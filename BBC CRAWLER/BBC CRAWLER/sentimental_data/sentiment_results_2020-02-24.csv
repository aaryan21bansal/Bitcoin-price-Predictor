"This video can not be played This footage of Salman Abedi outside the arena was shown to jurors Footage of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi watching music fans arrive for a Take That gig days before his attack has been shown to a jury. Abedi can be seen looking at box office queues, just yards from the spot where, four days later, on 22 May 2017, he killed himself and 22 others. Hashem Abedi, 22, is on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of helping his brother plan the attack. He denies 22 murders, attempted murder, and conspiring to cause explosions. The attempted murder charge encompasses the scores of people who survived the attack, which happened at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. The jury was shown CCTV footage in which Salman Abedi travels to the Arena venue, spending more than a minute in the City Rooms section where crowds can be seen milling around him. He then leaves for the nearby Arndale shopping centre, where he buys four nine-volt batteries and a large blue Kangol suitcase, used to transport his bomb-making equipment to his Manchester city centre flat. Earlier he was seen leaving the flat in Granby Row at about 18:00 BST. The hooded figure, wearing jogging bottoms and white trainers, was seen moving through rush-hour traffic. Hashem Abedi denies being an extremist and insists he had no idea of his brother's suicide bomb plans Abedi, then aged 22, also swaps his Sim card between phones and takes an untraced international call during the visit, where he walks the perimeter of the Arena venue before going inside to the City Rooms. Jurors heard he took the suitcase to Devell House, a block of flats in Rusholme, south Manchester, the next day. The prosecution said that on 14 April, the Abedi brothers left a Nissan Micra outside the flat and that the vehicle had been used to store bomb-making chemicals and equipment until Salman Abedi returned from Libya to carry out the final stage of the plan. Salman Abedi loads the suitcase and is seen struggling to drag it up the steps at his city centre apartment, where the prosecution allege he assembled his device. Jurors were also shown CCTV footage allegedly showing Salman Abedi taking a taxi to a B&Q store in Cheetham Hill where he spent nearly Â£200 on items including 4,000 screws, metal nuts, a swing bin, a spade, a saw, glue, tape, a set of drawers and an oak effect door. Footage from 18 May 2017 shows Salman Abedi in and around Victoria station, close to Manchester Arena Store worker Steven Dooley told police he woke on 23 May to see the ""devastating events"" of the previous evening on the news. Mr Dooley said that, two days before the Arena bombing, he remembered seeing a young man ""acting suspiciously"". ""My attention was drawn to him mainly because he had his hoodie over his head and I thought he might be shoplifting,"" he added. The jury was also taken through Salman Abedi's phone records from the afternoon of the bombing, which included multiple calls to an unknown Libyan number. The identity of the recipient has never been established. Hashem Abedi insists he is not an extremist and had no idea of his older brother's plans. The trial continues.

"Police say about 30 people, including children, were injured in the incident A car has been driven into a crowd at a carnival parade in the western German town of Volkmarsen. Thirty people, a third of them children, were injured, some seriously. A 29-year-old German citizen was arrested on suspicion of attempted homicide. Officials said a motive was currently unclear. Authorities in the state of Hesse, where Volkmarsen is located, cancelled all carnival parades ""as a precaution"" following the incident. The incident took place during celebrations for Rosenmontag, or Rose Monday - a carnival day celebrated in some parts of Germany, Austria, Belgium and Switzerland. Schools are often closed for the day, although it is not a national holiday in Germany. Local media report that a silver Mercedes drove through plastic barricades set up for the parade and into a group of people. Police said the incident occurred at about 14:45 local time (13:45 GMT). This video can not be played Emergency crews respond after a car drives into a crowd at a German carnival Eyewitnesses quoted in the German media say the driver accelerated toward the crowd and appeared to target children. German news website HNA cited witnesses as saying a man drove ""at full throttle"" into the crowd. Police said they believed it was an attack but that there was no indication of a political motive, according to German newspaper Bild. The car reportedly drove through plastic barricades set up around the parade In a statement, the Prosecutor's Office in Frankfurt said the suspect was receiving medical treatment for injuries sustained in the incident but would later be brought before an investigating judge. Steffen Roettger said his two daughters were at the parade and called him after the incident happened. ""My 10-year-old was pulled aside and only narrowly avoided being hit,"" he told broadcaster NTV. He said his daughter was ""in shock"" after seeing people ""lying around everywhere"". ""She won't get those images out of her head in a hurry."" Police have set up a portal for people to submit pictures or videos of the incident. They have also created an information centre for anyone affected at the town hall. Hesse state leader Volker Bouffier said he was ""shocked at the terrible act"", which had left ""many innocent people seriously injured"". In a statement, he shared his condolences with the victims and their families, while urging people not to speculate about possible motives. German Chancellor Angela Merkel thanked police and medics for their response, and said her thoughts were with those injured and their relatives.

"Global financial markets saw some of the sharpest falls in years on Monday after a rise in coronavirus cases renewed fears about economic slowdown. In the US, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 posted their sharpest daily declines since 2018, with the Dow falling 3.5% or more than 1,000 points. The S&P 500 ended the day 3.3% lower, while the Nasdaq sank 3.7%. The UK's FTSE 100 share index closed 3.3% lower, the sharpest drop since January 2016. In Italy, which has seen Europe's worst outbreak of the virus, Milan's stock market plunged nearly 6%. In contrast, the price of gold, which is considered less risky, hit its highest level in seven years at one point. Coronavirus spread raises fears of pandemic Coronavirus credit crunch hits Chinese firms What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? The moves came as the outbreak continued to spread outside of China, with Iran, South Korea and Italy reporting a surge in cases. About 77,000 people in China, where the virus emerged last year, have been infected and nearly 2,600 have died. More than 1,200 cases have been confirmed in about 30 other countries and there have been more than 20 deaths.Italy reported three more deaths on Monday, raising the total there to six. ""There has been so much complacency in recent weeks from investors, despite clear signs that China's economy is facing a large hit and that supply chains around the world were being disrupted,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""Markets initially wobbled in January, but had quickly bounced back, implying that investors didn't see the coronavirus as a serious threat to corporate earnings. They may now be reappraising the situation."" The losses on the Dow and S&P 500 in the US wiped out their gains for the year. Firms such as Nike, Apple and Walt Disney, which do major business in China and rely on it to make goods, were some of the hardest hit, with shares down more than 4%. Travel companies also continued to suffer. In the UK, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 was EasyJet, which sank 16.7%, while Tui and British Airways owner IAG were both down by more than 9% at the close. By Samira Hussain, New York business reporter Wall Street is spooked. The massive falls on US financial markets shows that pretty clearly. But why now? Part of the answer can be found in the ballooning number of confirmed cases in China and elsewhere. Investors worry this could mean a prolonged economic slowdown around the world. Tech juggernaut Apple has already warned of a shortage of iPhones and other US companies are also starting to break a sweat. If the impact is as serious as some investors suspect, it could derail the longest economic expansion in America's history. That means there are political implications too. US President Donald Trump has made a roaring economy a central part of his re-election bid. Any wobbles could make his case for another four years more challenging. The market moves come as companies continue to warn about the effect of the coronavirus on their supply chains and overall financial health. Associated British Foods, which owns clothing retailer Primark, warned on Monday that there could be shortages of some lines if delays in factory production in China were prolonged because of virus-related shutdowns. In China itself, officials have said most small businesses have yet to reopen after the authorities extended the Lunar New Year holiday in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Only about three out of 10 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were back to work, while transport problems were preventing workers from travelling and disrupting shipments of raw materials, said industry ministry spokesman Tian Yulong. SMEs make up about 60% of the Chinese economy. Analysts said the gold price - which has risen by more than 10% since the start of the year - could soon breach the $1,700 barrier. On Monday, prices surged more than 2% at one point, before retreating. ""Gold has finally established some serious momentum,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at online trading platform Oanda. Oil prices fell by about 4% on Monday, as investors worried about a fall in demand following the temporary factory closures due to the virus. The price of Brent crude dropped by more than $2 to $55.55 a barrel.

"The internet touts sold tickets to Ed Sheeran (pictured) gigs and other high profile events Two internet ticket touts who re-sold tickets worth millions of pounds for events including Ed Sheeran and Adele concerts have been jailed. Peter Hunter and David Smith traded as Ticket Wiz and BZZ. Over five years BZZ sold tickets for Â£9.3m more than it paid for them, Leeds Crown Court heard. Sheeran's manager Stuart Camp gave evidence after Â£75 seats for a charity gig were spotted on sale for Â£7,000. Hunter was jailed for four years and Smith for two and a half years. It was described by National Trading Standards as a ""landmark case"" which was ""the first successful prosecution against a company fraudulently reselling tickets on a large scale"". Sentencing the pair, Judge Mushtaq Khokhar said: ""This was a case of sustained dishonesty for a number of years. ""A lot of people in this case paid a lot more than they could have paid."" Latest news and stories from Yorkshire Sheeran and Potter ticket touts guilty of fraud How Ed Sheeran is tackling ticket touts In one year, Peter Hunter and David Smith, who are married, bought more than 750 tickets for Sheeran events alone. They used multiple identities and computer robots to buy tickets, selling them for inflated prices on secondary ticketing websites, including Viagogo, GetMein, StubHub and Seatwave. Hunter told the jury how he started his business when a friend without a credit card asked him to buy tickets to see Madonna and he realised he could re-sell extra purchases at a huge profit. The case has provoked calls for a wider criminal investigation of the secondary ticketing market When their home was raided, investigators found 112 different payment cards in 37 names. The couple used at least 97 different names, 88 postal addresses and more than 290 email addresses to evade platform restrictions. Hunter, 51, and Smith, 66, of Crossfield Road, north London, claimed they were a trusted and reliable source of tickets. The jury found them guilty of three counts of fraudulent trading and one of possessing articles for fraud.

"A range of food products were being sold on Facebook Marketplace Facebook should ""take responsibility"" for people using its website to sell food from their own homes, the Food Standards Agency has said. The watchdog is warning that sellers who have not registered with or been inspected by their local councils could be putting the public at risk. FSA chairwoman Heather Hancock wants Facebook to bring in stricter seller checks on its Marketplace platform. Facebook says its sellers must follow all applicable laws and regulations. How do other countries regulate social media? Trust 'undermined' by food delivery firms Doctors demand social media firms hand over data Facebook Marketplace allows users to post advertisements for free, to sell a range of goods and services. Butrules in force across the UK,externalrequire people selling food from their homes on a regular basis to register with their local authority. Once registered, they may be inspected and given a food hygiene rating. BBC News found a wide variety of food for sale by unregistered sellers on Facebook Marketplace. This included cooked meals and baked goods - and in one case, a whole deer. This video can not be played The BBC's Angus Crawford picks up several unlicensed takeaway meals from Facebook sellers Food safety expert Tony Lewis looked at a number of the adverts. ""There is no information about what they contain, we don't have a list of ingredients,"" he said. ""How's it been stored, how's it been prepped, have we got a whole load of allergens in there?"" He also warns about the potential risk to health. ""Listeria is a real threat, in the worst case it could kill you."" The BBC conducted a series of test purchases across the Midlands, buying goat curry, cake, roast chicken and chocolate party cones for children from sellers advertising on Facebook Marketplace. None of the sellers indicated they were registered, had been inspected or had a food hygiene rating. One user was selling a Biryani curry One said they thought those regulations did not apply to people cooking in their own homes. Another, when asked about the possible presence of allergens admitted: ""I haven't actually checked."" Ms Hancock of the FSA, which is responsible for food safety in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, says Facebook has ""an unavoidable moral obligation to help keep people safe"". She said ""if something goes wrong with this food"", the sellers would be in a ""terrible mess personally, about the consequences for them and the risk that they're posing to other people"". She added: ""We'd like that responsibility to extend to asking anybody who is supplying or selling food through the platform - are they registered?"" She also wants sellers to be forced to display any food hygiene rating they obtain. The FSA is calling for Facebook to introduce tighter checks on its Marketplace platform Facebook said: ""The safety of our community is our foremost priority and if we determine that a listing violates any of our community standards or commerce policies we will immediately remove the listing."" It added: ""We're in contact with the FSA to discuss the concerns raised and what we can do together on this issue."" Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, whose daughter Natasha died in 2016 from a severe allergic reaction after eating a sandwich from High Street chain Pret a Manger, says Facebook must do more, especially when it comes to allergens. Natasha did not know her sandwich contained sesame seeds and after she died herparents successfully campaignedfor changes in the law. Food businesses will have to include full ingredients labelling on pre-packaged products by summer 2021. Tanya, right, and husband Nadim, left, campaigned for a law change to better protect those with food allergies Mrs Ednan-Laperouse says she does not want to stop people selling homemade food, but is demanding they label ingredients clearly. Informing buyers on the doorstep is not enough, she said, adding: ""People can get confused, they might forget... Someone might misunderstand what they're saying."" Paula Wilkinson runs a business called Mums Bake Cakes, which connects home bakers to customers via a dedicated website. She makes sure all her sellers are registered and insured. There is ""absolutely"" no reason why properly-registered people should not sell food they have prepared at home, she says. ""It can be done safely,"" Ms Wilkinson added.

"Emma Gray trains sheepdogs full time and has about 20 on her farm A border collie from Northumberland has become the world's most expensive sheepdog after being sold to an American ranch owner for Â£18,900. Two-and-a-half year-old Megan was sold by shepherdess Emma Gray at an auction in North Yorkshire. Ms Gray, 33, who farms and trains sheepdogs near Morpeth, has broken her own record set a year ago, when a similar dog sold for almost Â£15,000. The average price for a working dog is about Â£2,000. Megan will go from herding sheep in the north-east of England to rounding up Wagyu cattle in Oklahoma. Ms Gray, who has represented England at the World Sheepdog Trials, said she had to double-check the price after the auction in Skipton on Friday. ""I had to ring the auction and just make sure it wasn't a hoax and that I wasn't dreaming,"" she said. ""Afterwards I went to Marks and Spencer and bought Megan some chicken and let her sleep on my pillow."" Megan will be herding American cattle when she reaches Oklahoma Megan is the offspring of several top-performing trials dogs and has an ""impressive bloodline"" according to Ms Gray, who trains up to 20 working dogs at a time. ""Megan is the full package. She's a really talented little dog and has all the best bloodlines in her,"" she added. ""It's really unusual for a dog like her to come on the market. ""Had circumstances been different I would never have sold her. ""But I already have two really, really good sheepdogs so I had to make the decision to sell her."" Ms Gray, who took on the remote National Trust-owned 150 acre Fallowlees Farm at Harwood Forest 10 years ago, said she had put videos of Megan online hoping to attract interest. TripAdvisor halts reviews of 'NatWest Hole' Love Island winner expected back by football club Two Ronnies sketch recreated in 280-year-old shop She said: ""I'm really pleased someone has recognised Megan's value, because I think sometime border collies and sheepdogs are undervalued, considering how talented they are. ""Herding cattle is not that different to herding sheep. And to be honest Megan will herd anything."" Megan is due to travel to the United States in about three weeks. Her new owner, Brian Stamps, who owns a ranch in central Oklahoma, said: ""I have followed the Skipton sale for several years as I used to run border collies here Stateside.

"This video can not be played 'I cleaned up but the flood came all over again' Parts of a town centre are under water amid warnings that flooding in the area could reach its ""highest ever"" level. Severe flood warnings are in place in Shrewsbury and Ironbridge, meaning there is a danger to life. Ann DiTella, of Shrewsbury B&B Darwin's Townhouse, said 11 rooms had flooded, less than a week after water ""destroyed everything in its wake"". People in Wharfage, Ironbridge, have been asked to evacuate as the River Severn may go over barriers on Tuesday. Telford and Wrekin Council leader Shaun Davies said the barrier breach ""isn't likely to cause any tidal wave or any dramatic effect"" but could fill up the road and footpath ""very quickly"". ""So our message is clear - we are asking residents and businesses on the Wharfage to evacuate,"" he said. Mr Davies said it was for people's own safety and for the emergency services who would ""be putting their lives at risk coming to your aid"". Latest updates on Shropshire flooding Council crews have been knocking doors to advise people and have set up a helpline and rest centre at Tontine Hotel. West Mercia Police said about 40 residents in Ironbridge had been advised to evacuate on Monday night. Water is expected to go over the barriers at Ironbridge Firefighters have been coming to the aid of families The Environment Agency (EA) said rainfall in the Welsh mountains was due to cause problems further down the River Severn. There aremore than 100 flood warnings,externaland some 200 alerts in England after a third week of downpours that started with Storm Ciara.

"Jessica Mann said she ""entered into what I thought was going to be a real relationship with him"" A one-time aspiring actress says Harvey Weinstein subjected her to ""degrading"" abuse, in some of the most graphic testimony shared in his trial so far. Jessica Mann detailed a catalogue of abuse by the Hollywood producer, saying he once trapped her in a hotel bedroom and raped her. Three of the five charges against Mr Weinstein relate to Ms Mann. He denies non-consensual sex and his lawyers say emails prove his and Ms Mann's relationship was consensual. WARNING: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting Ms Mann's evidence came at the end of the fourth week of the Manhattan trial of the Oscar-winning Hollywood mogul, who produced films including Shakespeare in Love and The English Patient. The 34-year-old said she met him in late 2012 or early 2013 at a party, and she told him of her ambition to be an actress. Later, she said, he invited her and a friend to a Los Angeles hotel suite. He then allegedly pulled Ms Mann into a bedroom and performed oral sex on her. Ms Mann then began a relationship with Mr Weinstein. ""I entered into what I thought was going to be a real relationship with him and it was extremely degrading from that point on,"" she said. She said he once urinated on her, and in 2013 raped her in a Manhattan hotel room. ""If he heard the word 'no,' it was like a trigger for him,"" she said. When asked why she stayed in the relationship, Ms Mann said in tears that there was ""no short answer"". ""One of the aspects initially was that I had had a sexual encounter"" with him, she said. ""That wasn't something I could undo. That really confused me and hurt me."" She stayed with him partly out of fear, she said. Weinstein arrives in court using a walking frame One of Mr Weinstein's lawyers, Damon Cheronis, said Ms Mann sent ""flattering"" emails to Mr Weinstein during their relationship, one of which said ""Miss you, big guy."" These prove the relationship was not abusive, the defence alleges. In Friday's testimony, Ms Mann also alleged that Mr Weinstein had ""extreme scarring"" on his body and used erectile dysfunction medication. She also believed he was intersex, and it appeared he had a vagina and no testicles. Since October 2017, more than 80 women have publicly accused Mr Weinstein of sexual misconduct but this criminal case involves only a few of them. Some consider the trial a watershed moment, where some of Mr Weinstein's alleged victims have had their voices heard in court for the first time. Mr Weinstein is on trial for five offences, including rape and predatory sexual assault. He denies the charges and all allegations of wrongdoing, but if convicted could face life in prison. Here is what has happened in the trial so far. Mr Weinstein turned up to his first court appearance heavily aided and using a walking frame. Crowds of protesters, including some accusers, gathered outside the courthouse to try and face him down. ""You thought you could terrorise me and others into silence. You were wrong,"" actress Rose McGowan, who accuses him of rape, said reading from an open letter. ""Today Lady Justice is staring down a super predator,"" Ms McGowan told reporters The same day, on 6 January, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced new charges against Mr Weinstein. After the New York trial, he is expected to appear in court in California. Finding an impartial jury for the New York case was a difficult task, with hundreds summoned as potential jurors. Mr Weinstein's legal team even filed a last-minute motion to move the trial outside Manhattan over the ""carnival-like atmosphere"" surrounding proceedings. They cited the media hype about model Gigi Hadid being among the potential jurors. Potential Weinstein juror speaks of 'disgust' Harvey Weinstein trial: What you need to know How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded The first week of proceedings ended with a flash-mob of protesters performing an anti-rape chant outside, which could be heard inside the courtroom. During the process, prosecutors accused Mr Weinstein's defence team of ""systematically eliminating"" young white women as jurors. The selection process concluded with five women and seven men on the panel. ""This trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement. It is not a referendum on sexual harassment,"" Judge James Burke told the jury, saying they must only decide if Mr Weinstein ""committed certain acts which constitute a particular crime"". ""The man seated right there was not just a titan in Hollywood, he was a rapist,"" prosecutor Meghan Hast said in her opening statement on 22 January. She accused him of using his celebrity status to manipulate women and explicitly detailed allegations against him. Only two of the accusers' cases, Mimi (Miriam) Haleyi and Jessica Mann, have led to individual criminals charges in New York but the testimony of others is being used as supporting evidence. Ms Hast, Assistant District Attorney, describes the Hollywood figure as a ""sexual predator"" Ms Hast described how Mr Weinstein allegedly ""lunged at"" Ms Haleyi in 2006 to perform a forced sex act on her. Ms Mann alleges he raped her in a New York hotel in 2013. One of Mr Weinstein's lawyers, Damon Cheronis, insists the state's case would ""unravel"" during the trial and urged the jury: ""While the narrative they painted for you is one that may reinforce your preconceived notions, it's not the truth."" The defence aim to present the sexual interactions as consensual. At the opening, Mr Cheronis alleged one accuser had even described Mr Weinstein as ""her casual boyfriend"". US actress Annabella Sciorra testified on 23 January that the film producer raped her in the winter of 1993/4. Her allegations, outside New York's statue of limitations, are being used to support the most serious charge of predatory sexual assault. She said Mr Weinstein forced his way into her apartment after a dinner with others. ""I was trying to get him off me,"" she told the jury. ""I was punching him, kicking him."" The former Sopranos actress described her body shaking after the alleged assault and said she did not go public with it for years because she was ""afraid for her life"". Ms Sciorra's friend, fellow actress Rosie Perez, testified that she shared some details of the incident with her at the time, but on cross-examination lawyers challenged Ms Sciorra's ability to remember the exact date of the alleged attack. Lawyer Donna Rotunno tried to poke holes in the Sopranos actress' account A forensic psychiatrist, Dr Barbara Ziv, also testified as an expert witness to explain misconceptions around rape and the behaviour of victims. Production assistant Mimi Haleyi told the court that Mr Weinstein assaulted her twice in Manhattan in 2006, after he helped her get a job on a television show he produced. She detailed an incident at his apartment where she alleges he performed oral sex on her, without consent, when she was on her period. What we learned from Weinstein documentary Who has accused Weinstein of what? ""Every time I tried to get off the bed he would push me back and hold me down,"" Ms Haleyi said during emotional testimony. ""At this point I realised what was happening. I'm being raped."" She told the court he convinced her to meet again weeks later. On that occasion she allegedly ""laid there"" as he had sex with her in an incident that left her feeling ""numb"" and like ""an idiot"". Mr Weinstein has only been charged over first alleged encounter. This video can not be played Hired by Weinstein to extract information on celebrities During cross-examination Mr Weinstein's defence focused on her continued contact with him after the alleged incidents and presented email exchanges between the two including one she signed off with ""lots of love"". Throughout the week further ""prior bad acts"" witnesses continued to testify. Former actress Dawn Dunning alleged Mr Weinstein put her hands up her skirt and touched her genitals at a hotel in Soho in 2004 and later tried to offer her film roles in exchange for sex. Tarale Wulff alleged Mr Weinstein masturbated in front of her in 2005 when she worked as a waitress. She said she was later invited to read scripts by Weinstein Company staff and was taken to his apartment, where he allegedly raped her.

"Global financial markets saw some of the sharpest falls in years on Monday after a rise in coronavirus cases renewed fears about economic slowdown. In the US, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 posted their sharpest daily declines since 2018, with the Dow falling 3.5% or more than 1,000 points. The S&P 500 ended the day 3.3% lower, while the Nasdaq sank 3.7%. The UK's FTSE 100 share index closed 3.3% lower, the sharpest drop since January 2016. In Italy, which has seen Europe's worst outbreak of the virus, Milan's stock market plunged nearly 6%. In contrast, the price of gold, which is considered less risky, hit its highest level in seven years at one point. Coronavirus spread raises fears of pandemic Coronavirus credit crunch hits Chinese firms What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? The moves came as the outbreak continued to spread outside of China, with Iran, South Korea and Italy reporting a surge in cases. About 77,000 people in China, where the virus emerged last year, have been infected and nearly 2,600 have died. More than 1,200 cases have been confirmed in about 30 other countries and there have been more than 20 deaths.Italy reported three more deaths on Monday, raising the total there to six. ""There has been so much complacency in recent weeks from investors, despite clear signs that China's economy is facing a large hit and that supply chains around the world were being disrupted,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""Markets initially wobbled in January, but had quickly bounced back, implying that investors didn't see the coronavirus as a serious threat to corporate earnings. They may now be reappraising the situation."" The losses on the Dow and S&P 500 in the US wiped out their gains for the year. Firms such as Nike, Apple and Walt Disney, which do major business in China and rely on it to make goods, were some of the hardest hit, with shares down more than 4%. Travel companies also continued to suffer. In the UK, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 was EasyJet, which sank 16.7%, while Tui and British Airways owner IAG were both down by more than 9% at the close. By Samira Hussain, New York business reporter Wall Street is spooked. The massive falls on US financial markets shows that pretty clearly. But why now? Part of the answer can be found in the ballooning number of confirmed cases in China and elsewhere. Investors worry this could mean a prolonged economic slowdown around the world. Tech juggernaut Apple has already warned of a shortage of iPhones and other US companies are also starting to break a sweat. If the impact is as serious as some investors suspect, it could derail the longest economic expansion in America's history. That means there are political implications too. US President Donald Trump has made a roaring economy a central part of his re-election bid. Any wobbles could make his case for another four years more challenging. The market moves come as companies continue to warn about the effect of the coronavirus on their supply chains and overall financial health. Associated British Foods, which owns clothing retailer Primark, warned on Monday that there could be shortages of some lines if delays in factory production in China were prolonged because of virus-related shutdowns. In China itself, officials have said most small businesses have yet to reopen after the authorities extended the Lunar New Year holiday in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Only about three out of 10 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were back to work, while transport problems were preventing workers from travelling and disrupting shipments of raw materials, said industry ministry spokesman Tian Yulong. SMEs make up about 60% of the Chinese economy. Analysts said the gold price - which has risen by more than 10% since the start of the year - could soon breach the $1,700 barrier. On Monday, prices surged more than 2% at one point, before retreating. ""Gold has finally established some serious momentum,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at online trading platform Oanda. Oil prices fell by about 4% on Monday, as investors worried about a fall in demand following the temporary factory closures due to the virus. The price of Brent crude dropped by more than $2 to $55.55 a barrel.

"The UK's biggest retailer, Tesco, is stocking plasters in a variety of skin tones as it tries to give a better reflection of racial diversity. It said the plasters, which come in light, medium and dark shades, would ""better represent the nation"". The retailer said they were developed in response to an emotional tweet from a US man, who used a plaster matching his skin tone for the first time. Tesco said it was the first UK supermarket to make such a move. People welcomed the news on Twitter, although some questioned why it had taken so long. Campaigner Sajda Mughal tweeted: ""This is like that feeling as a WOC [woman of colour] growing up not being able to find the right tone of foundation apart from pink!!!... And finally somebody introduces it!!!"" Nicola Robinson, Tesco's health, beauty and wellness director, said: ""As one of the largest retailers in the UK, we understand that we have a responsibility to ensure our products reflect the diversity of our customers and colleagues. ""We believe the launch of our new skin tone plaster range is an important step and a move that we hope will be replicated by other retailers and supermarkets across the country."" The supermarket giant developed the plasters after a tweet from Dominique Apollon, of US racial equality advocacy group Race Forward, went viral. Mr Apollon said he was overwhelmed after using a plaster matching his skin tone for the first time, and ""holding back tears"". It prompted more than 100,000 retweets and comments.

Currently, people have little choice when it comes to buying plasters of diverse shades on the High Street. Boots does not stock plasters in multiple shades, although it does offer transparent ones. Specialist brands are available online but can be expensive. Tesco, which is the UK's biggest seller of own-brand plasters, said its new plasters would be available at all of its 741 UK stores. Superdrug told the BBC it will also be launching plasters for dark tone, medium tone and light tone skin in six weeks' time across all of its stores. Boots also said it plans to launch plasters in a range of tones. Nicola Paul, a diversity expert at Green Park, an executive search firm, welcomed the news. ""Not only is it the right thing to do but there is demand,"" she said. ""Companies in the cosmetic industry realised the importance of producing products different skin tones years ago, though you'll also find plenty of blogs and posts explaining they haven't done enough. ""Some fashion retailers have considered their ranges, especially extending their 'nude' ranges beyond pale, be that shoes, tights or underwear. ""Supermarkets are very competitive when it comes to the sustainability agenda and it would be great to see more examples like this coming through."" Creating makeup just for African women.

"This video can not be played Drone captures massive queue for masks in South Korea's Daegu city The World Health Organization has said the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic. The WHO said it was too early to call the outbreak a pandemic but countries should be ""in a phase of preparedness"". A pandemic is when an infectious disease spreads easily from person to person in many parts of the world. More cases of the virus, which causes respiratory disease Covid-19, continue to emerge, with outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran causing concern. However, most infections are in China, the original source of the virus, where more than 77,000 people have the disease and over 2,600 have died. More than 1,200 cases have been confirmed in about 30 other countries and there have been more than 20 deaths. Italy reported four more deaths on Monday, raising the total there to seven. Worldwide stock markets saw sharp fallsbecause of concerns about the economic impact of the virus. China said it would postpone the annual meeting of the National People's Congress next month, to ""continue the efforts"" against the coronavirus. The body, which approves decisions made by the Communist Party, has met every year since 1978. The proportion of infected people who die from Covid-19 appears to be between 1% and 2%, although the WHO cautions that the mortality rate is not known yet. On Monday Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain reported their first cases, all involving people who had come from Iran. Officials in Bahrain said the patient infected there was a school bus driver, and several schools had been closed as a result. Coronavirus: Could it become a pandemic?

Among other developments: Some upcoming football matches in Italy's Serie A and the Europa League will be played behind closed doors to prevent the spread of the virus, Italy's sports minister says Gold surged to its highest price in seven yearsas coronavirus fears led investors to seek a safe haven South Korean pop group BTS asks fans to stay away from upcoming TV shows, which will be taped without a studio audience North Korea has quarantined 380 foreignersin a bid to stop the coronavirus from breaking out. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Monday that the number of new cases in recent days in Iran, Italy and South Korea was ""deeply concerning"". However he added: ""For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large scale severe disease or deaths. ""Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely, it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet."" ""The key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained, indeed there are many countries that have done exactly that,"" Mr Tedros said. ""Using the word 'pandemic' now does not fit the facts but may certainly cause fear."" But Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme, said now was the time to make ""do everything you would do to prepare for a pandemic"". Is the coronavirus a pandemic? For now the WHO says no. It argues the number of countries with outbreaks, the severity of the disease and the impact on society has not reached pandemic-level. But some scientists - assessing the same picture - think we are already there and others say we're on the cusp. The surge in cases in South Korea and the deaths in Iran and Italy have dialled up concern over the past few days. The deaths suggest there are far more cases in those two countries than have been reported and that the virus has been there for some time. But ultimately the word pandemic is just that - a word - it will not unlock more money or give the WHO new powers. It has already issued the highest warning it can, by declaring the virus a global emergency. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? A pandemic is theworldwide spread of a new disease,external The H1N1 (swine flu) outbreak, which killed hundreds of thousands of people, was declared a pandemic by the WHO in 2009 The WHO no longer formally labels an outbreak of disease a ""pandemic"" but says the term may be used ""colloquially"" Its advice to countries - to limit the infections while preparing for wider spread - remains the same South Korea- which has the largest number of confirmed cases outside China - reported another 231 infections on Monday taking the total there to more than 830. Eight people have died. Around 7,700 troops have been quarantined after 11 military members were infected.

InChina, the government announced a ban on the consumption of wild animals and a crackdown on the hunting, transportation and trade of prohibited species, state media say. It is thought that the outbreak originated at a market in the city of Wuhan selling wild animals. China reported 508 new infections on Monday, compared with 409 on Sunday.

"Finn Tapp signed for Oxford City in the summer from League One club MK Dons Love Island winner Finn Tapp is expected to see out his contract with his football club, it has emerged.

Mick Livesey, Oxford City's commercial director, said the club would insert clauses into new players' contracts over future appearance on TV shows. Mr Livesey said: ""He was [in breach of his contract] but I think you need to take a pragmatic sort of view: A 20-year-old lad, he's offered all this reality TV stuff. ""He has a contract, so he has to finish the contract he has with the football club. ""He's done very, very well for us."" Finn Tapp and Paige Turley will share Â£50,000 for winning the ITV show Mr Tapp signed for Oxford City last summer after he was released by MK Dons. ""As a football club, we wish Finn all the best and I can understand everything that's going on but we have a duty of care for Finn and we've got a duty of care for the football club,"" Mr Livesey said.

"Stewart has been homeless for most of his adult life. He's slept in shop doorways, church porches and on railway platforms, but also - he says - in some ""great places"". He now lives on an abandoned allotment in North Yorkshire, and has no desire to live in a house or flat again. Although he has ambitious plans for the future, he's content with his life as it is. The old pigeon shed where Stewart has lived since June last year is a patchwork of chicken wire, wood and plastic tarpaulins. Around it the bramble bushes are thriving, but the plants in the raised beds have long gone to seed and the dilapidated greenhouses look beyond repair. Wooden pallets and a rusting bike frame lie in a tangle next to water drums and scaffolding poles. Stewart doesn't think this allotment has been used for four or five years, but spades and forks still stand in the earth, as though whoever used to work this soil might just have downed tools for a tea break. It was a few weeks after first arriving in Whitby, while walking his border collie, Cariad, on the Cinder Track - the old Scarborough to Whitby railway line, which closed more than 50 years ago - that Stewart came across this place and set about making it his home. Inside the shed, the low winter sun pours in through the corrugated plastic that Stewart used to replace the broken window panes. He's lined the floor and some of the walls with insulating boards that he salvaged from a skip, and built himself a bed - his army surplus Arctic sleeping bag is laid out neatly on top. Soon after he'd settled in, Stewart had a visit from some curious police officers. They sniffed around, asked some questions, and returned later with some gifts - a smoke detector and a carbon monoxide alarm. There's no electricity or running water but Stewart has installed a wood-burning stove and washes every morning in water from a large container he occasionally refills and pulls behind his bicycle on a trailer. He has battery-powered lamps and a pile of books is stacked on the floor at the foot of his bed, among them a mushroom-spotting field guide, and a Penguin Vintage Classic, Love On The Dole. ""If you have a good book, a radio, you are warm and you are safe, you can close your eyes and be anywhere,"" Stewart says. ""It doesn't matter if you are homeless or living in a palace - it's all in the mind."" Stewart does feel safe here, but from long habit he takes the precaution of leaving his sleeping bag unzipped. ""I've been dragged down Cardiff Queen Street in my sleeping bag and I couldn't get out because it was zipped up,"" he tells me. ""And if someone comes along and sets you on fire, you can't get out and that's itâ¦ So you just never do your sleeping bag up."" Stewart's eyes were opened to the possibility of making a place that feels like home, despite being ""homeless"", about 15 years ago, when he was 26. He was squatting in Cardiff when he heard about a group of travellers living on the outskirts of the city, across the River Ely in Leckwith Woods. They'd built shelters known as benders from the branches of hazel and willow trees dug into the ground and curved to form arches. They had a treehouse, a teepee, an army tent, a generator and a kitchen sink plumbed into a spring, bringing clean running water straight up through the mud. ""When I saw this stuff it really put an idea into my head about how you can simplify things and still have a great life,"" he says. Stewart spent about five years there. For a while he gave up his mobile phone, and didn't claim any benefits. He went ""off-grid"". ""I just wanted to see what it would be like to live as a free man on the land,"" he says, ""and I absolutely loved it, it was liberating."" When the site was destroyed - Stewart suspects by the electricity company that came periodically to lop branches growing too close to pylons - he moved on. But he has been looking for somewhere to match that woodland home ever since, and sometimes he succeeds. ""I've found I have skills in finding great places,"" he says. There was a ""stunning place"" in Worcester - the wheel-less rear section of a removals lorry, rather like a shipping container, which backed on to Worcester Arena. There was an empty stable on a racecourse, also in Worcester. And, more recently, a roundabout in Darlington, where he lived undisturbed in a bell tent surrounded by hedges for 10 months. The housing charity, Shelter,says there are about 320,000 homeless people,externalin the UK, though this figure does not include ""hidden"" forms of homelessness, such as people sofa-surfing with friends. Stewart would be classified by the government as a ""rough sleeper"", as he lives in ""buildings or other places not designed for habitation"".According to the latest official figures,external, there were 4,700 rough sleepers in England in autumn 2018, including 250 in Yorkshire and the Humber. Briefing:How many families, children and lone individuals in the UK have no home of their own and are living in temporary accommodation or sleeping rough? And why?,external In the morning Stewart tends to wake early - in summer at least. ""I don't have any curtains so I generally wake as soon as the sun comes up. That's about eight o'clock just now, but during the summer I could be up at four in the morning - you just get used to getting up when it's light and going to bed when it's dark,"" he says. One of his main occupations is collecting driftwood from the beach, to use as fuel. He jokingly refers to the wood-burner as his television. ""It only plays the one channel, but who doesn't love watching logs burn?"" he says. He explains which types of wood burn best, and which smell nicest as they burn - cherry is incredible, he says, but his favourite is birch. Stewart isn't claiming any benefits at the moment, so he doesn't have to sign on, but he does have to earn money, and he does this by busking. I follow him and Cariad to Baxtergate, the main shopping street in town, where he takes up his usual spot, next to the old newsagents and opposite a busy, brightly lit bakery. ""Lovely guys in there,"" Stewart says, pointing. ""They do these amazing apple pasties."" He hasn't even taken his ukulele out of its bag when an elderly woman stops, chats for a moment and presses a folded up fiver into his hand. She's a regular, he tells me later, and probably gives him that amount most weeks. ""Sometimes people try to give me more than that, but if I don't know their situation I won't take it,"" he says. Stewart can make ten or twenty quid playing songs by Radiohead, The Smashing Pumpkins and Green Day for an hour or so. Some days, when the Steampunk or Goth Weekends are on and the town is heaving, he makes much, much more, he tells me. But it's not just about the money. This is his opportunity to chat to people, and the people here are mostly friendly - unlike some he's met during his years on the streets. There were the drunks who urinated on him as he slept, and the ""nice"" men who'd approach him on cold nights offering him somewhere warm to stay, only to turn predatory once indoors. ""That sort of thing happens all the time,"" he says. There was the man from the shop in a Welsh market town who gave him a day's work stuffing envelopes, then got him so hammered he passed out. ""The next thing I remember, I was waking up at three o'clock in the morning, and he was on top of me,"" Stewart says. ""I managed to get him off and nothing happened, but he knew I was a 16-year-old - he was getting me drunk and trying to groom me."" And there was the time he was abducted and forced to work on a travelling fairground for six months - they kept him in a caravan when he wasn't working, beat him and threatened him with violence - he still finds that almost unbearable to think about even now, 20 years on. Part of a mini-series of downloadable guides to the big issues in the news, the housing briefing has input from academics, researchers and journalists and is the BBC's response to demands for better explanation of the facts behind the headlines. Download the full BBC Briefing on housing,external BBC Bitesize: Six things you will learn from the housing briefing Why I shared a bed with my ex for six months Brought up in Southampton, Stewart was fostered at the age of 13 after being sexually abused by his mother's partner and physically abused by her next boyfriend. The first of four children, he was the only one taken into care and has no contact with his brother, sisters, mother, or father. He's been on his own since leaving care at the age of 16 and has been homeless for most of the intervening 25 years. ""I'm the only reliable person in my life,"" he says. Briefing:There are many causes of homelessness,external The first drug he tried, at 15, was LSD. Around that time he also got his first conviction, for breaking into a shop and emptying it of chocolate. Later he became dependent on cannabis - though now he doesn't touch it - and he has a string of further convictions, including one for assaulting an ex-girlfriend. He hasn't had a partner since. ""I'm not very good at relationships at all,"" he says. ""I struggle with stuff like that."" Between the ages of 17 and 19 Stewart walked from Sussex to Aberystwyth, then walked down the coast of Wales doing odd jobs as he went. Later he made a thorough exploration of Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, visiting every single Church of England church - thousands of them. He doesn't move around so much now, but he's reached a stage, he says, where he doesn't even want to live in a house. ""People come up to me and they're like, 'I don't know how you do it.'"" he tells me. ""And I say to them, 'I don't know howyoudo it.'"" Briefing:For those unable to buy or easily to rent a suitable home of their own, how much social housing is available?,external Applying for benefits would send his anxiety levels through the roof, Stewart says. He doesn't think he would be eligible for housing benefit in Whitby because he hasn't got a local connection, and anyway he wouldn't want to deal with neighbours or worry about paying bills. He's spent six or seven years of his adult life living like that, in shared places or council flats, and that was enough. At the beach where Stewart usually gathers driftwood, we walk along the shoreline. He's brought a litter picker and a plastic bag from the lifeboat station to collect rubbish - today just a few cigarette ends and some tiny colourful pieces of plastic, worn down by the sea and left behind by the swash. But Stewart also stops from time to time to pick slivers of tumbled sea glass from the wet sand. Blue is the hardest colour to find here, he says, but he really loves yellow. He thinks he'll make a wind chime with the big bits, and a mosaic mirror frame with the smaller ones. ""I love what the sea signifies,"" he says, as he looks out across the water towards the lighthouse. ""It signifies freedom - it goes where it wants to when it wants to. The only thing that has any power over it is the moon."" Stewart tells me he doesn't tend to eat during the day, but at a cafe in town he lets me buy him a coffee to which he adds three generous spoonfuls of sugar. He also orders a slice of lemon cake to have later. ""If you've got no money and you can only eat an evening meal then it's better to keep your system going just on that,"" he says. He knows how to get referred to food banks, he knows which churches give out food parcels, and where the soup runs are, but he tries to only use them if he really needs to. If things get really tight, he says, there are other good people who will help him out - at the pie and mash shop and at one of the cafes - but he doesn't like to ask. He'd prefer to be independent. ""l am homeless,"" he says, ""but I'm also car-less and lots-of-other-things-less - does that make me a charity case?"" In fact, Stewart wants to help other people. He dreams of growing food on the allotments - not just for himself, but also for the local community. And he'd like to create a sensory garden, for people who are sight-and-hearing impaired or have learning disabilities, where plants and flowers, features and objects stimulate through touch, sight, scent, taste and hearing. ""This could be an amazing community resource,"" he says. ""But I don't know if they will let me do it."" Stewart has other plans too. He wants to save to buy a yurt and he's had the idea of launching a pedicab business offering a taxi service for tourists from the town up to the ruined abbey that sits on a cliff above Whitby, overlooking the North Sea. He understands, though, that he will never have a permanent home and that his life consists of moving from town to town ""finding and then getting evicted from safe places"". Is it OK if someone wants to live for years on a bench? Homeless-by-sea: How we ended up sleeping rough by the coast Not another 'I bought my house age 24' article Squatting in non-residential buildings or on land - as Stewart is doing - is not illegal in England and Wales. To remove a squatter the owner would have to get a court order. Stewart thinks the owner, in his case, could be the railway or the county council - he's heard conflicting reports. Whichever it is, he hopes that if they decide they want the allotment back, they'll allow him to stay until they're ready to redevelop it. ""And I'd be perfectly fine with that, absolutely fine,"" he says. ""I know my home could be taken away from me just like that, but people who are working can lose a home just like that as well. ""One door closes, another door opens.""

"Some 1.1 million people were killed by the Nazis at Auschwitz Several Jewish groups have criticised Amazon for fictitious depictions of the Holocaust in its new series Hunters. The online retail giant has also been denounced for allowing the sale of anti-Semitic propaganda books. David Weil, the producer of Hunters, has defended the series and Amazon said it was ""listening to feedback"" about controversial book sales. Hunters, a 10-part drama series, follows a team of Nazi hunters in 1970s America. The show, starring Al Pacino, has been accused of bad taste and ""Jewsploitation"" for its depiction of fictional atrocities during the Holocaust. Around six million Jews were killed across Nazi-occupied Europe during the period from 1941-45. In one scene, inmates of Auschwitz concentration camp are forced to kill each other while being used in a game of human chess. Mr Weil, whose grandmother was a Holocaust survivor, said while Hunters was ""inspired by true events"", it was not a documentary series and never purported to be. He said he decided to fictionalise events in the series because he did not want to misrepresent the suffering of real people. ""After all, it is true that Nazis perpetrated widespread and extreme acts of sadism and torture - and even incidents of cruel 'games' - against their victims. I simply did not want to depict those specific, real acts of trauma,"" Mr Weil said. ""If the larger philosophical question is, can we ever tell stories about the Holocaust that are not documentary? I believe we can and should."" Auschwitz Memorial, a charity that maintains the former camp as a historical site, accused the programme makers of ""inventing a fake game of human chess"" in an act of ""dangerous foolishness"". Karen Pollack, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, told the BBC such portrayals risked fuelling Holocaust denial, and lent a tone of ""flippant entertainment"" to the programme. ""We have a real responsibility to protect the truth of the Holocaust,"" said Mrs Pollack, ""particularly as we're moving away from living history, the survivors are few and frailer."" ""We can't do this alone,"" she added. ""We have to rely on other people in society who want to do good."" About 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz.

"US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania have visited the Taj Mahal on the first day of their trip to India. The iconic ""monument to love"" was the second stop in a 36-hour official visit, Mr Trump's first to India. Earlier on Monday he landed in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who greeted him along with tens of thousands of Indians. The leaders of the world's two largest democracies will meet on Tuesday. No big deals are expected to be signed. Mr Trump received an exuberant welcome in the northern city of Agra, which included dancers dressed as peacocks and horses. While Mr Modi was not present, he was greeted by a close ally of his, Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, where Agra is located. The Trumps then left for the Taj Mahal, a 17th-Century marble mausoleum built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his queen, Mumtaz Mahal. It is perhaps India's most famous monument and isusually part of every visiting dignitary's itinerary. This video can not be played Why Trump's India visit matters Earlier, in Gujarat's Ahmedabad city, Mr Trump addressed a huge crowd at the Motera cricket stadium. ""Namaste,"" he began to thunderous applause, before going on to refer to several Indian icons, from history to cricket to Bollywood. ""India will always hold a very special place in our hearts,"" he added. He also had words of praise for Mr Modi: ""Everybody loves him but I will tell you this, he is very tough. You are not just the pride of Gujarat, you are living proof that with hard work, Indians can accomplish anything they want."" Mr Trump arrived in Agra to a colourful welcome However, he struggled to pronounce several Indian words - from Ahmedabad, the city where he was speaking, to Swami Vivekananda, an Indian philosopher, greatly admired by Mr Modi. He also called the Vedas - ancient Hindu texts - ""Vestas"". He ended his speech by saying: ""God bless India, God bless the United States of America  - we love you, we love you very much."" He spoke after Mr Modi, and crowds began leaving mid-way through the US president's speech. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Ahmedabad Inside the arena Mr Trump was welcomed warmly, but the biggest cheers were for Prime Minister Modi -  no surprise, this is his home town. I've been to rallies for both leaders - and while there was an energy as the two political rock stars headlined the same event, it lacked much of the excitement of their solo appearances. There were some awkward moments as President Trump tried his best with Indian names. In the world's largest cricket stadium, he managed to mangle the pronunciation of one of the world's greatest cricketers, Sachin Tendulkar. But overall, it did what both men wanted - cement the close ties they and their nations share. Follow Rajini on Twitter@BBCRajiniV,external Mr Trump's visit comes at an opportune time for Mr Modi, who has been under the spotlight in recent months following controversial decisions by his government. In December, India passed a contentious new citizenship law granting amnesty to non-Muslim immigrants from three nearby countries. This prompted massive protests across the country, with critics accusing the government of marginalising India's more than 200 million Muslims - a  charge the government denies. Seven Trump claims about India fact-checked What will Trump's visit do for US-India ties? What Donald Trump gets out of his trip to India When Modi's enthusiastic bear hug beat Trump's handshake How Trump got his wall - in India But protests are still continuing, including in Delhi,where a policeman was killed on Monday after violence broke out hours ahead of Mr Trump's visit. Clashes had erupted between groups protesting against the citizenship law, and those in favour of it. In August, Mr Modi's government revoked the partial autonomy of the disputed territory of Indian-administered Kashmir, sparking protests in the Muslim-majority valley. Mobile phone connections and the internet have only been partially restored, and political leaders there are still under house arrest along with hundreds of others. The two decisions have sharply polarised India, and have been questioned by leaders abroad. More than 100,000 people packed Motera stadium for the rally But Mr Modi put on a grand public reception to welcome Mr Trump. In Gujarat he was greeted with a road show as crowds lined his route to the stadium. It featured performers from across the country, showcasing the arts from different states. Billboards along the route to the Motera stadium were emblazoned with pictures of the two men and carried slogans such as ""two dynamic personalities, one momentous occasion"".

"Roads in parts of Powys remain flooded, including the A458 near Welshpool As Wales braces for more flooding, the Welsh Government has announced it will give at least Â£500 to every affected household. Ministers said a further Â£500 would be made available to those without house insurance cover. Rhondda Cynon Taf council appealed for food donations to help more than 500 households that had suffered flooding. Key roads,externalandrail lines,externalremain shut, especially in mid Wales where there was fresh flooding on Monday. A number of former coal sites in south Wales are being monitored 24 hours a day following several landslides. First Minister Mark Drakeford said a Â£10m fund set up by the Welsh Government would not be enough and the UK government needed to come up with cash to cover the cost of infrastructure damage. ""After a week of silence in the face of this emergency, we urgently need to hear what longer-term support communities can expect from the UK government,"" he said. The UK government said it would ""look seriously at any request"" from the Welsh Government for additional support and assistance for flood relief. In a statement, a spokesman said Welsh Secretary Simon Hart had met Mr Drakeford on Monday and ""reiterated the UK government's support for the affected communities"". He said the UK government had also ensured that any flood hardship payments made to individuals and families would not affect their eligibility for benefits issued by Department for Work and Pensions. Heavy rain has caused new flooding along the River Dyfi in Machynlleth, Powys Speaking in the House of Commons, Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said a quarter of the families across the UK affected by floods lived in Rhondda Cynon Taf, and urged the UK government to help. He said many of his constituents ""have to choose between putting food on the table or paying the insurance"" and that Rhondda Cynon Taf council faced a Â£30m bill to repair damage caused by the floods. Mr Bryant said: ""We need money from the government, we don't want talk of mutual aid. ""We need money and we need it now"". UK Environment Secretary George Eustice said if the Welsh Government approached the Wales Office with its concerns about funding then the matter could be considered. Responsibility for flooding is devolved. Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards also called for the UK government to give financial assistance to the Welsh Government for the communities hit by the floods. Hutchings Motor Group on Treforest Industial Estate said 258 of its new and used vehicles worth Â£3.5m had been written off The centre of Pontypridd was left under water after the River Taff burst its banks last Sunday and thousands were affected around the county by widespread flooding. Two car dealerships in the town - Hutchings Motor Group and Greenaway Autos - were flooded when the River Taff burst its banks, leading to about 300 new and used cars being written off. Now Welsh Labour politicians havecalled on the new chancellorfor a one-off grant of Â£30m to help pay for repair and restoration work across Rhondda Cynon Taff. Allow Twitter content?

A boy wades towards a flooded alleyway in Pontypridd during Storm Dennis Manics star to lead Valley Aid flood fundraiser Call for UK cash to fund flood relief in Wales In a letter to Rishi Sunak, they also called for council tax and business rates to be suspended for a year in affected properties. Council chiefs estimate Â£30m of infrastructure damage in Rhondda Cynon Taff alone - with the bill for private properties across the county ""likely to run to nearly Â£150m pounds,"" according to Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan. The Welsh Government funds flood defences, flood clear-ups and funding to local authorities, but tax relief is a UK government call. ""Wales took the brunt of the force of this storm and we would be wiping out all of our financial resources in one of the poorest areas of the country,"" Mr Bryant toldBBC Radio Wales. As the flood water subsides - the cost to some affected Storm Dennis is clear ""In the normal course of things this would be funded by the Welsh Government. ""But you would be wiping out the entire capital allocation just by dealing with the problems in Rhondda Cynon Taff. That would mean no other work on things like schools for example. ""They have announced lots of extra money in England but there isn't a single consequential penny for Wales, which is the hardest hit part of the UK. ""The whole point of the 'United Kingdom' is that if one part of the UK suffers then the whole of the United Kingdom should step in to help."" Mr Bryant added he thinks Westminster ""is open to the idea"" for extra funding but wants the UK government to ""step up"". If you've been flooded, you want help. You don't really care where it comes from. Being flooded is traumatic and it takes time and money to recover. In these Labour heartlands, if people feel they've been abandoned there could be a backlash in the assembly elections next May. The politicians who wrote the letter to the chancellor want extra money from the UK government. But a lot of what they're asking for is legally the responsibility of the Welsh Government. The UK government has promised extra money to flooded local authorities in England because they are responsible for funding councils there. In Wales, local councils are funded by the Welsh Government which has promised ten million pounds for immediate relief, with more to come. Reserves exist for emergencies, should the Welsh Government use theirs to shoulder the full cost? Or is this an extraordinary situation, where the UK government should step in? In politics, the answer to the question ""Who pays?"" is never straightforward. Prince Charles meets flood victims Can more be done to combat flooding? Why Wales is prone to landslides About 550 homes were flooded across the county and Rhondda council bosses say they ""currently have 50 families in temporary accommodation"". ""The amount of damage is just something we haven't seen on this scale before,"" said Mr Morgan. ""A lot of families don't have insurance and some businesses are being told by their insurance companies they aren't covered. ""Unless we have additional support families will be out of their homes for sometime, businesses could fold and people could lose their jobs."" Pontypridd's popular lido at Ynysangharad Park is unlikely to re-open this year after Storm Dennis floods Crowdfunding pages have already raised thousands for the flood-hit communities and aValley Aid fundraising concert has been announcedfor next month, where Manic Street Preachers frontman James Dean Bradfield and Grammy award winner Amy Wadge will headline. Film star Michael Sheen and Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones have between them raised more than Â£80,000 in online campaigns. A collection at Saturday's Six Nations rugby game between Wales and France at the Principality Stadium raised Â£12,000, the Welsh Rugby Union said. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Whilst flood defences and the response to flooding in Wales are devolved, we will continue to engage with and support the Welsh Government on flood relief and coal tip safety."" The Department for Work and Pensions have confirmed that flood hardship payments will ""not affect eligibility for benefits."" Welsh Water had been using tankers after a treatment works in Monmouth was flooded In mid Wales, delivery driver Mike Jones told how he was struck by floodwater while on the A458 near Welshpool, Powys, on Monday. Mike Jones's was hit by flood water on the A458 near Welshpool on the when a river burst its banks He said: ""All of a sudden from my left the river burst its banks and it came through the hedge out in front of me. ""A big wave came across the front of the van and I just about got through but unfortunately it got into the enginesâ¦ it was a bit scary."" A full Powys council meeting on Friday will reveal what the cost of the recent storms has been to the county and what can be done to help those affected. Councillor John Morris, who represents Crickhowell -Â one of the worst hit areas of the county - said: ""In my area alone over 30 residential properties were affected and about the same number of businesses. ""This includes the Elvicta Trading Estate on the outskirts of Crickhowell with its 20 or so businesses and is a major employer in the area."" Caereinion High School near Welshpool, Powys, closed on Monday because flooded roads are preventing some teachers and pupils from getting in. Meanwhile, running water to a town marooned by flooding has been restored after almost a week without supply on Monday. Tankers and bottled water had supplied residents in Monmouth after the town's Mayhill treatment works was shut after becoming submerged after the Rivers Monnow and Wye burst their banks.

"Some 1.1 million people were killed by the Nazis at Auschwitz Several Jewish groups have criticised Amazon for fictitious depictions of the Holocaust in its new series Hunters. The online retail giant has also been denounced for allowing the sale of anti-Semitic propaganda books. David Weil, the producer of Hunters, has defended the series and Amazon said it was ""listening to feedback"" about controversial book sales. Hunters, a 10-part drama series, follows a team of Nazi hunters in 1970s America. The show, starring Al Pacino, has been accused of bad taste and ""Jewsploitation"" for its depiction of fictional atrocities during the Holocaust. Around six million Jews were killed across Nazi-occupied Europe during the period from 1941-45. In one scene, inmates of Auschwitz concentration camp are forced to kill each other while being used in a game of human chess. Mr Weil, whose grandmother was a Holocaust survivor, said while Hunters was ""inspired by true events"", it was not a documentary series and never purported to be. He said he decided to fictionalise events in the series because he did not want to misrepresent the suffering of real people. ""After all, it is true that Nazis perpetrated widespread and extreme acts of sadism and torture - and even incidents of cruel 'games' - against their victims. I simply did not want to depict those specific, real acts of trauma,"" Mr Weil said. ""If the larger philosophical question is, can we ever tell stories about the Holocaust that are not documentary? I believe we can and should."" Auschwitz Memorial, a charity that maintains the former camp as a historical site, accused the programme makers of ""inventing a fake game of human chess"" in an act of ""dangerous foolishness"". Karen Pollack, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, told the BBC such portrayals risked fuelling Holocaust denial, and lent a tone of ""flippant entertainment"" to the programme. ""We have a real responsibility to protect the truth of the Holocaust,"" said Mrs Pollack, ""particularly as we're moving away from living history, the survivors are few and frailer."" ""We can't do this alone,"" she added. ""We have to rely on other people in society who want to do good."" About 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz.

""As a bookseller, we are mindful of book censorship throughout history, and we do not take this lightly,"" Amazon said in response. It added that it was investing ""significant time and resources"" in ensuring products on sale met its guidelines.

Previous seasons have been filmed on the Spanish island of Mallorca over the summer. Overall, the winter series has been a ratings hit for ITV2, albeit not as successful as previous summer series.

"Figen Murray has called for a new law making it compulsory for every venue to assess the risk of a terror attack The mother of Martyn Hett, who died in the terror attack at Manchester Arena, has called on venues to help shape a new law to ensure the safety of fans at concerts and other big events. Figen Murray has been lobbying the government to bring in new security measures since her son's death in 2017. The Home Office has said it will now consult on ""Martyn's Law"" to require venues to prepare for any terror risks. Ms Murray said the ""common-sense step... will save lives in the future"". ""Today's consultation is the start of making us all that bit safer,"" said Ms Murray,  who urged businesses and the public to get involved. Ms Murray spearheaded the campaign to introduce Martyn's Law, which requests measures such as airport-style security checks - including bag searches and metal detectors - at large public venues. She launcheda petition in 2018 that gathered more than 23,000 signatures.,external She said: ""Public venues already have all sorts of obligations from fire prevention to health and safety - but until now there has been no duty to protect their customers. ""Martyn's Law will change that. It's a common-sense step that will save lives in the future."" Martyn Hett was one of 22 people killed in the Manchester Arena attack, when Salman Abedi blew himself up at the end of the Ariana Grande concert, leaving hundreds more injured. A Coronation Street superfan, the 29-year-old's funeral was attended by many members of the soap's cast andsaw tributes from singers Michelle McManus and Mariah Carey. Since the 2017 attack, backpacks and large bags have been banned from large concert venues, but there is no legislation requiring security checks at all public venues. Under the government's proposals,external, Parliament would pass a new law that would impose a legal duty on whoever is responsible for the management of public spaces. The new law would require owners and operators to consider the risk of an attack and the plans they have in place to either help prevent it happening - or to manage the aftermath. The duty could include obligations to review and improve not only the physical security of a location, but also how well staff members are trained to deal with an incident. Final plans will follow a consultation in the spring and Ms Murray made her plea to venue owners and businesses that put on big events to play their part in that process. Security Minister James Brokenshire said:  ""We are in complete agreement with campaigners such as Figen Murray on the importance of venues and public spaces having effective and proportionate protective security and preparedness measures to keep people safe. ""Of course, it is important that this new law is proportionate. This public consultation will ensure we put in place a law that will help protect the public, while not putting undue pressure on businesses."" Martyn Hett was one of 22 people killed in the Manchester Arena attack on 22 May 2017 This announcement follows the conviction last Friday of a woman who wanted to take a bomb into St Paul's Cathedral and blow it up. Safiyya Shaikh recorded the landmark's security arrangements - a classic example of how would-be attackers prepare. That case revealed a threat at the extreme end of the spectrum - but how should other public spaces prepare when the behaviour that needs stopping can be very difficult to spot or predict? The proposed new legal duty aims to be a balancing act - working out what would be proportionate, relative to the risk of an attack. The O2 Arena in London, for instance, has an enormous security operation, including measures to stop vehicle attacks. But while a pub wouldn't need the same level of security, would the landlady benefit from having thought about how to protect customers amid an attack outside - just like at Borough Market in 2017. So supporters of the law say the goal is to make it scaleable - ensuring that all businesses where the public congregate have considered the risks, rather like they do already for fire, so they know how to respond were the worst to happen. The forthcoming inquiry into the Manchester attack is expected to examine how prepared the arena had been for such an event. Manchester City's council has already pledged to introduce its own version of Martyn's Lawas part of licensing rules for clubs and venues. Last November, the coroner at the inquests for the eight victims of the 2017 London Bridge attack urged the government to consider a legal duty after hearing evidence of missed opportunities to better protect the area. The shadow security minister Nick Thomas-Symonds paid tribute to campaigners behind Martyn's Law, but said the government needed to reverse police cuts. ""There can be no objection to proper consultation on a duty to protect and we pay tribute to those who have campaigned for this change. ""However, a duty to protect is no substitute for professional policing. Combating the terrorists requires everything from community policing through to counter-terrorism."" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has previously called on security against terror attacks at venuesto be ""mandatory not discretionary"".

"Weeks after reports of a mysterious new virus began to emerge in the central Chinese province of Hubei, the authorities there suddenly changed how they determined who was infected. It led to a significant spike in numbers - only because doctors are now counting patients who are diagnosed in a clinic and not just those who have taken the test. But in those early days, the rapid spread of the virus through the city of Wuhan, combined with a shortage of hospital beds, meant some didn't get the treatment they needed. Two Wuhan residents told the BBC about the harrowing experience of trying to get care for their loved-ones in a city overwhelmed by sickness. Huang was raised by his grandparents after his parents passed away when he was a child. All he ever wanted was to provide for his grandparents, both in their 80s, so that they could enjoy retirement in bliss, he says. But in the space of just over a fortnight, his grandfather was killed by the coronavirus, and now his grandmother is in a critical condition. Sharp increase in coronavirus deaths and cases Will someone develop a coronavirus vaccine? The Chinese doctor who tried to warn about coronavirus Huang's grandparents started to have respiratory symptoms on 20 January. They couldn't go to a hospital until 26 January as it was difficult for them to get around after Wuhan was put into effective lockdown on 23 January, with public transport suspended. They were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus on 29 January, but were only admitted to a hospital three days later. But the hospital was so full that there were no empty beds. His grandparents had high fever and difficulty breathing, but were only offered seats in the corridor. He begged the hospital staff and he managed to get a long chair and a folding bed. ""There's no doctor or nurse in sight,"" Huang wrote in his diary, ""Hospital without doctors is just like a graveyard."" The night before his grandfather passed away, Huang was with his grandparents in the corridor. He kept chatting with his grandmother so that she wouldn't know that his grandfather was experiencing delirium, he says. A bed was finally available three hours before his grandfather died. Huang was by his bedside till the last minute. He wrote on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform: ""Grandpa, please rest in peace. There's no pain in heaven."" ""Many patients died without the company of family members and couldn't even get a last look at each other."" His grandmother is battling for her life in the hospital, and he spends as much time as possible with her. ""There's no effective medicine. Doctors told me not to hold out hope, and she can only get through by herself,"" he said. ""We can only let fate decide."" Since 7 February Xiao Huang has himself been feeling unwell and has now been quarantined for two weeks in a hotel. In early January, Da Chun's mother developed a fever. The family was not particularly alarmed, thinking that it was just a cold. They had heard little about the mysterious disease that was quietly spreading in the city of 11 million. But her fever did not subside for a week, even though she received injections from a community clinic. On 20 January, the same day when Chinese authorities admitted that the coronavirus is transmittable between humans, he brought his mother to an outpatient clinic designated for people with fever. After looking at the chest scan and results of the blood test, the doctor told them that his mother had been infected with the novel coronavirus. ""Till this day, I am still in disbelief,"" says Da Chun. But more bad news came. The doctor said his mother, 53, could not be admitted to a hospital because they didn't have the test kits to confirm the diagnosis. The test kits were only available at eight designated hospitals in late January. ""A doctor of a designated hospital told me they don't have the right to hospitalise my mum. It's the local health commission that allocates beds for confirmed cases,"" the 22-year-old says. ""So, doctors can't do [the] coronavirus test to confirm my mom as [an] infected case, and can't offer her a bed."" Da Chun says his mother was not an isolated case. In a chat group with more than 200 members on the popular messaging app WeChat for families of infected patients people shared similar stories. His brother would queue up at hospitals to check if there were beds available. He would go to the clinic with his mother so that she could get drips. But during these visits, they saw patients pass away inside observation rooms before getting tested or admitted. ""The dead bodies were wrapped and taken away by parlour staff,"" he says. ""I don't know if they will be counted as deaths [caused by the novel coronavirus]."" His mother's condition continued to worsen. She started to cough blood, and there was blood in her urine. On 29 January, his mother was finally admitted to a hospital, but he says she received no treatment and the hospital did not have sufficient equipment during the first days when she was first hospitalised. But he's not giving up hope that his mother will recover. Reporting by the BBC's Grace Tsoi. Illustrations by Gerry Fletcher.

"US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania have visited the Taj Mahal on the first day of their trip to India. The iconic ""monument to love"" was the second stop in a 36-hour official visit, Mr Trump's first to India. Earlier on Monday he landed in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who greeted him along with tens of thousands of Indians. The leaders of the world's two largest democracies will meet on Tuesday. No big deals are expected to be signed. Mr Trump received an exuberant welcome in the northern city of Agra, which included dancers dressed as peacocks and horses. While Mr Modi was not present, he was greeted by a close ally of his, Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, where Agra is located. The Trumps then left for the Taj Mahal, a 17th-Century marble mausoleum built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his queen, Mumtaz Mahal. It is perhaps India's most famous monument and isusually part of every visiting dignitary's itinerary. This video can not be played Why Trump's India visit matters Earlier, in Gujarat's Ahmedabad city, Mr Trump addressed a huge crowd at the Motera cricket stadium. ""Namaste,"" he began to thunderous applause, before going on to refer to several Indian icons, from history to cricket to Bollywood. ""India will always hold a very special place in our hearts,"" he added. He also had words of praise for Mr Modi: ""Everybody loves him but I will tell you this, he is very tough. You are not just the pride of Gujarat, you are living proof that with hard work, Indians can accomplish anything they want."" Mr Trump arrived in Agra to a colourful welcome However, he struggled to pronounce several Indian words - from Ahmedabad, the city where he was speaking, to Swami Vivekananda, an Indian philosopher, greatly admired by Mr Modi. He also called the Vedas - ancient Hindu texts - ""Vestas"". He ended his speech by saying: ""God bless India, God bless the United States of America  - we love you, we love you very much."" He spoke after Mr Modi, and crowds began leaving mid-way through the US president's speech. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Ahmedabad Inside the arena Mr Trump was welcomed warmly, but the biggest cheers were for Prime Minister Modi -  no surprise, this is his home town. I've been to rallies for both leaders - and while there was an energy as the two political rock stars headlined the same event, it lacked much of the excitement of their solo appearances. There were some awkward moments as President Trump tried his best with Indian names. In the world's largest cricket stadium, he managed to mangle the pronunciation of one of the world's greatest cricketers, Sachin Tendulkar. But overall, it did what both men wanted - cement the close ties they and their nations share. Follow Rajini on Twitter@BBCRajiniV,external Mr Trump's visit comes at an opportune time for Mr Modi, who has been under the spotlight in recent months following controversial decisions by his government. In December, India passed a contentious new citizenship law granting amnesty to non-Muslim immigrants from three nearby countries. This prompted massive protests across the country, with critics accusing the government of marginalising India's more than 200 million Muslims - a  charge the government denies. Seven Trump claims about India fact-checked What will Trump's visit do for US-India ties? What Donald Trump gets out of his trip to India When Modi's enthusiastic bear hug beat Trump's handshake How Trump got his wall - in India But protests are still continuing, including in Delhi,where a policeman was killed on Monday after violence broke out hours ahead of Mr Trump's visit. Clashes had erupted between groups protesting against the citizenship law, and those in favour of it. In August, Mr Modi's government revoked the partial autonomy of the disputed territory of Indian-administered Kashmir, sparking protests in the Muslim-majority valley. Mobile phone connections and the internet have only been partially restored, and political leaders there are still under house arrest along with hundreds of others. The two decisions have sharply polarised India, and have been questioned by leaders abroad. More than 100,000 people packed Motera stadium for the rally But Mr Modi put on a grand public reception to welcome Mr Trump. In Gujarat he was greeted with a road show as crowds lined his route to the stadium. It featured performers from across the country, showcasing the arts from different states. Billboards along the route to the Motera stadium were emblazoned with pictures of the two men and carried slogans such as ""two dynamic personalities, one momentous occasion"". Mr Trump entered to the music of Elton John, which he is known to love, playing on the speakers. The event is being compared to the ""Howdy, Modi!"" event that Mr Trump and Mr Modi held in Houston last year, which was attended by 50,000 people. Mr Trump also made a quick stop at the Sabarmati Ashram, where Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, who was born in Gujarat, lived for 13 years. Allow Twitter content?

"North Korea is taking precautions to keep the virus out North Korea has quarantined 380 foreigners in an attempt to stop the coronavirus from breaking out. The foreigners are mostly diplomats stationed in the capital Pyongyang, state media reported. About 200 foreigners had already been confined to their compounds for the past 30 days - but as that came to an end, the quarantine has been extended. North Korea has not reported any cases of Covid-19, but several other countries did so on Monday. Afghanistan and Dubai said they had detected their first cases, and Kuwait said three people returning from Iran had been infected. What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? In South Korea, seven people have died with 763 people infected. Around 7,700 troops have been quarantined after 11 military members were infected. The virus, which emerged in China, has spread to at least 29 countries. Italy has the highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe, with 152. Around 50,000 people in two northern ""hotspot"" regions - Veneto and Lombardy - have been put under quarantine for two weeks. Iran has also confirmed 43 cases of the virus and eight deaths. Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak How a misleading coronavirus map went global Watching loved ones die without care in Wuhan In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged, the authorities earlier announced that some non-residents would be allowed to leave if they showed no symptoms of the virus. However, local officials now say that order was made without authorisation and has been revoked. The city has been in lockdown since January 23, with authorities cutting off transport links in and out of the city. More than 2,500 people have died from the virus in mainland China, with some 77,150 cases confirmed cases reported. A worker sprays disinfectant to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus at a market in Seoul North Korea has not confirmed any cases but the country shares a long and often porous border with China. There are concerns that North Korea, which is subject to international sanctions, lacks the health infrastructure to test and treat those infected and that any outbreak could quickly spread unchecked. At the moment, all foreigners coming into the country must be quarantined for 30 days. There are relatively few foreigners in North Korea, and only around 200 Westerners, according to one expert. North Korea: Who is sending aid? Why are there expats in North Korea? North Korean authorities have also cancelled the annual Pyongyang marathon, which typically sees people from all over the world participating. Around 3,000 people in North Pyongan province - a north-western region bordering China - are also now under monitoring for reportedly showing suspected symptoms, said state media. This video can not be played People in Daegu have voiced concern over the spread of the virus South Korea has the largest number of confirmed cases outside China, after a huge spike in the past week. Before last Wednesday, the country had recorded just 31 cases. That number has now jumped to 763. Eight new cases of the virus have been reported in the army, and one in the navy, air force and marine corps - bringing the number to 11. But the biggest virus clusters have been linked to a hospital and a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu. South Korea has raised its infectious disease alert to its highest level A handful of South Korea airlines, including Korean Air Lines - the country's biggest airline - has suspended flights going to Daegu, which has a population of around 2.5m. Korean Air says the suspension will last until March 27. Italian officials have introduced sweeping measures to control what is nowthe worst outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe- at least three people have died and more than 150 cases confirmed. In the regions of Lombardy and Veneto, a lock-down is in place in several small towns. For the next two weeks, 50,000 residents will not be able to leave without special permission. Even outside the zone, many businesses and schools have suspended activities, and sporting events have been cancelled - including several top-flight football matches. Officials have yet to find the first carrier of the virus in the country. Analysis by Fergus Walsh,medicalcorrespondent The combined situation in South Korea, Iran and Italy points to the early stages of pandemic. This means a global outbreak, with the coronavirus spreading in the community in multiple parts of the world. In each of these countries we are seeing spread of the virus with no connection to China. The lockdown efforts in Italy mirror those that have happened in China. The situation in Iran is especially worrying, because the health authorities have reportedly said the virus has spread to multiple cities, and it appears the first case in Lebanon is linked to a traveller from Iran. If we have a pandemic, it will still be important to limit the speed of spread of the virus. If countries could hold it somewhat at bay until the end of winter, there is a hope that warmer temperatures will reduce the time the virus can survive in the air, as we see with seasonal flu. But this may not be certain. Iran said on Sunday it had 43 confirmed cases of the virus, most of them in the holy city of Qom. Eight of those infected have died, the highest number of deaths outside China. Iraq, Pakistan, Armenia and Turkey have closed their borders with Iran, and Afghanistan has suspended air and road travel to and from Iran. China's President Xi Jinping has described the outbreak as the ""largest public health emergency"" in the country's recent history. Speaking on Sunday, he acknowledged ""shortcomings"" in China's response and said lessons must be learned. Why a pregnant nurse is sparking outrage in China China reported 409 new infections on Monday, the bulk of which were from Wuhan. But outside China, cases with no clear link to that country or other confirmed cases continue to rise, prompting concern from the World Health Organization (WHO).

"This video can not be played Drone captures massive queue for masks in South Korea's Daegu city The World Health Organization has said the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic. The WHO said it was too early to call the outbreak a pandemic but countries should be ""in a phase of preparedness"". A pandemic is when an infectious disease spreads easily from person to person in many parts of the world. More cases of the virus, which causes respiratory disease Covid-19, continue to emerge, with outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran causing concern. However, most infections are in China, the original source of the virus, where more than 77,000 people have the disease and over 2,600 have died. More than 1,200 cases have been confirmed in about 30 other countries and there have been more than 20 deaths. Italy reported four more deaths on Monday, raising the total there to seven. Worldwide stock markets saw sharp fallsbecause of concerns about the economic impact of the virus. China said it would postpone the annual meeting of the National People's Congress next month, to ""continue the efforts"" against the coronavirus. The body, which approves decisions made by the Communist Party, has met every year since 1978. The proportion of infected people who die from Covid-19 appears to be between 1% and 2%, although the WHO cautions that the mortality rate is not known yet. On Monday Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain reported their first cases, all involving people who had come from Iran. Officials in Bahrain said the patient infected there was a school bus driver, and several schools had been closed as a result. Coronavirus: Could it become a pandemic? Tell us how you've been affected by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Among other developments: Some upcoming football matches in Italy's Serie A and the Europa League will be played behind closed doors to prevent the spread of the virus, Italy's sports minister says Gold surged to its highest price in seven yearsas coronavirus fears led investors to seek a safe haven South Korean pop group BTS asks fans to stay away from upcoming TV shows, which will be taped without a studio audience North Korea has quarantined 380 foreignersin a bid to stop the coronavirus from breaking out. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Monday that the number of new cases in recent days in Iran, Italy and South Korea was ""deeply concerning"". However he added: ""For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large scale severe disease or deaths. ""Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely, it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet."" ""The key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained, indeed there are many countries that have done exactly that,"" Mr Tedros said. ""Using the word 'pandemic' now does not fit the facts but may certainly cause fear."" But Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme, said now was the time to make ""do everything you would do to prepare for a pandemic"". Is the coronavirus a pandemic? For now the WHO says no. It argues the number of countries with outbreaks, the severity of the disease and the impact on society has not reached pandemic-level. But some scientists - assessing the same picture - think we are already there and others say we're on the cusp. The surge in cases in South Korea and the deaths in Iran and Italy have dialled up concern over the past few days. The deaths suggest there are far more cases in those two countries than have been reported and that the virus has been there for some time. But ultimately the word pandemic is just that - a word - it will not unlock more money or give the WHO new powers. It has already issued the highest warning it can, by declaring the virus a global emergency. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? A pandemic is theworldwide spread of a new disease,external The H1N1 (swine flu) outbreak, which killed hundreds of thousands of people, was declared a pandemic by the WHO in 2009 The WHO no longer formally labels an outbreak of disease a ""pandemic"" but says the term may be used ""colloquially"" Its advice to countries - to limit the infections while preparing for wider spread - remains the same South Korea- which has the largest number of confirmed cases outside China - reported another 231 infections on Monday taking the total there to more than 830. Eight people have died. Around 7,700 troops have been quarantined after 11 military members were infected. But the biggest virus clusters have been linked to a hospital and a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu.

In the regions of Lombardy and Veneto, a lock-down is in place in several small towns. For the next two weeks, 50,000 residents will not be able to leave without special permission. This video can not be played Mark Lowen was on the ground at the edge of Italy's coronavirus lockdown area Even outside the zone, many businesses and schools have suspended activities, and sporting events have been cancelled. Three deaths announced on Monday were all in Lombardy, Italian media reported. It is not yet clear how the virus entered the country, officials said. InChina, the government announced a ban on the consumption of wild animals and a crackdown on the hunting, transportation and trade of prohibited species, state media say. It is thought that the outbreak originated at a market in the city of Wuhan selling wild animals. China reported 508 new infections on Monday, compared with 409 on Sunday. The bulk of the new cases were in Wuhan. Outside the worst-hit province of Hubei, the number of new infections continues to decline, according to official figures. The death toll in China rose by 71 to 2,663. Iransaid on Sunday it had 61 confirmed cases of the virus, most of them in the holy city of Qom. Twelve of those infected have died, the highest number of deaths outside China. On Mondayan MP in Qom accused the government of covering up the extent of the outbreak, saying there were 50 deaths in the city alone.

"Labour members have begun casting their votes in the party's contest to replace outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey qualified for the ballot after obtaining enough support from unions and affiliated groups. The party is also choosing a new deputy leader, following Tom Watson's resignation in December. Voting will close on 2 April, with the results announced at a special conference two days later. Among those taking part will be 114,000 new members who have joined since December's election, where Labour won its lowest number of seats since 1935. Members of affiliated trades unions and groups can also vote, as well as around 14,700 ""registered supporters"" who have paid Â£25 to take part on a one-off basis. Who will be Labour's next leader? Blair queries Labour hopefuls' hunger for change 100 years of Labour in charts To qualify for the ballot, candidates needed support from three unions or affiliates representing 5% of the membership, or 33 constituency Labour parties (CLPs). Sir Keir, the party's Brexit spokesman, is seen as the front-runner in the contest and has secured the most nominations from unions and affiliates, as well as CLPs. He said the party needs to stop ""taking lumps out of each other,"" adding that the ""trashing"" of former Labour governments ""has to stop"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have to pull together and unite - and I feel that's where the membership is."" He also attacked the government's latestimmigration plans, adding that he would get rid of minimum salary thresholds as they were not ""the right measure for people coming to this country"". Speaking at a members' hustings in Durham on Sunday, all three leadership candidates pledged to offer their rivals shadow cabinet posts if they are successful, and said they would happily serve in the winner's top team. Sir Keir did not commit to offering roles to his rivals at a previous event last week. Writing for the Independent,externalon Sunday, Wigan MP Ms Nandy said the party had previously treated voters concerned about immigration as ""irrational or racist"". She added that the party would need to focus on devolving power around the country, rather than offering policies ""devised by a small group of people behind desks in central London"". Also making her pitch to members before voting opened, Mrs Long-Bailey said the party should turn the next election into a ""climate election"". In anIndependent article of her own,external, the shadow business secretary said green policies could improve infrastructure and boost ""well-paid, unionised jobs"". Meanwhile shadow home secretary Diane Abbott joined shadow chancellor John McDonnell in saying she will stand down from the shadow cabinet once a new leader is in place. Mr Corbyn has said he wouldconsider servingin the shadow cabinet if offered a job by his successor. He said last week he would ""see what it is"" if offered a post, adding that he ""didn't know"" whether this would happen. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn 'would consider shadow cabinet role' Members and supporters can vote via email if they have registered an email address with the party, or if not using a postal ballot delivered to their home. Voting works using a preferential system, with members ranking the candidates in order of preference. If one fails to get more than half the first preference votes, the second preference votes of the lowest-ranked candidate are redistributed until the contest produces a winner. The system is the same for the deputy leadership race, where shadow education secretary Angela Rayner is regarded as the frontrunner. Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, Scotland's only remaining Labour MP Ian Murray, Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan and shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon have also secured their place on the deputy leadership members' ballot. 100 years of Labour in charts What you need to know about Keir Starmer.

"US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania have visited the Taj Mahal on the first day of their trip to India. The iconic ""monument to love"" was the second stop in a 36-hour official visit, Mr Trump's first to India. Earlier on Monday he landed in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who greeted him along with tens of thousands of Indians. The leaders of the world's two largest democracies will meet on Tuesday. No big deals are expected to be signed. Mr Trump received an exuberant welcome in the northern city of Agra, which included dancers dressed as peacocks and horses. While Mr Modi was not present, he was greeted by a close ally of his, Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, where Agra is located. The Trumps then left for the Taj Mahal, a 17th-Century marble mausoleum built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his queen, Mumtaz Mahal. It is perhaps India's most famous monument and isusually part of every visiting dignitary's itinerary. This video can not be played Why Trump's India visit matters Earlier, in Gujarat's Ahmedabad city, Mr Trump addressed a huge crowd at the Motera cricket stadium. ""Namaste,"" he began to thunderous applause, before going on to refer to several Indian icons, from history to cricket to Bollywood. ""India will always hold a very special place in our hearts,"" he added. He also had words of praise for Mr Modi: ""Everybody loves him but I will tell you this, he is very tough. You are not just the pride of Gujarat, you are living proof that with hard work, Indians can accomplish anything they want."" Mr Trump arrived in Agra to a colourful welcome However, he struggled to pronounce several Indian words - from Ahmedabad, the city where he was speaking, to Swami Vivekananda, an Indian philosopher, greatly admired by Mr Modi. He also called the Vedas - ancient Hindu texts - ""Vestas"". He ended his speech by saying: ""God bless India, God bless the United States of America  - we love you, we love you very much."" He spoke after Mr Modi, and crowds began leaving mid-way through the US president's speech. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Ahmedabad Inside the arena Mr Trump was welcomed warmly, but the biggest cheers were for Prime Minister Modi -  no surprise, this is his home town. I've been to rallies for both leaders - and while there was an energy as the two political rock stars headlined the same event, it lacked much of the excitement of their solo appearances. There were some awkward moments as President Trump tried his best with Indian names. In the world's largest cricket stadium, he managed to mangle the pronunciation of one of the world's greatest cricketers, Sachin Tendulkar. But overall, it did what both men wanted - cement the close ties they and their nations share. Follow Rajini on Twitter@BBCRajiniV,external Mr Trump's visit comes at an opportune time for Mr Modi, who has been under the spotlight in recent months following controversial decisions by his government. In December, India passed a contentious new citizenship law granting amnesty to non-Muslim immigrants from three nearby countries. This prompted massive protests across the country, with critics accusing the government of marginalising India's more than 200 million Muslims - a  charge the government denies. Seven Trump claims about India fact-checked What will Trump's visit do for US-India ties? What Donald Trump gets out of his trip to India When Modi's enthusiastic bear hug beat Trump's handshake How Trump got his wall - in India But protests are still continuing, including in Delhi,where a policeman was killed on Monday after violence broke out hours ahead of Mr Trump's visit. Clashes had erupted between groups protesting against the citizenship law, and those in favour of it. In August, Mr Modi's government revoked the partial autonomy of the disputed territory of Indian-administered Kashmir, sparking protests in the Muslim-majority valley. Mobile phone connections and the internet have only been partially restored, and political leaders there are still under house arrest along with hundreds of others. The two decisions have sharply polarised India, and have been questioned by leaders abroad. More than 100,000 people packed Motera stadium for the rally But Mr Modi put on a grand public reception to welcome Mr Trump. In Gujarat he was greeted with a road show as crowds lined his route to the stadium. It featured performers from across the country, showcasing the arts from different states. Billboards along the route to the Motera stadium were emblazoned with pictures of the two men and carried slogans such as ""two dynamic personalities, one momentous occasion"". Mr Trump entered to the music of Elton John, which he is known to love, playing on the speakers. The event is being compared to the ""Howdy, Modi!"" event that Mr Trump and Mr Modi held in Houston last year, which was attended by 50,000 people. Mr Trump also made a quick stop at the Sabarmati Ashram, where Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, who was born in Gujarat, lived for 13 years. Allow Twitter content?

"Scenes such as this at Nantgarw were repeated across Rhondda Cynon Taff following Storm Dennis Welsh Labour MPs and assembly members have called on the new chancellor to deliver flood relief cash to some of the worst affected parts of Wales. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, they ask for a one-off grant of Â£30m to pay for repair and restoration work across Rhondda Cynon Taff. They also want council tax and business rates suspended for a year in affected properties. They accepted some matters are devolved - but want action at a UK level. ""Our belief in the Union leads us to conclude that when any part of the United Kingdom is hit particularly hard, the whole of the UK should help out, regardless of the normal funding rules,"" they have written in the letter to the Treasury. ""We therefore urge you as a matter of urgency to provide specific one-off funding for RCT (Rhondda Cynon Taff)."" Pontypridd's popular lido at Ynysangharad Park is unlikely to re-open this year after Storm Dennis floods The letter has been signed by the MPs Chris Elmore (Ogmore), Chris Bryant (Rhondda), Beth Winter (Cynon Valley), and Alex Davies-Jones (Pontypridd). The AMs Mick Antoniw (Pontypridd), Vikki Howells (Cynon Valley), and Huw Irranca-Davies (Ogmore), have added their names to the request.

Prince Charles meets Storm Dennis flood victims Why Wales is prone to landslides Can more be done to combat flooding? Writing to Mr Sunak,who replaced Sajid Javid at No 11 Downing Street earlier this month, they argued that damage to roads, bridges and council property will cost the local authority up to Â£30m. They added: ""That will swamp the council's total annual general capital funding allocation of Â£13.4m. The damage to private properties across the county is likely to run to nearly Â£150m pounds."" ""We are a resilient community, many hundreds of people have mucked in and helped out. We are generous too. Charitable donations have nearly reached Â£200,000. ""But, however generous we are individually, we do not have deep pockets."" In addition to calls for additional cash, the Labour politicians have also asked for some rules on benefit payments to be suspended.

Speaking to BBC Wales, the Rhondda MP Chris Bryant added: ""Wales has borne the brunt of the misery and RCT in particular has been hardest hit. ""Without extra help, RCT could be wiped out financially as we rebuild bridges, roads and flood defences."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said it had been ""working around the clock with partner agencies to keep people safe and informed"" since the storms and resulting floods. ""We have made available Â£10m to deal with the immediate impact of the storms,"" they added. ""This funding is being made available for the initial response, while work to assess the overall impact and cost of the damage continues. This will determine what further financial support is needed and, depending on the scale of those costs, we would look to the UK government to provide resources."" Taff Street in Pontypridd was badly affected They said the First Minister Mark Drakeford would be meeting the Welsh Secretary Simon Hart next week to discuss the safety of coal tips and the communities in their shadows. A UK government official said it had been communicating with emergency services, councils and the Welsh Government over flooding.

"The evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were taken to Arrowe Park Hospital on Saturday Four cruise ship passengers flown to Britain on Saturday have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 13. They were among 30 repatriated Britons and two Irish citizens beginning a 14-day quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral. The four UK nationals caught the virus on the Diamond Princess liner in Japan, England's chief medical officer said. They have now been transferred to specialist NHS infection centres. Two patients are in the Royal Hallamshire in Sheffield, one is in the Royal in Liverpool and a fourth was transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, NHS England said. Prof Keith Willett, NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus said: ""These specialist centres are well prepared to deal with cases and earlier this year the Newcastle unit successfully treated and discharged two patients who had contracted the virus."" Prof Willett added there had been a ""calm response"" to confirmed cases of coronavirus so far, ""which will continue to be important as more of us might need to self-isolate for a time, to protect ourselves, our families and the community"". Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said the four new cases were not surprising and would present no risk to the public. The Department of Health said a ""full infectious disease risk assessment"" was done before Saturday's repatriation flight from Japan, adding that no-one who boarded the flight had displayed any symptoms of the virus. Any more passengers who test positive will immediately be taken into specialist NHS care, the department said. It added that ""appropriate arrangements"" are in place at Arrowe Park, including strict separation of passengers from staff and from each other. It comes as 118 UK citizens and their family members rescued from Wuhan - the centre of the virus outbreak -ended their two-week isolation in Milton Keynes on Sunday. Last weekend, NHS England announced thatall but one of the nine people being treated for the coronavirus in the UK had been discharged from hospital. Venice Carnival closes amid coronavirus outbreak How a virus reveals the many ways China is feared Coronavirus: What you need to know by BBC News medical correspondent Fergus Walsh It's not surprising that some of those repatriated from the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the coronavirus. They were on board a ship where the quarantine was a failure - more than one in five of the 3,700 passengers and crew have tested positive. In the US, 18 repatriated passengers from the cruise ship subsequently tested positive for Covid-19, as did seven passengers flown back to Australia. It would seem likely that more of those in quarantine in Arrowe Park hospital may test positive in the coming days. But the NHS is well able to cope with such cases and can isolate and treat patients in specialist centres. Far more concerning is the situation in Italy, Iran and South Korea, where there is human-to-human spread of the virus in the community, which could eventually lead to the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic. More than 620 people on board the Diamond Princess tested positive for the virus Arrowe Park Hospital was previously used to isolate 83 British nationals who were flown back to the UK from Wuhan on the Foreign Office's first evacuation flight in January. Janelle Holmes, chief executive at Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Trust reassured staff that the hospital was ""running as usual"". ""When guests arrived yesterday evening, we followed clear guidance in relation to infection prevention control. This was to minimise the chance of any infection spreading."" The evacuees had already spent two weeks in quarantine on board the cruise ship, but since then 600 passengers and crew have tested positive for the new virus, raising fears that the incubation period for the virus may be longer than originally thought. Two of the Britons who were not on the evacuation flight, Sally and David Abel, are being treated in a Japanese hospital Separately, four Britons from the ship who recently tested positive for the new coronavirus were not on Saturday's repatriation flight. They included David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, who have since been diagnosed with pneumonia, according to their family and are being treated in a Japanese hospital. Relatives said the couple are both ""having a really tough time"" and feel ""very much in the dark"" in terms of treatment, adding that they are awaiting further tests. The new strain of coronavirus, which originated last year in Hubei province in China, causes a respiratory disease called Covid-19. China has seen more than 76,000 infections and 2,442 deaths. The virus has since spread to at least 11 other countries. Over the weekend, Italian officials imposed strict quarantine restrictions in two northern ""hotspot"" regions close to Milan and Venice, as the number of coronavirus cases soared to 130 - the worst outbreak in Europe. Italian officials have cut short the Venice Carnival as they try to control what is now the worst outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe Venice Carnival has been cut short, schools and museums closed and sporting events suspended as authorities struggle to contain the spread of the virus. About 50,000 people cannot enter or leave several towns in Veneto and Lombardy for the next two weeks without special permission. Three people have died. Elsewhere, authorities in South Korea and Iran are battling to control rising numbers of infections. South Korea has raised its coronavirus alert to the ""highest level"". The UK Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to the cities of Daegu and Cheongdo. Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan have closed their borders with Iran, where eight people are known to have died. Officials have ordered the closure of schools, universities and cultural centres in 14 provinces. Have you been affected by the latest developments around Covid-19?

"Weeks after reports of a mysterious new virus began to emerge in the central Chinese province of Hubei, the authorities there suddenly changed how they determined who was infected. It led to a significant spike in numbers - only because doctors are now counting patients who are diagnosed in a clinic and not just those who have taken the test. But in those early days, the rapid spread of the virus through the city of Wuhan, combined with a shortage of hospital beds, meant some didn't get the treatment they needed. Two Wuhan residents told the BBC about the harrowing experience of trying to get care for their loved-ones in a city overwhelmed by sickness. Huang was raised by his grandparents after his parents passed away when he was a child. All he ever wanted was to provide for his grandparents, both in their 80s, so that they could enjoy retirement in bliss, he says. But in the space of just over a fortnight, his grandfather was killed by the coronavirus, and now his grandmother is in a critical condition. Sharp increase in coronavirus deaths and cases Will someone develop a coronavirus vaccine? The Chinese doctor who tried to warn about coronavirus Huang's grandparents started to have respiratory symptoms on 20 January. They couldn't go to a hospital until 26 January as it was difficult for them to get around after Wuhan was put into effective lockdown on 23 January, with public transport suspended. They were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus on 29 January, but were only admitted to a hospital three days later. But the hospital was so full that there were no empty beds. His grandparents had high fever and difficulty breathing, but were only offered seats in the corridor. He begged the hospital staff and he managed to get a long chair and a folding bed. ""There's no doctor or nurse in sight,"" Huang wrote in his diary, ""Hospital without doctors is just like a graveyard."" The night before his grandfather passed away, Huang was with his grandparents in the corridor. He kept chatting with his grandmother so that she wouldn't know that his grandfather was experiencing delirium, he says. A bed was finally available three hours before his grandfather died. Huang was by his bedside till the last minute. He wrote on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform: ""Grandpa, please rest in peace. There's no pain in heaven."" ""Many patients died without the company of family members and couldn't even get a last look at each other."" His grandmother is battling for her life in the hospital, and he spends as much time as possible with her. ""There's no effective medicine. Doctors told me not to hold out hope, and she can only get through by herself,"" he said. ""We can only let fate decide."" Since 7 February Xiao Huang has himself been feeling unwell and has now been quarantined for two weeks in a hotel. In early January, Da Chun's mother developed a fever. The family was not particularly alarmed, thinking that it was just a cold. They had heard little about the mysterious disease that was quietly spreading in the city of 11 million. But her fever did not subside for a week, even though she received injections from a community clinic. On 20 January, the same day when Chinese authorities admitted that the coronavirus is transmittable between humans, he brought his mother to an outpatient clinic designated for people with fever. After looking at the chest scan and results of the blood test, the doctor told them that his mother had been infected with the novel coronavirus. ""Till this day, I am still in disbelief,"" says Da Chun. But more bad news came. The doctor said his mother, 53, could not be admitted to a hospital because they didn't have the test kits to confirm the diagnosis. The test kits were only available at eight designated hospitals in late January. ""A doctor of a designated hospital told me they don't have the right to hospitalise my mum. It's the local health commission that allocates beds for confirmed cases,"" the 22-year-old says. ""So, doctors can't do [the] coronavirus test to confirm my mom as [an] infected case, and can't offer her a bed."" Da Chun says his mother was not an isolated case. In a chat group with more than 200 members on the popular messaging app WeChat for families of infected patients people shared similar stories. His brother would queue up at hospitals to check if there were beds available. He would go to the clinic with his mother so that she could get drips. But during these visits, they saw patients pass away inside observation rooms before getting tested or admitted. ""The dead bodies were wrapped and taken away by parlour staff,"" he says. ""I don't know if they will be counted as deaths [caused by the novel coronavirus]."" His mother's condition continued to worsen. She started to cough blood, and there was blood in her urine. On 29 January, his mother was finally admitted to a hospital, but he says she received no treatment and the hospital did not have sufficient equipment during the first days when she was first hospitalised. But he's not giving up hope that his mother will recover. Reporting by the BBC's Grace Tsoi. Illustrations by Gerry Fletcher.

"The UK is in the middle of what many describe as a housing crisis. Demand for homes has increased, fuelled in part by a rising population, but construction work has failed to keep up with the pace of that demand. This BBC Briefing estimates that the size of the housing supply gap - the difference between the available stock and the number of homes needed for everyone to have a decent place to live - may be in excess of one million homes. What to do about it is a question that divides policymakers, economists and the public. There is no single easy solution - it all depends on your circumstances and where you live. The situation is made more complicated because responsibility for housing policy is spilt between different bodies. And over the past 40 years, direct government powers to increase housing supply have given way to more private sector involvement. At the same time, public awareness of housing as an issue is increasing. Homelessness and overcrowding are on the rise, home ownership has been declining and there is a shortage of social homes. That's why housing has been chosen as the third topic for the BBC Briefing - a series of in-depth online guides analysing the big issues in the news.

"Part ofLearn & revise Save to My Bitesize But is it true, and how did we get to this point? What can be done to sort things out? If youâve ever been confused by words like buy-to-let, housing gap or the property ladder, the latestBBC Briefing can help you navigatethe UKâs housing landscape.From a quick history of our urban landscapes to what the 2008 crisis meant for first-time buyers, weâve picked six key facts to get you started on one of the hottest topics of our times. The Industrial Revolution saw millions of people move to cities. Thanks to rising wages and better health, the UK population went from 11 million in 1800 to 37 million in 1900. But the housing supply couldnât keep up, leading to people from the working class living in overcrowded tenements and slums. From access to green areas to social housing, campaigners and social reformers, like Octavia Hill, championed projects to change urban settings so they could be more liveable. At the same time, thanks to the spread of the railway, the burgeoning middle class âescapedâ to the suburbs. At the start of the 20th Century, rising affluence and middle-class aspirations helped shape what many still think of today as the âidealâ dwelling: a home with its own garden, in a leafy suburban area from which work can be accessed via an easy commute. What came next? The development of model villages, an evolution of social housing and a great change in the owning v renting ratio. To find out more about all this, as well as how our housing stock and homeowning numbers compare to the rest of Europe, head tothis section of the Briefing. At the time of writing, 140,000 families â approximately 320,000 people â are officially deemed homeless in the UK. But of these, just over 5,000 are rough sleepers. Sofa-surfing, staying with friends or family, squatting, living in a hostel or shelter are just some of the conditions someone can be experiencing to be defined as âhomelessâ, and some of these are not included in official homelessness counts. In England alone, 210,000 children are officially estimated to be homeless, according to the Childrenâs Commissioner for England. To read more about the causes of homelessness and how public policy has affected figures, readthis section of the Briefing. A walk around Helsinki might reveal something unlikely to be witnessed in any other major European city: there are virtually no rough sleepers in Finlandâs capital. In 2007, the Nordic country created its âHousing Firstâ initiative â all homeless people are given permanent accommodation, as well as help and support, no questions asked. Similar schemes are being trialled in the UK, but their success is still being assessed.Click hereto read about them. The 2008 global financial crash was largely triggered by the low cost of borrowing, which meant people took out mortgages they couldnât really afford. As a result, getting a mortgage became much harder â for example, while before banks would be happy to lend to someone with a small deposit or no deposit at all, since 2008 many lenders have required deposits as high as 25% of a property price, on top of other conditions that have to be met for a mortgage to be granted. That, paired with low interest rates on savings and other factors, has affected first-time buyers massively. Research suggests that one in three millennials (the generation born between 1980 and 2000) will still be renting beyond retirement. Due to high rent prices and the difficulties in saving up to buy a home, there are now 500,000 more 20-25 year-olds living with their parents than in 1996. Read more about what housing prospects look like for young people, including the ways in which some are trying to save up for a house, inthis section of the Briefing. Until 1989, the prices at which landlords could let their properties were capped. The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act 1915 was introduced to prevent landlords from profiteering during the war. Its principles continued to exist in various forms for decades. But while it benefitted tenants in some ways, capping rents had a flipside: the private rental sector fell from 90% of the housing stock in 1915 to 10% by 1991. However, housing policy professor Peter Kemp has explained that, while the impact of rent control measures on the private rental sector was significant, it wasnât the only factor that led to its decline. This section of the Briefingtells all you need to know about the challenges faced by both tenants and landlords in the private rental sector. Based on a 2019 study on England, BBC Briefing estimates the whole of the UK has a housing gap of approximately 1.2 million homes. This is the number of homes that would be needed to ensure that everyone has a âdecentâ (i.e. of a good standard, liveable) home. Forecasts show around four million extra homes will be needed by 2035, due to estimated population growth and the rate of housing completions. Now, in 2017-2018, 275,000 new homes were built in the UK. If we were to continue building new dwellings at that rate, the housing gap could be closed by 2035. However, itâs not just about building â we need to make sure we meet all sorts of housing needs. To understand more about what this means,read this part of the Briefing.

"Young adults are detained under the Mental Health Act at a higher rate than other age groups. Stacey Dooley meets the nurses taking care of them Last year, almost 50,000 adults in England were detained under theMental Health Act,externalâ or ""sectioned"", as it's commonly known. The highest number of detentions was in the18-34,externalage group, and in a new BBC Three documentary, Stacey Dooley joins the nurses at Springfield University Hospital, south-west London, to find out what it's like to be on the front line of mental health care. It's not uncommon to face severely distressed, confused and even violent patients, who come to the hospital during a crisis. Sometimes, they don't understand what's happening or why they're there, but other times they're just desperate for a way to cope. Some people might be sectioned for their safety, while others come through the Lotus Assessment Suite â here, they'll be supported by nurses for up to 48 hours while plans are made for how best to treat them. They may have come to the suite voluntarily, or been brought in by relatives or friends. The nurses here try to help the patient in their own home if they can â for instance, by referring them to the home treatment team. Stacey, Guan and other staff members check in on a patient Stacey shadows mental health nurses as they find themselves having to make quick-fire decisions about the patients' well-being â sometimes inadvertently upsetting the patient more â and meets some of the patients to hear their stories. Everyone's mental health struggle is different, and the staff know there's no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to treatment. But what's it really like working in this often challenging and upsetting, but rewarding, area of nursing? Three nurses, who appear in the documentary, tell us. Polly, 28, formerly deputy unit manager, Lotus Assessment Suite, now Team Manager of the Richmond Home Treatment Team, South West London and St Georgeâs Mental Health NHS Trust Polly faces difficult choices about a patient's treatment ""I wouldn't say I've really struggled with my mental health to the point that I've had to seek help, but I've experienced some similar difficulties to my patients. There's nothing wrong with relating to someone on a personal level and I think that's sometimes what they want: to hear that it's OK that they're struggling, and if I was in their position I might feel the same. There's nothing to say I couldn't end up in the position my patients are. ""We see young adults who've gone through their lives managing really well, but have had a series of unfortunate life events. They never thought mental health issues would happen to them, but it could happen to anyone. I think campaigns around talking are really important, but talking on its own won't get us where we need to be â we need to be self-aware that no-one can escape mental health problems. We wouldn't be shocked if our physical health deteriorated if we didn't look after ourselves, and it's the same for mental health. Things like sleep, exercise and having structure are really important in maintaining it. ""Patients start their journey in the Lotus suite, and once they're discharged, the home treatment team provide help in a crisis. Keeping people in hospital isn't always the best thing, because they're not learning to cope on their own. We want to empower the patients to manage by themselves, but that doesn't mean it isn't a scary feeling sending someone home if they say they don't feel safe. It's a skill to compartmentalise things and not think about it when you go home â you get better the longer you've done it, but it is hard. Itâs the best feeling if I meet someone at work in an acute crisis, then later on a day off I see them walking down the road, and you hope, in the nicest way, that you donât have to see them in hospital again."" Guan, 24, former healthcare assistant at the Lotus Assessment Suite. He no longer working for the South West London and St Georgeâs Mental Health NHS Trust, Springfield University Hospital, and is training to become a psychotherapist Guan was attacked by a patient ""I have been attacked at work. Weirdly, I didn't find myself panicking, because you go into a mindset of damage limitation. Someone has their hand around my neck, but all I'm thinking about is how to de-escalate it. It isn't until afterwards that I started thinking about how it was scary. Whenever I talk to people, they say they couldn't do it and it sounds really hard, but honestly, I think most people could. You don't have to deal with these situations every day, but when you do, you find you have capacity to do it. I think I surprised myself sometimes. That's something your training can't prepare you for, it's all instinct. ""Dealing with irate or confused patients is something that comes with time, but you'd be surprised how many things you just find yourself doing instinctively. You're there to take care of people, so it is hard making a decision if they don't know what's going on. Feeling like you're doing something against their will isn't nice. ""I've had my own mild mental health struggles, and my thinking was that, in some sense, by talking to other people about their problems I'd also be working through my own. You do see yourself reflected back in others, but what I really didn't expect when I started was the diversity of experience. Being depressed or anxious isn't some universal thing â it's tied up with everyone's personal situations. You might think being around people with mental health issues would be difficult if you've experienced them yourself, but I didn't find that. Focusing on other people and the world around me helped me not to retreat into my own mind."" Lottie, 24, charge nurse at the Lotus Assessment Suite, South West London and St Georgeâs Mental Health NHS Trust, Springfield University Hospital Lottie found her first months in the job the hardest ""Mental health nursing wasn't always something I wanted to do. In my late teens, there were some people in my life who were struggling with their own mental health, and I was told by them that I was a good source of support. That was my turning point â I didn't really know what to do as a career, but I went down the mental health nursing route, training for three years, and I've never looked back. ""In training, you spend one and a half of those years on placements. We were told that the first six months in the job after qualifying would be the hardest, and honestly, I learnt more in those first months than I did in my training, because suddenly it's so real, and there's nobody overlooking you anymore. ""You know you're going to come across very distressed patients self-harming, but I don't think I was fully prepared for that. Within the first couple of weeks of qualifying, I was dealing with people showing self-harming behaviours, and suddenly had to put everything I learnt into practice. ""You don't have time to panic â it's all instinct. It's when I got home later that it all caught up with me. My way of letting things out was having a cry, and at first I felt so weak, but I had to learn that's nothing to be ashamed of. I found it quite difficult at the beginning to make sure I was in a good place mentally to help my patients, but I felt really supported by everyone else at work. I had to find effective ways to deal with my emotions outside of work, like going to an art gallery or the gym â I like to spend my days off looking after myself and giving myself space to breathe.""

"These houses in Broomhill are the latest addition to Bristol council's housing stock English councils are building homes again, on a scale not seen in decades, constructing an estimated 13,000 dwellings over a 12 month period. That's tiny compared with housing need, however many councils have plans to expand, so could this be a sign of the return of the council house? Right To Buy, one of Margaret Thatcher's most popular policies,external, gave hundreds of thousands of families the chance to own their council home and transformed their financial status, but it resulted in local authorities losing an estimated two million dwellings. Long-term tenants can still buy their homes at a discount, and councils only get to keep a third of the proceeds. In 2017-18 there werenearly half a million vulnerable households on waiting lists for social housing,external. A short stroll from the river Avon in Bristol, overlooking a children's playground, there is a cluster of new brick-built homes. With double-height windows on the upper floors, they look like an upmarket private development. But they're the latest addition to Bristol council's housing stock. ""It's a dream house,"" one tenant said. The single mother, who only moved in two months ago had been living with her baby in a one-bedroom flat in a tower block. Now she has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a garden. Her baby has his own room, and loves playing in the garden too. She said: ""He's so much happier here."" But in her view, more houses are urgently needed. There's an acute housing shortage in Bristol, with 13,000 families on the council's waiting list. Within three years the local authority aims to be the biggest developer in the city. The council has completed 200 homes and has plans for a further 900. ""We haven't built like this since the 70s,"" said Councillor Paul Smith, Cabinet Member for Housing. Councillor Paul Smith says Bristol City council has not ""built like this since the 70s"" However, not all the homes will be socially rented council housing. Aston Rise, the biggest development so far, 80 of the 130 homes will be sold to private buyers in order to fund the project. Some of the council houses in the heart of the estate have views of the Clifton Suspension Bridge, and could be attractive for a long-term tenant to buy. In the past, Mr Smith has been highly critical of Right to Buy but he said the council had no choice but to keep building. ""We've seen already how our new housing has transformed people's lives, the lives of their children."" Professor Janice Morphet concluded councils in England had built or acquired more than 13,000 homes over a period of a year Last year, Professor Janice Morphet of the Bartlett School of Planning at University College London asked all councils in England about their housing plans. She concluded they had built or acquired more than 13,000 homes over a period of 12 months. These are a mixture of different tenures - some traditional social rented housing, others for sale or at a higher rent. Most of these do not appear on official government statistics. ""That's partly because councils are just getting going,"" she said - and partly because of the different routes they use. According to her research, both Conservative and Labour councils are building. Nearly 80% of them have set up companies to do this. If they build houses through these companies, rather than using their own Housing Revenue Account, they are not eligible for Right to Buy. Becontree was once described as the biggest council estate in Europe, the size of a small town, with 100,000 people. Now 80% of the houses have been sold through Right to Buy and the local authority, Barking and Dagenham, has what local politicians see as a housing crisis. The council has one of the most ambitious building programmes through its company Be First. Council leader Darren Rodwell said he hoped to see the equivalent of ""two new Becontrees"" over the next 20 years. But they will not be traditional council estates: there will be a mix of tenures, in different locations. Some new rented homes will come from deals with private landlords who ""build to rent"". Barking and Dagenham Council hopes to build the equivalent of ""two new Becontrees"" over the next 20 years Mr Rodwell is confident these new dwellings will not be eligible for Right To Buy, despite the council's role. ""You use the protection of the private sector to deliver what I see as the goals of a 21st Century community,"" he said. However, government policy is to encourage home ownership. It supports Right to Buy, the Help to Buy policy which assists first time buyers to purchase new homes, and is now consulting on a new ""First Homes"" policy. This would offer a further discount to home buyers, and be paid for through contributions that housing developers already make through the planning system: currently this often pays for social or affordable homes. Some MPs are critical of the councils' approach. The Conservative Bob Blackman said more social housing was urgently needed, and it was good that councils were building again. But he said he thought it was ""fundamentally wrong"" they were using their own companies to prevent them being sold to tenants. He has asked the government to investigate. Mr Blackman said it was good that more social housing was being built: he thought authorities should keep more of the proceeds from sales, and use that to build more, ""so that we have a virtuous circle"". ""We continue to provide new social housing in this country and as people improve their circumstances, they have the right to own that property and more people can move into the property that's been developed."" The Ministry for Housing said it was ""important that social housing tenants have the opportunity to become home-owners"" and, while housing companies can be an effective way to deliver new homes, ""we would expect them to offer an opportunity for tenants to become homeowners"".

"Zoe McKendree: ""You can't really present yourself best for an interview if you're sleeping on a friend's sofa"" Hoping to buy a home? You'll have to get across the UK's huge housing gap. Researchers have used the averages of recent studies to estimate the possible scale of the current shortage, which will grow as the UK population increases in size. This gap - the difference between the current housing stock and the number needed for everyone to have a decent home to live in - is more than one million homes, according to theBBC Housing Briefing,external. A lot of the pressure from the gap falls on people renting privately. Zoe McKendree, 33, spends more than a third of her pay on rent for her shared flat in Brixton, south London. She dreams of the keys to a home of her own but that is a distant prospect. Instead, she has had to contend with what she said were ""callous"" landlords and escalating costs. She has also experienced multiple no-fault evictions, where private landlords evict tenants at short notice without a good reason. Zoe says: ""I can't do things like buy a car, which I would really like to. I can't move out. I have to still be in a flatshare. ""I also keep getting evicted through no fault of my own, and each time that costs me over a thousand pounds. So every time I save money, which I could put towards a deposit, it's gone."" The government has said itintends to ban no-fault evictions in England. The council house may be seeing a revival 'Why I don't want to live in a house' Where can I afford to live? No-fault evictions to be banned In a poll of more than 2,000 people for the Affordable Housing Commission, 13% of adults said their mental health was affected by their housing situation. Looking just at those in unaffordable housing - costing more than a third of income - produced a greater level of concern. Twenty-five percent of the sample said their mental health had suffered. That's potentially millions of people. Despite having a good job with a charity, Zoe feels her quality of life has hardly improved since her early 20s. The BBC's Housing Briefing estimates that we have built 1.2 million fewer homes than we should have She adds: ""It makes me feel really anxious - it made me very depressed. It made it really difficult to look for work because I had so much of my mental time worrying about where I was going to live. ""You can't really present yourself best for an interview if you're sleeping on a friend's sofa and you're really worried you're going to be homeless."" Behind the stress is a shortage of places to live. The BBC's Housing Briefing estimates that we have built 1.2 million fewer homes than we should have, and the need for more homes is increasing. The calculations suggest it will take at least 15 years at current building rates to close the gap, and that not enough of what is being built is affordable. Hannah Clark from Oxfordshire, now aged 32, has been saving since she was 14 in the hope of being able to put down a deposit on something affordable. After her father had a stroke, she realised, as a teenager, there would be no help from the bank of mum and dad. ""I very rarely even now spend anything on myself,"" she says. ""There's a sense of guilt, because I have to save for a roof over my head. I have to have security for my future."" In contrast to Zoe, Hannah has been living rent free with family members, currently her sister, while she puts money aside. It sounds an easier route, but Hannah says her mental health has been affected. ""If you're living under someone else's roof you're constantly under their rules and therefore you can't have a relationship really with anyone. You can't invite them back,"" she explains. ""It's quite lonely, there's lots of pressure."" Hannah Clark first began saving for a home when she was 14 The Affordable Housing Commission found that more than half of 18 to 24-year-olds live with family, and 18% are still doing so as 25 to 34-year-olds. At the same time, government statistics show that the number of young adults living with parents is on the rise. Hannah has managed to build up a nest egg and aims to use it for the deposit on a small studio flat. She has been working for a publishing company and running a small business on the side selling illustrations. But she says the challenge of getting her own home has been a constant stress. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Since 2010 this government has delivered over 464,000 new affordable homes, including 114,000 social homes. In addition to this, the social housing waiting list has decreased by 40% since 2012. ""Last year we delivered more homes than any year in the last 30 years and have committed to delivering a million more in this parliament. ""We have also abolished the council borrowing cap so local authorities are able to continue to build more social homes, giving families the chance to find somewhere that is safe and secure.""
