"The public have been warned to stay vigilant to criminals selling fake coronavirus-related products. The Local Government Association said some councils have seen a ""significant surge"" in reports of scams by those seeking to exploit virus fears. More than 500,000 sub-standard masks were seized by a London council, while other criminals have attempted to trick people into giving personal details. The LGA is calling on the public to report scams to their local council. Fraudsters are seeking to take advantage of public fears by selling bogus medical products and other counterfeit items. Victims lose thousands to fake puppy sales New mums targeted in breastfeeding photo scam Scammers use coronavirus 'hook' to target victims The LGA - which represents councils in England and Wales - said criminals have been preying on vulnerable and older people who are self-isolating. In one case, a woman in her 80s answered the door to a man who demanded Â£220 to complete a health and safety check. Meanwhile, a telephone conman is being investigated after posing as a Swindon Council worker sorting lockdown food parcels, in a bid to obtain a pensioner's personal details. A car repair garage was reported after allegedly trying to sell coronavirus testing kits to customers. In Ealing, 2,600 illegal bottles of hand sanitiser as well as 500,000 substandard face masks were taken off the market by the local council, according to the LGA.

Residents are being tricked into buying goods online, door-to-door, by phone, text and email, the LGA said, with councils advising people not to accept services from strangers or cold callers. Simon Blackburn, chairman of the LGA's Safer and Stronger Communities Board, warned the public to be ""cautious"", adding: ""If something doesn't seem right or sounds too good to be true, don't hesitate to end a phone call, bin a letter, delete an email or shut the door."" He advised people to report scams to avoid others becoming victims of these ""despicable crimes"" and so fraudsters could be brought to justice, with councils seeking ""the toughest penalties"". It comes after the National Crime Agency (NCA) warned thevirus was increasingly being used as a ""hook to commit fraud""and that such scams were ""likely to increase"" during the pandemic. And it's not just bogus health products being sold by fraudsters. Some people hoping to buy kittens and puppies during the lockdown arebeing conned with fake online advertisements, according to Action Fraud,with victims losing more than Â£280,000 in two months.

"Terry Clark fought in the Battle of Britain in summer 1940 One of the last survivors of the Battle of Britain, Flight Lieutenant Terry Clark, has died aged 101. Mr Clark, originally from Croydon, had been living at a North Yorkshire care home where he died on Thursday, the eve of the 75th anniversary of VE Day. His death leaves John ""Paddy"" Hemingway as the last member of ""The Few"" who took to the skies in summer 1940. Mr Clark served as a radar operator during World War Two, defending the UK against Luftwaffe attacks. The Battle of Britain led to the deaths of 544 RAF pilots and aircrew out of a group of 3,000. Their bravery and sacrifice in withstanding the greater numbers of German pilots of the Luftwaffe and a possible invasion was recognised by then Prime Minister Winston Churchill. ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few,"" he told MPs. RAF Benevolent Fund controller Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot said: ""Our condolences go to Terry's family and friends at this sad time. ""This news is especially poignant as we remember the bravery and sacrifice of all those who fought for us today, the 75th anniversary of VE Day. The RAF Benevolent Fund said Mr Clark ""answered their country's call without question"" ""Terry belonged to a generation of servicemen and women who answered their country's call without question. ""We owe a debt of gratitude to every one of them and their legacy must be to remember their service."" She added: ""John 'Paddy' Hemingway is now the last surviving member of The Few and in September we will mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the battle. ""The RAF Benevolent Fund will be paying tribute to those pilots and air crew who 'gave so much to so many'."" The Battle of Britain Memorial said Mr Clark joined No 615 Squadron of the Auxiliary Air Force at Kenley in March 1938 as an aircrafthand, before training to become an air gunner, flying Hawker Hectors on Army Co-operation duties. He joined No 219 Squadron at Catterick on 12 July 1940, two days into the Battle of Britain, and later trained on radar as a Radio Observer, flying in Beaufighters.

"UK airlines say they have been told the government will bring in a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the UK from any country apart from the Republic of Ireland in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. Industry body Airlines UK said the policy needed ""a credible exit plan"" and should be reviewed weekly. People arriving in the UK would have to self-isolate at a private residence. Government and aviation sources told BBC News that the quarantine would mean people might be expected to provide an address when they arrive at the border. It is not clear how long the new travel restriction would be in place and whether non-UK residents would be allowed to stay in rented private accommodation. ""We need to see the details of what they are proposing"", said Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, EasyJet and other UK-based airlines, in a statement. It is not clear whether there are plans to quarantine people arriving to the UK via other modes of transport. Eurostar and P&O ferries declined to comment, while other firms have not yet responded to the BBC's queries. What do I need to know if I decide to fly? UK airlines warn quarantine will 'kill air travel' Passengers told to wear gloves at some UK airports Aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst is expected to clarify the policy to airline and airport representatives in a conference call scheduled for Sunday morning. A spokeswoman for Belfast International Airport said it had written to the government to clarify what the plans were - adding that the airport had not been consulted on the move. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said Labour had been asking the government for weeks to clarify ""mixed messages"" about what people should do on arrival to the UK. ""People have been brought back in relatively large numbers and many of them are telling us that they have no information or advice given out about what they should be doing when they get home,"" she said. UK airports suggested that a quarantine ""would not only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy"". Karen Dee from the Airport Operators Association, which represents most UK airports, said the measure should be applied ""on a selective basis following the science"" and ""the economic impact on key sectors should be mitigated"". BBC News understands that key workers such as lorry drivers who transport goods and people working in the shipping industry would be exempt. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? A Heathrow spokesman said any measures agreed must be medically effective, meet public expectations and be deliverable by airports. ""We will continue to do everything we can to support the government in tackling the health crisis whilst keeping vital trading routes open for British businesses in every corner of the UK,"" he added. Last Sunday, Andrew Marr asked the transport secretary whether the UK would introduce a quarantine on people arriving in the UK. Grant Shapps said he was ""actively looking at these issues, right now, so that when we have infection rates within the country under control we're not importing"". He said it was important ""that we do ensure that the sacrifices, in a sense, social distancing, that we're asking the British people to make are matched by anyone who comes to this country"". A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We do not comment on leaks. The focus remains on staying at home to protect the NHS and save lives."" If a quarantine is needed now, some will question why it was not necessary weeks ago. Tens of thousands of people have flown into the UK during the pandemic, although the government says the vast majority were returning home.

"This video can not be played Silence falls around the country as people honour servicemen and women Extracts of Winston Churchill's VE Day speech have been broadcast to the nation, as part of the commemorations for the 75th anniversary. Britain's wartime leader spoke about a ""brief period of rejoicing"" amid ""toils and efforts"" in the replayed speech. Earlier, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall led a two-minute silence, and later the Queen will address a nation still in lockdown. Boris Johnson expressed ""eternal"" gratitude to the wartime generation. Victory in Europe Day marks the day in 1945 when Britain and its allies accepted the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, bringing the war in Europe to an end. Latest updates as nation marks VE Day in lockdown What is VE Day? In pictures: VE Day celebrations across the UK Nine Chelsea Pensioners die with Covid-19 This year's celebration is limited as the lockdown prompted by the coronavirus pandemic means there will be no large-scale street parties or parades. But at 15:00 BST, the same time that Winston Churchill addressed the nation on 8 May 1945, BBC One broadcast his words: ""We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing, but let us not forget for a moment the toils and efforts that lie ahead."" The commemorations began with a flypast over London by the Royal Air Force display team the Red Arrows, while RAF Typhoon jets flew over Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. The Red Arrows left their trademark red, white and blue trails as they soared over London Officers and soldiers of the Household Division maintained social distancing as they laid a wreath A Royal British Legion standard bearer as people mark the silence in Redcar, North Yorkshire Then, a piper played at the war memorial near Balmoral, where Prince Charles and Camilla laid flowers and led the country in silent remembrance. Left at the memorial with Camilla's bouquet was a message paying tribute to her father, Major Bruce Shand - who served with the 12th Royal Lancers during the war - and his regiment ""who fought so bravely to give us peace"". A gun salute from Edinburgh Castle marked the beginning and end of the silence, but crowds were absent from many war memorials as people reflected at home. Later, although large street parties were out of the question, some still managed to get out the bunting for a socially distanced celebration. This video can not be played The Red Arrows fly over London In a message, Mr Johnson referred to the virus outbreak, saying it ""demands the same spirit of national endeavour"" as shown during wartime. ""We can't hold the parades and street celebrations we enjoyed in the past, but all of us who were born since 1945 are acutely conscious that we owe everything we most value to the generation who won the Second World War,"" he said.

The local council says the lights are also to remind people ""that lighter times will come again"" Mr Johnson said: ""We survived and eventually triumphed thanks to the heroism of countless ordinary people, who may be elderly today, but who once carried the fate of freedom itself on their shoulders. ""Across the world, our soldiers, sailors and airmen fought the Nazis with courage, ingenuity and stubborn endurance. ""On the home front, women defended our cities against air raids, worked the factories, ran the hospitals and broke enemy codes.

Born in December 1939, Peter Stevens had no memory of his father, who had been fighting in North Africa and Italy for most of Peter's life. Peter told BBC Radio 5 Live about meeting his father for the first time, aged five: ""A face came at the back window, I looked up and my grandparents said, 'That's your father.' That's remained with me all my life, that moment."" He recalls walking with his father through the fields near High Wycombe, meeting his mother where she was working and walking back together, a family for the first time in five years.

"Katie Miller, seen here with Mike Pence's chief of staff, is married to Trump aide Stephen Miller A top aide to US Vice-President Mike Pence has tested positive for Covid-19 one day after another White House staff member was diagnosed with the virus. Mr Pence's press secretary Katie Miller tested positive on Friday, a day after President Donald Trump's valet. The White House has begun daily testing for Mr Pence and Mr Trump, and has claimed to be taking ""every single precaution to protect the president"". The US death toll is now nearing 80,000 and states are beginning to reopen. Six members of Mr Pence's team were abruptly taken off his plane, Air Force 2, after it was held on the tarmac outside Washington, DC for over an hour on Friday, as he prepared to travel to Iowa to meet religious leaders. The staff members had had recent contact with Mrs Miller, according to an unnamed US official cited in the media pool report. The president and vice-president had not. Mrs Miller is the wife of Trump aide Stephen Miller. Mr Trump visited the WWII memorial in Washington DC on Friday During a meeting with Republicans at the White House, Mr Trump told reporters:  ""She's a wonderful young woman, Katie."" ""She tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive."" When asked about the possibility of an outbreak in the White House, Mr Trump told reporters: ""All you can do is take precautions and do the best you can."" He also said he was correct not to wear a mask while visiting the World War II memorial in Washington for VE Day, because the elderly veterans there with him were ""far away"". ""Plus the wind was blowing so hard and such a direction that if the plague ever reached them, I'd be very surprised,"" he added. BBC White House correspondent Tara McKelvey The president has made it clear he does not like the way that a mask looks on him. He said last month that he believes wearing a mask would not make a good impression,externalon world leaders and others he meets. ""As I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens ... I don't see it for myself, I just don't,"" Trump told a journalist. For some, the president's refusal to wear a mask is more than a question of style. It is a political statement. Trump and the other officials at the White House want to give people the impression that the health crisis is under control and that soon the economy will be on back on track. Earlier on Friday, Mr Trump told Fox and Friends that his valets have already started wearing masks. A day earlier it emerged that a member of the US Navy who serves the president's food had tested positive for coronavirus. The president said that the individual had tested negative four days beforehand. ""This is why testing's not necessarily the answer,"" he said, though he noted staff would now be tested daily. ""Testing only goes so far."" Later, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the measures taken by the White House to keep officials safe. ""We've taken every single precaution to protect the president,"" Ms McEnany said. Mr Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, also told reporters: ""This is the safest place you can come to."" On Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first saliva test collection kit for home use. The government agency has been criticised for allowing the market to become flooded with test kits that sometimes show false results. According to the White House coronavirus task force, the US is testing about 248,000 people per day and has tested around 8.1m people so far.

"New York, the US financial capital, is also one of the US hotspots for the coronavirus The US unemployment rate has risen to 14.7%, with 20.5 million jobs lost in April, as the coronavirus pandemic devastated the economy. The rise means the jobless rate is now worse than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Since the pandemic began, the US has suffered its worst growth numbers in a decade and the worst retail sales report on record. Just two months ago, the unemployment rate was at 3.5%, a 50-year low. ""It is historically unprecedented,"" said economist Erica Groshen, former head of the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics, who now teaches at Cornell University. ""We have put our economy into a medically induced coma in order to heal it from the pandemic... and that has led to the most precipitous loss of jobs seen in any of the modern data."" The report from the Labor Department showed declines in every sector of the economy. Leisure and hospitality was hit especially hard, with payrolls falling by 7.7 million or 47%. Employers in education and health services cut 2.5 million positions, while retailers shed 2.1 million. The Labor Department said more than three-quarters of those without jobs described themselves as temporarily laid off, a sign that many of those currently without work are hopeful that the economy will be able to rebound. US to borrow record $3tn in pandemic spending Coronavirus job losses and 'the millennial curse' 'What I fear the most is not being able to survive' The Fed's four radical moves to save the economy But economists warned that the pandemic is likely to force major changes to businesses - such as limits on how many people may be in a restaurant at one time - that could reduce the need for workers. And the longer the shutdown lasts, the more likely it is that a business will not survive. ""Even a temporary layoff can turn into a permanent one if the business doesn't survive or if the business has to change its business model so dramatically that it needs different numbers or a different kind of worker,"" Ms Groshen said. The economic crisis is not unique to the US. In the UK,the Bank of England has warned of the sharpest recession on record, while Canada on Friday reported its unemployment rate had increased 5.2 percentage points to 13% last month. Statistics Canada estimated that about a third of the workforce was either out of work, or working less than half of their usual hours. In an appearance on the Fox News channel, US President Donald Trump shrugged off the 20.5 million jobs lost in the US as ""totally expected"" and ""no surprise"". ""Even the Democrats aren't blaming me for that. What I can do is I can bring it back,"" he said as the figures were released. But bankruptcies have already claimed retailers such as J Crew and Neiman Marcus, as well as many firms in the energy sector, where a collapse in oil prices, due in part to a pandemic-related drop in demand, has worsened the strains. The jobless rate for black workers is the highest since 2010, and is at a record among Hispanics While some states have already started to relax restrictions, re-starting the economy is likely to be difficult, as workers worry about the risk of infection and grapple with the impact of school closures. ""I'm not certain what's going to happen next,"" said Tanya Nikolaevskaya, a legal assistant in New York, who was furloughed last month, after working from home in March. Ms Nikolaevskaya hopes to return to what she described as her dream job, but she has a medical condition that makes her worried about infection and is a single mother, whose 8-year-old daughter will need care if schools do not reopen. ""It's all about, 'Is there childcare,'"" she said. ""If I will not have childcare, I will not be able to go back."" The number of people in the labor force - working or looking for work - fell 2.5% last month, to its lowest level since 1970, while those reporting reduced hours or an inability to find a full-time job nearly doubled. The Labor Department warned that the situation might be worse than estimated, pointing to the spike in the number of people who said they were employed but ""absent from work"". Including those responses suggests an unemployment rate closer to 20%, it said. Among black workers, the unemployment rate jumped to 16.7%, the highest since 2010. Among Hispanics, it surged to a record 18.9%, while it climbed to a lower - but still record-setting - 14.2% among white workers. Overall, the unemployment rate was the highest recorded in data back to 1948, while the over-the-month jobs decline was the largest reported in data back to 1939. ""The scale of the challenge cannot be overstated,"" said Robert Alster, head of investment services at wealth manager Close Brothers Asset Management.

Here are Friday's main headlines:   Reading has been one way to pass the time during lockdown for many - and an online ""Hobbitathon"" with Gollum actor Andy Serkis is helping thousands get through Monday. Serkis is reading The Hobbit live - and in its entirety - in an effort to raise money for charity. The 56-year-old began streaming his online performance of JRR Tolkien's 1937 novel at 10:00 BST. Fans have been watching the YouTube stream, with thousands of pounds raised for NHS Charities Together and Best Beginnings, according to The Hobbitathon's funding page. ""Thank you so much for joining me on this huge expedition we're about to go on in our living rooms,"" Serkis told viewers before he began the reading. Athletes will be hoping to compete in the Tokyo Paralympics next year Disability sport will have a important part to play in building a ""new normal"" when the coronavirus crisis eases, says the head of the International Paralympic Committee. The Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games was postponed until 2021 because of the pandemic, although IPC president Andrew Parsons insists it will not threaten the sport's future. ""We are looking at the positives, what the new world will be when it comes to inclusion and diversity,"" Parsons told BBC Sport. ""We donât want to go back to normal, normal has failed.  We want to build a new normal. ""We need a world that is built by all, for all, and I think the Paralympics will have a very strong message here."" Parsons also says there is ""a need for more discussion"" about the impact of Covid-19 on people with impairment and disability, adding the IPC is lobbying national governments to discuss the issue more. The Trump administration has announced that 20,000 undocumented migrants have been summarily expelled from the US since March. In a statement, US officials cite Trump's order issued in late March, which shut the US border with Canada and Mexico to limit the spread of the coronavirus. According to government figures, around 90% of migrants who entered the US in April have been deported. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Thousands of people have been riding bicycles through the
centre of Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, in protest against the government of
Prime Minister Janez Jansa. The protest organisers accused Mr Jansa of violating human
rights under the pretext of taking action against Covid-19. They said this
included increasing police powers, inciting hatred against migrants and making
personal attacks on journalists. Environmental organisations also joined the protest. They
say the government has inserted clauses into emergency legislation which would
prevent NGOs from taking part in consultations about construction
projects. Katie Miller with the Vice-President's Chief of Staff Marc Short The top aide to Mike Pence, whose positive test forced an abrupt change to the US vice-president's travel plans to Iowa today, has been named as his press secretary Katie Miller. It comes day after another White House workers tested positive for the virus. When asked about the possibility of an outbreak in the White House, Mr Trump told reporters: ""All you can do is take precautions and do the best you can.""

US-Canada border. Canada requires citizens to live in the country for at least
six months out of the year to maintain health benefits, and many Canadians have
returned out of fear their benefits would run out while abroad, leaving their
spouses behind. The border has been closed to all non-essential travel since 18 March.
Exceptions are supposed to be made for immediate family of returning Canadian
citizens, but it's up to the discretion of border security.   Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent UK airlines say they have been told the government will bring in a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the UK from any country apart from the Republic of Ireland in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. People arriving in the UK would have to self-isolate at a private residence.
Government and aviation sources told BBC News that the quarantine would mean people might be expected to provide an address at the border. It is not clear how long the new travel restriction would be in place and whether non-UK residents would be allowed to stay in rented private accommodation. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world have pushed countries into crisis-mode, prompting a massive rescue spending in an effort to soften the blow from what is expected to be the worst economic contraction since the 1930s. In many countries, the aid is targeted at the poor or people working in the informal economy who are unlikely to get assistance through other programmes. In other cases, they are on the condition that a person's job has been affected by shutdowns. Canada, for example, is providing C$2,000 (Â£1,150; $1,400) per month for up to four months to those who have lost income due to the pandemic, while Costa Rica is funding a monthly allowance of $220 (Â£177) for people who have lost their jobs due to the virus. All Americans earning under $99,000 - an estimated 90% of households - are due to receive as much as $1,200 (Â£964) per adult, while South Korea's central government is sending cheques of up to KRW 1 million (Â£659; $820) to families in the bottom 70% income bracket. Hong Kong in February announced a handout of $10,000 Hong Kong dollar ($1,280; Â£985) per adult; Japan is sending its citizens JPY 100,000 (Â£752; $931) per person, and Singapore $S600 (Â£340; $422). Read more: Coronavirus bailouts: Which country has the most generous deal? Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent There has been more evidence this week of the mounting economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to contain it. In the US, another three million people claimed unemployment benefits and the unemployment rate has soared to almost 15% - the highest ever report in data first published in 1948.  The European Commission, in its latest forecast, predicts a decline in economic activity of 7.5% this year with what it calls an incomplete recovery in 2021. That would leave the EU economy still smaller than it was last year.  It is now beyond question that the US, the EU and most of the world are in the throes of a very sharp recession. There are also concerns about just how convincing the recovery from it will be. The longer the situation drags on, the more risk there is that businesses deprived of revenue will be unable to survive. For workers, longer periods of unemployment can make it harder to get new jobs. If, however, the health crisis abates soon and the commercial world can safely return to relative normality fairly quickly, the lasting economic damage may be more moderate. Women in Italy havedemanded a greater rolein the country's official response to the coronavirus outbreak. The Civil Defence's daily briefings on the crisis are chaired by men. No women were included in Italy's 20-member technical scientific committee (CTS) - a group of experts advising the government during the crisis. In response, Italian women started a social media campaign to call for better representation. A petition started by the Dateci Voce (""Give us voice"") group has been signed more than 4,500 times, including by MPs, scientist and researchers. Italy is one of three countries - along with the United States and UK - to record more than 30,000 deaths. The UK and the EU must continue to co-operate in the fight against the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have agreed. The pair spoke on Friday to discuss the response to the pandemic. ""Both leaders welcomed the good co-operation between the UK and the EU on the coronavirus, including the global effort to repatriate citizens,"" Mr Johnson's office said. The prime minister congratulated the EU on the 7.4bn euros raised bythe pledging conference it hostedon Monday, while Ms Von der Leyen thanked the UK for its Â£388m pledge for vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen met at Downing Street in January Deadly accidents involving children and firearms have gone up in the past two months, according to US researchers. It comes after a record spike in gun sales while lockdown measures were first going into place around the US. Fatal unintentional shootings jumped by 43% in March and April compared to average gun deaths during the same two months in the past three years, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. ""We know that there are risks to having guns in the home, and with the surge in gun sales in the last two months, it could create more opportunity for kids to gain access to guns and unintentionally hurt themselves or someone else,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of the group's volunteer network Moms Demand Action. ""The numbers show there's been an increase in these horrible shooting tragedies during the time the pandemic was at its peak."" Third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom faces the ""horrible"" task of euthanising his animals Tens of thousands of US pork producers are facing a stark reality: although demand for their products is high in the nation's grocery stores, they may have to euthanise and dispose of millions of pigs due to a breakdown in the American food supply chain. Although chicken and cattle farmers are facing a similar situation, as are milk and egg producers, because of the tight time frame between when a pig is born to when it is ready for slaughter, some of the most drastic actions are occurring on these farms first. According to the Minnesota Pork Producers Association, an estimated 10,000 pigs are being euthanised every day in the state. ""On the same day that we're euthanising pigs - and it's a horrible day - is the same day that a grocery store 10 miles away may not get a shipment of pork,"" says third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom. ""It's just that the supply chain is broken at this point.""

"Milan's mayor has threatened to close the popular Navigli district as crowds gather Italy has become the first country in the European Union to register more than 30,000 coronavirus-related deaths. It reported 243 new fatalities on Friday - down from 274 the day before - taking the total to 30,201. The daily number of confirmed new cases fell slightly to 1,327, bringing the total number of infections to 217,185. Restrictions have begun to ease around the county, but one doctor described the city of Milan as a ""time bomb"", according to local media. Italy has the third highest number of officially recorded coronavirus deaths in the world, after the United States and the UK - which is no longer a member of the EU. Britain passed the 30,000 mark on Wednesday. Spain is Europe's third worst-affected country with more than 26,000 deaths. Reality check: Can you compare the UK with Italy? Italy was the first country in Europe to impose a lockdown when coronavirus cases began to surface in northern regions in February. Some lockdown measures have been rolled back. This week, Italians have been able to exercise for the first time in weeks, as long as they respect rules on physical distance and wear masks where distancing is difficult. They are able to visit relatives - but not friends - within their region. Catholic churches are also preparing for the resumption of Mass on 18 May, but there will be strict social distancing and worshippers must wear face masks. Other faiths will also be allowed to hold religious services. More people have been out and about in Rome since restrictions were eased However, schools, cinemas and most shops will stay shut, and all public gatherings are still banned. Bars and restaurants are due to start allowing customers to sit at tables in June. While some restrictions remain in place, images shared on social media show people in busy areas ignoring distancing rules and not wearing protective masks, leading to an outcry. Massimo Galli, head of the infectious diseases department at Milan's Sacco hospital, told La Reppublica newspaper it was clear that lockdown easing ""may present problems"". He said: ""We have a very high number of infected people returning to circulation."" Coronavirus commissioner Angelo Borrelli warned the public that containment measures would ""be stiffened"" if the virus showed signs of taking off again. ""We are monitoring things carefully,"" he said on Thursday. This video can not be played ""We risked everything to survive"" - Naples resident Filomena Police in the capital Rome said they were setting up checkpoints on roads leading to the coast, lakes and tourist spots in the countryside over the weekend. They said they would also be monitoring areas where nightlife is popular. The Mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, issued an ""ultimatum"" on Friday after footage emerged of crowds of people - most of them young - adopting neither face masks or social distancing in the city's popular Navigli area. Milan, the capital of the Lombardy region, was the epicentre of the Italian outbreak. ""I will take measures, I will close the Navigli,"" Mr Sala threatened, describing the scenes as ""disgraceful"".

In another development, an Italian government agency has warned that the cash-starved tourism industry is vulnerable to incursions by mafia organisations as the lockdown eases. A report by the Covid-19 criminal infiltration monitoring body said the tourism and catering sectors would have a ""lack of liquidity that will expose them to loan-sharking"". It said the mafia groups would be looking to invest in struggling businesses such as hotels and restaurants with the aim of laundering money.

"Katie Miller, seen here with Mike Pence's chief of staff, is married to Trump aide Stephen Miller A top aide to US Vice-President Mike Pence has tested positive for Covid-19 one day after another White House staff member was diagnosed with the virus. Mr Pence's press secretary Katie Miller tested positive on Friday, a day after President Donald Trump's valet. The White House has begun daily testing for Mr Pence and Mr Trump, and has claimed to be taking ""every single precaution to protect the president"". The US death toll is now nearing 80,000 and states are beginning to reopen. Six members of Mr Pence's team were abruptly taken off his plane, Air Force 2, after it was held on the tarmac outside Washington, DC for over an hour on Friday, as he prepared to travel to Iowa to meet religious leaders. The staff members had had recent contact with Mrs Miller, according to an unnamed US official cited in the media pool report. The president and vice-president had not. Mrs Miller is the wife of Trump aide Stephen Miller. Mr Trump visited the WWII memorial in Washington DC on Friday During a meeting with Republicans at the White House, Mr Trump told reporters:  ""She's a wonderful young woman, Katie."" ""She tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive."" When asked about the possibility of an outbreak in the White House, Mr Trump told reporters: ""All you can do is take precautions and do the best you can."" He also said he was correct not to wear a mask while visiting the World War II memorial in Washington for VE Day, because the elderly veterans there with him were ""far away"". ""Plus the wind was blowing so hard and such a direction that if the plague ever reached them, I'd be very surprised,"" he added. BBC White House correspondent Tara McKelvey The president has made it clear he does not like the way that a mask looks on him. He said last month that he believes wearing a mask would not make a good impression,externalon world leaders and others he meets. ""As I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens ... I don't see it for myself, I just don't,"" Trump told a journalist. For some, the president's refusal to wear a mask is more than a question of style. It is a political statement. Trump and the other officials at the White House want to give people the impression that the health crisis is under control and that soon the economy will be on back on track. Earlier on Friday, Mr Trump told Fox and Friends that his valets have already started wearing masks. A day earlier it emerged that a member of the US Navy who serves the president's food had tested positive for coronavirus. The president said that the individual had tested negative four days beforehand. ""This is why testing's not necessarily the answer,"" he said, though he noted staff would now be tested daily. ""Testing only goes so far."" Later, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the measures taken by the White House to keep officials safe. ""We've taken every single precaution to protect the president,"" Ms McEnany said. Mr Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, also told reporters: ""This is the safest place you can come to."" On Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first saliva test collection kit for home use. The government agency has been criticised for allowing the market to become flooded with test kits that sometimes show false results. According to the White House coronavirus task force, the US is testing about 248,000 people per day and has tested around 8.1m people so far.

"UK airlines say they have been told the government will bring in a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the UK from any country apart from the Republic of Ireland in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. Industry body Airlines UK said the policy needed ""a credible exit plan"" and should be reviewed weekly. People arriving in the UK would have to self-isolate at a private residence. Government and aviation sources told BBC News that the quarantine would mean people might be expected to provide an address when they arrive at the border. It is not clear how long the new travel restriction would be in place and whether non-UK residents would be allowed to stay in rented private accommodation. ""We need to see the details of what they are proposing"", said Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, EasyJet and other UK-based airlines, in a statement. It is not clear whether there are plans to quarantine people arriving to the UK via other modes of transport. Eurostar and P&O ferries declined to comment, while other firms have not yet responded to the BBC's queries. What do I need to know if I decide to fly? UK airlines warn quarantine will 'kill air travel' Passengers told to wear gloves at some UK airports Aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst is expected to clarify the policy to airline and airport representatives in a conference call scheduled for Sunday morning. A spokeswoman for Belfast International Airport said it had written to the government to clarify what the plans were - adding that the airport had not been consulted on the move. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said Labour had been asking the government for weeks to clarify ""mixed messages"" about what people should do on arrival to the UK. ""People have been brought back in relatively large numbers and many of them are telling us that they have no information or advice given out about what they should be doing when they get home,"" she said. UK airports suggested that a quarantine ""would not only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy"". Karen Dee from the Airport Operators Association, which represents most UK airports, said the measure should be applied ""on a selective basis following the science"" and ""the economic impact on key sectors should be mitigated"".

""We will continue to do everything we can to support the government in tackling the health crisis whilst keeping vital trading routes open for British businesses in every corner of the UK,"" he added. Last Sunday, Andrew Marr asked the transport secretary whether the UK would introduce a quarantine on people arriving in the UK. Grant Shapps said he was ""actively looking at these issues, right now, so that when we have infection rates within the country under control we're not importing"". He said it was important ""that we do ensure that the sacrifices, in a sense, social distancing, that we're asking the British people to make are matched by anyone who comes to this country"". A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We do not comment on leaks. The focus remains on staying at home to protect the NHS and save lives."" If a quarantine is needed now, some will question why it was not necessary weeks ago.

"Nicola Sturgeon says she must extend the lockdown in Scotland to stop a resurgence of the virus. Because the rate of infection (the now famous R number) is still at or around one in Scotland, possibly slighter higher than in other parts of the UK, she says any easing of the current restrictions would be ""very very risky"" indeed. This may not be the same message we hear from Boris Johnson on Sunday. That means we could soon see different parts of the UK operating under different lockdown rules. 'Catastrophic mistake' to change lockdown message PM 'must show respect' to UK nations over lockdown Already there has been some variation between the UK's four nations. The Scottish government have advisedeveryone to wear a face covering in busy placeswhere social distancing is not possible, like on public transport or in supermarkets. All non essential building sites in Scotland have been closed but housebuilders have reopened sites in England. Nicola Sturgeon announcedschool closures before the UK government. And it is very likely that Scottish schools will return to normal operations after those in England. Despite these differences UK politicians often talk about a ""four nations"" approach to dealing with coronavirus. They seem to agree it is desirable that the whole of UK operates under the same rules. But it's clear that if they can't agree on what those rules should be then some divergence is inevitable. Nicola Sturgeon is obviously concerned that the prime minster may lift some lockdown restrictions earlier than she believes would be wise for Scotland These decisions are, she says, quite literally a matter of life and death. So she will not be rushed or pressured into moving more quickly than she believes is safe. Her view is that if we are to maintain a UK-wide approach then all parts of the UK will have to agree to move at the pace of the slowest nation. If the prime minister wants to move faster he can do so for England but he can't make any of the other UK nations do the same. Despite her caution Nicola Sturgeon has already made public more details of how lockdown could eventually be lifted. These include proposals for allowing more outdoor activities, allowing people to meet up with others from outside their households and getting the NHS back to normal operations, while simultaneously saying the rule for now remains ""Stay Home"". She doesn't seem to be concerned that this sends mixed messages about what we are and are not allowed to do. But if the restrictions diverge significantly across the country it may become more confusing. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Peter told BBC Radio 5 Live about meeting his father for the first time, aged five: ""A face came at the back window, I looked up and my grandparents said, 'That's your father.' That's remained with me all my life, that moment."" He recalls walking with his father through the fields near High Wycombe, meeting his mother where she was working and walking back together, a family for the first time in five years.

Here are Friday's main headlines:   Reading has been one way to pass the time during lockdown for many - and an online ""Hobbitathon"" with Gollum actor Andy Serkis is helping thousands get through Monday. Serkis is reading The Hobbit live - and in its entirety - in an effort to raise money for charity. The 56-year-old began streaming his online performance of JRR Tolkien's 1937 novel at 10:00 BST. Fans have been watching the YouTube stream, with thousands of pounds raised for NHS Charities Together and Best Beginnings, according to The Hobbitathon's funding page. ""Thank you so much for joining me on this huge expedition we're about to go on in our living rooms,"" Serkis told viewers before he began the reading. Athletes will be hoping to compete in the Tokyo Paralympics next year Disability sport will have a important part to play in building a ""new normal"" when the coronavirus crisis eases, says the head of the International Paralympic Committee. The Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games was postponed until 2021 because of the pandemic, although IPC president Andrew Parsons insists it will not threaten the sport's future. ""We are looking at the positives, what the new world will be when it comes to inclusion and diversity,"" Parsons told BBC Sport. ""We donât want to go back to normal, normal has failed.  We want to build a new normal. ""We need a world that is built by all, for all, and I think the Paralympics will have a very strong message here."" Parsons also says there is ""a need for more discussion"" about the impact of Covid-19 on people with impairment and disability, adding the IPC is lobbying national governments to discuss the issue more. The Trump administration has announced that 20,000 undocumented migrants have been summarily expelled from the US since March. In a statement, US officials cite Trump's order issued in late March, which shut the US border with Canada and Mexico to limit the spread of the coronavirus. According to government figures, around 90% of migrants who entered the US in April have been deported. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Thousands of people have been riding bicycles through the
centre of Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, in protest against the government of
Prime Minister Janez Jansa. The protest organisers accused Mr Jansa of violating human
rights under the pretext of taking action against Covid-19. They said this
included increasing police powers, inciting hatred against migrants and making
personal attacks on journalists. Environmental organisations also joined the protest. They
say the government has inserted clauses into emergency legislation which would
prevent NGOs from taking part in consultations about construction
projects. Katie Miller with the Vice-President's Chief of Staff Marc Short The top aide to Mike Pence, whose positive test forced an abrupt change to the US vice-president's travel plans to Iowa today, has been named as his press secretary Katie Miller.

US-Canada border. Canada requires citizens to live in the country for at least
six months out of the year to maintain health benefits, and many Canadians have
returned out of fear their benefits would run out while abroad, leaving their
spouses behind. The border has been closed to all non-essential travel since 18 March.
Exceptions are supposed to be made for immediate family of returning Canadian
citizens, but it's up to the discretion of border security.   Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent UK airlines say they have been told the government will bring in a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the UK from any country apart from the Republic of Ireland in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. People arriving in the UK would have to self-isolate at a private residence.
Government and aviation sources told BBC News that the quarantine would mean people might be expected to provide an address at the border. It is not clear how long the new travel restriction would be in place and whether non-UK residents would be allowed to stay in rented private accommodation. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world have pushed countries into crisis-mode, prompting a massive rescue spending in an effort to soften the blow from what is expected to be the worst economic contraction since the 1930s. In many countries, the aid is targeted at the poor or people working in the informal economy who are unlikely to get assistance through other programmes. In other cases, they are on the condition that a person's job has been affected by shutdowns. Canada, for example, is providing C$2,000 (Â£1,150; $1,400) per month for up to four months to those who have lost income due to the pandemic, while Costa Rica is funding a monthly allowance of $220 (Â£177) for people who have lost their jobs due to the virus. All Americans earning under $99,000 - an estimated 90% of households - are due to receive as much as $1,200 (Â£964) per adult, while South Korea's central government is sending cheques of up to KRW 1 million (Â£659; $820) to families in the bottom 70% income bracket. Hong Kong in February announced a handout of $10,000 Hong Kong dollar ($1,280; Â£985) per adult; Japan is sending its citizens JPY 100,000 (Â£752; $931) per person, and Singapore $S600 (Â£340; $422). Read more: Coronavirus bailouts: Which country has the most generous deal? Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent There has been more evidence this week of the mounting economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to contain it. In the US, another three million people claimed unemployment benefits and the unemployment rate has soared to almost 15% - the highest ever report in data first published in 1948.  The European Commission, in its latest forecast, predicts a decline in economic activity of 7.5% this year with what it calls an incomplete recovery in 2021. That would leave the EU economy still smaller than it was last year.  It is now beyond question that the US, the EU and most of the world are in the throes of a very sharp recession. There are also concerns about just how convincing the recovery from it will be. The longer the situation drags on, the more risk there is that businesses deprived of revenue will be unable to survive. For workers, longer periods of unemployment can make it harder to get new jobs. If, however, the health crisis abates soon and the commercial world can safely return to relative normality fairly quickly, the lasting economic damage may be more moderate. Women in Italy havedemanded a greater rolein the country's official response to the coronavirus outbreak. The Civil Defence's daily briefings on the crisis are chaired by men. No women were included in Italy's 20-member technical scientific committee (CTS) - a group of experts advising the government during the crisis. In response, Italian women started a social media campaign to call for better representation. A petition started by the Dateci Voce (""Give us voice"") group has been signed more than 4,500 times, including by MPs, scientist and researchers. Italy is one of three countries - along with the United States and UK - to record more than 30,000 deaths. The UK and the EU must continue to co-operate in the fight against the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have agreed. The pair spoke on Friday to discuss the response to the pandemic. ""Both leaders welcomed the good co-operation between the UK and the EU on the coronavirus, including the global effort to repatriate citizens,"" Mr Johnson's office said. The prime minister congratulated the EU on the 7.4bn euros raised bythe pledging conference it hostedon Monday, while Ms Von der Leyen thanked the UK for its Â£388m pledge for vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen met at Downing Street in January Deadly accidents involving children and firearms have gone up in the past two months, according to US researchers. It comes after a record spike in gun sales while lockdown measures were first going into place around the US. Fatal unintentional shootings jumped by 43% in March and April compared to average gun deaths during the same two months in the past three years, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. ""We know that there are risks to having guns in the home, and with the surge in gun sales in the last two months, it could create more opportunity for kids to gain access to guns and unintentionally hurt themselves or someone else,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of the group's volunteer network Moms Demand Action. ""The numbers show there's been an increase in these horrible shooting tragedies during the time the pandemic was at its peak."" Third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom faces the ""horrible"" task of euthanising his animals Tens of thousands of US pork producers are facing a stark reality: although demand for their products is high in the nation's grocery stores, they may have to euthanise and dispose of millions of pigs due to a breakdown in the American food supply chain. Although chicken and cattle farmers are facing a similar situation, as are milk and egg producers, because of the tight time frame between when a pig is born to when it is ready for slaughter, some of the most drastic actions are occurring on these farms first. According to the Minnesota Pork Producers Association, an estimated 10,000 pigs are being euthanised every day in the state. ""On the same day that we're euthanising pigs - and it's a horrible day - is the same day that a grocery store 10 miles away may not get a shipment of pork,"" says third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom. ""It's just that the supply chain is broken at this point.""

"Help for Mr Wong (R) finally came in the form of the Fijian Navy (L) One man's dream to spend three years sailing solo around the Pacific nearly turned to disaster after borders started closing around the region, leaving him stranded alone at sea for three months. While people around the globe were panic buying and stocking up, he was running low on food and fuel as he sailed between islands trying to find somewhere to dock. Wong - he only wanted to share his surname - set off from his home country Singapore on 2 February. It was an adventure the 59-year-old experienced sailor had been meticulously planning for years - everything from the exact amount of fuel he would need to the weather conditions of the places he was intending to visit. The plan was to sail from Singapore to Polynesia, a journey that would take about four months, in his yacht. Once there, he would spend time exploring the region by land and sea. But he would soon learn that even the best laid plans could go awry - especially in the face of a global pandemic. For the first leg of his journey, Wong was joined by two friends who accompanied him in the initial stages of his journey. In late February, they disembarked in Indonesia as scheduled and Wong headed on alone to his destination of Papua New Guinea (PNG), where he planned to stock up on fuel and food. But a few days in, his auto-pilot broke. ""I was still in Indonesian waters then so I wanted to anchor and take a break and repair my boat. But I was chased away - they said the lockdown had already begun,"" he told the BBC. ""So I thought OK I would just continue on."" A broken autopilot meant he needed to man the ship at all times. At night, he would set his alarm to ring once every hour, so he could wake up to check his whereabouts. And his luck did not improve. As he neared PNG, he found out from his family - whom he kept in touch with by satellite phone - that it had also closed its borders. Mr Wong had been sailing the seas for years before deciding to make the long voyage He decided he would stop at a small island close by instead. ""It was a small island, only around 20-30 families lived there. There was no telephone, no television, nothing,"" he said. ""But even they had heard of the lockdown, so they chased me away. I approached several other islands but they all chased me away. ""It was then that I got news that the South Pacific islands were all in lockdown, but I was already halfway there - I couldn't really turn back. So I decided to just continue to Tuvalu."" That leg of the journey would take the next 13 days. It was 21 April when he reached Tuvalu. By this time, he had already spent weeks alone on his boat, and his supplies were running dangerously low. ""My initial plan, if there was no virus, was that I would stop at each country for a while, buy some fuel and food,"" he said. ""By this time, the vegetables were all spoilt but I still could keep things like meat and things like potatoes as I had a fridge on board."" He was about two hours from Tuvalu waters when he was discovered by maritime officials - who again, told him to leave. ""I pleaded with them and said 'Please, I don't have any more fuel and food. I won't anchor and step on land, just let me stay in your waters,'"" he said. But they said no. ""I said I didn't have anywhere to go and they said to head back to the ocean. At last I said ok at least help me buy some food and fuel."" He passed them nearly US$1,400 (Â£1,133) in exchange for 1,000 litres of diesel and approximately a month's worth of food. A boat carrying both these things eventually arrived, but they couldn't approach Wong due to social distancing rules. Mr Wong had to use a small rubber float to get his food items across ""I pulled out my small rubber boat and pushed it their way, and they put the goods there and I would tow it back. We took a lot of time pulling it back and forth."" He received eggs, meat pies and lots of instant noodles among other things So he left, deciding to head towards Fiji. During this time, his family back home in Singapore got in touch with Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and tried to secure a place for him to dock in Fiji. All he could do then was wait and hope for the best. His options were running low but then he hit a real low point after his boat hit coral. ""It was sometime in April that my propeller was damaged. I remember on that day, huge winds started picking up - they were really strong,"" he said. He later found out that he was some 500 nautical miles (926 km) away from Cyclone Harold - the storm that ravaged the Pacific Islands, killing dozens. ""I was very far away but I still felt it. The winds blew my boat and it hit something, causing one of my propellers to spoil,"" he said. But thankfully, he soon received word that the Fiji government had agreed to take him in. ""I was so happy and relieved when Fiji let me in, I was really thankful to the Fijian government and to Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for co-ordinating,"" he said. A navy boat was sent out to tow him in and he eventually docked in Fiji on 29 April - after almost three months of wandering the sea. ""Mr Wong was fatigued after incurring damages to his yacht and had minimal rest and [was] running short of food supplies,"" Commander Tim Natuva of the Fiji Navy told BBC News. Cmdr Natuva said the rescue effort required co-ordination from Singapore and multiple ministries in Fiji including customs, immigration, navy and the ministry of health. Fiji, which has a population of about 880,000, currently has 18 confirmed cases of the virus - one of the few nations in the South Pacific to have any reported virus cases. Cmdr Natuva said the rescue itself was ""fairly simple"" but ""needed some adjustments"" because of the virus restrictions. How do you stay at home if your home is destroyed? But it was a success - Wong eventually managed to dock. He was taken to hospital where he had to undergo a swab test. The test, of course, came back negative. ""If it had come back positive - I really don't know how that would have happened! I hadn't seen anyone for months at that point!"" he joked. When asked how he felt about being rejected from every country, his tone remained upbeat, saying: ""Those countries did what they had to do. If they had let me in and someone had gotten the virus from me, how could they explain the incident to their citizens? ""One thing that surprised me was that even those small islands with no wifi and television, even they felt the effects of the virus so strongly. I really felt for them."" Wong has since been discharged but remains in Fiji working on repairing his yacht, waiting for the chance to resume his trip. ""I hope this outbreak is something we'll all be able to get through,"" he said. ""And after this all ends, I will continue my voyage."" How do you stay at home if your home is destroyed?

"People should not expect big changes to the coronavirus lockdown in Boris Johnson's speech to the nation on Sunday, a cabinet minister has said. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Breakfast the speech would set out a ""cautious"" road map for the UK, rather than immediate alterations. Wales announced ""modest"" changes to its lockdown from Monday, which will allow peopleto exercise outside more often. Meanwhile, a six-week-old baby with coronavirus died in England. The NHS said the baby had an underlying health condition and died on 3 May at an undisclosed hospital. The most recent figures from Thursday show the total number of people who have died with coronavirus in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK is 30,615 - a daily increase of 539. Mixed messages across the four nations What will be the 'new normal'? The five tests for ending lockdown Announcing the plans for Wales' lockdown, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted Wales to ""move in step with the other nations of the United Kingdom"". The new measures will allow people to exercise outside more than once a day, while some garden centres and recycling centres will reopen. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday the only change she was consideringin the immediate term was to outdoor exercise. Mr Dowden said the PM's speech, at 19:00 BST on Sunday, would cautiously begin to look to the future, with limited amendments to restrictions to begin with. ""On Sunday, what the prime minister will do is set out the road map ahead,"" he said. ""So we can start to look to the future, but we'll have to do so in a very tentative and cautious way. People should not expect big changes from the prime minister on Sunday. ""But what they should expect, and this is what people have been asking for some time, tell us where we're going. Give us a road map ahead. And that is what the prime minister will do.""

Mr Johnson had also said in the Commons on Wednesday he wanted to possibly ""get going"" with some measures to ease lockdown on Monday. But BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt said the government ""had a wobble"" after Mr Johnson ""gave the impression to some people that more significant changes were on the way"". And the Welsh and Scottish governments suggested No 10 had sent ""mixed messages"" about the lockdown. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to make their own decisions on lockdown regulations: In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas already extended the lockdown there- as she urged peopleto stick to restrictions over the bank holiday weekend In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakefordsaid people will be able to exercise outside more than once a day, with some libraries set to reopen too In Northern Ireland, First Minister Arlene Fosterhas said ""everything will stay as it is"" for the next three weeks No 10 has said Mr Johnson is in favour of a UK-wide approach, even if different parts begin to move at slightly different speeds based on the evidence for each nation. Mr Johnson says the UK government will act with ""maximum caution"" when beginning to ease the lockdown Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Thursday's No 10 briefing the virus' reproduction value -known as the R number- was between 0.5 and 0.9. UK public health bodies want the R number to stay below one. John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told MPs he believed the R number had risen in the past two weeks, despite the lockdown. He said latest estimates put it currently between 0.75 and one. Office for National Statistics chief Sir Ian Diamond Thursday's briefing the assessment that the number had risen was driven by the spread in care homes.

"Experts say that mass testing will help officials plan better As India continues to fight the spread of coronavirus, a few 'successful' efforts at containing the infection have been touted as 'models', celebrated and mimicked across the country. But experts say such premature euphoria can be dangerous. The BBC's Vikas Pandey reports. The northern Indian city of Agra, home to the iconic Taj Mahal, was one of the first Indian cities to report a positive case of coronavirus back in early March. It continued to report cases throughout the month but managed to slow down the spread - and that is how the ""Agra model"" was born. It trended as a hashtag on social media, the federal government was full of praise and Uttar Pradesh state chief minister Yogi Adityanath was credited for its success. But things changed within days. As the month of April started, the number of cases started doubling quickly and the early success started to unravel. The model had relied heavily on strictly containing affected areas and isolating suspected cases. But as the virus spread to newer areas, authorities had to look for other options, like aggressive testing. The city now has more than 600 cases - more than any other city in the state and the much-feted Agra model disappeared from the news cycle. It just goes to prove such early celebrations involve ""great risks"", says prominent virologist Dr Shahid Jameel. Agra has seen a sharp rise in the number of cases ""Such euphoria makes people let their guard down and that can be dangerous,"" he says. Several experts, including Dr Jameel, point out that there is so little known about the novel coronavirus, the existence of which was only discovered late last year, meaning scientists haven't had enough time to study it properly. ""That makes Covid-19 so dangerous,"" he adds. Take, for example, the discovery that ""the virus can be found in the sputum"" of those affected for up to 30 days. ""So you can't feel victorious even after you have successfully treated all your patients. Being vigilant is the only option."" Classifying affected areas as containment zones has helped officials In Agra, authorities were quick to define containment zones and they went for aggressive contact tracing. ""But it didn't call for a celebration because it ran the risk of undoing all the good work authorities had done,"" Dr Jameel adds. Another problem of celebrating such models is that other states and districts rush to replicate it. Epidemiologist Lalit Kant warns against such practice. ""Such models are area specific and cannot be replicated. One size doesn't fit all. We can of course learn from different models,"" he adds. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories CONTACT-TRACING APPS:Why are there doubts? CLIMATE:'Australia's chance to grasp green energy' ENDING LOCKDOWN:The routes back to normal life Take the example of Kerala: the state has been investing heavily in its healthcare network for years. When coronavirus hit the state, it was well prepared. Officials were  quick to identify, isolate and treat patients. It also used technology in contact tracing and also in finding suspected hotspots quickly to halt the spread. But does that make Kerala a success model? Dr A Fathahudeen, who is the nodal officer for COVID-19 treatment in Ernakulam district, is against the idea of calling any place a success model yet. Contact tracing has been an important part of the government's strategy ""We have seen resurgence of cases in some areas of Kerala. There are some cases where we haven't been able to find the source of the infection,"" he says. He argues that things change ""so fast with this virus"" that nobody can afford to relax. ""If you celebrate such models, then you will have dead bodies to answer for."" Dr Fathahudeen says such models should be studied by scientists but they haven't had enough time to do that. The problem starts, he adds, when ""politicians start declaring successes without any scientific approval"". ""They (politicians) often don't realise that what worked in Kerala will not work in a densely populated slum like Dharawi in Mumbai,"" he said. People are not allowed to leave containment zone Indeed, Dr Kant believes that most of these models rely on ""containing people from going out"", but we are still ""far away from containing the virus"". ""So that distinction has to be made,"" he says. ""Behaviour of individuals, population density, travel history and health infrastructure - all these factors come into play. So, models can be adapted, but not adopted."" Public health expert Anant Bhan agrees. He believes that each state, and possibly each district, needs to evaluate its own response. ""There can't be a uniform model in such a diverse country like India,"" he adds. Mr Bhan says that euphoria over such success models can also put frontline workers at risk. ""The possibility of complacency become real when people, including frontline workers, get false hope of a success,"" he adds. And that is why you need to acknowledge and learn from the positives when any place does well, but ""definitely not celebrate it as an end"". Several Indian states have been trying to ramp up testing The state of Rajasthan is an example that shows why one model cannot be applied in two places. While the state government has been able to contain the spread in the town of Bhilwara, it has struggled to do the same in the capital Jaipur, which has been ravaged by the virus. And then there are global models that have also been celebrated, andSingapore is one of them,external. Headlines across the world congratulated Singapore for containing the spread. But the country saw a second wave and had to announce a lockdown. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases expert at Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Novena hospital, says Singapore did well with measures like social distancing. ""But this virus is sneaky, the risk was always there and it made a comeback,"" he adds. He adds that ""shortcuts or celebrations"" can quickly come back to haunt you. ""All it takes is a super-spreader to reverse your success and no country in the world can afford to do that.""

Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Thousands of people have been riding bicycles through the
centre of Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, in protest against the government of
Prime Minister Janez Jansa. The protest organisers accused Mr Jansa of violating human
rights under the pretext of taking action against Covid-19. They said this
included increasing police powers, inciting hatred against migrants and making
personal attacks on journalists. Environmental organisations also joined the protest. They
say the government has inserted clauses into emergency legislation which would
prevent NGOs from taking part in consultations about construction

It comes day after another White House workers tested positive for the virus. When asked about the possibility of an outbreak in the White House, Mr Trump told reporters: ""All you can do is take precautions and do the best you can.""

York City afterher husband was denied entry into Canada.,external Erika Lavelle's baby is due on 23 October, and she and her husband hoped to get
out of the ""war zone"" in New York City, where they live. But they were turned away by Canadian border security. Other couples,externalhavehad to separate,externalsince the coronavirus crisis shut the
US-Canada border. Canada requires citizens to live in the country for at least
six months out of the year to maintain health benefits, and many Canadians have
returned out of fear their benefits would run out while abroad, leaving their
spouses behind. The border has been closed to all non-essential travel since 18 March.
Exceptions are supposed to be made for immediate family of returning Canadian
citizens, but it's up to the discretion of border security.   Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent UK airlines say they have been told the government will bring in a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the UK from any country apart from the Republic of Ireland in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. People arriving in the UK would have to self-isolate at a private residence.
Government and aviation sources told BBC News that the quarantine would mean people might be expected to provide an address at the border. It is not clear how long the new travel restriction would be in place and whether non-UK residents would be allowed to stay in rented private accommodation. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world have pushed countries into crisis-mode, prompting a massive rescue spending in an effort to soften the blow from what is expected to be the worst economic contraction since the 1930s. In many countries, the aid is targeted at the poor or people working in the informal economy who are unlikely to get assistance through other programmes. In other cases, they are on the condition that a person's job has been affected by shutdowns. Canada, for example, is providing C$2,000 (Â£1,150; $1,400) per month for up to four months to those who have lost income due to the pandemic, while Costa Rica is funding a monthly allowance of $220 (Â£177) for people who have lost their jobs due to the virus. All Americans earning under $99,000 - an estimated 90% of households - are due to receive as much as $1,200 (Â£964) per adult, while South Korea's central government is sending cheques of up to KRW 1 million (Â£659; $820) to families in the bottom 70% income bracket. Hong Kong in February announced a handout of $10,000 Hong Kong dollar ($1,280; Â£985) per adult; Japan is sending its citizens JPY 100,000 (Â£752; $931) per person, and Singapore $S600 (Â£340; $422).

Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent There has been more evidence this week of the mounting economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to contain it. In the US, another three million people claimed unemployment benefits and the unemployment rate has soared to almost 15% - the highest ever report in data first published in 1948.  The European Commission, in its latest forecast, predicts a decline in economic activity of 7.5% this year with what it calls an incomplete recovery in 2021. That would leave the EU economy still smaller than it was last year.  It is now beyond question that the US, the EU and most of the world are in the throes of a very sharp recession. There are also concerns about just how convincing the recovery from it will be. The longer the situation drags on, the more risk there is that businesses deprived of revenue will be unable to survive. For workers, longer periods of unemployment can make it harder to get new jobs. If, however, the health crisis abates soon and the commercial world can safely return to relative normality fairly quickly, the lasting economic damage may be more moderate. Women in Italy havedemanded a greater rolein the country's official response to the coronavirus outbreak. The Civil Defence's daily briefings on the crisis are chaired by men. No women were included in Italy's 20-member technical scientific committee (CTS) - a group of experts advising the government during the crisis. In response, Italian women started a social media campaign to call for better representation. A petition started by the Dateci Voce (""Give us voice"") group has been signed more than 4,500 times, including by MPs, scientist and researchers. Italy is one of three countries - along with the United States and UK - to record more than 30,000 deaths. The UK and the EU must continue to co-operate in the fight against the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have agreed. The pair spoke on Friday to discuss the response to the pandemic. ""Both leaders welcomed the good co-operation between the UK and the EU on the coronavirus, including the global effort to repatriate citizens,"" Mr Johnson's office said. The prime minister congratulated the EU on the 7.4bn euros raised bythe pledging conference it hostedon Monday, while Ms Von der Leyen thanked the UK for its Â£388m pledge for vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen met at Downing Street in January Deadly accidents involving children and firearms have gone up in the past two months, according to US researchers. It comes after a record spike in gun sales while lockdown measures were first going into place around the US. Fatal unintentional shootings jumped by 43% in March and April compared to average gun deaths during the same two months in the past three years, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. ""We know that there are risks to having guns in the home, and with the surge in gun sales in the last two months, it could create more opportunity for kids to gain access to guns and unintentionally hurt themselves or someone else,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of the group's volunteer network Moms Demand Action. ""The numbers show there's been an increase in these horrible shooting tragedies during the time the pandemic was at its peak."" Third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom faces the ""horrible"" task of euthanising his animals Tens of thousands of US pork producers are facing a stark reality: although demand for their products is high in the nation's grocery stores, they may have to euthanise and dispose of millions of pigs due to a breakdown in the American food supply chain. Although chicken and cattle farmers are facing a similar situation, as are milk and egg producers, because of the tight time frame between when a pig is born to when it is ready for slaughter, some of the most drastic actions are occurring on these farms first. According to the Minnesota Pork Producers Association, an estimated 10,000 pigs are being euthanised every day in the state. ""On the same day that we're euthanising pigs - and it's a horrible day - is the same day that a grocery store 10 miles away may not get a shipment of pork,"" says third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom. ""It's just that the supply chain is broken at this point.""

""But our streets are not empty, they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other. âAnd when I look at our country today and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors, and airmen would recognise and admire.â She ends her address, recorded at Windsor Castle, by sending her âwarmest good wishesâ to the nation. âNever give up, never despair, that was the message of VE Day,â the Queen says. âAt the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain. But we kept faith that the cause was right and this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through.â But she says while Britain was celebrating the end of the war in Europe, it wasnât until August that fighting ceased in the Far East. âMany people laid down their lives in that terrible conflict,â she says. âThey fought so we could live in peace at home and abroad.

"Friday is a one-off holiday that will only be marked in Berlin Berliners have been given an unprecedented public holiday, to mark the end of World War Two in Europe but also liberation from Nazi rule. Not since reunification has a German city acknowledged 8 May as a day of liberation in this way; some Berliners are unaware of its significance. A street party and several events have been cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The holiday is one-off and is not being held outside Berlin. But there are growing calls for a public holiday to be held across Germany. For some, particularly in areas of the old West Germany, 8 May has long been associated with defeat in World War Two. Many families preferred to draw a veil over the period, both those who had suffered persecution as well as those who hadn't. In the areas of the old communist East Germany, 8 May was taught as a ""Day of Liberation"" from the Nazi regime by the victorious Red Army. Post-war Berlin itself was divided into four sectors - the Soviets in the east and the US, French and British in the west. Berlin was a divided city for decades In the latter years of the West German state, the date was also seen as marking liberation from the Nazi regime. In 1985 President Richard von WeizsÃ¤cker made clear the day should be seen as a day of liberation and not defeat. Ten years later, on the 50th anniversary of liberation, a reunified Berlin was at the centre of a state ceremony. Nowadays the date is viewed more significantly as the rebirth of democracy. But the only national public holiday currently marking German history is 3 October, which celebrates the date of reunification in 1990. ""It's the principles of democracy that we want to get across,"" explains Moritz van DÃ¼lmen, whose Kulturprojekte is behind a number of events. A campaign highlights how voters should not allow democracy to be overthrown: ""At the beginning was the vote - a vote and its result"" Some of the posters have appeared on streets around the capital Although many of the plans for Berlin's public holiday have been scrapped, including a street party, an open air exhibition and numerous events at museums,some projects will still take place online,external. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier are laying wreaths at Berlin's memorial for victims of war and tyranny. Queen Elizabeth II laid a wreath at the German memorial for victims of war and dictatorship in 2004 ""We are also keen to reach a young audience, particularly those with a migrant background, who have little knowledge of German history,"" Mr van DÃ¼lmen explains. Remembering history, he argues, is more important than ever in light of recent deadly far-right attacks at a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle and a shisha bar at Hanau near Frankfurt. Horror of Germans targeted in anti-Semitic attack German Kurds react to Hanau shootings How 1989 reshaped the modern world The story of Tunnel 29 Talk to Berliners and many will not see the significance of 8 May as the end of the war, or even the surrender of Nazi Germany. Many only found out this week that Friday was a public holiday. Hannelore Steer, who grew up in East Germany, sees the holiday as a good idea as she was used to seeing it celebrated many years ago. Fall of Berlin Wall was 'worst night of my life' 'Cut the Iron Curtain': Germany's 1989 freedom picnic Weng Yuen believes it would help people remember what had happened. ""17 June used to be a public holiday in West Germany to remind us of the uprising in East Germany in 1953. That's now largely forgotten particularly with a younger generation,"" she told the BBC. This video can not be played The punk rocker who took on the East German Stasi Berliner Tina Michael, who has two teenage sons, says that's important as the history curriculum has recently been cut in German schools. ""As history and geography classes have been merged, a lot of material can't be covered any more,"" she complains. Friday's holiday has also been a subject for political debate. Holocaust survivor Esther Bejarano, 95, wrote an open letter to Mrs Merkel and President Steinmeier calling for 8 May to become a lasting and nationwide public holiday. She believes it could help Germans appreciate that 8 May 1945 was ""a day of liberation and the crushing of the National Socialist regime"".One hundred thousand people have signed a petition,externalsupporting the proposal. Politicians including Katrin GÃ¶ring-Eckardt from the Greens and Katja Kipping of the left-wing Linke party have backed her proposal. It was Die Linke that lobbied for the day to become a public holiday in Berlin. Not everyone backs the idea. The far-right AfD party, which is the biggest opposition force in Germany's Bundestag, is bitterly opposed to the holiday. Just how far to the right is AfD? How far right caused earthquake in German politics Co-leader Alexander Gauland sees 8 May as an ""ambivalent"" date, because while it may have meant liberation for some, it also represents the ""absolute defeat"" of Germany and the ""loss of big parts of Germany"". The day is being widely covered by German media, in an attempt to portray the broad array of experiences that Germans had as the war came to an end.

A special evening programme will feature Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins, actor Adrian Lester and singer Beverley Knight, who will be performing some well-known songs from the 1930s and 40s. It will culminate in a public sing along of Dame Vera Lynn's We'll Meet Again, a song synonymous with World War Two. Last month, the Queen echoed the words of the now 103-year-old singer - known as the Forces' sweetheart -when she told those in lockdown ""we will meet again""during a rare speech to the nation.

"People should not expect big changes to the coronavirus lockdown in Boris Johnson's speech to the nation on Sunday, a cabinet minister has said. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Breakfast the speech would set out a ""cautious"" road map for the UK, rather than immediate alterations. Wales announced ""modest"" changes to its lockdown from Monday, which will allow peopleto exercise outside more often. Meanwhile, a six-week-old baby with coronavirus died in England. The NHS said the baby had an underlying health condition and died on 3 May at an undisclosed hospital. The most recent figures from Thursday show the total number of people who have died with coronavirus in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK is 30,615 - a daily increase of 539. Mixed messages across the four nations What will be the 'new normal'? The five tests for ending lockdown Announcing the plans for Wales' lockdown, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted Wales to ""move in step with the other nations of the United Kingdom"". The new measures will allow people to exercise outside more than once a day, while some garden centres and recycling centres will reopen. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday the only change she was consideringin the immediate term was to outdoor exercise. Mr Dowden said the PM's speech, at 19:00 BST on Sunday, would cautiously begin to look to the future, with limited amendments to restrictions to begin with. ""On Sunday, what the prime minister will do is set out the road map ahead,"" he said. ""So we can start to look to the future, but we'll have to do so in a very tentative and cautious way. People should not expect big changes from the prime minister on Sunday. ""But what they should expect, and this is what people have been asking for some time, tell us where we're going. Give us a road map ahead. And that is what the prime minister will do."" He added: ""The worst thing that could happen is that after the huge effort we've all put inâ¦ we don't want to have a second peak that overwhelms the NHS."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Mr Johnson had also said in the Commons on Wednesday he wanted to possibly ""get going"" with some measures to ease lockdown on Monday. But BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt said the government ""had a wobble"" after Mr Johnson ""gave the impression to some people that more significant changes were on the way"". And the Welsh and Scottish governments suggested No 10 had sent ""mixed messages"" about the lockdown.

Mr Johnson says the UK government will act with ""maximum caution"" when beginning to ease the lockdown Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Thursday's No 10 briefing the virus' reproduction value -known as the R number- was between 0.5 and 0.9. UK public health bodies want the R number to stay below one. John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told MPs he believed the R number had risen in the past two weeks, despite the lockdown. He said latest estimates put it currently between 0.75 and one. Office for National Statistics chief Sir Ian Diamond Thursday's briefing the assessment that the number had risen was driven by the spread in care homes. ""That gives us a real challenge to reduce the epidemic in care homes and it's one that I think - over the next few weeks from what I see happening - will happen,"" Sir Ian said.

"New York, the US financial capital, is also one of the US hotspots for the coronavirus The US unemployment rate has risen to 14.7%, with 20.5 million jobs lost in April, as the coronavirus pandemic devastated the economy. The rise means the jobless rate is now worse than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Since the pandemic began, the US has suffered its worst growth numbers in a decade and the worst retail sales report on record. Just two months ago, the unemployment rate was at 3.5%, a 50-year low. ""It is historically unprecedented,"" said economist Erica Groshen, former head of the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics, who now teaches at Cornell University. ""We have put our economy into a medically induced coma in order to heal it from the pandemic... and that has led to the most precipitous loss of jobs seen in any of the modern data."" The report from the Labor Department showed declines in every sector of the economy. Leisure and hospitality was hit especially hard, with payrolls falling by 7.7 million or 47%. Employers in education and health services cut 2.5 million positions, while retailers shed 2.1 million. The Labor Department said more than three-quarters of those without jobs described themselves as temporarily laid off, a sign that many of those currently without work are hopeful that the economy will be able to rebound. US to borrow record $3tn in pandemic spending Coronavirus job losses and 'the millennial curse' 'What I fear the most is not being able to survive' The Fed's four radical moves to save the economy But economists warned that the pandemic is likely to force major changes to businesses - such as limits on how many people may be in a restaurant at one time - that could reduce the need for workers. And the longer the shutdown lasts, the more likely it is that a business will not survive. ""Even a temporary layoff can turn into a permanent one if the business doesn't survive or if the business has to change its business model so dramatically that it needs different numbers or a different kind of worker,"" Ms Groshen said. The economic crisis is not unique to the US. In the UK,the Bank of England has warned of the sharpest recession on record, while Canada on Friday reported its unemployment rate had increased 5.2 percentage points to 13% last month. Statistics Canada estimated that about a third of the workforce was either out of work, or working less than half of their usual hours. In an appearance on the Fox News channel, US President Donald Trump shrugged off the 20.5 million jobs lost in the US as ""totally expected"" and ""no surprise"". ""Even the Democrats aren't blaming me for that. What I can do is I can bring it back,"" he said as the figures were released. But bankruptcies have already claimed retailers such as J Crew and Neiman Marcus, as well as many firms in the energy sector, where a collapse in oil prices, due in part to a pandemic-related drop in demand, has worsened the strains. The jobless rate for black workers is the highest since 2010, and is at a record among Hispanics While some states have already started to relax restrictions, re-starting the economy is likely to be difficult, as workers worry about the risk of infection and grapple with the impact of school closures. ""I'm not certain what's going to happen next,"" said Tanya Nikolaevskaya, a legal assistant in New York, who was furloughed last month, after working from home in March. Ms Nikolaevskaya hopes to return to what she described as her dream job, but she has a medical condition that makes her worried about infection and is a single mother, whose 8-year-old daughter will need care if schools do not reopen. ""It's all about, 'Is there childcare,'"" she said. ""If I will not have childcare, I will not be able to go back."" The number of people in the labor force - working or looking for work - fell 2.5% last month, to its lowest level since 1970, while those reporting reduced hours or an inability to find a full-time job nearly doubled. The Labor Department warned that the situation might be worse than estimated, pointing to the spike in the number of people who said they were employed but ""absent from work"". Including those responses suggests an unemployment rate closer to 20%, it said. Among black workers, the unemployment rate jumped to 16.7%, the highest since 2010. Among Hispanics, it surged to a record 18.9%, while it climbed to a lower - but still record-setting - 14.2% among white workers. Overall, the unemployment rate was the highest recorded in data back to 1948, while the over-the-month jobs decline was the largest reported in data back to 1939. ""The scale of the challenge cannot be overstated,"" said Robert Alster, head of investment services at wealth manager Close Brothers Asset Management.

"More people are using their cars despite the coronavirus lockdown, the RAC motoring group says. Its analysis suggests there are 11% more vehicles on the road this week than in the second week of lockdown. Meanwhile, the number of emergency callouts rose 18% over the same period. ""There is now mounting evidence that people are venturing back out in their vehicles,"" said RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes, who blamed it on ""lockdown fatigue"". He also said boredom and ""the sunny spring weather might also be enticing drivers back into their vehicles"". ""Additionally, some who are indoors might have chosen to carry out home maintenance and DIY, so have taken an opportunity to visit DIY stores that are now open."" The report follows comments from AA boss Simon Breakwell,who told the Financial Times,external: ""Far more cars are getting back on the road."" He said about half the current AA call-outs are for people unable to start their cars on the driveway, often with flat batteries after weeks of vehicles sitting idle. The RAC analysed ""black box"" driving data, breakdown numbers and route planning figures since the lockdown began to come up with its figures. Comparing the second week of lockdown with last week, 11% more cars were on the road and 23% more daily miles were driven. Vehicle breakdowns attended by RAC patrols climbed nearly a fifth across the same period. Coronavirus: Is it time to free the healthy from restrictions? Coronavirus: Drivers being 'ripped off for petrol' Coronavirus: Traffic 'reaching early 1970s levels' The number of routes planned via the RAC Routeplanner is also increasing, suggesting a rise in trips being taken by drivers. More routes were planned on Monday 5 May 2020 than on any other day during the lockdown, with 16% more planned on that day than just a week earlier. ""Our data clearly shows a slight, but nonetheless steady, rise in the number of drivers using their vehicles, and the distances they are travelling in them on a daily basis, compared with earlier in the lockdown,"" said Mr Lyes. A new survey by the RAC suggests that two out of five drivers are now using their vehicles more frequently than earlier in the coronavirus lockdown. The top reason given for using a car more was for food and grocery shopping, with almost a quarter of drivers naming it. Around one in 10 said that they were driving more to pick up essential supplies or for trips to a pharmacy. But worryingly, one in 20 said they were using their vehicle more now to specifically purchase alcohol, or going out in the car specifically to visit DIY stores. ""The current advice remains to only go out when necessary for essential purposes, or where you cannot work from home,"" pointed out Mr Lyes. ""The question drivers should ask themselves before venturing out is, 'Do I really need to?'

"This video can not be played Tara Reade, who accuses Joe Biden of sexual assault 27 years ago, says he 'should take the polygraph' A woman who accuses Democratic White House candidate Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her 27 years ago has called on him to quit the presidential race. In an interview, Tara Reade urged Mr Biden to ""please step forward and be held accountable"". She added: ""You should not be running on character for the president of the United States."" Mr Biden, who is set to challenge President Donald Trump in November, has denied Ms Reade's accusation. WARNING: Some readers may find details in this story upsetting. The former vice-president is running against Donald Trump Ms Reade, now 56, worked as a staff assistant to Mr Biden from 1992-93 when he was a senator for the US state of Delaware. She has said that in 1993 he forced her against a wall and put his hands under her shirt and skirt, penetrating her with a finger, after she delivered him his gym bag. In her most graphic, detailed account yet of the alleged assault, Ms Reade told US media personality Megyn Kelly that Mr Biden kissed her neck and told her he wanted to have sex with her, using an obscene term. ""So, he had one hand underneath my shirt, and the other had, I had a skirt on, and he went down my skirt and then went up and I remember I was up almost on my tippy toes,"" she said. ""When he went inside the skirt, he was talking to me at the same time, and he was leaning into me and I pulled this way away from his head."" When she refused his advances, she said: ""He looked at me and said, 'What the hell, man, I heard you liked me'."" She added: ""He pointed his finger at me and he said 'You're nothing to me. You're nothing'."" Whatâs behind the Biden sexual harassment allegation Third White House run for 'Middle Class Joe' Joe Biden, the touchy-feely politician Ms Reade was asked by Kelly if she wanted Mr Biden to withdraw from the race. ""I wish he would, but he won't, but I wish he would,"" she said. ""That's how I feel emotionally."" Ms Reade offered to take a lie detector test about her claim, on condition that Mr Biden do so also. ""I will take one if Joe Biden takes one,"" she said. Ms Reade said she had received a death threat after Biden supporters accused her without evidence of being a Russian agent. ""His surrogates have been saying really horrible things about me and to me on social media,"" she continued. ""He hasn't himself, but there is a measure of hypocrisy with the campaign saying it's been safe - it's not been safe. ""All of my social media has been hacked, all of my personal information has been dragged through."" Biden campaign communications director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement after the interview aired that Ms Reade's story contained ""inconsistencies"". ""Women must receive the benefit of the doubt,"" said the statement. ""They must be able to come forward and share their stories without fear of retribution or harm - and we all have a responsibility to ensure that. ""At the same time, we can never sacrifice the truth. And the truth is that these allegations are false and that the material that has been presented to back them up, under scrutiny, keeps proving their falsity."" Mr Biden, who is the Democratic party's presumptive presidential nominee, broke his silence on the matter a week ago, appearing on a morning television show to brand the allegations ""false"". A court document from 1996 shows Ms Reade's ex-husband describing ""a problem she was having at work regarding sexual harassment, in US Senator Joe Biden's office"",according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune,external. ""It was obvious that this event had a very traumatic effect on [Reade], and that she is still sensitive and effected [sic] by it today,"" wrote Theodore Dronen, her then-husband, in a legal memo during their divorce battle. The file obtained by the California newspaper appears to be the only document from the time that might describe Ms Reade's allegation. Ms Reade's brother, a former neighbour and a former colleague have all said they heard her describe the accusation against her boss after the alleged incident. And her mother appears to have called a CNN show about the claim back in 1993. High-powered Manhattan lawyer Douglas Wigdor said in a statement that he is representing Ms Reade. He has represented alleged sexual assault victims of jailed Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Some Republicans are seizing on the Reade accusation to portray Democrats as hypocrites who only defend women when claims of wrongdoing are aimed at conservatives. Mr Trump himself has faced a barrage of sexual misconduct allegations, which he also denies. He once boasted of grabbing women by the genitals. The sexual allegations against Donald Trump However, the Democrats have much more strongly championed the #MeToo movement, which backs women who make accusations of sexual assault and calls for their stories to be heard. Women are a core constituency for the party, traditionally giving more votes to Democratic candidates than Republicans. Some liberal women have said,externalthey believe Tara Reade but will vote for Mr Biden anyway because they view Mr Trump as much worse. November's presidential election will be the first of the #MeToo era, and Mr Biden has framed it as a ""battle for the soul of America"".

Whatâs behind the Biden sexual harassment allegation Third White House run for 'Middle Class Joe' Joe Biden, the touchy-feely politician Ms Reade was asked by Kelly if she wanted Mr Biden to withdraw from the race. ""I wish he would, but he won't, but I wish he would,"" she said. ""That's how I feel emotionally."" Ms Reade offered to take a lie detector test about her claim, on condition that Mr Biden do so also. ""I will take one if Joe Biden takes one,"" she said. Ms Reade said she had received a death threat after Biden supporters accused her without evidence of being a Russian agent. ""His surrogates have been saying really horrible things about me and to me on social media,"" she continued. ""He hasn't himself, but there is a measure of hypocrisy with the campaign saying it's been safe - it's not been safe. ""All of my social media has been hacked, all of my personal information has been dragged through."" Biden campaign communications director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement after the interview aired that Ms Reade's story contained ""inconsistencies"". ""Women must receive the benefit of the doubt,"" said the statement. ""They must be able to come forward and share their stories without fear of retribution or harm - and we all have a responsibility to ensure that. ""At the same time, we can never sacrifice the truth. And the truth is that these allegations are false and that the material that has been presented to back them up, under scrutiny, keeps proving their falsity."" Mr Biden, who is the Democratic party's presumptive presidential nominee, broke his silence on the matter a week ago, appearing on a morning television show to brand the allegations ""false"". A court document from 1996 shows Ms Reade's ex-husband describing ""a problem she was having at work regarding sexual harassment, in US Senator Joe Biden's office"",according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune,external. ""It was obvious that this event had a very traumatic effect on [Reade], and that she is still sensitive and effected [sic] by it today,"" wrote Theodore Dronen, her then-husband, in a legal memo during their divorce battle. The file obtained by the California newspaper appears to be the only document from the time that might describe Ms Reade's allegation. Ms Reade's brother, a former neighbour and a former colleague have all said they heard her describe the accusation against her boss after the alleged incident. And her mother appears to have called a CNN show about the claim back in 1993. High-powered Manhattan lawyer Douglas Wigdor said in a statement that he is representing Ms Reade. He has represented alleged sexual assault victims of jailed Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Some Republicans are seizing on the Reade accusation to portray Democrats as hypocrites who only defend women when claims of wrongdoing are aimed at conservatives. Mr Trump himself has faced a barrage of sexual misconduct allegations, which he also denies. He once boasted of grabbing women by the genitals. The sexual allegations against Donald Trump However, the Democrats have much more strongly championed the #MeToo movement, which backs women who make accusations of sexual assault and calls for their stories to be heard. Women are a core constituency for the party, traditionally giving more votes to Democratic candidates than Republicans. Some liberal women have said,externalthey believe Tara Reade but will vote for Mr Biden anyway because they view Mr Trump as much worse. November's presidential election will be the first of the #MeToo era, and Mr Biden has framed it as a ""battle for the soul of America"".

"More people are using their cars despite the coronavirus lockdown, the RAC motoring group says. Its analysis suggests there are 11% more vehicles on the road this week than in the second week of lockdown. Meanwhile, the number of emergency callouts rose 18% over the same period. ""There is now mounting evidence that people are venturing back out in their vehicles,"" said RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes, who blamed it on ""lockdown fatigue"". He also said boredom and ""the sunny spring weather might also be enticing drivers back into their vehicles"". ""Additionally, some who are indoors might have chosen to carry out home maintenance and DIY, so have taken an opportunity to visit DIY stores that are now open."" The report follows comments from AA boss Simon Breakwell,who told the Financial Times,external: ""Far more cars are getting back on the road."" He said about half the current AA call-outs are for people unable to start their cars on the driveway, often with flat batteries after weeks of vehicles sitting idle. The RAC analysed ""black box"" driving data, breakdown numbers and route planning figures since the lockdown began to come up with its figures. Comparing the second week of lockdown with last week, 11% more cars were on the road and 23% more daily miles were driven. Vehicle breakdowns attended by RAC patrols climbed nearly a fifth across the same period. Coronavirus: Is it time to free the healthy from restrictions? Coronavirus: Drivers being 'ripped off for petrol' Coronavirus: Traffic 'reaching early 1970s levels' The number of routes planned via the RAC Routeplanner is also increasing, suggesting a rise in trips being taken by drivers. More routes were planned on Monday 5 May 2020 than on any other day during the lockdown, with 16% more planned on that day than just a week earlier. ""Our data clearly shows a slight, but nonetheless steady, rise in the number of drivers using their vehicles, and the distances they are travelling in them on a daily basis, compared with earlier in the lockdown,"" said Mr Lyes. A new survey by the RAC suggests that two out of five drivers are now using their vehicles more frequently than earlier in the coronavirus lockdown. The top reason given for using a car more was for food and grocery shopping, with almost a quarter of drivers naming it. Around one in 10 said that they were driving more to pick up essential supplies or for trips to a pharmacy. But worryingly, one in 20 said they were using their vehicle more now to specifically purchase alcohol, or going out in the car specifically to visit DIY stores. ""The current advice remains to only go out when necessary for essential purposes, or where you cannot work from home,"" pointed out Mr Lyes. ""The question drivers should ask themselves before venturing out is, 'Do I really need to?' ""By only using the car for essential journeys at this time, we're not only helping prevent the virus spreading, but are also reducing the risk of being involved in a road collision and avoiding putting any further pressure on the NHS.""

Serkis is reading The Hobbit live - and in its entirety - in an effort to raise money for charity. The 56-year-old began streaming his online performance of JRR Tolkien's 1937 novel at 10:00 BST.

Athletes will be hoping to compete in the Tokyo Paralympics next year Disability sport will have a important part to play in building a ""new normal"" when the coronavirus crisis eases, says the head of the International Paralympic Committee. The Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games was postponed until 2021 because of the pandemic, although IPC president Andrew Parsons insists it will not threaten the sport's future. ""We are looking at the positives, what the new world will be when it comes to inclusion and diversity,"" Parsons told BBC Sport. ""We donât want to go back to normal, normal has failed.  We want to build a new normal. ""We need a world that is built by all, for all, and I think the Paralympics will have a very strong message here."" Parsons also says there is ""a need for more discussion"" about the impact of Covid-19 on people with impairment and disability, adding the IPC is lobbying national governments to discuss the issue more. The Trump administration has announced that 20,000 undocumented migrants have been summarily expelled from the US since March. In a statement, US officials cite Trump's order issued in late March, which shut the US border with Canada and Mexico to limit the spread of the coronavirus. According to government figures, around 90% of migrants who entered the US in April have been deported. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Thousands of people have been riding bicycles through the
centre of Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, in protest against the government of
Prime Minister Janez Jansa. The protest organisers accused Mr Jansa of violating human
rights under the pretext of taking action against Covid-19. They said this
included increasing police powers, inciting hatred against migrants and making
personal attacks on journalists. Environmental organisations also joined the protest. They
say the government has inserted clauses into emergency legislation which would
prevent NGOs from taking part in consultations about construction
projects.

US-Canada border. Canada requires citizens to live in the country for at least
six months out of the year to maintain health benefits, and many Canadians have
returned out of fear their benefits would run out while abroad, leaving their
spouses behind. The border has been closed to all non-essential travel since 18 March.
Exceptions are supposed to be made for immediate family of returning Canadian
citizens, but it's up to the discretion of border security.   Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent UK airlines say they have been told the government will bring in a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the UK from any country apart from the Republic of Ireland in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. People arriving in the UK would have to self-isolate at a private residence.
Government and aviation sources told BBC News that the quarantine would mean people might be expected to provide an address at the border. It is not clear how long the new travel restriction would be in place and whether non-UK residents would be allowed to stay in rented private accommodation. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world have pushed countries into crisis-mode, prompting a massive rescue spending in an effort to soften the blow from what is expected to be the worst economic contraction since the 1930s. In many countries, the aid is targeted at the poor or people working in the informal economy who are unlikely to get assistance through other programmes. In other cases, they are on the condition that a person's job has been affected by shutdowns. Canada, for example, is providing C$2,000 (Â£1,150; $1,400) per month for up to four months to those who have lost income due to the pandemic, while Costa Rica is funding a monthly allowance of $220 (Â£177) for people who have lost their jobs due to the virus. All Americans earning under $99,000 - an estimated 90% of households - are due to receive as much as $1,200 (Â£964) per adult, while South Korea's central government is sending cheques of up to KRW 1 million (Â£659; $820) to families in the bottom 70% income bracket. Hong Kong in February announced a handout of $10,000 Hong Kong dollar ($1,280; Â£985) per adult; Japan is sending its citizens JPY 100,000 (Â£752; $931) per person, and Singapore $S600 (Â£340; $422). Read more: Coronavirus bailouts: Which country has the most generous deal? Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent There has been more evidence this week of the mounting economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to contain it. In the US, another three million people claimed unemployment benefits and the unemployment rate has soared to almost 15% - the highest ever report in data first published in 1948.  The European Commission, in its latest forecast, predicts a decline in economic activity of 7.5% this year with what it calls an incomplete recovery in 2021. That would leave the EU economy still smaller than it was last year.  It is now beyond question that the US, the EU and most of the world are in the throes of a very sharp recession. There are also concerns about just how convincing the recovery from it will be. The longer the situation drags on, the more risk there is that businesses deprived of revenue will be unable to survive. For workers, longer periods of unemployment can make it harder to get new jobs. If, however, the health crisis abates soon and the commercial world can safely return to relative normality fairly quickly, the lasting economic damage may be more moderate. Women in Italy havedemanded a greater rolein the country's official response to the coronavirus outbreak. The Civil Defence's daily briefings on the crisis are chaired by men. No women were included in Italy's 20-member technical scientific committee (CTS) - a group of experts advising the government during the crisis. In response, Italian women started a social media campaign to call for better representation. A petition started by the Dateci Voce (""Give us voice"") group has been signed more than 4,500 times, including by MPs, scientist and researchers. Italy is one of three countries - along with the United States and UK - to record more than 30,000 deaths. The UK and the EU must continue to co-operate in the fight against the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have agreed. The pair spoke on Friday to discuss the response to the pandemic. ""Both leaders welcomed the good co-operation between the UK and the EU on the coronavirus, including the global effort to repatriate citizens,"" Mr Johnson's office said. The prime minister congratulated the EU on the 7.4bn euros raised bythe pledging conference it hostedon Monday, while Ms Von der Leyen thanked the UK for its Â£388m pledge for vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen met at Downing Street in January Deadly accidents involving children and firearms have gone up in the past two months, according to US researchers. It comes after a record spike in gun sales while lockdown measures were first going into place around the US. Fatal unintentional shootings jumped by 43% in March and April compared to average gun deaths during the same two months in the past three years, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. ""We know that there are risks to having guns in the home, and with the surge in gun sales in the last two months, it could create more opportunity for kids to gain access to guns and unintentionally hurt themselves or someone else,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of the group's volunteer network Moms Demand Action. ""The numbers show there's been an increase in these horrible shooting tragedies during the time the pandemic was at its peak."" Third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom faces the ""horrible"" task of euthanising his animals Tens of thousands of US pork producers are facing a stark reality: although demand for their products is high in the nation's grocery stores, they may have to euthanise and dispose of millions of pigs due to a breakdown in the American food supply chain. Although chicken and cattle farmers are facing a similar situation, as are milk and egg producers, because of the tight time frame between when a pig is born to when it is ready for slaughter, some of the most drastic actions are occurring on these farms first. According to the Minnesota Pork Producers Association, an estimated 10,000 pigs are being euthanised every day in the state. ""On the same day that we're euthanising pigs - and it's a horrible day - is the same day that a grocery store 10 miles away may not get a shipment of pork,"" says third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom.

Serkis is reading The Hobbit live - and in its entirety - in an effort to raise money for charity. The 56-year-old began streaming his online performance of JRR Tolkien's 1937 novel at 10:00 BST.

Athletes will be hoping to compete in the Tokyo Paralympics next year Disability sport will have a important part to play in building a ""new normal"" when the coronavirus crisis eases, says the head of the International Paralympic Committee. The Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games was postponed until 2021 because of the pandemic, although IPC president Andrew Parsons insists it will not threaten the sport's future. ""We are looking at the positives, what the new world will be when it comes to inclusion and diversity,"" Parsons told BBC Sport. ""We donât want to go back to normal, normal has failed.  We want to build a new normal. ""We need a world that is built by all, for all, and I think the Paralympics will have a very strong message here."" Parsons also says there is ""a need for more discussion"" about the impact of Covid-19 on people with impairment and disability, adding the IPC is lobbying national governments to discuss the issue more. The Trump administration has announced that 20,000 undocumented migrants have been summarily expelled from the US since March. In a statement, US officials cite Trump's order issued in late March, which shut the US border with Canada and Mexico to limit the spread of the coronavirus. According to government figures, around 90% of migrants who entered the US in April have been deported. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Thousands of people have been riding bicycles through the
centre of Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, in protest against the government of
Prime Minister Janez Jansa. The protest organisers accused Mr Jansa of violating human
rights under the pretext of taking action against Covid-19. They said this
included increasing police powers, inciting hatred against migrants and making
personal attacks on journalists. Environmental organisations also joined the protest. They
say the government has inserted clauses into emergency legislation which would
prevent NGOs from taking part in consultations about construction
projects.

US-Canada border. Canada requires citizens to live in the country for at least
six months out of the year to maintain health benefits, and many Canadians have
returned out of fear their benefits would run out while abroad, leaving their
spouses behind. The border has been closed to all non-essential travel since 18 March.
Exceptions are supposed to be made for immediate family of returning Canadian
citizens, but it's up to the discretion of border security.   Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent UK airlines say they have been told the government will bring in a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the UK from any country apart from the Republic of Ireland in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. People arriving in the UK would have to self-isolate at a private residence.
Government and aviation sources told BBC News that the quarantine would mean people might be expected to provide an address at the border. It is not clear how long the new travel restriction would be in place and whether non-UK residents would be allowed to stay in rented private accommodation. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world have pushed countries into crisis-mode, prompting a massive rescue spending in an effort to soften the blow from what is expected to be the worst economic contraction since the 1930s. In many countries, the aid is targeted at the poor or people working in the informal economy who are unlikely to get assistance through other programmes. In other cases, they are on the condition that a person's job has been affected by shutdowns. Canada, for example, is providing C$2,000 (Â£1,150; $1,400) per month for up to four months to those who have lost income due to the pandemic, while Costa Rica is funding a monthly allowance of $220 (Â£177) for people who have lost their jobs due to the virus. All Americans earning under $99,000 - an estimated 90% of households - are due to receive as much as $1,200 (Â£964) per adult, while South Korea's central government is sending cheques of up to KRW 1 million (Â£659; $820) to families in the bottom 70% income bracket. Hong Kong in February announced a handout of $10,000 Hong Kong dollar ($1,280; Â£985) per adult; Japan is sending its citizens JPY 100,000 (Â£752; $931) per person, and Singapore $S600 (Â£340; $422). Read more: Coronavirus bailouts: Which country has the most generous deal? Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent There has been more evidence this week of the mounting economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to contain it. In the US, another three million people claimed unemployment benefits and the unemployment rate has soared to almost 15% - the highest ever report in data first published in 1948.  The European Commission, in its latest forecast, predicts a decline in economic activity of 7.5% this year with what it calls an incomplete recovery in 2021. That would leave the EU economy still smaller than it was last year.  It is now beyond question that the US, the EU and most of the world are in the throes of a very sharp recession. There are also concerns about just how convincing the recovery from it will be. The longer the situation drags on, the more risk there is that businesses deprived of revenue will be unable to survive. For workers, longer periods of unemployment can make it harder to get new jobs. If, however, the health crisis abates soon and the commercial world can safely return to relative normality fairly quickly, the lasting economic damage may be more moderate. Women in Italy havedemanded a greater rolein the country's official response to the coronavirus outbreak. The Civil Defence's daily briefings on the crisis are chaired by men. No women were included in Italy's 20-member technical scientific committee (CTS) - a group of experts advising the government during the crisis. In response, Italian women started a social media campaign to call for better representation. A petition started by the Dateci Voce (""Give us voice"") group has been signed more than 4,500 times, including by MPs, scientist and researchers. Italy is one of three countries - along with the United States and UK - to record more than 30,000 deaths. The UK and the EU must continue to co-operate in the fight against the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have agreed. The pair spoke on Friday to discuss the response to the pandemic. ""Both leaders welcomed the good co-operation between the UK and the EU on the coronavirus, including the global effort to repatriate citizens,"" Mr Johnson's office said. The prime minister congratulated the EU on the 7.4bn euros raised bythe pledging conference it hostedon Monday, while Ms Von der Leyen thanked the UK for its Â£388m pledge for vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen met at Downing Street in January Deadly accidents involving children and firearms have gone up in the past two months, according to US researchers. It comes after a record spike in gun sales while lockdown measures were first going into place around the US. Fatal unintentional shootings jumped by 43% in March and April compared to average gun deaths during the same two months in the past three years, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. ""We know that there are risks to having guns in the home, and with the surge in gun sales in the last two months, it could create more opportunity for kids to gain access to guns and unintentionally hurt themselves or someone else,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of the group's volunteer network Moms Demand Action.

Third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom faces the ""horrible"" task of euthanising his animals Tens of thousands of US pork producers are facing a stark reality: although demand for their products is high in the nation's grocery stores, they may have to euthanise and dispose of millions of pigs due to a breakdown in the American food supply chain. Although chicken and cattle farmers are facing a similar situation, as are milk and egg producers, because of the tight time frame between when a pig is born to when it is ready for slaughter, some of the most drastic actions are occurring on these farms first. According to the Minnesota Pork Producers Association, an estimated 10,000 pigs are being euthanised every day in the state. ""On the same day that we're euthanising pigs - and it's a horrible day - is the same day that a grocery store 10 miles away may not get a shipment of pork,"" says third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom.

"More people are using their cars despite the coronavirus lockdown, the RAC motoring group says. Its analysis suggests there are 11% more vehicles on the road this week than in the second week of lockdown. Meanwhile, the number of emergency callouts rose 18% over the same period. ""There is now mounting evidence that people are venturing back out in their vehicles,"" said RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes, who blamed it on ""lockdown fatigue"". He also said boredom and ""the sunny spring weather might also be enticing drivers back into their vehicles"". ""Additionally, some who are indoors might have chosen to carry out home maintenance and DIY, so have taken an opportunity to visit DIY stores that are now open."" The report follows comments from AA boss Simon Breakwell,who told the Financial Times,external: ""Far more cars are getting back on the road."" He said about half the current AA call-outs are for people unable to start their cars on the driveway, often with flat batteries after weeks of vehicles sitting idle. The RAC analysed ""black box"" driving data, breakdown numbers and route planning figures since the lockdown began to come up with its figures. Comparing the second week of lockdown with last week, 11% more cars were on the road and 23% more daily miles were driven. Vehicle breakdowns attended by RAC patrols climbed nearly a fifth across the same period. Coronavirus: Is it time to free the healthy from restrictions? Coronavirus: Drivers being 'ripped off for petrol' Coronavirus: Traffic 'reaching early 1970s levels' The number of routes planned via the RAC Routeplanner is also increasing, suggesting a rise in trips being taken by drivers. More routes were planned on Monday 5 May 2020 than on any other day during the lockdown, with 16% more planned on that day than just a week earlier. ""Our data clearly shows a slight, but nonetheless steady, rise in the number of drivers using their vehicles, and the distances they are travelling in them on a daily basis, compared with earlier in the lockdown,"" said Mr Lyes. A new survey by the RAC suggests that two out of five drivers are now using their vehicles more frequently than earlier in the coronavirus lockdown. The top reason given for using a car more was for food and grocery shopping, with almost a quarter of drivers naming it. Around one in 10 said that they were driving more to pick up essential supplies or for trips to a pharmacy. But worryingly, one in 20 said they were using their vehicle more now to specifically purchase alcohol, or going out in the car specifically to visit DIY stores. ""The current advice remains to only go out when necessary for essential purposes, or where you cannot work from home,"" pointed out Mr Lyes. ""The question drivers should ask themselves before venturing out is, 'Do I really need to?' ""By only using the car for essential journeys at this time, we're not only helping prevent the virus spreading, but are also reducing the risk of being involved in a road collision and avoiding putting any further pressure on the NHS.""

John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told MPs he believed the R number had risen in the past two weeks, despite the lockdown. He said latest estimates put it currently between 0.75 and one. Office for National Statistics chief Sir Ian Diamond Thursday's briefing the assessment that the number had risen was driven by the spread in care homes.

"This video can not be played Any lockdown changes will be ""modest"", says Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab The PM says the government will proceed with ""maximum caution"" when considering easing coronavirus restrictions. Boris Johnson is due to announce plans for England's lockdown on Sunday, but ministers have insisted short term changes to measures will be ""modest"". At the government's daily briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described media reports on easing restrictions as ""not a reliable guide"". He added that changes may vary between the different nations. It comes after Scotland's lockdownwas formally extendedand the Northern Ireland Executive said there was""no headroom"" yet to ease the lockdown. Wales is due to announced itsthe nation's lockdown plans on Friday, after the Welsh government warned media reports speculating how Mr Johnson might ease lockdown measuresrisked sending ""mixed messages""to the public. Some newspapers suggested the rules on exercise could be relaxed and more people encouraged to return to work. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to make their own decisions on lockdown regulations - and could lift restrictions at a different rate. Mixed messages across the four nations Is it time to free healthy people from restrictions? What will be the 'new normal'? The five tests for ending lockdown The prime minister has told leaders of the devolved nations that he is committed to a UK-wide approach to tackling coronavirus ""even if different parts of the UK begin to move at slightly different speeds"", Downing Street said. ""Those decisions will be made based on the science for each nation,"" a No 10 spokesman added. The latest figures show the total number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus is 30,615 - a daily increase of 539. The UK provided some 86,583 tests in 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Thursday - meaning the government missed its 100,000-per-day target for the fifth consecutive day. There were reports restrictions on outdoor exercise could be lifted in England from Monday People all over the UK joined in the weekly clap for NHS staff and other key workers on Thursday evening At the briefing, Mr Raab said any short term changes to restrictions would be ""modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored"". He stressed that the existing rules would still apply over the bank holiday weekend and urged people to ""continue to follow the guidance"". Facing pressure over media reports suggesting the lockdown would be eased, the foreign secretary said that reports were ""not a reliable guide"" to future policy decisions. Coronavirus: Is R the crucial number? He added that future decisions would be based on the reproduction number - known as the R level - which represents the average number of people that an infected person will pass the virus on to. ""If we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people aren't following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place,"" he said. Mr Raab said the R number was somewhere between 0.5 and 0.9. However, Prof John Edmunds, who is advising the government, said earlier that it had actually risen slightly - to between 0.75 and one. An R number greater than one would result in exponential growth in the number of cases. But if the number stays lower than one, the disease will eventually peter out as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Sir Ian Diamond, the chief statistician for the Office for National Statistics, saidthe current R numberwas below one. However, he said R had increased since the last estimates due to the rise in virus transmission in care homes. The R number can be different in different parts of the country or in different settings, says the BBC's health reporter Rachel Schraer. ""The question is how contained they are or whether the epidemic in care homes will spread back into the community,"" she said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government was ""right to extend the lockdown"" until the infection rate was under control, saying that ""the health and safety of the nation needs to come first"". He added that ""there needs to be absolute clarity that we must follow the rules"". With much speculation about Sunday's announcement, the government seems keen to manage expectations. Dominic Raab's emphasis was on gradual steps; he spoke of this being a delicate and dangerous moment with the virus remaining deadly. He said the prime minister would set out a road map of how the country might come out of this lockdown, but the government doesn't want to release the handbrake and see the car race away just yet. Today's press conference seemed designed to both offer a glimmer of hope about how the country might move on from lockdown, and to shroud it in caution - with emphasis that current measures still remain in place. Whether that message comes across as clear, or confused, is the key question at what could be a crucial moment in managing this pandemic. By law, the government must review the restrictions every three weeks, and Thursday marks the latest deadline. Although the lockdown - first announced on 23 March - will largely stay in place, the ""stay at home"" message is expected to be scrapped and it is likely more outdoor activities will be permitted. The prime minister will make his address at 19:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Johnson has told opposition leaders he will deliver a statement in the House of Commons on the government's next steps on Monday. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned it could be ""catastrophic"" to drop the stay at home message as she announced that the nation's lockdown was to be extended. She said any easing of restrictions would be ""very risky"" at this stage, but said the Scottish government may be prepared to allow people to spend more time outdoors. Scotlandhas already set out a number of options for lifting the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Here are Friday's main headlines:   Reading has been one way to pass the time during lockdown for many - and an online ""Hobbitathon"" with Gollum actor Andy Serkis is helping thousands get through Monday. Serkis is reading The Hobbit live - and in its entirety - in an effort to raise money for charity. The 56-year-old began streaming his online performance of JRR Tolkien's 1937 novel at 10:00 BST. Fans have been watching the YouTube stream, with thousands of pounds raised for NHS Charities Together and Best Beginnings, according to The Hobbitathon's funding page. ""Thank you so much for joining me on this huge expedition we're about to go on in our living rooms,"" Serkis told viewers before he began the reading. Athletes will be hoping to compete in the Tokyo Paralympics next year Disability sport will have a important part to play in building a ""new normal"" when the coronavirus crisis eases, says the head of the International Paralympic Committee. The Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games was postponed until 2021 because of the pandemic, although IPC president Andrew Parsons insists it will not threaten the sport's future. ""We are looking at the positives, what the new world will be when it comes to inclusion and diversity,"" Parsons told BBC Sport. ""We donât want to go back to normal, normal has failed.  We want to build a new normal. ""We need a world that is built by all, for all, and I think the Paralympics will have a very strong message here."" Parsons also says there is ""a need for more discussion"" about the impact of Covid-19 on people with impairment and disability, adding the IPC is lobbying national governments to discuss the issue more. The Trump administration has announced that 20,000 undocumented migrants have been summarily expelled from the US since March. In a statement, US officials cite Trump's order issued in late March, which shut the US border with Canada and Mexico to limit the spread of the coronavirus. According to government figures, around 90% of migrants who entered the US in April have been deported. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Thousands of people have been riding bicycles through the
centre of Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, in protest against the government of
Prime Minister Janez Jansa. The protest organisers accused Mr Jansa of violating human
rights under the pretext of taking action against Covid-19. They said this
included increasing police powers, inciting hatred against migrants and making
personal attacks on journalists. Environmental organisations also joined the protest. They
say the government has inserted clauses into emergency legislation which would
prevent NGOs from taking part in consultations about construction
projects. Katie Miller with the Vice-President's Chief of Staff Marc Short The top aide to Mike Pence, whose positive test forced an abrupt change to the US vice-president's travel plans to Iowa today, has been named as his press secretary Katie Miller. It comes day after another White House workers tested positive for the virus. When asked about the possibility of an outbreak in the White House, Mr Trump told reporters: ""All you can do is take precautions and do the best you can.""

US-Canada border. Canada requires citizens to live in the country for at least
six months out of the year to maintain health benefits, and many Canadians have
returned out of fear their benefits would run out while abroad, leaving their
spouses behind. The border has been closed to all non-essential travel since 18 March.
Exceptions are supposed to be made for immediate family of returning Canadian
citizens, but it's up to the discretion of border security.   Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent UK airlines say they have been told the government will bring in a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the UK from any country apart from the Republic of Ireland in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. People arriving in the UK would have to self-isolate at a private residence.
Government and aviation sources told BBC News that the quarantine would mean people might be expected to provide an address at the border. It is not clear how long the new travel restriction would be in place and whether non-UK residents would be allowed to stay in rented private accommodation. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world have pushed countries into crisis-mode, prompting a massive rescue spending in an effort to soften the blow from what is expected to be the worst economic contraction since the 1930s. In many countries, the aid is targeted at the poor or people working in the informal economy who are unlikely to get assistance through other programmes. In other cases, they are on the condition that a person's job has been affected by shutdowns. Canada, for example, is providing C$2,000 (Â£1,150; $1,400) per month for up to four months to those who have lost income due to the pandemic, while Costa Rica is funding a monthly allowance of $220 (Â£177) for people who have lost their jobs due to the virus. All Americans earning under $99,000 - an estimated 90% of households - are due to receive as much as $1,200 (Â£964) per adult, while South Korea's central government is sending cheques of up to KRW 1 million (Â£659; $820) to families in the bottom 70% income bracket. Hong Kong in February announced a handout of $10,000 Hong Kong dollar ($1,280; Â£985) per adult; Japan is sending its citizens JPY 100,000 (Â£752; $931) per person, and Singapore $S600 (Â£340; $422). Read more: Coronavirus bailouts: Which country has the most generous deal? Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent There has been more evidence this week of the mounting economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to contain it. In the US, another three million people claimed unemployment benefits and the unemployment rate has soared to almost 15% - the highest ever report in data first published in 1948.  The European Commission, in its latest forecast, predicts a decline in economic activity of 7.5% this year with what it calls an incomplete recovery in 2021. That would leave the EU economy still smaller than it was last year.  It is now beyond question that the US, the EU and most of the world are in the throes of a very sharp recession. There are also concerns about just how convincing the recovery from it will be. The longer the situation drags on, the more risk there is that businesses deprived of revenue will be unable to survive. For workers, longer periods of unemployment can make it harder to get new jobs. If, however, the health crisis abates soon and the commercial world can safely return to relative normality fairly quickly, the lasting economic damage may be more moderate. Women in Italy havedemanded a greater rolein the country's official response to the coronavirus outbreak. The Civil Defence's daily briefings on the crisis are chaired by men. No women were included in Italy's 20-member technical scientific committee (CTS) - a group of experts advising the government during the crisis. In response, Italian women started a social media campaign to call for better representation. A petition started by the Dateci Voce (""Give us voice"") group has been signed more than 4,500 times, including by MPs, scientist and researchers. Italy is one of three countries - along with the United States and UK - to record more than 30,000 deaths. The UK and the EU must continue to co-operate in the fight against the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have agreed. The pair spoke on Friday to discuss the response to the pandemic. ""Both leaders welcomed the good co-operation between the UK and the EU on the coronavirus, including the global effort to repatriate citizens,"" Mr Johnson's office said. The prime minister congratulated the EU on the 7.4bn euros raised bythe pledging conference it hostedon Monday, while Ms Von der Leyen thanked the UK for its Â£388m pledge for vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen met at Downing Street in January Deadly accidents involving children and firearms have gone up in the past two months, according to US researchers. It comes after a record spike in gun sales while lockdown measures were first going into place around the US. Fatal unintentional shootings jumped by 43% in March and April compared to average gun deaths during the same two months in the past three years, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. ""We know that there are risks to having guns in the home, and with the surge in gun sales in the last two months, it could create more opportunity for kids to gain access to guns and unintentionally hurt themselves or someone else,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of the group's volunteer network Moms Demand Action. ""The numbers show there's been an increase in these horrible shooting tragedies during the time the pandemic was at its peak."" Third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom faces the ""horrible"" task of euthanising his animals Tens of thousands of US pork producers are facing a stark reality: although demand for their products is high in the nation's grocery stores, they may have to euthanise and dispose of millions of pigs due to a breakdown in the American food supply chain. Although chicken and cattle farmers are facing a similar situation, as are milk and egg producers, because of the tight time frame between when a pig is born to when it is ready for slaughter, some of the most drastic actions are occurring on these farms first. According to the Minnesota Pork Producers Association, an estimated 10,000 pigs are being euthanised every day in the state. ""On the same day that we're euthanising pigs - and it's a horrible day - is the same day that a grocery store 10 miles away may not get a shipment of pork,"" says third-generation pig farmer Mike Boerboom. ""It's just that the supply chain is broken at this point.""

"This video can not be played Any lockdown changes will be ""modest"", says Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab The PM says the government will proceed with ""maximum caution"" when considering easing coronavirus restrictions. Boris Johnson is due to announce plans for England's lockdown on Sunday, but ministers have insisted short term changes to measures will be ""modest"". At the government's daily briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described media reports on easing restrictions as ""not a reliable guide"". He added that changes may vary between the different nations. It comes after Scotland's lockdownwas formally extendedand the Northern Ireland Executive said there was""no headroom"" yet to ease the lockdown. Wales is due to announced itsthe nation's lockdown plans on Friday, after the Welsh government warned media reports speculating how Mr Johnson might ease lockdown measuresrisked sending ""mixed messages""to the public. Some newspapers suggested the rules on exercise could be relaxed and more people encouraged to return to work. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to make their own decisions on lockdown regulations - and could lift restrictions at a different rate. Mixed messages across the four nations Is it time to free healthy people from restrictions? What will be the 'new normal'? The five tests for ending lockdown The prime minister has told leaders of the devolved nations that he is committed to a UK-wide approach to tackling coronavirus ""even if different parts of the UK begin to move at slightly different speeds"", Downing Street said. ""Those decisions will be made based on the science for each nation,"" a No 10 spokesman added. The latest figures show the total number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus is 30,615 - a daily increase of 539. The UK provided some 86,583 tests in 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Thursday - meaning the government missed its 100,000-per-day target for the fifth consecutive day. There were reports restrictions on outdoor exercise could be lifted in England from Monday People all over the UK joined in the weekly clap for NHS staff and other key workers on Thursday evening At the briefing, Mr Raab said any short term changes to restrictions would be ""modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored"". He stressed that the existing rules would still apply over the bank holiday weekend and urged people to ""continue to follow the guidance"". Facing pressure over media reports suggesting the lockdown would be eased, the foreign secretary said that reports were ""not a reliable guide"" to future policy decisions. Coronavirus: Is R the crucial number? He added that future decisions would be based on the reproduction number - known as the R level - which represents the average number of people that an infected person will pass the virus on to. ""If we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people aren't following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place,"" he said. Mr Raab said the R number was somewhere between 0.5 and 0.9. However, Prof John Edmunds, who is advising the government, said earlier that it had actually risen slightly - to between 0.75 and one. An R number greater than one would result in exponential growth in the number of cases. But if the number stays lower than one, the disease will eventually peter out as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Sir Ian Diamond, the chief statistician for the Office for National Statistics, saidthe current R numberwas below one. However, he said R had increased since the last estimates due to the rise in virus transmission in care homes. The R number can be different in different parts of the country or in different settings, says the BBC's health reporter Rachel Schraer. ""The question is how contained they are or whether the epidemic in care homes will spread back into the community,"" she said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government was ""right to extend the lockdown"" until the infection rate was under control, saying that ""the health and safety of the nation needs to come first"". He added that ""there needs to be absolute clarity that we must follow the rules"". With much speculation about Sunday's announcement, the government seems keen to manage expectations. Dominic Raab's emphasis was on gradual steps; he spoke of this being a delicate and dangerous moment with the virus remaining deadly. He said the prime minister would set out a road map of how the country might come out of this lockdown, but the government doesn't want to release the handbrake and see the car race away just yet. Today's press conference seemed designed to both offer a glimmer of hope about how the country might move on from lockdown, and to shroud it in caution - with emphasis that current measures still remain in place. Whether that message comes across as clear, or confused, is the key question at what could be a crucial moment in managing this pandemic. By law, the government must review the restrictions every three weeks, and Thursday marks the latest deadline. Although the lockdown - first announced on 23 March - will largely stay in place, the ""stay at home"" message is expected to be scrapped and it is likely more outdoor activities will be permitted. The prime minister will make his address at 19:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Johnson has told opposition leaders he will deliver a statement in the House of Commons on the government's next steps on Monday. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned it could be ""catastrophic"" to drop the stay at home message as she announced that the nation's lockdown was to be extended. She said any easing of restrictions would be ""very risky"" at this stage, but said the Scottish government may be prepared to allow people to spend more time outdoors. Scotlandhas already set out a number of options for lifting the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Friday is a one-off holiday that will only be marked in Berlin Berliners have been given an unprecedented public holiday, to mark the end of World War Two in Europe but also liberation from Nazi rule. Not since reunification has a German city acknowledged 8 May as a day of liberation in this way; some Berliners are unaware of its significance. A street party and several events have been cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The holiday is one-off and is not being held outside Berlin. But there are growing calls for a public holiday to be held across Germany. For some, particularly in areas of the old West Germany, 8 May has long been associated with defeat in World War Two. Many families preferred to draw a veil over the period, both those who had suffered persecution as well as those who hadn't. In the areas of the old communist East Germany, 8 May was taught as a ""Day of Liberation"" from the Nazi regime by the victorious Red Army. Post-war Berlin itself was divided into four sectors - the Soviets in the east and the US, French and British in the west. Berlin was a divided city for decades In the latter years of the West German state, the date was also seen as marking liberation from the Nazi regime. In 1985 President Richard von WeizsÃ¤cker made clear the day should be seen as a day of liberation and not defeat. Ten years later, on the 50th anniversary of liberation, a reunified Berlin was at the centre of a state ceremony. Nowadays the date is viewed more significantly as the rebirth of democracy. But the only national public holiday currently marking German history is 3 October, which celebrates the date of reunification in 1990. ""It's the principles of democracy that we want to get across,"" explains Moritz van DÃ¼lmen, whose Kulturprojekte is behind a number of events. A campaign highlights how voters should not allow democracy to be overthrown: ""At the beginning was the vote - a vote and its result"" Some of the posters have appeared on streets around the capital Although many of the plans for Berlin's public holiday have been scrapped, including a street party, an open air exhibition and numerous events at museums,some projects will still take place online,external. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier are laying wreaths at Berlin's memorial for victims of war and tyranny. Queen Elizabeth II laid a wreath at the German memorial for victims of war and dictatorship in 2004 ""We are also keen to reach a young audience, particularly those with a migrant background, who have little knowledge of German history,"" Mr van DÃ¼lmen explains. Remembering history, he argues, is more important than ever in light of recent deadly far-right attacks at a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle and a shisha bar at Hanau near Frankfurt. Horror of Germans targeted in anti-Semitic attack German Kurds react to Hanau shootings How 1989 reshaped the modern world The story of Tunnel 29 Talk to Berliners and many will not see the significance of 8 May as the end of the war, or even the surrender of Nazi Germany. Many only found out this week that Friday was a public holiday. Hannelore Steer, who grew up in East Germany, sees the holiday as a good idea as she was used to seeing it celebrated many years ago. Fall of Berlin Wall was 'worst night of my life' 'Cut the Iron Curtain': Germany's 1989 freedom picnic Weng Yuen believes it would help people remember what had happened. ""17 June used to be a public holiday in West Germany to remind us of the uprising in East Germany in 1953. That's now largely forgotten particularly with a younger generation,"" she told the BBC. This video can not be played The punk rocker who took on the East German Stasi Berliner Tina Michael, who has two teenage sons, says that's important as the history curriculum has recently been cut in German schools. ""As history and geography classes have been merged, a lot of material can't be covered any more,"" she complains. Friday's holiday has also been a subject for political debate. Holocaust survivor Esther Bejarano, 95, wrote an open letter to Mrs Merkel and President Steinmeier calling for 8 May to become a lasting and nationwide public holiday. She believes it could help Germans appreciate that 8 May 1945 was ""a day of liberation and the crushing of the National Socialist regime"".One hundred thousand people have signed a petition,externalsupporting the proposal. Politicians including Katrin GÃ¶ring-Eckardt from the Greens and Katja Kipping of the left-wing Linke party have backed her proposal. It was Die Linke that lobbied for the day to become a public holiday in Berlin. Not everyone backs the idea. The far-right AfD party, which is the biggest opposition force in Germany's Bundestag, is bitterly opposed to the holiday. Just how far to the right is AfD? How far right caused earthquake in German politics Co-leader Alexander Gauland sees 8 May as an ""ambivalent"" date, because while it may have meant liberation for some, it also represents the ""absolute defeat"" of Germany and the ""loss of big parts of Germany"". The day is being widely covered by German media, in an attempt to portray the broad array of experiences that Germans had as the war came to an end.

Left at the memorial with Camilla's bouquet was a message paying tribute to her father, Major Bruce Shand - who served with the 12th Royal Lancers during the war - and his regiment ""who fought so bravely to give us peace"". A gun salute from Edinburgh Castle marked the beginning and end of the silence, but crowds were absent from many war memorials as people reflected at home. Later, although large street parties were out of the question, some still managed to get out the bunting for a socially distanced celebration.
