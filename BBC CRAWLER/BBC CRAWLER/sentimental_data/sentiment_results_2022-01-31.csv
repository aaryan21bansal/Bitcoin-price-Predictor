"Boris Johnson arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday afternoon Boris Johnson has arrived in Ukraine for talks with the country's president amid rising concerns over a possible Russian invasion. The UK prime minister promised to work with Volodymyr Zelensky to find a diplomatic solution to arguments with Moscow and ""avoid further bloodshed"". Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops, tanks, artillery and missiles near its borders with Ukraine. But President Vladimir Putin denies he is planning an attack. However, his government has warned Ukraine not to make any further moves towards joining Nato, arguing that this threatens Russia's own security. The US has rejected this demand and Western countries are threatening to expand sanctions against Moscow if there is an invasion. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has saidlegislation was being preparedto target a wider range of individuals and businesses associated with Mr Putin, while a US official said Washington's sanctions meant people close to the Kremlin would be cut off from the international financial system. Ukraine leader praises West's response on Russia Why is the UK worried about Ukraine? Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Ahead of Mr Johnson's visit to Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the UK government announced it was giving Â£88m to promote stable governance and energy independence from Russia. Mr Johnson said: ""It is the right of every Ukrainian to determine how they are governed. As a friend and a democratic partner, the UK will continue to uphold Ukraine's sovereignty in the face of those who seek to destroy it. ""We urge Russia to step back and engage in dialogue to find a diplomatic resolution and avoid further bloodshed."" Mr Johnson hopes also to speak to Mr Putin later this week, having cancelled a call with the Russian president on Monday as he faced questions from MPs overparties held in Downing Street during the pandemic. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had been due to accompany the PM to Ukraine, but she announced on Monday that she had been diagnosed with Covid and was self-isolating. US President Joe Biden has warned there is a ""distinct possibility"" of Russia invading Ukraine within the next month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Western backing in the face of Russia's military build-up and announced an expansion of the army. As British, Polish and Dutch leaders visited the country, top US and Russian officials are due to hold fresh talks on the crisis. But on Monday there wereangry clashes between Russian and US envoys at the UN Security Council, after the US called a meeting to discuss Moscow's troop build-up on its borders with Ukraine. US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the mobilisation was the biggest Europe had seen in decades. What is Nato and why doesn't Russia trust it? Biden warns Russia may invade Ukraine next month She said the US continued to believe there was a diplomatic solution, but warned the US would act decisively in the event of an invasion - the consequences of which would be ""horrific"". However, her Russian counterpart Vasily Nebenzya accused the US of fomenting hysteria and ""unacceptable interference"" in Russia's affairs. He said there was no proof that Russia was planning military action against Ukraine, adding that Russia often deployed troops on its own territory and this was none of Washington's business. Russia wants the West to promise Ukraine will never join Nato - a military alliance where members promise to come to another's aid in the event of an armed attack. Moscow sees Nato troops in eastern Europe as a direct threat to its security, but the US has already rejected this demand. President Putin has long argued the US broke a 1990 guarantee, amid the collapse of the Soviet Union, that Nato would not expand further east - though interpretations differ over exactly what was promised. Nato's 30 members include the US and UK, as well as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - former Soviet republics which border Russia. Moscow's forces annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014 and it is backing rebels who seized large swathes of the eastern Donbas region soon afterwards.

"This video can not be played The crime gangs cashing in on illegal waste Organised crime gangs are illegally burying thousands of tonnes of waste across Scotland, a BBC investigation has found. Some of the rubbish is being brought up from the north of England by the gangs, and is believed to include hazardous clinical waste from hospitals. Current affairs series Disclosure has been told that threats and intimidation are being used against landowners who refuse to allow waste to be buried on their land. One claimed to have been threatened that their animals would be killed if they did not agree to let waste be buried on their land, while many others spoken to by the BBC were too scared to go on the record. An insider from a criminal network told Disclosure that dumping waste had become as profitable as the drug trade. Sepa, Scotland's environmental regulator, says its resources are being stretched by the gangs' activities. Kath McDowall is a senior investigator with Sepa Kath McDowall, one of the senior investigators looking into the organised groups, said: ""When people typically think of waste crime they think of small-scale fly-tipping and they don't quite realise it's happening on this scale."" She said the Scottish Environment Protection Agency was up against gangs who had been involved in running drugs and weapons for decades. Ms McDowall said they had ""taken lessons they've learned from doing other types of criminality and are now applying it to waste"". However, she said the resources that Sepa had to deal with the problem were ""pretty finite."" The legitimate disposal of rubbish is an expensive business because of the cost of complying with tight regulations and landfill taxes. Criminal gangs who bypass these costs have a massive advantage over legitimate traders. Drew Murdoch said there was a risk that some smaller legal businesses could fold Drew Murdoch is managing director of J&M Murdoch and Son, a family-run waste business which has been operating legitimately for 50 years. ""There is now more of a criminal element in the waste industry than there has ever been before,"" he said. ""And that is largely due to the amount of money they can make out of illegally dealing with waste."" His company might make Â£50,000 from a Â£1m contract due to the costs of landfill taxes, insurance and disposing of materials correctly. ""An illegitimate firm or criminal enterprise could quote half of that and pocket pretty much most of the money,"" he said. Mr Murdoch said there was a risk that some smaller legal businesses could fold or turn to criminality to compete. A trailer found abandoned at the side of the A73 in Lanarkshire was filled with domestic household waste An insider from one criminal network involved in burying waste told Disclosure that waste was ""the new drugs"". ""It's an easy way to make money. It's completely hidden in plain sight - and the money from these waste gangs goes straight back into their organised criminal activities. ""It finances their drugs operations, their movement of weapons, people, whatever."" The insider claimed that one criminal gang from the north of England had multiple sites across Scotland which received waste driven up from England in lorries. At one of these sites, the landowner would be paid Â£350 per lorry, containing a mixture of domestic and hazardous clinical waste. The site receives five lorries a day, five days a week, adding up to more than Â£8,000 a week for the landowner alone. The insider said they knew that at least one of these sites had been operational for years. Surveillance photos show a criminal network from the north of England illegally burying waste in south Wales The BBC has been told the criminal gangs are using a network of brokers to identify parcels of land in Scotland where they can bury industrial quantities of waste. The brokers may identify landowners or farmers who they can either intimidate or pay to accept the waste. One gang targeted two farms in south Wales where they buried tonnes of household rubbish as well as hazardous clinical waste from hospitals. Natural Resources Wales, the environmental regulator, discovered the waste included syringes, used dressings, and blood vials. The same tactic is being used in Scotland, leading to one criminal network being actively investigated by Sepa. Waste like this - which was buried illegally in Wales - is now being brought to Scotland Another method is to fill old lorry trailers with waste and abandon them in laybys and quiet streets around the country. In the last 15 months, 12 trailers have been found across central Scotland - all of them filled with household and construction waste. Elsewhere, a derelict farm near Port Glasgow, in Inverclyde, has been filled with an estimated 10,000 tyres. One barn that is overflowing with tyres lies within a few metres of a housing estate. Tyres are classified as hazardous waste because of the polluting emissions they give off and their potential to catch fire. And when Sepa investigated an illegal waste site in Lanarkshire, it found that methane emissions from buried rubbish brought up from England were 60 times the legal limit. Methane is a major driver of climate change. Thousands of tyres have been illegally dumped at a farm in Port Glasgow Sepa does not have a specific clean-up fund, so it must redirect money from other environmental work when illegal dumps need to be cleared. Its environmental investigators say organised crime has gained a strong foothold in the waste trade. Richard Sinnott, an atmospheric scientist at Sepa, told the BBC it was an ""increasing trend"", and that he could not overstate how damaging it was to Scotland's environment. Sepa is currently investigating 234 cases of waste crime. Of those, 31 are of the highest concern due to links with serious and organised crime or the potential for severe environmental damage. The authority estimates that 15% of organised crime groups in Scotland now have interests in environmental businesses. These range from skip hire companies to waste hauliers and construction and demolition firms. Justice Secretary Keith Brown said work was starting to have an impact on the problem The Environmental Services Association last year estimated that criminality in the trade was costing the UK taxpayer more than Â£1bn a year. Scotland's Justice Secretary Keith Brown chairs the Serious and Organised Crime Taskforce, which five months ago made waste crime its top priority. He said he was aware of ""a great deal of activity"" in terms of waste coming across the border between England and Scotland. He added: ""The way that the environmental protection agency, our rural local authorities, and the police authorities, are working, is starting to make an impact on this serious problem.""

"Proposed changes to alcohol duty will lead to higher prices and less choice for wine drinkers, the owner of wine merchant Laithwaites has warned. The proposals, contained in October's Budget, were described by Chancellor Rishi Sunak as the ""most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years"". But Direct Wines said the complexity would be ""crippling"" for the trade. It said small and medium firms would ""probably go out of business"". In the Budget, the chancellor said that under the new system for alcohol duty, which is due to start in 2023, taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider would be cut, but would rise for stronger drinks such as red wine. According to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA), if wine is taxed according to its alcoholic strength in this way, 70% of all wine, still and sparkling, will go up in price, as will 80% of all still wine, 95% of red wine and 100% of fortified wines. The government's consultation on the proposals has just closed.A spokesperson from the Treasury said that for all wines with an ABV between 8.5% and 22%, there will be one band based on alcohol content. ""Our reforms will replace our outdated rules with a common-sense approach that puts the taxation of stronger beers, wines and spirits on an equal footing, making lighter and sparkling wines more affordable for UK drinkers"", they said. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the treasurer of Direct Wines, Tim Curtis, said that under the present system there were three rates of duty on wine: one for still wine, a slightly higher one for sparkling wine and a higher one for fortified wine. ""So it's just three numbers and the majority of still wines sold in the UK, it's Â£2.23 a bottle, it couldn't really be much simpler,"" he said. ""But the Treasury have had a go and they've created 13 wine bands for the same Â£2.23, so for every half a percent of alcohol increase it goes up about 10p per bottle and above the 15% threshold there's another 14 bands so really they're replacing three with 27."" The WSTA has calculated implementing the changes would result in an increase in costs of about Â£250m a year for the wine trade. ""The complexity for the wine trade... is crippling,"" said Mr Curtis. ""Wine is an agricultural product and the ABV (Alcohol by Volume) of wine is set by the amount of sunshine warmth in the vineyard when the grapes grow on the vines and that changes every year. ""Last year we sold over 7,500 different wines and we would need a team of people dedicated to this to track and calculate the correct amount of duty for each product."" Mr Curtis said the average price of wine would ""certainly go up for the UK consumer"". ""It is the same cost to set up a duty rate for 12 bottles of wine as it is if you're selling a million so inherently for small and medium merchants in the UK this is just going to become an administrative nightmare. ""The red tape is just huge so you can imagine some ranges will shrink and sadly some small and medium enterprises will probably go out of business. So for the consumer it is a case of higher cost, less choice and fewer merchants competing for their business."" Wine mail order company The Wine Society, which has sales of Â£130m a year, initially welcomed the government review because it aimed to simplify the duty regime. ""But actually it doesn't simplify it at all,"" said its director of wine Pierre Mansour. He also said that Wine Society members would pay more for their wine as a result of the proposed changes. Most still wines sold by the Society, and in the UK overall, are 11.5% ABV and above. ""That's about 95% of our sales,"" he said. ""And we estimate that with the new taxation customers would end up paying an additional Â£2m a year in duty, so the cost of wine will increase because the taxation is going to rise."" Prosecco and pint taxes to fall, red wine to rise Rishi Sunak's Budget claims fact-checked A spokesman for the chain Majestic Wine said the move would have an effect on the ""day to day pricing of wines that most consumers drink"". It would ""inevitably have an impact on retailers' bottom lines - and whilst we will work hard to minimise the impact this has on our customers, it comes at a very challenging time for the industry"". Similarly, head of wine at the Adnams brewery, which is based in Southwold, Suffolk, said that reduced sales and compromised margins will make this sector ""increasingly unappealing to small business and entrepreneurship"". Increasing three tax bands to more than 20% would add ""complexity and cost to all drinks retailers in the UK. Clearly, we do not see this as simplification and would urge the government to listen to the WSTA and its members to reconsider this move,"" the spokesperson for Majestic Wine added. Instead of the government's proposals, The Wine Society said a simpler approach would be to apply tax bands across categories of alcohol, so any type of alcohol up to 5% ABV would be taxed at the same rate, with this rising for drinks of between 5% and 10% ABV, and so on. Alternatively, most still wine sold in the UK is 8.5%-15% ABV. Mr Mansour said one single tax rate could be applied to all wines in that range, fixing it at the mid-point of the band - so at 12%.

"The National Crime Agency can seize Â£5.6m from a sophisticated global money laundering scheme involving UK companies, a court has ruled. Financial investigators can take the money from the London-based family of Javanshir Feyziyev, an MP in the Azerbaijan parliament. The NCA had hoped to seize over Â£15m but hailed Monday's ruling a success. It comes as campaigners criticise the government for delaying new laws to target allegedly dirty money in the UK. The investigation was launched after the exposure of a corruption scandal dubbed the Azerbaijani laundromat. The NCA pored over thousands of leaked documents from Den Danske Bank, in Estonia, obtained by theOrganised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project,externaland other media organisations in 2017. There is evidence linking the ""laundromat"" scheme to Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev, international investigators say They showed $2.9bn (Â£2bn) had been moved into Western Europe by some of the Azeri elite, while UK shell companies - largely existing only on paper - hid the true sources of the cash. Some of it was used asa slush fundto bribe European politicians and make luxury purchases. ""Having exhaustively considered the evidence filed,"" district judge John Zani told Westminster Magistrates' Court, ""I am entirely satisfied that there was a significant money laundering scheme in existence in Azerbaijan, Estonia and Latvia, at the relevant time."" During the case, the NCA said cash had been funnelled out of Azerbaijan by Baktelekom - a ""clone company"" set up to look like the state-owned telecoms provider. ""It has no known employees, no website and no accounts have ever been traced,"" the court was told. Yet Baktelekom somehow managed to pay Hilux Services LLP, registered in Glasgow, $1.3bn for steel pipes. The money-laundering operation created bogus records for pipes that were never bought Hilux never filed accounts to Companies House, was unknown to Revenue & Customs, and the steel pipes were ""bogus"", according to the NCA. Judge Zani said invoices the company had filed to banks in Estonia and Latvia were ""entirely fictitious and were produced in order to deceive the bank into opening accounts and allowing the later flow of very significant sums into and out of their accounts so as to mask the underlying money laundering activities of those orchestrating the accounts"". One of the primary beneficiaries of payments from Hilux was a company called Avromed, the NCA said. Legal documents show Avromed LLC was founded by Mr Feyziyev. The judge said there was no suggestion Mr Feyziyev and his family had been engaged in corruption. But ""there have been unhealthy, corrupt links between the 'ruling elite' of Azerbaijan and those at the helm of Avromed Company LLC"". He ruled the NCA could seize Â£4.4m from the account of Mr Feyziyev's wife, Parvana, and Â£1m from their son Orkhan Javanshir. A further Â£240,000 must be forfeited by the couple's nephew Elman Javanshir. Javanshir Feyziyev's family has a London base and UK bank accounts The family, who own a mansion overlooking Regent's Park, in central London, denied the funds obtained by Mr Feyziyez had been obtained by criminal conduct. ""The adverse findings in this matter relate to money which, before it was paid to Dr Feyziyev, flowed through various intermediaries of which the family had neither knowledge, nor control,"" a spokesman said. While they were disappointed any of the frozen funds had been forfeited, he added: ""The Feyziyev family are relieved that the judge has ordered the release of approximately Â£10m, of which the NCA sought forfeiture, and that this long-running matter has at last been resolved, for the most part, in the family's favour."" But NCA civil-recovery head Andy Lewis said: ""This is a substantial forfeiture of money laundered through the Azerbaijan laundromat - and our success highlights the risk to anyone who uses these schemes."" Nevertheless, campaigners against corruption say the fight against allegedly dirty money is being undermined. ""There is over Â£700m that we've identified in real estate owned here by the ruling elite of Azerbaijan,"" Transparency UK policy director Duncan Hames said. ""There is an awful lot more to go after. ""If they had the resources to pursue more cases, it could make a bigger dent in Britain's dirty money problem."" Mr Hames criticised the government for backtracking on promising ""a register to lift the veil of secrecy over who really owns the foreign companies that hold real estate in the UK"". Last week, the prime minister's anti-corruption champion, junior minister Lord Agnew, resigned, complaining the government had made a ""foolish"" decision to kill off legislation during the next parliamentary year that would require those holding property through shell companies to declare who they were. ""The well of excuses after three or four years of promising this piece of legislation, or its related pieces, has now run dry,"" he said.

"Linda Thomas-Greenfield (R) warned of more Russian troops arriving in Belarus There have been angry clashes between Russian and US envoys at the UN Security Council, after the US called a meeting to discuss Moscow's troop build-up on its borders with Ukraine. US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the mobilisation was the biggest Europe had seen in decades. Her Russian counterpart accused the US of fomenting hysteria and unacceptable interference in Russia's affairs. The US and UK have promised further sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said legislation was being preparedwhich would target a wider range of individuals and businesses close to the Kremlin than is currently possible. A US official said Washington's sanctions meant individuals close to the Kremlin would be cut off from the international financial system. Russia has placed an estimated 100,000 troops, tanks, artillery and missiles near Ukraine's frontiers. Diplomatic efforts continue, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken due to hold talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later on Tuesday. The US said it had received a written response from Russia to a US proposal aimed at de-escalating the crisis in Ukraine. But hours later Russia's deputy foreign minister said that was not true and a source told Ria news agency it was still preparing a response. A state department spokesperson said the US remained fully committed to dialogue and would continue to consult closely with its allies and partners, including Ukraine. Meanwhile a number of European leaders are travelling to Ukraine on Tuesday for talks.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is flying to Kyivafter promising to work with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find a diplomatic solution to arguments with Moscow and ""avoid further bloodshed"". Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte are also heading to the Ukrainian capital. At Monday's UN Security Council meeting, Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said there was no proof that Russia was planning military action against Ukraine, and that its troop build-up was not confirmed by the UN. He said Russia often deployed troops on its own territory and that this was none of Washington's business. Russia had tried to block the open session of the UN body but was outvoted by 10 votes to two. The Biden administration was ""whipping up tensions and rhetoric, and provoking escalation"", Mr Nebenzya said. ""This isn't just unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of our state, it's also an attempt to mislead the international community about the true situation in the region and the reasons for the current global tensions,"" he said. Ms Thomas-Greenfield said the US continued to believe there was a diplomatic solution but warned that the US would act decisively if Russia invaded Ukraine, the consequences of which would be ""horrific"". ""This is the largest... mobilisation of troops in Europe in decades,"" she said. ""And as we speak, Russia is sending even more forces and arms to join them."" Moscow was planning to increase its force deployed in neighbouring Belarus, on Ukraine's northern border, to 30,000, she added. Late on Monday, the US ordered the departure of family members of American government employees from Belarus, citing the ""unusual and concerning Russian military build-up"". A similar order was earlier issued to families of US government personnel in the American embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Ukrainian forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine for eight years Moscow wants the West to promise Ukraine will never join the Nato alliance - in which members promise to come to another's aid in the event of an armed attack - but the US has rejected that demand. Nato's 30 members include the US and UK, as well as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - former Soviet republics which border Russia. Moscow sees Nato troops in eastern Europe as a direct threat to its security. Mr Putin has long argued the US broke a guarantee it made in 1990 that Nato would not expand further east, though interpretations differ over exactly what was promised. Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014.

"Prince Andrew has settled a civil sexual assault case brought against him in the US by Virginia Giuffre. The settlement comes a month after it was announced that Prince Andrew's military titles and royal patronages would be returned to the Queen and he would stop using the title His Royal Highness in an official capacity. The 61-year-old Duke of York is the third child of the Queen and he isninth in line to the throne,external. His elder siblings are Charles, Prince of Wales and Anne, the Princess Royal. He is divorced from Sarah, Duchess of York, with whom he has two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Prince Andrew loses military titles and use of HRH Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson in 1986 at Westminster Abbey The Duke of York has been accused of sexual abuse in a civil case in the US. In court documents, Virginia Giuffre says she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by Jeffrey Epstein from the age of 16. Part of her abuse involved being lent out to other powerful men - including Prince Andrew, she alleges. Ms Giuffre says the duke sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was under the age of 18. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all the allegations against him. He said in aninterview with BBC Newsnight in 2019that he had no recollection of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre. On 15 February a letter filed to the US district court on Tuesday said the duke and Ms Giuffre hadreached an out-of-court settlement. It said the duke - who makes no admission of liability - would pay an undisclosed sum to Ms Giuffre.

In addition, Prince Andrew has also agreed to make a ""substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights"".

In 2007, Prince Andrewsold his Sunninghill Park home for Â£15m - Â£3m more than the asking price- to Timor Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the then-president of Kazakhstan. The 12-bedroom house near Windsor Castle had been given to Prince Andrew as a wedding present from the Queen. How will Prince Andrew afford the payment? Prince Andrew will no longer be called His Royal Highness, or HRH, a royal source said. LikeHarry and Meghan,Prince Andrew retains his title HRH but will not use it in any official capacity. The duke had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, and served as a helicopter pilot during the 1982 Falklands War. He also commanded the mine countermeasures vessel HMS Cottesmore. Prince Andrew served as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot for 22 years His military appointments were suspended after he stepped back from public duties in 2019. But he has now lost a series of UK military titles: Colonel of the Grenadier Guards - one of the most senior infantry regiments in the British army. He took this role over from his father Prince Philip in 2017 Honorary air commodore of RAF Lossiemouth Colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment Colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps Colonel-in-chief of The Royal Lancers (Queen Elizabeth's Own) Colonel-in-chief of the Yorkshire Regiment Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm Royal colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers Royal colonel of the Royal Regiment of Scotland He has also lost a number of overseas honorary military titles: Colonel-in-Chief of the Queen's York Rangers (Canada) Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada Colonel-in-Chief of the Princess Louise Fusiliers (Canada) Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment Prince Andrew retains his service role as a Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy. Thejob of a royal patron is to bring publicity to a causeor service. Prince Andrew used to be a patron to about 200 charities and organisations. But after the controversial BBC interview in 2019, in which he denied allegations that he had sex with Virginia Giuffre, many chose to cut ties with him. They included the Outward Bound Trust, English National Ballet, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and London Metropolitan University. Prince Andrew had still been left with dozens of other patronages - including being a patron or member of prestigious golf clubs, schools and cultural trusts. But these have now been returned to the Queen and will be redistributed to other members of the Royal Family. All of Prince Andrew's roles have been immediately returned to his mother, the Queen After retiring from the Navy, Prince Andrew served as the UK's special representative for trade and investment for 10 years. But he gave up the title after he was criticised over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, who wassentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution. He had also attracted criticism for combining business with pleasure on his overseas trips, and some newspapers gave him the nickname ""Airmiles Andy"". The prince's judgement has also been questioned for holding meetings with Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif, and for entertaining the son-in-law of Tunisia's ousted president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali at Buckingham Palace. And in November 2010, a secret cable published on Wikileaks revealed a US ambassador wrote that he spoke ""cockily"" during an official engagement, leading a discussion that ""verged on the rude"". From 2011 to 2019, Prince Andrew was a working Royal. One focus was Pitch@Palace - an initiative he started to help entrepreneurs seeking investment. In 2020it removed Prince Andrew's name from its website, after prominent supporters distanced themselves amid revelations about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.

"Soviet forces advance on Seelow Heights Germany's refusal to send weapons to Ukraine has puzzled and angered some allies. But the reasons why Europe's most powerful country is standing back are historical and complex. There's a great grassy plain to the east of Berlin where the soil tells terrible stories. As farmers plough, their blades disturb human bones, weapons; the fragments of one of the most brutal battles of World War Two. It was spring 1945. Hitler was hiding in a bunker in Berlin, his troops in retreat. Soviet forces advanced from the east across the plain but, above them on a hill called the Seelow Heights, the Nazis had taken up a defensive position. It was, by all accounts, a muddy, chaotic bloodbath. The Soviets eventually prevailed, hastening the end of the war, but it's estimated up to 30,000 of their soldiers were killed. To visit the memorial at Seelow Heights is to understand how deeply entrenched this country's history remains in the minds of many Germans - and how the horrors of the 20th Century still influence its foreign policy today. It is one of the reasons Germany has refused to send weapons to Ukraine, prompting a furious response from politicians there. This is, by and large, a nation of pacifists. An annual survey reveals that most Germans believe diplomatic negotiation is the best way to resolve conflict. German troops rarely participate in anything other than peacekeeping missions; there are few exceptions - and they were controversial - including the Balkans in the 90s and, more recently, Afghanistan. It's also, ironically, one of the world's biggest arms exporters (though its output is dwarfed by that of the US and Russia). And it has strict controls over where weapons are sent, even if Angela Merkel's government was sometimes accused of not sticking to those rules. ""Germany has a longstanding policy of restraint when it comes to military conflict of all sorts and weapons export is seen as fuelling conflict rather than reducing conflict,"" says Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff from the German Marshall Fund. ""This longstanding policy says that Germany does not export arms into conflict zones."" Germany has departed from that principle, to arm Peshmerga fighters battling IS in Northern Iraq. But the situation in Ukraine is different, he says. The reason is history - the Nazi killings of millions of people in Ukraine and Russia. ""To export arms into the bloodlands that Germany helped to create, to supply one part of the bloodlands with armsâ¦ against the other part of the bloodlandsâ¦ is an anathema in the German political debate."" Merkel visits German troops in Afghanistan The situation on the Ukrainian border is testing Germany's new coalition government. Chancellor Olaf Scholz - who probably thought Covid would be his greatest challenge - is now under pressure from his international allies to shift his country to a new, more hawkish position. His government - a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats - came to power at the end of last year promising a values-based foreign policy and even stricter constraints on arms exports. Resisting calls - even from some within that government - to send weapons to Kiev, Chancellor Scholz has instead paid for a field hospital, offered to treat wounded soldiers in Germany and is sending 5,000 helmets to Ukraine. Because there's another reason for Germany's reluctance - many here simply don't believe that sending weapons will solve the crisis. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? How big is the Russian military build-up? Scholz's foreign minister, Green politician Annalena Baerbock, points out that Germany is a financial donor to Ukraine and believes that is more effective than sending arms. ""I do not think it's realistic to believe such weapons exports could turn around the military imbalance. The best protection is to prevent further aggression. The strongest weapon, if you want to use that word, is that we, united as Nato members, as EU states, as the G7, make clear every new aggression will have massive consequences."" Chancellor Scholz favours the dialogue-based approach pursued by his predecessor. Angela Merkel was instrumental, along with President Emmanuel Macron of France, in setting up the so-called Normandy format under which Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia aimed to establish a ceasefire in Eastern Ukraine. It's hoped that same format might work now. Nils Schmidt, foreign affairs spokesman for the chancellor's social democrats, says ""France and Germany are mediators and I think it's not very appropriate for a mediator nation to send weapons to Ukraine, to one conflict party, because we are trying to promote a diplomatic solution."" And Germany is well placed for such diplomacy. Chancellor Scholz may not have Mrs Merkel's clout with President Putin. But, thanks to their histories, Germany's relationship to Russia is unlike that of many other Western countries. This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian Marta Yuzkiv is preparing to defend her country but says she doesn't want war Thousands of German firms do business there. Many Germans - including Angela Merkel - grew up behind the Iron Curtain, learning Russian at school. Her ability to communicate regularly with Vladimir Putin when other leaders could not, was often attributed to their shared experience of life in the Communist East. What puzzles - and angers - many around the world (and a fair few in Germany too) is why Chancellor Scholz isn't playing his most obvious card. The two countries' economic ties are perhaps most controversially embodied in the Nordstream 2 pipeline, which, if and when it comes online, would double the amount of Russian gas coming into Europe via Germany. Chancellor Scholz is under pressure to scrap the project by way of a sanction against Russia. That he has not yet done so is, critics argue, emblematic of Germany's self-interest. It's a sore topic for his government. His social democrats, who say the pipeline is a private economic project, are behind it. But his partners, the FDP, say it's political and the Greens would dearly love to let it go. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Ukraine crisis Mr Scholz has indicated that, should Russia invade Ukraine, all options will be on the table, including the pipeline. But, in his quietly spoken way, has gone no further, prompting some to wonder whether history will judge him canny or weak and hesitant. ""It's wise to have a certain level of strategic ambiguity so that Putin cannot start calculating which price he would have to pay in case of doing this or that,"" says Nils Schmidt. ""That's why is so important to have all these options on the table."" And, in the meantime, as Vladimir Putin tests the nerves of the West, Germany faces fundamental questions about its pacifist instincts. Even towards the end of the Merkel era, calls were growing for Germany to take on a more substantial military role on the world stage. And, as visitors to Seelow Heights, who imagine the screams of Katyusha rockets and the shouts of dying men, will understand, Germany knows very well what is at stake - and the cost of getting it wrong.

"US President-elect Donald Trump has called on Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national incomes on defence. That is more than double the military alliance's current target of 2%. Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has also told member countries to boost military spending as part of a new ""wartime mindset"". Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in Washington DC in 1949 by 12 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK and the US. Nato was founded in Washington DC in April 1949 Nato'sprimary purpose,externalwas to block expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree thatif one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.,external Nato does not have its own army, but member states can take collective military action in response to crises. For instance, the body supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004. It alsoco-ordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises.,external Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America - the original 12 founders plus 20 countries which have joined since 1949. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries became members, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Having been neutral for decades,both applied to Nato in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia have also asked to join. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, the alliancesaid that Ukraine could eventually join,external. Former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in ""the long-term"" After Russia's invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for this process to be fast-tracked. Although then Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg reconfirmed Ukraine could join ""in the long term"", he said this would not happen until after the war ended. Nato currently asks every member country to spend at least 2% of national income - also known as GDP - on defence. It is thought that23 countries met that target in 2024, compared to only three in 2014. The countries which spend the largest share of GDP on defence are the US and those close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic states. In July 2024, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmersaid the UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. In December 2024, Nato secretary general Rutte said that member stateswould have to ""shift to a wartime mindset"" and spend ""considerably more than 2%"" on defence,external. During his first term as US president, Trump persuaded many Nato members to increase defence spending. In 2018 he said thatall countries in the alliance should be committing 4% of GDP. At a press conference at his Florida home in January 2025,Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5%,external, telling reporters: ""They can all afford it."" While campaigning for his second presidential term, Trumpsaid he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough, remarks which were strongly condemned by the White House and former Nato chief Stoltenberg. How much do Nato members spend on defence? Nato said Russia's invasion of Ukraine posed the""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"".,external The alliance has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia. However, individual member states have supplied arms and equipment. German research organisationthe Kiel Institute,externalsaid that the US had allocated 59.9bn euros (Â£49.7bn) for military support to Ukraine between February 2022 and October 2024. European Nato members provided 52.6bn euros (Â£43.7bn) over the same period. The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have sent anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems such as Patriot, artillery guns, tanks and drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles such as Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp. Atacms missiles can reach up to 300km (186 miles) and are hard to intercept due to their high speed In August 2024,Ukraine received two US-made F16 fighter jets- the first of more than 60 pledged by Nato member states. Since November 2024,the US and UK have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to hit targets within Russian territory. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?

"The foreign secretary said the measures would be the toughest sanctions on Russia yet Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced new legislation to expand the UK's sanctions regime in the event of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Currently the government can only impose sanctions on those directly linked to Russian actions in Ukraine. But the new powers will allow it to target a much broader range of individuals and businesses. Russia said the threat of more sanctions would backfire, hurting British companies and shareholders. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called it ""an undisguised attack on business"" and said it would lead to retaliatory measures ""based on our interests"". Russia has placed an estimated 100,000 troops, tanks, artillery and missiles near Ukraine's frontiers, but denies it plans to invade the former Soviet republic, which also borders the European Union. In a statement to the House of Commons, Ms Truss said the legislation - which will be in place by 10 February - would not impose sanctions automatically but provide for additional powers ""in the event of any further Russian incursion into Ukraine"". The Foreign Office says the new measures will allow the UK to act ""in lockstep with the US and other allies to freeze assets and ban travel"". ""We will make sure that those who share responsibility for the Kremlin's aggressive and destabilising action will share in bearing a heavy cost,"" Ms Truss said. ""Their assets in the UK will be frozen. No UK business or individual would be able to transact with them. And should they seek to enter the UK, they would be turned back."" ""Those in and around the Kremlin will have nowhere to hide,"" she added. Ms Truss said that the measures amounted to the toughest sanctions regime against Russia yet and were the biggest change in approach by the UK since Brexit. Reports suggest the US has also drawn up a list of individuals and relatives who could face sanctions. Ms Truss's statement came as the United Nations Security Council met at the request of the US to discuss Russia's troop build-up. US President Joe Biden released a statement at the start of the meeting warning Russia of ""severe consequences"" if it chose to ""walk away from diplomacy"". Russia had tried to block the meeting, with its UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya accusing Washington of unacceptable interference in its affairs and attempts to whip up hysteria. Ms Truss has previously spoken of a ""real threat"" of Russia invading Ukraine, which she says would be ""terrible for Europe"". The UK is also sending weapons to Ukraine and offering extra support to nearby Nato allies. This video can not be played Watch: Understand the Ukraine crisis with Ros Atkins in less than six minutes Is Russia preparing to invade? Why Germany isn't sending weapons to Ukraine Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? How will we know if war has started? Ms Truss was due to visit President Zelensky in Ukraine on Tuesday with the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. But on Monday night she announced on Twitter that she had tested positive for Covid-19 and would be working from home while she isolates. She is also due to visit Moscow within the next two weeks. In the statement earlier on Monday Ms Truss said the UK had already trained 20,000 troops in Ukraine, supplied anti-tank missiles, and given support to its navy and energy sector. The UK has more than 900 military personnel based in Estonia and more than 100 in Ukraine as part of a training mission, while a light cavalry squadron numbering about 150 is deployed to Poland. Russia wants the West to promise Ukraine will never join Nato, in which members promise to come to another's aid in the event of an armed attack, but the US has rejected that demand. Nato's 30 members include the US and UK, as well as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - former Soviet republics which border Russia. Moscow sees Nato troops in eastern Europe as a direct threat to its security. Mr Putin has long argued the US broke a guarantee it made in 1990 that Nato would not expand further east, though interpretations differ over exactly what was promised. Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014. It is also backing rebels who seized large swathes of the eastern Donbas region soon afterwards, and some 14,000 people have died in fighting there.

"This video can not be played The crime gangs cashing in on illegal waste Organised crime gangs are illegally burying thousands of tonnes of waste across Scotland, a BBC investigation has found. Some of the rubbish is being brought up from the north of England by the gangs, and is believed to include hazardous clinical waste from hospitals. Current affairs series Disclosure has been told that threats and intimidation are being used against landowners who refuse to allow waste to be buried on their land. One claimed to have been threatened that their animals would be killed if they did not agree to let waste be buried on their land, while many others spoken to by the BBC were too scared to go on the record. An insider from a criminal network told Disclosure that dumping waste had become as profitable as the drug trade. Sepa, Scotland's environmental regulator, says its resources are being stretched by the gangs' activities. Kath McDowall is a senior investigator with Sepa Kath McDowall, one of the senior investigators looking into the organised groups, said: ""When people typically think of waste crime they think of small-scale fly-tipping and they don't quite realise it's happening on this scale."" She said the Scottish Environment Protection Agency was up against gangs who had been involved in running drugs and weapons for decades. Ms McDowall said they had ""taken lessons they've learned from doing other types of criminality and are now applying it to waste"". However, she said the resources that Sepa had to deal with the problem were ""pretty finite."" The legitimate disposal of rubbish is an expensive business because of the cost of complying with tight regulations and landfill taxes. Criminal gangs who bypass these costs have a massive advantage over legitimate traders. Drew Murdoch said there was a risk that some smaller legal businesses could fold Drew Murdoch is managing director of J&M Murdoch and Son, a family-run waste business which has been operating legitimately for 50 years. ""There is now more of a criminal element in the waste industry than there has ever been before,"" he said. ""And that is largely due to the amount of money they can make out of illegally dealing with waste."" His company might make Â£50,000 from a Â£1m contract due to the costs of landfill taxes, insurance and disposing of materials correctly. ""An illegitimate firm or criminal enterprise could quote half of that and pocket pretty much most of the money,"" he said. Mr Murdoch said there was a risk that some smaller legal businesses could fold or turn to criminality to compete. A trailer found abandoned at the side of the A73 in Lanarkshire was filled with domestic household waste An insider from one criminal network involved in burying waste told Disclosure that waste was ""the new drugs"". ""It's an easy way to make money. It's completely hidden in plain sight - and the money from these waste gangs goes straight back into their organised criminal activities. ""It finances their drugs operations, their movement of weapons, people, whatever."" The insider claimed that one criminal gang from the north of England had multiple sites across Scotland which received waste driven up from England in lorries. At one of these sites, the landowner would be paid Â£350 per lorry, containing a mixture of domestic and hazardous clinical waste. The site receives five lorries a day, five days a week, adding up to more than Â£8,000 a week for the landowner alone. The insider said they knew that at least one of these sites had been operational for years. Surveillance photos show a criminal network from the north of England illegally burying waste in south Wales The BBC has been told the criminal gangs are using a network of brokers to identify parcels of land in Scotland where they can bury industrial quantities of waste. The brokers may identify landowners or farmers who they can either intimidate or pay to accept the waste. One gang targeted two farms in south Wales where they buried tonnes of household rubbish as well as hazardous clinical waste from hospitals. Natural Resources Wales, the environmental regulator, discovered the waste included syringes, used dressings, and blood vials. The same tactic is being used in Scotland, leading to one criminal network being actively investigated by Sepa. Waste like this - which was buried illegally in Wales - is now being brought to Scotland Another method is to fill old lorry trailers with waste and abandon them in laybys and quiet streets around the country. In the last 15 months, 12 trailers have been found across central Scotland - all of them filled with household and construction waste. Elsewhere, a derelict farm near Port Glasgow, in Inverclyde, has been filled with an estimated 10,000 tyres. One barn that is overflowing with tyres lies within a few metres of a housing estate. Tyres are classified as hazardous waste because of the polluting emissions they give off and their potential to catch fire. And when Sepa investigated an illegal waste site in Lanarkshire, it found that methane emissions from buried rubbish brought up from England were 60 times the legal limit. Methane is a major driver of climate change. Thousands of tyres have been illegally dumped at a farm in Port Glasgow Sepa does not have a specific clean-up fund, so it must redirect money from other environmental work when illegal dumps need to be cleared. Its environmental investigators say organised crime has gained a strong foothold in the waste trade. Richard Sinnott, an atmospheric scientist at Sepa, told the BBC it was an ""increasing trend"", and that he could not overstate how damaging it was to Scotland's environment. Sepa is currently investigating 234 cases of waste crime. Of those, 31 are of the highest concern due to links with serious and organised crime or the potential for severe environmental damage. The authority estimates that 15% of organised crime groups in Scotland now have interests in environmental businesses. These range from skip hire companies to waste hauliers and construction and demolition firms. Justice Secretary Keith Brown said work was starting to have an impact on the problem The Environmental Services Association last year estimated that criminality in the trade was costing the UK taxpayer more than Â£1bn a year. Scotland's Justice Secretary Keith Brown chairs the Serious and Organised Crime Taskforce, which five months ago made waste crime its top priority. He said he was aware of ""a great deal of activity"" in terms of waste coming across the border between England and Scotland. He added: ""The way that the environmental protection agency, our rural local authorities, and the police authorities, are working, is starting to make an impact on this serious problem.""

One claimed to have been threatened that their animals would be killed if they did not agree to let waste be buried on their land, while many others spoken to by the BBC were too scared to go on the record. An insider from a criminal network told Disclosure that dumping waste had become as profitable as the drug trade. Sepa, Scotland's environmental regulator, says its resources are being stretched by the gangs' activities. Kath McDowall is a senior investigator with Sepa Kath McDowall, one of the senior investigators looking into the organised groups, said: ""When people typically think of waste crime they think of small-scale fly-tipping and they don't quite realise it's happening on this scale."" She said the Scottish Environment Protection Agency was up against gangs who had been involved in running drugs and weapons for decades. Ms McDowall said they had ""taken lessons they've learned from doing other types of criminality and are now applying it to waste"". However, she said the resources that Sepa had to deal with the problem were ""pretty finite."" The legitimate disposal of rubbish is an expensive business because of the cost of complying with tight regulations and landfill taxes. Criminal gangs who bypass these costs have a massive advantage over legitimate traders. Drew Murdoch said there was a risk that some smaller legal businesses could fold Drew Murdoch is managing director of J&M Murdoch and Son, a family-run waste business which has been operating legitimately for 50 years. ""There is now more of a criminal element in the waste industry than there has ever been before,"" he said. ""And that is largely due to the amount of money they can make out of illegally dealing with waste."" His company might make Â£50,000 from a Â£1m contract due to the costs of landfill taxes, insurance and disposing of materials correctly. ""An illegitimate firm or criminal enterprise could quote half of that and pocket pretty much most of the money,"" he said. Mr Murdoch said there was a risk that some smaller legal businesses could fold or turn to criminality to compete. A trailer found abandoned at the side of the A73 in Lanarkshire was filled with domestic household waste An insider from one criminal network involved in burying waste told Disclosure that waste was ""the new drugs"". ""It's an easy way to make money. It's completely hidden in plain sight - and the money from these waste gangs goes straight back into their organised criminal activities. ""It finances their drugs operations, their movement of weapons, people, whatever."" The insider claimed that one criminal gang from the north of England had multiple sites across Scotland which received waste driven up from England in lorries. At one of these sites, the landowner would be paid Â£350 per lorry, containing a mixture of domestic and hazardous clinical waste. The site receives five lorries a day, five days a week, adding up to more than Â£8,000 a week for the landowner alone. The insider said they knew that at least one of these sites had been operational for years. Surveillance photos show a criminal network from the north of England illegally burying waste in south Wales The BBC has been told the criminal gangs are using a network of brokers to identify parcels of land in Scotland where they can bury industrial quantities of waste. The brokers may identify landowners or farmers who they can either intimidate or pay to accept the waste. One gang targeted two farms in south Wales where they buried tonnes of household rubbish as well as hazardous clinical waste from hospitals. Natural Resources Wales, the environmental regulator, discovered the waste included syringes, used dressings, and blood vials. The same tactic is being used in Scotland, leading to one criminal network being actively investigated by Sepa. Waste like this - which was buried illegally in Wales - is now being brought to Scotland Another method is to fill old lorry trailers with waste and abandon them in laybys and quiet streets around the country. In the last 15 months, 12 trailers have been found across central Scotland - all of them filled with household and construction waste. Elsewhere, a derelict farm near Port Glasgow, in Inverclyde, has been filled with an estimated 10,000 tyres. One barn that is overflowing with tyres lies within a few metres of a housing estate. Tyres are classified as hazardous waste because of the polluting emissions they give off and their potential to catch fire. And when Sepa investigated an illegal waste site in Lanarkshire, it found that methane emissions from buried rubbish brought up from England were 60 times the legal limit. Methane is a major driver of climate change. Thousands of tyres have been illegally dumped at a farm in Port Glasgow Sepa does not have a specific clean-up fund, so it must redirect money from other environmental work when illegal dumps need to be cleared. Its environmental investigators say organised crime has gained a strong foothold in the waste trade. Richard Sinnott, an atmospheric scientist at Sepa, told the BBC it was an ""increasing trend"", and that he could not overstate how damaging it was to Scotland's environment. Sepa is currently investigating 234 cases of waste crime. Of those, 31 are of the highest concern due to links with serious and organised crime or the potential for severe environmental damage. The authority estimates that 15% of organised crime groups in Scotland now have interests in environmental businesses. These range from skip hire companies to waste hauliers and construction and demolition firms. Justice Secretary Keith Brown said work was starting to have an impact on the problem The Environmental Services Association last year estimated that criminality in the trade was costing the UK taxpayer more than Â£1bn a year. Scotland's Justice Secretary Keith Brown chairs the Serious and Organised Crime Taskforce, which five months ago made waste crime its top priority. He said he was aware of ""a great deal of activity"" in terms of waste coming across the border between England and Scotland. He added: ""The way that the environmental protection agency, our rural local authorities, and the police authorities, are working, is starting to make an impact on this serious problem.""

"A house in Bensham, Gateshead, where the roof was blown off during Storm Malik Thousands of households are still without power in Scotland and north-east England, after two storms hit the UK at the weekend. Storms Malik and Corrie caused power cutsfor 118,000 homes in Scotlandand80,000 in northern England. On Monday evening, around 18,100 remained without power. On Saturday, two people were killed by falling trees - a boy in Staffordshire and a woman in Aberdeen. Several schools in Aberdeenshire, the Highlands and Moray were closed on Monday due to storm damage or power outages. And there has been major disruption to rail services between Edinburgh and Newcastle - with some lines closed on Monday morning. Much of Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England was under a yellow Met Office warning for wind over the weekend. Gusts of 92mph were recorded on Sunday night at Stornoway in the Western Isles. There is another yellow warning in place for parts of northern Scotland,externalon Tuesday between 06:00 GMT and 18:00, with gusts of up to 65mph expected. But the Met Office said the next few days would be much calmer before a brief cold snap on Thursday. Thousands without power as second storm hits Scotland Weather warning now in force in Northern Ireland Thousands into third day without power after storm In pictures: Storm Malik hits Scotland Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said about 16,900 were still without power on Monday evening, mostly in rural Aberdeenshire and the Angus border, while Northern Powergrid said 1,200 customers were without power across Northumberland, County Durham and Tyne & Wear. SSEN said restoration efforts would continue into Tuesday, with the possibility that for ""small clusters"" of customers this may extend into Wednesday. A car crushed by fallen bricks in Seaton Sluice, Northumberland A van at Apperley Bridge near Bradford was crushed by a fallen tree during Storm Malik. No-one was hurt. Trees in Aberdeenshire fell overnight during Storm Corrie Douglas Morrison, 51, who lives two miles from Kemnay, Aberdeenshire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had ""never seen this level of devastation"" to forest areas - ""I'm talking hundreds and hundreds of trees absolutely flattened and snapped like matchsticks"". He said his house had lost power at 08:00 GMT on Saturday and had come back on for a few hours on Sunday before being cut again. ""I just hope it comes on again today because as time passes it gets harder and harder because you lose your hot water, you lose the heat in your house, so let's just hope it comes on today,"" he said. Check the weather in your area Look at the map of power cuts in north-east England and you would be forgiven for thinking there's an alarming lack of electricity in the region. But this is very different from the chaos of Storm Arwen last November. This time only a small number of properties are without supply and more and more are being reconnected by the hour. Storm Arwen swept in from the north, an unusual direction for such weather. Storm Malik came from the west, where we are used to getting our weather from. Trees in particular are more resilient to a westerly as it's the prevailing wind direction. With Arwen, whole communities were left without power for several days - the aim for those without power now is to get them back on by the end of the day. A few areas cut off by Arwen have been hit again this weekend - but the message from Northern Powergrid is the length of time to fix should be much quicker. The damage is not comparable to what happened late last year. Peter Isgate, 65, who lives in Finchale Abbey Village in County Durham, told the PA news agency power had been off at the residential park where he lived since 10:00 on Saturday. He said that the average age there was around 70 and there were people with no heating and that nobody had been to see them. ""It's about heat and cold, old people feel it, and it just seems like they're getting ignored,"" he said. Disruption to trains continued into Monday,with ScotRail replacing a number of services with buses,external. The storms brought back memories of Storm Arwen which left thousands of homes without power for more than a week in Scotland and the north of England. Stewart Sexton, 58, from Alnwick, Northumberland, lost power for 35 hours over the weekend, having previously been badly affected by Storm Arwen, and said he was ""enraged"". ""This situation never happened before Arwen yet we did get storms,"" he said, blaming a lack of maintenance of the infrastructure and a resilience plan. Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was clear there had been a ""much stronger join-up between the power companies and the local resilience partnerships"" over the weekend. He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme there was an ""improving situation"" but said power companies and others had to explore how to build more resilience in the system. A number of welfare centres have been opened in Aberdeenshire for people needing showers and power, while hot food is being served at various school canteens.

"Ministers will meet later to decide whether or not to scrap mandatory Covid vaccinations for NHS staff in England. Front-line NHS workers in England must be fully vaccinated by 1 April, meaning they need a first dose by Thursday. If they are not jabbed by April, they will be redeployed or dismissed. Around 77,000 have had no jab at all. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the jabs requirement was being ""kept under review"" but thatit was the ""duty"" of NHS staff to get vaccinated. The policy was proposed when Delta was the dominant variant that was circulating and evidence showed being vaccinated significantly cut the risk of catching and spreading the virus. Since then, a more contagious and slightly milder variant called Omicron has emerged. It has led to an increase in breakthrough infections among people who are vaccinated, although the jabs are still doing a great job at preventing severe cases. Mr Javid told the Health and Social Care Select Committee on Tuesday that it was right to ""reflect"" on the policy now Omicron was dominant. But it is understood no final decisions have been made. The government has been under pressure from some within the health service to scrap the mandate, arguing that it would lead to a staffing crisis. The Royal College of Midwives warned the policy could have a""catastrophic impact"",externalon maternity services, while the Royal College of GPs and Royal College of Nursingcalled for the deadline to be delayed. But the Department of Health and Social Care has previously insisted the policy was ""the right thing to do to protect patients"". The UK Health Security Agency says vaccines have proven to be effective against hospitalisation, mortality, infection and transmission. ""Several studies have provided evidence that vaccines are effective at preventing infection,""a recent report said.,external ""Uninfected individuals cannot transmit; therefore, the vaccines are also effective at preventing transmission."" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told BBC Breakfast that while any change to policy would be a decision for the health secretary, he said ""fundamental facts"" had changed due to Omicron and so any decision would take that into account. There are practical and ethical reasons why the mandatory vaccination policy may go. On a practical level the NHS in England can ill-afford staff to be forced out - there are already nearly 100,000 vacancies. And then on an ethical level - as some staff are pointing out - is it right to insist on vaccination when the benefits are not overwhelmingly clear cut with the rise of the Omicron variant? Vaccination against hepatitis B is a condition of employment for some staff, but that is more than 90% effective against infection and immunity last for years. By comparison immunity against Covid infection after two doses has largely gone after 20 weeks. A booster can initially increase protection to around 70% but by 10 weeks that has started to wane significantly too. It certainly helps to reduce spread, but is it enough to over-ride freedom to choose? And if staffing levels drop further because of the mandate could the risks that pose outweigh the benefits the vaccine brings? Protests against the policyhave been held in cities across the country - and someNHS staff have said they are even considering moving to work in the UK nationswhere vaccination is not compulsory. There are no plans in Scotland and Wales to make Covid jabs mandatory for NHS workers or care home staff, while there will be a public consultation on the issue in Northern Ireland. Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing's director for England, said that while the college would urge all nursing staff to get vaccinated, it ""makes no sense"" to risk losing thousands of workers when there were already many vacancies. She told BBC Breakfast that losing nurses and care staff ""actually puts patients at more risk than not having nurses at all"". Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, said she was ""saddened for all the people who may have lost their jobs needlessly"", with mandatory vaccination already in place in that sector since November. She said the policy had had a ""devastating impact"". Government figures suggest 40,000 care staff had not been vaccinated by the deadline - but it is unclear how many of these lost their jobs because of medical exemptions and redeployment to roles away from the frontline. ""The people who we've lost, we hope they'll think about coming back and we will do everything we can to try and encourage them to come back, but they will have found other roles and they may be happier in their other roles now and not want to move again,"" she said. While the mandatory vaccinations policy is due to come in to force for NHS workers on 1 April, Thursday is the final day on which workers could get their first dose with time to be fully vaccinated by that date due to the separation needed between first and second doses. The latest figures show that almost 95% of NHS staff have had at least one Covid jab, leaving about 77,000 who have not. That compares to around 91% of the general population in England who have had at least one jab, although that includes people aged 12 and over. Speaking to MPs on the select committee last week, Mr Javid said not all of them were in patient-facing roles. He said that while it was the ""professional duty of every NHS worker to get vaccinated"" it was ""reasonable to assume"" that not everyone would do so. Mr Javid said the jabs requirement would be ""kept under review"". When pressed on whether that meant the government was considering scrapping it he added: ""We're reflecting on it because we do have to accept that the virus has changed."" One of those who has said he isprepared to lose his job over mandatory vaccinesis specialist paramedic Matt Taylor, 42, who is unvaccinated. He works in primary care in Cumbria and said that he found the argument for the vaccine ""a bit weak"" as the vaccine has not eradicated Covid as some jabs have done with other diseases in the past.

"The agricultural sector is a significant part of the economy in Northern Ireland Agri-food business groups have urged assembly members to back a new law that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 82% by 2050. But a coalition of environmental groups are calling on assembly members to set a tougher net-zero target. The business groups say the tougher target would result in ""significant damage"" to the rural economy. The draft law, known as Climate Change (No.2) Bill, will be considered by the assembly on Tuesday. It is one of two climate change draft laws currently before the assembly. The Climate Change (No.1) Bill proposes to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. It is a private members bill brought forward by Green Party leader Clare Bailey. The second bill, brought by the Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots, sets a target of an 82% reduction in emissions by 2050. That figure is aligned with what the government's climate advisory body, the Committee on Climate Change,says is practically possiblegiven Northern Ireland's relativity large agriculture sector. A short-lived bid to find a compromise between the two bills foundered in the autumn. Assembly members from the Green Party, Sinn FÃ©in and Alliance have proposed amendments to Mr Poots' bill, which would effectively bring it in line with Ms Bailey's bill. The business groups, which include the Ulster Farmers' Union and NI Food & Drink, have written to assembly members asking them to reject the amendments. They say the target of 82% is ""extremely challenging"" for the sector but they support it because it is ""grounded in science and based on the concept of everyone doing their fair share"". However, they say a net-zero target would lead to the livestock sector becoming a ""cottage industry"" and mean ""large job losses in food processing, and rural communities ruined, while our food will have to be imported from countries with much higher emissions and at higher cost"". Edwin Poots' bill is one of two climate bills making their way through the Northern Ireland Assembly They describe amendments aimed at providing protections for agri-food under net zero as having ""no substance or value"". A coalition of environmental groups, including the RSPB and Friends of the Earth, are urging assembly members to support the amendments. Will 2022 be the year NI gets climate change laws? Where does NI stand on climate change? Friends of the Earth say the amendments will make the legislation ""stronger, fairer and more independent - including a just transition, a zero-carbon target, independent oversight and clear policies across government departments"". Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK without its own climate legislation, though it is contributing to wider UK reduction targets. In 2020, the Committee on Climate Change suggested an 82% reduction by 2050 would be ""an equitable contribution"" for Northern Ireland to the UK's net-zero ambition. It said the economic reliance on agriculture, Northern Ireland's biggest emitting sector, would make it difficult to go further and faster without a significant reduction in agricultural output. Will 2022 be the year NI gets climate change laws? How has powering Northern Ireland changed? Where does NI stand on climate change?

"This video can not be played Clean-up begins in Scotland after storms Corrie and Malik Thousands of homes have been spending another day without power after two storms battered parts of Scotland. More than 80,000 homes lost supply during Storm Malik on Saturday before Storm Corrie hit 38,000 more on Sunday. The electricity network in the north east and the Highlands were worst affected by the gusts of up to 92mph. Scottish and Southern Energy Networks said about 16,900 were still off at 20.00 on Monday, mostly in rural Aberdeenshire and the Angus border. SSEN earlier said power had been restored in badly-impacted Stonehaven. About 19,000 were cases related to two major faults affecting about 13,000 customers in the Stonehaven area, and 6,000 in Deeside. The Met Office has also issued a yellow weather warning due to forecasted wind gusts of up to 65mph across the north and north east of Scotland valid from 06:00 on Tuesday until 18:00.

""It's almost like it's every time there's a storm now - the last four storms we've had three power cuts."" BBC Scotland's Euan McIlwraith said the wind blew across the stubble fields in Banff and picked up the chaff, creating a bizarre spectacle. ""We had drifts of straw three feet deep so we were blocked off by what looked like snow drifts but was actually drifts of straw. It was the most bizarre thing,"" he told Good Morning Scotland. Trees were felled by strong winds around Lews Castle College in Stornoway Tree cutting in Aviemore was being carried out Several schools in Aberdeenshire, the Highlands and Moray were closed due to storm damage or power outages. In the Highlands, SSEN welfare centres were set up in Cannich and Munlochy to offer hot food and drinks for people without power. On Sunday evening, Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team had a ""full team call-out"" for a missing walker in high winds and snow on the Cairngorm Plateau.

He said the east and north was ""a bit more problematical"" , where routes are being checked in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen, and on the line from Perth to Inverness. There are also some large trees down between Aberdeen and Inverurie. ""It is an improving situation - we've had staff out through the night clearing trees and clearing debris,"" Mr Simpson added. A lorry overturned in the Drumlithie area Most routes are expected to reopen during the course of the morning but travellers should check before they travel. Other travel problems include: A92 in Aberdeenshire closed at Bridge of Muchalls and Stonehaven after a lorry overturned. A90 Laurencekirk both directions restricted because of  a fallen tree. A9 partially blocked near Golspie in the Highlands because of a fallen tree.

""We have to explore - and the power companies particularly have to do this - how we can build more resilience into the network,"" he said. ""Some of that may be at the elementary end of the spectrum of undertaking proactive tree cutting to make sure that power lines are protected as far as possible from the falling of trees. ""At the other end of the spectrum we have to be constantly looking at what should be the resilience of the network - should we have as many overhead power lines? ""Should we look to be undergrounding power lines? Obviously there'll be a financial impact of that on the investment that's got to be made in the network but these are all issues that need to be looked at given the increased severity and incidents of this type."" A 60-year-old woman in Aberdeen and a nine-year-old boy in Staffordshire were killed by falling trees during Saturday's storm. Fallen trees and flying debris also caused widespread structural damage in addition to power outages which affected 80,000 customers. One woman in Oyne, Aberdeenshire told the BBC a tree crashed through her hand-built porch, narrowly missing her home. Parts of the roof were blown off Huntly Falconry Centre allowing four falcons to escape - owners appealed for help to track them down. And in Glasgow, people living near a landmark tower were evacuated from their homes amid fears for its safety. An exclusion zone was set up around the Trinity building at Lynedoch Street after Glasgow City Council said its ""structural deterioration"" had been worsened by high winds.

"The Queen will be 96 when the main Jubilee celebrations kick off in June Stars including Ross Kemp and Gareth Southgate are hoping to break the record for Britain's biggest ever national party as part of the Queen's Jubilee celebrations. The first ever national Thank You Day was held last year for people to thank those in their community - and is returning for a second year. It is being held on Sunday 5 June to coincide with the Platinum Jubilee. Actor Kemp said if more than 10 million people take part, it will be a record. Although there are no official figures, estimates suggest 8.5 million peoplejoined celebrations for the last Jubileein 2012, while 10 million peopleattended street parties to celebrate the weddingof Prince Charles and Princess Diana in 1981. The Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977 also saw thousands of parties held across the UK - with 4,000 in London alone. Celebrations revealed for Queen's Platinum Jubilee What do people buy the Queen for her Jubilee? ""We want to get as many people as possible to get out into the community with friends and families and let's have a party,"" Kemp told BBC Breakfast. ""You can bring wine and cheese if you wish, but this is not a business meeting, this is a party."" The star added: ""77 was a big one for me. I can remember it being such a special time, such a joyous time. Friends and family. I lived in a close in Essex and everybody came to it, everybody came. ""We want as many people as possible to get involved. And if we make it over 10 million, then that is a national record. ""It's history, she is our history. So we're celebrating that."" This video can not be played Watch: Ross Kemp talks royal celebrations...and his favourite cake As well as Kemp, the national party day is being backed by other big names including Gary Lineker, Levi Roots, Lorraine Kelly, Ellie Simmonds, Prue Leith, Alan Titchmarsh and Anne Wafula Strike. Organisers say the idea behindNational Thank You Day,externalthis year is for people to show their appreciation of both the Queen and each other - and to get together with neighbours to share a Big Jubilee Lunch. It is being backed by institutions and groups including the NHS, FA, National Lottery Community Fund, Royal Voluntary Service, the Scouts and the Church of England. The Queen taking part in a Silver Jubilee walkabout in 1977 Lisa Hunter, who is helping to plan the events, urged people hoping to hold street parties or local celebrations to speak to their local authority about road closures. A four-day UK bank holiday weekend from 2 to 5 June is being held to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee - to mark her 70 years on the throne. Other events being planned include a competition to create a new pudding, pageants and parades. Last year's National Thank You Day in July - the first one -saw events take place across the countryincluding an interfaith ceremony at Coventry Cathedral and 1,000 roses handed out in Bradford. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also hosted a barbecue for community leaders, NHS workers and representatives from the Royal Voluntary Service. On10 Januarythe Platinum Pudding Competition starts. Members of the public are invited to create a dish to dedicate to the Queen's reign. From12 to 15 May, more than 500 horses and 1,000 performers will take part in a 90-minute show at Windsor Castle, taking the audience on a journey through history from Elizabeth I to present day. The first day of the long weekend isThursday 2 Juneand will see Trooping the Colour held in full for the first time since the pandemic. There will be more than 1,400 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians taking part. Tickets are available to the public from next weekon this site,external. Also that day, Platinum Jubilee beacons will be lit in more than 1,500 locations across the UK, the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas Territories. For the first time, the capital cities of Commonwealth countries will also light beacons. OnFriday 3 June- the second day of the Bank Holiday weekend - a Service of Thanksgiving for the Queen's reign will be held at St Paul's Cathedral. OnSaturday 4 Junethe Queen will be joined by members of the Royal Family at the Derby, held at Epsom Downs. There will also be a Platinum Party at Buckingham Palace, with members of the public invited to apply to attend a live concert. Performers have yet to be named, but it is billed as bringing together some of the world's biggest stars to celebrate the most significant moments from the Queen's seven-decade reign. The ballot for UK residents to secure tickets will be launched in February. OnSunday 5 Junepeople across the country will be invited to sit down together to take part in the Big Jubilee Lunch, with street parties held across the UK. That day's events will also include the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, which will feature 5,000 people from the UK and the Commonwealth performing around the area of Buckingham Palace. The palace promises ""pomp and ceremony, street arts, theatre, music, circus, costumes as well as cutting-edge visual technology"". Primary and secondary school children are invited tocreate a picture of their hopes and aspirations,externalfor the planet over the next 70 years. A selection of these will be transferred on to silk flags, which will carried by secondary school pupils in the pageant. And there will also be a National Thank You Day.

"Ministers will meet later to decide whether or not to scrap mandatory Covid vaccinations for NHS staff in England. Front-line NHS workers in England must be fully vaccinated by 1 April, meaning they need a first dose by Thursday. If they are not jabbed by April, they will be redeployed or dismissed. Around 77,000 have had no jab at all. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the jabs requirement was being ""kept under review"" but thatit was the ""duty"" of NHS staff to get vaccinated. The policy was proposed when Delta was the dominant variant that was circulating and evidence showed being vaccinated significantly cut the risk of catching and spreading the virus. Since then, a more contagious and slightly milder variant called Omicron has emerged. It has led to an increase in breakthrough infections among people who are vaccinated, although the jabs are still doing a great job at preventing severe cases. Mr Javid told the Health and Social Care Select Committee on Tuesday that it was right to ""reflect"" on the policy now Omicron was dominant. But it is understood no final decisions have been made. The government has been under pressure from some within the health service to scrap the mandate, arguing that it would lead to a staffing crisis. The Royal College of Midwives warned the policy could have a""catastrophic impact"",externalon maternity services, while the Royal College of GPs and Royal College of Nursingcalled for the deadline to be delayed. But the Department of Health and Social Care has previously insisted the policy was ""the right thing to do to protect patients"". The UK Health Security Agency says vaccines have proven to be effective against hospitalisation, mortality, infection and transmission. ""Several studies have provided evidence that vaccines are effective at preventing infection,""a recent report said.,external ""Uninfected individuals cannot transmit; therefore, the vaccines are also effective at preventing transmission."" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told BBC Breakfast that while any change to policy would be a decision for the health secretary, he said ""fundamental facts"" had changed due to Omicron and so any decision would take that into account. There are practical and ethical reasons why the mandatory vaccination policy may go. On a practical level the NHS in England can ill-afford staff to be forced out - there are already nearly 100,000 vacancies. And then on an ethical level - as some staff are pointing out - is it right to insist on vaccination when the benefits are not overwhelmingly clear cut with the rise of the Omicron variant? Vaccination against hepatitis B is a condition of employment for some staff, but that is more than 90% effective against infection and immunity last for years. By comparison immunity against Covid infection after two doses has largely gone after 20 weeks. A booster can initially increase protection to around 70% but by 10 weeks that has started to wane significantly too. It certainly helps to reduce spread, but is it enough to over-ride freedom to choose? And if staffing levels drop further because of the mandate could the risks that pose outweigh the benefits the vaccine brings? Protests against the policyhave been held in cities across the country - and someNHS staff have said they are even considering moving to work in the UK nationswhere vaccination is not compulsory. There are no plans in Scotland and Wales to make Covid jabs mandatory for NHS workers or care home staff, while there will be a public consultation on the issue in Northern Ireland. Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing's director for England, said that while the college would urge all nursing staff to get vaccinated, it ""makes no sense"" to risk losing thousands of workers when there were already many vacancies. She told BBC Breakfast that losing nurses and care staff ""actually puts patients at more risk than not having nurses at all"". Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, said she was ""saddened for all the people who may have lost their jobs needlessly"", with mandatory vaccination already in place in that sector since November. She said the policy had had a ""devastating impact"". Government figures suggest 40,000 care staff had not been vaccinated by the deadline - but it is unclear how many of these lost their jobs because of medical exemptions and redeployment to roles away from the frontline. ""The people who we've lost, we hope they'll think about coming back and we will do everything we can to try and encourage them to come back, but they will have found other roles and they may be happier in their other roles now and not want to move again,"" she said. While the mandatory vaccinations policy is due to come in to force for NHS workers on 1 April, Thursday is the final day on which workers could get their first dose with time to be fully vaccinated by that date due to the separation needed between first and second doses. The latest figures show that almost 95% of NHS staff have had at least one Covid jab, leaving about 77,000 who have not. That compares to around 91% of the general population in England who have had at least one jab, although that includes people aged 12 and over. Speaking to MPs on the select committee last week, Mr Javid said not all of them were in patient-facing roles. He said that while it was the ""professional duty of every NHS worker to get vaccinated"" it was ""reasonable to assume"" that not everyone would do so. Mr Javid said the jabs requirement would be ""kept under review"". When pressed on whether that meant the government was considering scrapping it he added: ""We're reflecting on it because we do have to accept that the virus has changed."" One of those who has said he isprepared to lose his job over mandatory vaccinesis specialist paramedic Matt Taylor, 42, who is unvaccinated. He works in primary care in Cumbria and said that he found the argument for the vaccine ""a bit weak"" as the vaccine has not eradicated Covid as some jabs have done with other diseases in the past.

"Boris Johnson has vowed that a plan to overhaul EU laws copied over after Brexit will encourage business to invest in the UK. The prime minister said a ""Brexit Freedoms Bill"" will make it easier to change thousands of EU-era regulations that remain in force. He said the it would allow the UK to set growth-friendly rules for ""cutting edge technologies of the future"". But the plan has been criticised by the devolved administrations. Since Brexit the UK has moved away from EU laws in certain areas, including on immigration, payments to farmers, and gene-editing rules for crops. But the prime minister has been under increasing pressure in recent months from MPs on the right of his party to go further. Former Brexit minister Lord Frost resigned last year, calling for the government to deliver on the opportunities Brexit presented, adding in his letter to the PM: ""You know my concerns about the current direction of travel."" Did the EU ban crown marks on pint glasses? What's been causing lorry queues at Dover? In an announcement for the two-year anniversary of the UK's exit from the EU, No 10 said its new bill would ensure changes can be made more easily. Speaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said it would allow the UK to shape better regulations in areas where it is ""strong"" - citing areas like cyber technology, artificial intelligence, and gene editing. ""There are things that we can do differently in a way that will encourage business to invest even more,"" he told reporters. ""We won't diverge for the sake of it, but we're going to make sure this is the number one place to invest and do business because of freedoms that we have,"" he added. Downing Street said the changes would build on others since Brexit, which include: a move tosimplify alcohol dutiesfrom 2023 by moving way from EU-wide rules scrapping the EU-mandated 5%rate of VAT on tampons creating a new UK regime for regulating government support to industry The UK copied over the laws to smooth its exit from the EU on 31 January 2020, and kept them during a transition period that ended in January 2021. Since September, the government has been reviewing which of these it wants to keep in place, ditch or amend. Under Brexit withdrawal legislation passed in 2018, retained EU laws have a legal status of their own - and a special process for changing them. Downing Street said it wanted to make it easier for MPs to change these laws, arguing that removing or changing them could otherwise take years. It did not specify the provisions in the bill or how it calculated a claim that businesses would save Â£1bn through the cutting of red tape. Legislation inherited after Brexit - ""retained EU law"" in the jargon - can only be changed if Parliament passes new laws. But the ""Brexit Freedoms Bill"" will change that, by giving ministers more power to alter retained EU law more quickly, and not necessarily with votes in Parliament. It's very unlikely that the fussy clerks in the House of Commons will allow the government to give the bill such a political name, and so I bet it gets relabelled as something much more boring. Whatever it's called, to Conservative backbenchers it promises a bout of post-Brexit deregulation. But the same MPs will also worry that it's a power-grab by ministers at their expense. It's part of a policy blitz this week that's visible from space. There's going to be a new compensation scheme for airline passengers whose flights are delayed. Also due is the paper fleshing out the PM's flagship policy of ""levelling up"". But all of this could be made to look like a sideshow by two things the government has no control over: Sue Gray's report into lockdown-busting parties in Whitehall that could drop at any time, and the diplomatic crisis between Ukraine and Russia. However, the bill has sparked concerns in the devolved administrations - which have obtained new powers in certain policy areas since Brexit. A source said that a meeting between the Attorney General Suella Braverman and devolved ministers on Saturday was ""last-minute, fractious, and cack-handed"". The Scottish government's Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution Angus Robertson said the bill would ""undermine devolution"". And Mick Antoniw, the Welsh Minister for the Constitution, said the UK government was driving a ""coach and horses through the concept of mutual consent"". The situation in Northern Ireland is more complicated because of its special Brexit deal, known as the Protocol, which the UK iscurrently trying to renegotiate. It keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, meaning that a significant amount of EU law continues to apply. For example,there are question marksover whether the changes to alcohol taxes will be allowed. The UK government said it would ""continue to work closely with the devolved administrations"". Meanwhile, Labour criticised ministers for not using Brexit to scrap VAT on energy bills, which had to be at least 5% in the EU. Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said the public ""overwhelmingly support"" the change, adding: ""It is time the government started listening"".

"Lisa wants to help other women who may be struggling with similar issues An awareness campaign is being launched to support an estimated one million UK women at risk of harmful gambling. The charity Gamble Aware says some may not recognise the warning signs or feel too much shame and stigma to seek help. The estimates come from a nationally representative YouGov poll of 9,649 women, using a recognised scoring system -Problem Gambling Severity Index,external- to measure gambling harms. It suggests half a million could be dangerously hooked. The campaign will run until March across TV, social and digital channels. Lisa Walker, 49, from Rainham in east London, struggled with compulsive gambling for more than a decade. Her habit escalated in her late 20s, after she won a large sum of money playing poker. ""I won over Â£127,000 in one night. That was the worst night of my life because that's when my addiction really started to spiral out of control. ""The casino wanted me back and they offered me anything I wanted - free drinks, free meals to entice me."" She says she would go there often, as well as nipping into the local bingo hall and betting shop, to feed what had become a damaging habit. ""Most days I thought about gambling and most days I did gamble. It got to the stage where I didn't have any value of money any more."" Eventually, she lost all of her winnings, as well as her home, after re-mortgaging her house to keep gambling. She ended up staying in a hostel for a while with her two children, who were 10 and 11 at the time.

Paul Merson: 'I wouldn't wish this on anybody' Widow urges gambling reform after husband's death Shilton calls for change to gambling laws At 45, Lisa's addiction continued. She even chose to marry her partner at a venue in Vegas - then spent her wedding night gambling at the casino rather than celebrating with her groom and guests. When she returned from Vegas, Lisa realised she needed help, as gambling had taken her to a ""deep, dark place"" where she could think of nothing else. Lisa decided to attend a Gamblers Anonymous meeting, where she was one of two women among 35 men. She now attends meetings every week and is starting to see more women come to the meetings.

"Boris Johnson has vowed that a plan to overhaul EU laws copied over after Brexit will encourage business to invest in the UK. The prime minister said a ""Brexit Freedoms Bill"" will make it easier to change thousands of EU-era regulations that remain in force. He said the it would allow the UK to set growth-friendly rules for ""cutting edge technologies of the future"". But the plan has been criticised by the devolved administrations. Since Brexit the UK has moved away from EU laws in certain areas, including on immigration, payments to farmers, and gene-editing rules for crops. But the prime minister has been under increasing pressure in recent months from MPs on the right of his party to go further. Former Brexit minister Lord Frost resigned last year, calling for the government to deliver on the opportunities Brexit presented, adding in his letter to the PM: ""You know my concerns about the current direction of travel."" Did the EU ban crown marks on pint glasses? What's been causing lorry queues at Dover? In an announcement for the two-year anniversary of the UK's exit from the EU, No 10 said its new bill would ensure changes can be made more easily. Speaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said it would allow the UK to shape better regulations in areas where it is ""strong"" - citing areas like cyber technology, artificial intelligence, and gene editing. ""There are things that we can do differently in a way that will encourage business to invest even more,"" he told reporters. ""We won't diverge for the sake of it, but we're going to make sure this is the number one place to invest and do business because of freedoms that we have,"" he added. Downing Street said the changes would build on others since Brexit, which include: a move tosimplify alcohol dutiesfrom 2023 by moving way from EU-wide rules scrapping the EU-mandated 5%rate of VAT on tampons creating a new UK regime for regulating government support to industry The UK copied over the laws to smooth its exit from the EU on 31 January 2020, and kept them during a transition period that ended in January 2021. Since September, the government has been reviewing which of these it wants to keep in place, ditch or amend. Under Brexit withdrawal legislation passed in 2018, retained EU laws have a legal status of their own - and a special process for changing them. Downing Street said it wanted to make it easier for MPs to change these laws, arguing that removing or changing them could otherwise take years. It did not specify the provisions in the bill or how it calculated a claim that businesses would save Â£1bn through the cutting of red tape. Legislation inherited after Brexit - ""retained EU law"" in the jargon - can only be changed if Parliament passes new laws. But the ""Brexit Freedoms Bill"" will change that, by giving ministers more power to alter retained EU law more quickly, and not necessarily with votes in Parliament. It's very unlikely that the fussy clerks in the House of Commons will allow the government to give the bill such a political name, and so I bet it gets relabelled as something much more boring. Whatever it's called, to Conservative backbenchers it promises a bout of post-Brexit deregulation. But the same MPs will also worry that it's a power-grab by ministers at their expense. It's part of a policy blitz this week that's visible from space. There's going to be a new compensation scheme for airline passengers whose flights are delayed. Also due is the paper fleshing out the PM's flagship policy of ""levelling up"". But all of this could be made to look like a sideshow by two things the government has no control over: Sue Gray's report into lockdown-busting parties in Whitehall that could drop at any time, and the diplomatic crisis between Ukraine and Russia. However, the bill has sparked concerns in the devolved administrations - which have obtained new powers in certain policy areas since Brexit. A source said that a meeting between the Attorney General Suella Braverman and devolved ministers on Saturday was ""last-minute, fractious, and cack-handed"". The Scottish government's Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution Angus Robertson said the bill would ""undermine devolution"". And Mick Antoniw, the Welsh Minister for the Constitution, said the UK government was driving a ""coach and horses through the concept of mutual consent"". The situation in Northern Ireland is more complicated because of its special Brexit deal, known as the Protocol, which the UK iscurrently trying to renegotiate. It keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, meaning that a significant amount of EU law continues to apply. For example,there are question marksover whether the changes to alcohol taxes will be allowed. The UK government said it would ""continue to work closely with the devolved administrations"". Meanwhile, Labour criticised ministers for not using Brexit to scrap VAT on energy bills, which had to be at least 5% in the EU. Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said the public ""overwhelmingly support"" the change, adding: ""It is time the government started listening"".

"UK food and drink firms say they remain concerned about supply shortages as a deal which ensured carbon dioxide (CO2) supplies comes to an end. CO2 is used in fizzy drinks, to keep packaged food fresh and to stun livestock before slaughter. CO2 usersagreed a three-month dealin October to keep a key production site open after its owner said high energy prices made it too expensive to run. The arrangement ends on Monday, raising questions over the future of supplies. Industry body the Food and Drink Federation is warning that supermarkets could suffer shortages of some foods if the deal with US firm CF Industries is not extended. Why are gas prices so high? What's CO2 used for in food and drink? Food firms fear CO2 shortages if deal not struck CF Industries, which supplies 60% of the UK's industrial CO2, said it would ""continue to negotiate"" with its customers to ""extend CO2 offtake and pricing agreements"". After previously putting up money to reopen the plant in September,and brokering the October deal, the government has said it is now up to CO2 firms to ensure continued supplies. ""We are continuing to work closely with both the hospitality and food and drink industries, and do not expect any significant disruption to essential food supplies,"" a spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said. Last year, CF Industries temporarily shut its facilities at Ince in Cheshire and Billingham on Teessideafter fertiliser manufacturing became uneconomic because of the rising price of natural gas. This resulted in an acute shortage of CO2. Supermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks. CF Industries reopened its Billingham plant in September after the government agreed to provide financial support to keep it running for three weeks. The company agreed to continue supplies of gas until the end of this month -but gave no guarantees beyond that. A Food and Drink Federation spokesperson said that with energy prices ""still very high"", there could be further CO2 shortages which could result in supermarket shortages that would add pressure on to families already coping with high food-price inflation. ""We will continue to work with the government on this,"" the Food and Drink Federation said. ""It is critical that together we ensure supply can continue and that we build long-term resilience into the production of food-grade CO2,"" they added. The British Poultry Council (BPC), which represents producers of half the meat eaten in the UK, said it was ""imperative"" that the government continued to ""honour its commitment"" to food security by ensuring ""little to no disruption"" to supply chains in the event of a CO2 shortage. ""If CO2 continues to be actively prioritised by government for the livestock sector (along with nuclear and healthcare) on the grounds of maintaining food supply and avoiding bird welfare issues, industry can continue to keep food moving,"" a BPC spokesperson added. The market for industrial CO2 - a pure, compressed form of the gas - is a highly unusual one, which is why this problem has been hard to fix. Though supplies are crucial for many food and drink producers, as well as some medical procedures and the nuclear industry, it is only made as a by-product of other processes. So if there is a disturbance to those other industries, the CO2 gets switched off as an unintended consequence. This is what happened last autumn, when the UK's two biggest sources, CF Industries and a bioethanol plant at Wilton on Teesside, were both shut down at once. Fixing the problem has proved tricky. Industrial CO2 is difficult to transport and store, and it is difficult to import much more because there are shortages across Europe. In addition, new production facilities cannot be opened in three months. Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, told the Financial Times in September he was ""as surprised as anyone"" to learn how crucial the CO2 he sold was to UK industries. By Ben King, business reporter CF Industries keeps its cards close to its chest. But this winter it might be easier for them to justify keeping the crucial plant at Billingham open, even though gas prices remain high. The CO2 it produces, so vital to so many industries, is made as a by-product from producing ammonia, a chemical used in fertiliser manufacture and other industrial processes. And it's a great time to be making ammonia. World ammonia prices have surged since September, when the government reached into its pocket to convince CF Industries to turn Billingham back on. The global benchmark price, CFR Tampa, has almost doubled to a record high of $1,135 a tonne this month, according to market data provider Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS). And if war disrupts the 20% of global supply which comes from Russia and Ukraine, prices could go higher still. ""If I was an ammonia producer at the moment, I would want to keep on producing,"" said Richard Ewing, who watches the ammonia market at ICIS. But only CF Industries will know if this is enough to keep Billingham open. How much are energy bills going up?

"Paramedic Matt Taylor says he is prepared to lose his job because he has not had a coronavirus vaccine Matt Taylor is a specialist paramedic who has worked through the pandemic treating elderly and vulnerable people in their homes. He hasn't had a Covid-19 vaccination and says he's prepared to lose his job over it. He's one of around 80,000 unvaccinated NHS staff in England being told if they work with patients and don't get a jab by next week they could be moved to a different role or even sacked. ""There's nothing that says 'thank you' more than an email three days before Christmas telling you that if you don't do what they tell you to do you're not going to have a job,"" he says. Under the government's current rules,NHS England staff must have a first jab by 3 February to allow time to be fully vaccinated by 1 April to continue in frontline roles. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said the policy is ""under review"". Pressed on whether that meant the government was considering scrapping the plan he added: ""We're reflecting on it because we do have to accept that the virus has changed."" But he said it was still ""absolutely right"" that health and social care staff ""carry out their professional duty, which is to do all that they can to put patient safety first, and that means getting vaccinated."" Call to delay compulsory Covid vaccines for NHS staff Does this doctor's vaccine claim stack up? False Covid vaccine claims debunked Mr Taylor, 42, works in primary care in Cumbria and says he feels like NHS staff are being used as political pawns. ""The government says as healthcare workers we should want to protect our patients by getting vaccinated. ""But you can argue that it won't protect them any more whether I have it or not. We all know people who are triple jabbed and they've still got Covid or they've not been jabbed and they haven't got it. ""It's not like the vaccine has eradicated Covid like some vaccines have done in the past so I find the argument for the science a bit weak."" The UK Health Security Agency says,externalvaccines significantly reduce the risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19, and help cut the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Dr Nikki Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, says health care professionals have ""a duty"" to make sure they are protected. The Department for Health and Social Care said there were no plans to delay the deadline and it was ""the right thing to do to protect patients"". Allow Twitter content?

""I am not patient facing, but if I were, I would be willing to lose my job on principle,"" she says. ""Nursing staff and doctors have been taught throughout their careers not to force medical treatments on patients who don't want them,"" she adds, but she feels ""the government is now trying to shame them into accepting"" a jab she believes is still experimental. Ms Chappell says she is concerned about the impact the mandate could have on workers' mental health and the way they feel about working for the NHS. ""There will be people who don't want to have the vaccine but their partner might want them to because they are worried about how they will manage if they lose their job,"" she says. ""It's putting relationships, families, homes under pressure - there will be people whose families are split up over this."" NHS England staff must have their first dose by 3 February and their second by 1 April under government rules Psychotherapist Anna says she feels stressed and pressured by NHS emails, meetings and webinars encouraging her to get a Covid jab. ""I feel like I don't even get a moment to breathe without being softly interrogated, by staff I may or may not even know,"" she says. ""I am thinking about taking it. I have no intention to resign or change my job. I just want to do it in my own time."" She is the only unvaccinated member of her team, but Anna says she does not consider herself to be ""an anti-vaxxer"" as she has had other jabs. The NHS worker from London has had several meetings with her boss about the mandatory vaccination deadline. ""I was asked if I'd had a conversation with my family yet, had I booked an appointment yet. It felt like incessant coaching or surveillance on whether or not I'll be vaccinated. ""I feel they [the NHS] want me to say as soon as possible that I'm not getting it, so they can start thinking of how to fire me."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check answers your vaccine concerns Some 5.1% of staff had not received any vaccine as of 23 January - the equivalent of 77,591 people, although not all will be in frontline jobs. The DHSC's impact assessment warns 73,000 NHS staff in England could be lost due to the government's mandatory vaccination policy. Pat Cullen, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, is calling for a delay to the 3 February deadline. She said: ""To dismiss valued nursing staff during this crisis would be an act of self-sabotage."" Scotland and Wales have not made any proposals to make Covid jabs compulsory for NHS workers or care home staff. Northern Ireland will hold apublic consultation. Wales could recruit non-jabbed English NHS staff Asa Granger says six to 10 colleagues are unvaccinated and face losing their jobs Asa Granger is a paramedic for South East Coast Ambulance Service who says he has also received an email about the mandatory vaccination deadline. ""They've put unless you're exempt for clinical reasons if you haven't had your first jab by 3 February you'll be redeployed or lose your job."" Mr Granger says there are six to 10 staff at his ambulance station in the same situation. ""I cannot treat any one of my patients without their consent, yet they're asking me to get vaccinated against my will,"" he says. ""Back in 2020 we were all being clapped and come 2022 they're saying we are sacking you, it's an absolute disgrace."" The 35-year-old says: ""I'm relatively young, fit and well. There have been lots of adverse effects linked to the vaccine. If I don't take the vaccine I'm 100% safe from the side-effects. I'm pretty happy with those odds."" Research has found side-effects from the vaccines are rare. Last year,feedback from about 40,000 peoplefound about one in three reported some side-effects. None were serious and a common one was some soreness around the injection site. Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), says the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh the risks for the ""vast majority of people"". Mr Granger says he is holding out hope that the government will scrap the mandatory vaccination policy but does not know what he will do if it doesn't. ""I have a wife and young baby,"" he says. ""A colleague has said he's done it under duress because he has a family to support. I'm not judging people who have a vaccine, it's their choice but I'm not being given a choice.""

"Dental therapist Chloe is considering finding a job in Wales to stay in the NHS Get jabbed, or risk losing your job. That's the dilemma facing thousands of unvaccinated NHS staff. All healthcare workers in England must have a first Covid jab by 3 February and be fully vaccinated by 1 April. But some have told BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat they are hoping for a third option: finding work across the borders, where vaccination is not compulsory. NHS England staff must be fully vaccinated by 1 April under government rules Chloe, a 25-year-old dental therapist in Plymouth, says she doesn't want the vaccine and is looking into working in Wales. ""It'll probably be a case of finding a shared house or living with a friend in Cardiff,"" she says. ""Probably only being able to work two or three days a week then commuting. ""That will obviously put a strain on my relationship [with my partner] because we'll be living separately, and it's just a real hassle."" Chloe doesn't think she should have to choose between her work and the vaccine, especially since she has spent years training for the job. ""I think it's disgusting they're doing this,"" she says. ""They're taking away our human rights. ""I don't think it's very fair that just across the border in Wales - a mile long bridge - the laws are going to be completely different."" In England,it is set to become mandatoryfrom 1 April for staff who have face-to-face contact with patients to have had two Covid vaccine doses, unless they have a medical exemption. The Department of Health says this will help to protect patients. NHS workers in England who oppose the government's mandatory vaccination policy staged a protest in central London However, in Scotland and Wales there are no plans to make jabs compulsory for NHS workers, while there will be apublic consultation on the issue in Northern Ireland. Call to delay compulsory vaccines for NHS staff Wales could recruit non-jabbed English NHS staff Small number of non-jabbed NHS staff 'manageable' The vast majority of NHS staff in England are vaccinated, but it's thought around 70,000 to 80,000 are not. This adds up to 10% of workers at some hospitals or GP surgeries, according to the Royal College of GPs, which hascalled for the deadline to be delayed to prevent staff shortages. Care providers in Wales have suggested they could employ unvaccinated workerswho've left NHS jobs in England due to its mandatory vaccination policy, after Wales' First MinisterMark Drakeford said he ""wouldn't rule it out"". The Scottish Government says NHS recruitment is ""undertaken according to open and fair processes"", and that vaccination is a personal choice. Chloe, who graduated last year, is worried about losing her career: 'Nearly a decade of work is going to be completely wasted' Chloe's concerns are shared by Maria, who's been a midwife in London for ten years and is not vaccinated against Covid. ""As things stand, I'm likely to lose my job on 1 April,"" she says. ""We have been told they will try to redeploy us. However, I don't see how many non-patient-facing roles they're going to find for the many midwives that have chosen not to have the vaccine."" ""My preferred option at the moment is moving to the border - hoping to work in Wales as a midwife, and live in England."" Maria insists she is ""not an anti-vaxxer in any way"". She says she volunteered for the vaccine trials, has had many previous vaccines, and has even recommended that her parents have the Covid vaccine. However she is ""strongly opposed"" to compulsory jabs, because she says it ""violates the principles of bodily integrity and informed consent - central to the care I give to women"". Vaccine complications dwarfed by virus risks How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? Maria says she decided not to get the Covid jab after considering ""the risk of Covid to me, versus the risk of the vaccine"", and because she doesn't believe vaccination stops transmission to patients. Studies showthe risks of infection with Covid are much greater than the risks of vaccines, which are very good at protecting against becoming severely ill. The protection they give against catching it and passing it on does wane more quickly, butdoctors and scientists say it is not the case that vaccines don't protect others at all. Maria says she has recently contemplated changing her mind as the deadline approaches though. ""The last few weeks have been so tough, I have actually thought about getting the vaccine just to protect my mental health,"" she says. However she still feels like not having it is ""the right decision"" for her so she has started looking for jobs in Wales but has only found six suitable vacancies advertised across the whole country so isn't optimistic about finding work there immediately. ""It [moving home] is definitely a sacrifice I'd be willing to make. Midwifery is my vocation - it's the reason I left my family and my home country.""

Since September, the government has been reviewing which of these it wants to keep in place, ditch or amend. Under Brexit withdrawal legislation passed in 2018, retained EU laws have a legal status of their own - and a special process for changing them. Downing Street said it wanted to make it easier for MPs to change these laws, arguing that removing or changing them could otherwise take years. It did not specify the provisions in the bill or how it calculated a claim that businesses would save Â£1bn through the cutting of red tape. Legislation inherited after Brexit - ""retained EU law"" in the jargon - can only be changed if Parliament passes new laws. But the ""Brexit Freedoms Bill"" will change that, by giving ministers more power to alter retained EU law more quickly, and not necessarily with votes in Parliament. It's very unlikely that the fussy clerks in the House of Commons will allow the government to give the bill such a political name, and so I bet it gets relabelled as something much more boring. Whatever it's called, to Conservative backbenchers it promises a bout of post-Brexit deregulation. But the same MPs will also worry that it's a power-grab by ministers at their expense. It's part of a policy blitz this week that's visible from space. There's going to be a new compensation scheme for airline passengers whose flights are delayed. Also due is the paper fleshing out the PM's flagship policy of ""levelling up"". But all of this could be made to look like a sideshow by two things the government has no control over: Sue Gray's report into lockdown-busting parties in Whitehall that could drop at any time, and the diplomatic crisis between Ukraine and Russia. However, the bill has sparked concerns in the devolved administrations - which have obtained new powers in certain policy areas since Brexit. A source said that a meeting between the Attorney General Suella Braverman and devolved ministers on Saturday was ""last-minute, fractious, and cack-handed"". The Scottish government's Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution Angus Robertson said the bill would ""undermine devolution"". And Mick Antoniw, the Welsh Minister for the Constitution, said the UK government was driving a ""coach and horses through the concept of mutual consent"". The situation in Northern Ireland is more complicated because of its special Brexit deal, known as the Protocol, which the UK iscurrently trying to renegotiate. It keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, meaning that a significant amount of EU law continues to apply. For example,there are question marksover whether the changes to alcohol taxes will be allowed. The UK government said it would ""continue to work closely with the devolved administrations"". Meanwhile, Labour criticised ministers for not using Brexit to scrap VAT on energy bills, which had to be at least 5% in the EU. Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said the public ""overwhelmingly support"" the change, adding: ""It is time the government started listening"".

"Lisa wants to help other women who may be struggling with similar issues An awareness campaign is being launched to support an estimated one million UK women at risk of harmful gambling. The charity Gamble Aware says some may not recognise the warning signs or feel too much shame and stigma to seek help. The estimates come from a nationally representative YouGov poll of 9,649 women, using a recognised scoring system -Problem Gambling Severity Index,external- to measure gambling harms. It suggests half a million could be dangerously hooked. The campaign will run until March across TV, social and digital channels. Lisa Walker, 49, from Rainham in east London, struggled with compulsive gambling for more than a decade. Her habit escalated in her late 20s, after she won a large sum of money playing poker. ""I won over Â£127,000 in one night. That was the worst night of my life because that's when my addiction really started to spiral out of control. ""The casino wanted me back and they offered me anything I wanted - free drinks, free meals to entice me."" She says she would go there often, as well as nipping into the local bingo hall and betting shop, to feed what had become a damaging habit. ""Most days I thought about gambling and most days I did gamble. It got to the stage where I didn't have any value of money any more."" Eventually, she lost all of her winnings, as well as her home, after re-mortgaging her house to keep gambling. She ended up staying in a hostel for a while with her two children, who were 10 and 11 at the time.

Paul Merson: 'I wouldn't wish this on anybody' Widow urges gambling reform after husband's death Shilton calls for change to gambling laws At 45, Lisa's addiction continued. She even chose to marry her partner at a venue in Vegas - then spent her wedding night gambling at the casino rather than celebrating with her groom and guests. When she returned from Vegas, Lisa realised she needed help, as gambling had taken her to a ""deep, dark place"" where she could think of nothing else. Lisa decided to attend a Gamblers Anonymous meeting, where she was one of two women among 35 men. She now attends meetings every week and is starting to see more women come to the meetings. Lisa is in recovery and is setting up her own women's group, as well as working for Betknowmore as a Peer Aid worker. She says online gambling is a new way people are getting hooked. ""We are seeing so many people coming through, getting online. You've got a 24-hour mobile phone and a 24-hour casino in your pocket and within a couple of minutes you can be online gambling."" Liz Karter, a UK expert in gambling addiction in women and a gambling addiction counsellor, said: ""Gambling behaviours manifest themselves differently in women than men. ""For example, we know the easy availability of online gambling leads many women to games which appear innocent and socially acceptable. The games seem safe and familiar, as they are so similar to the free play digital games we are all now used to playing. ""In addition, the hopes of financial gains can prove a powerful motivator. While gambling doesn't always lead to harm, it's vital women are aware of early warning signs including losing track of time, incurring increasing debt, or a tendency to hide gambling from others or gambling to forget their problems.""

"Ministers will meet later to decide whether or not to scrap mandatory Covid vaccinations for NHS staff in England. Front-line NHS workers in England must be fully vaccinated by 1 April, meaning they need a first dose by Thursday. If they are not jabbed by April, they will be redeployed or dismissed. Around 77,000 have had no jab at all. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the jabs requirement was being ""kept under review"" but thatit was the ""duty"" of NHS staff to get vaccinated. The policy was proposed when Delta was the dominant variant that was circulating and evidence showed being vaccinated significantly cut the risk of catching and spreading the virus. Since then, a more contagious and slightly milder variant called Omicron has emerged. It has led to an increase in breakthrough infections among people who are vaccinated, although the jabs are still doing a great job at preventing severe cases. Mr Javid told the Health and Social Care Select Committee on Tuesday that it was right to ""reflect"" on the policy now Omicron was dominant. But it is understood no final decisions have been made. The government has been under pressure from some within the health service to scrap the mandate, arguing that it would lead to a staffing crisis. The Royal College of Midwives warned the policy could have a""catastrophic impact"",externalon maternity services, while the Royal College of GPs and Royal College of Nursingcalled for the deadline to be delayed. But the Department of Health and Social Care has previously insisted the policy was ""the right thing to do to protect patients"". The UK Health Security Agency says vaccines have proven to be effective against hospitalisation, mortality, infection and transmission. ""Several studies have provided evidence that vaccines are effective at preventing infection,""a recent report said.,external ""Uninfected individuals cannot transmit; therefore, the vaccines are also effective at preventing transmission."" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told BBC Breakfast that while any change to policy would be a decision for the health secretary, he said ""fundamental facts"" had changed due to Omicron and so any decision would take that into account. There are practical and ethical reasons why the mandatory vaccination policy may go. On a practical level the NHS in England can ill-afford staff to be forced out - there are already nearly 100,000 vacancies. And then on an ethical level - as some staff are pointing out - is it right to insist on vaccination when the benefits are not overwhelmingly clear cut with the rise of the Omicron variant? Vaccination against hepatitis B is a condition of employment for some staff, but that is more than 90% effective against infection and immunity last for years. By comparison immunity against Covid infection after two doses has largely gone after 20 weeks. A booster can initially increase protection to around 70% but by 10 weeks that has started to wane significantly too. It certainly helps to reduce spread, but is it enough to over-ride freedom to choose? And if staffing levels drop further because of the mandate could the risks that pose outweigh the benefits the vaccine brings? Protests against the policyhave been held in cities across the country - and someNHS staff have said they are even considering moving to work in the UK nationswhere vaccination is not compulsory. There are no plans in Scotland and Wales to make Covid jabs mandatory for NHS workers or care home staff, while there will be a public consultation on the issue in Northern Ireland. Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing's director for England, said that while the college would urge all nursing staff to get vaccinated, it ""makes no sense"" to risk losing thousands of workers when there were already many vacancies. She told BBC Breakfast that losing nurses and care staff ""actually puts patients at more risk than not having nurses at all"". Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, said she was ""saddened for all the people who may have lost their jobs needlessly"", with mandatory vaccination already in place in that sector since November. She said the policy had had a ""devastating impact"". Government figures suggest 40,000 care staff had not been vaccinated by the deadline - but it is unclear how many of these lost their jobs because of medical exemptions and redeployment to roles away from the frontline. ""The people who we've lost, we hope they'll think about coming back and we will do everything we can to try and encourage them to come back, but they will have found other roles and they may be happier in their other roles now and not want to move again,"" she said. While the mandatory vaccinations policy is due to come in to force for NHS workers on 1 April, Thursday is the final day on which workers could get their first dose with time to be fully vaccinated by that date due to the separation needed between first and second doses. The latest figures show that almost 95% of NHS staff have had at least one Covid jab, leaving about 77,000 who have not. That compares to around 91% of the general population in England who have had at least one jab, although that includes people aged 12 and over. Speaking to MPs on the select committee last week, Mr Javid said not all of them were in patient-facing roles. He said that while it was the ""professional duty of every NHS worker to get vaccinated"" it was ""reasonable to assume"" that not everyone would do so. Mr Javid said the jabs requirement would be ""kept under review"". When pressed on whether that meant the government was considering scrapping it he added: ""We're reflecting on it because we do have to accept that the virus has changed."" One of those who has said he isprepared to lose his job over mandatory vaccinesis specialist paramedic Matt Taylor, 42, who is unvaccinated. He works in primary care in Cumbria and said that he found the argument for the vaccine ""a bit weak"" as the vaccine has not eradicated Covid as some jabs have done with other diseases in the past.

"This video can not be played Clean-up begins in Scotland after storms Corrie and Malik Thousands of homes have been spending another day without power after two storms battered parts of Scotland. More than 80,000 homes lost supply during Storm Malik on Saturday before Storm Corrie hit 38,000 more on Sunday. The electricity network in the north east and the Highlands were worst affected by the gusts of up to 92mph. Scottish and Southern Energy Networks said about 16,900 were still off at 20.00 on Monday, mostly in rural Aberdeenshire and the Angus border. SSEN earlier said power had been restored in badly-impacted Stonehaven. About 19,000 were cases related to two major faults affecting about 13,000 customers in the Stonehaven area, and 6,000 in Deeside. The Met Office has also issued a yellow weather warning due to forecasted wind gusts of up to 65mph across the north and north east of Scotland valid from 06:00 on Tuesday until 18:00.

The line between Tain and Ardgay was blocked A large tree was blocking the A9 at Golspie Pauline Thom, from near Huntly, is isolating with Covid and is relying on support from her sons to bring her supplies. ""I can't go out and access any food or get water or anything,"" she said. ""I've got lots of animals - I've got sheep and horses. I've tried phoning the electric companies and Scottish Water but nobody seems to know if there's any help."" Douglas Morrison from near Kemnay told BBC Scotland: ""We got power last night for three hours yesterday, but then the first couple of gusts of wind we lost the power again so we're back to where we were before."" ""It's almost like it's every time there's a storm now - the last four storms we've had three power cuts."" BBC Scotland's Euan McIlwraith said the wind blew across the stubble fields in Banff and picked up the chaff, creating a bizarre spectacle. ""We had drifts of straw three feet deep so we were blocked off by what looked like snow drifts but was actually drifts of straw. It was the most bizarre thing,"" he told Good Morning Scotland. Trees were felled by strong winds around Lews Castle College in Stornoway Tree cutting in Aviemore was being carried out Several schools in Aberdeenshire, the Highlands and Moray were closed due to storm damage or power outages.

""The two exceptions are the line from East Kilbride to Glasgow and Ayr down to Stranraer where we're still carrying out safety inspections."" He said the east and north was ""a bit more problematical"" , where routes are being checked in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen, and on the line from Perth to Inverness. There are also some large trees down between Aberdeen and Inverurie. ""It is an improving situation - we've had staff out through the night clearing trees and clearing debris,"" Mr Simpson added. A lorry overturned in the Drumlithie area Most routes are expected to reopen during the course of the morning but travellers should check before they travel. Other travel problems include: A92 in Aberdeenshire closed at Bridge of Muchalls and Stonehaven after a lorry overturned. A90 Laurencekirk both directions restricted because of  a fallen tree. A9 partially blocked near Golspie in the Highlands because of a fallen tree. In Edinburgh one lane of M90 closed from the Scotstoun Junction to the Kirkliston Jn of M9 after a lorry overturned and cannot be recovered until noon.

Deputy first minister John Swinney toldGood Morning Scotlandthere was an ""improving situation"" across Scotland following the two ""serious storms"" over the weekend. ""We have to explore - and the power companies particularly have to do this - how we can build more resilience into the network,"" he said. ""Some of that may be at the elementary end of the spectrum of undertaking proactive tree cutting to make sure that power lines are protected as far as possible from the falling of trees. ""At the other end of the spectrum we have to be constantly looking at what should be the resilience of the network - should we have as many overhead power lines? ""Should we look to be undergrounding power lines? Obviously there'll be a financial impact of that on the investment that's got to be made in the network but these are all issues that need to be looked at given the increased severity and incidents of this type."" A 60-year-old woman in Aberdeen and a nine-year-old boy in Staffordshire were killed by falling trees during Saturday's storm. Fallen trees and flying debris also caused widespread structural damage in addition to power outages which affected 80,000 customers. One woman in Oyne, Aberdeenshire told the BBC a tree crashed through her hand-built porch, narrowly missing her home. Parts of the roof were blown off Huntly Falconry Centre allowing four falcons to escape - owners appealed for help to track them down. And in Glasgow, people living near a landmark tower were evacuated from their homes amid fears for its safety.

One of those who has said he isprepared to lose his job over mandatory vaccinesis specialist paramedic Matt Taylor, 42, who is unvaccinated. He works in primary care in Cumbria and said that he found the argument for the vaccine ""a bit weak"" as the vaccine has not eradicated Covid as some jabs have done with other diseases in the past.

"This video can not be played Clean-up begins in Scotland after storms Corrie and Malik Thousands of homes have been spending another day without power after two storms battered parts of Scotland. More than 80,000 homes lost supply during Storm Malik on Saturday before Storm Corrie hit 38,000 more on Sunday. The electricity network in the north east and the Highlands were worst affected by the gusts of up to 92mph. Scottish and Southern Energy Networks said about 16,900 were still off at 20.00 on Monday, mostly in rural Aberdeenshire and the Angus border. SSEN earlier said power had been restored in badly-impacted Stonehaven. About 19,000 were cases related to two major faults affecting about 13,000 customers in the Stonehaven area, and 6,000 in Deeside. The Met Office has also issued a yellow weather warning due to forecasted wind gusts of up to 65mph across the north and north east of Scotland valid from 06:00 on Tuesday until 18:00.

""We've told our customers that where we didn't have the full details of the fault it would be Tuesday evening and that is four days from when the impact arrived from Storm Malik. ""If we can outperform that target, if we can get there quicker we will change that restoration time."" Some residents have told BBC Scotland they have struggled to get information from the energy supplier. The line between Tain and Ardgay was blocked A large tree was blocking the A9 at Golspie Pauline Thom, from near Huntly, is isolating with Covid and is relying on support from her sons to bring her supplies. ""I can't go out and access any food or get water or anything,"" she said. ""I've got lots of animals - I've got sheep and horses. I've tried phoning the electric companies and Scottish Water but nobody seems to know if there's any help."" Douglas Morrison from near Kemnay told BBC Scotland: ""We got power last night for three hours yesterday, but then the first couple of gusts of wind we lost the power again so we're back to where we were before."" ""It's almost like it's every time there's a storm now - the last four storms we've had three power cuts."" BBC Scotland's Euan McIlwraith said the wind blew across the stubble fields in Banff and picked up the chaff, creating a bizarre spectacle. ""We had drifts of straw three feet deep so we were blocked off by what looked like snow drifts but was actually drifts of straw. It was the most bizarre thing,"" he told Good Morning Scotland. Trees were felled by strong winds around Lews Castle College in Stornoway Tree cutting in Aviemore was being carried out Several schools in Aberdeenshire, the Highlands and Moray were closed due to storm damage or power outages. In the Highlands, SSEN welfare centres were set up in Cannich and Munlochy to offer hot food and drinks for people without power. On Sunday evening, Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team had a ""full team call-out"" for a missing walker in high winds and snow on the Cairngorm Plateau. The person was found by a climbing party and escorted to safety. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The two exceptions are the line from East Kilbride to Glasgow and Ayr down to Stranraer where we're still carrying out safety inspections."" He said the east and north was ""a bit more problematical"" , where routes are being checked in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen, and on the line from Perth to Inverness. There are also some large trees down between Aberdeen and Inverurie. ""It is an improving situation - we've had staff out through the night clearing trees and clearing debris,"" Mr Simpson added. A lorry overturned in the Drumlithie area Most routes are expected to reopen during the course of the morning but travellers should check before they travel. Other travel problems include: A92 in Aberdeenshire closed at Bridge of Muchalls and Stonehaven after a lorry overturned. A90 Laurencekirk both directions restricted because of  a fallen tree. A9 partially blocked near Golspie in the Highlands because of a fallen tree. In Edinburgh one lane of M90 closed from the Scotstoun Junction to the Kirkliston Jn of M9 after a lorry overturned and cannot be recovered until noon.

Deputy first minister John Swinney toldGood Morning Scotlandthere was an ""improving situation"" across Scotland following the two ""serious storms"" over the weekend. ""We have to explore - and the power companies particularly have to do this - how we can build more resilience into the network,"" he said. ""Some of that may be at the elementary end of the spectrum of undertaking proactive tree cutting to make sure that power lines are protected as far as possible from the falling of trees. ""At the other end of the spectrum we have to be constantly looking at what should be the resilience of the network - should we have as many overhead power lines? ""Should we look to be undergrounding power lines? Obviously there'll be a financial impact of that on the investment that's got to be made in the network but these are all issues that need to be looked at given the increased severity and incidents of this type."" A 60-year-old woman in Aberdeen and a nine-year-old boy in Staffordshire were killed by falling trees during Saturday's storm. Fallen trees and flying debris also caused widespread structural damage in addition to power outages which affected 80,000 customers. One woman in Oyne, Aberdeenshire told the BBC a tree crashed through her hand-built porch, narrowly missing her home. Parts of the roof were blown off Huntly Falconry Centre allowing four falcons to escape - owners appealed for help to track them down. And in Glasgow, people living near a landmark tower were evacuated from their homes amid fears for its safety. An exclusion zone was set up around the Trinity building at Lynedoch Street after Glasgow City Council said its ""structural deterioration"" had been worsened by high winds.

"Boris Johnson has vowed that a plan to overhaul EU laws copied over after Brexit will encourage business to invest in the UK. The prime minister said a ""Brexit Freedoms Bill"" will make it easier to change thousands of EU-era regulations that remain in force. He said the it would allow the UK to set growth-friendly rules for ""cutting edge technologies of the future"". But the plan has been criticised by the devolved administrations. Since Brexit the UK has moved away from EU laws in certain areas, including on immigration, payments to farmers, and gene-editing rules for crops. But the prime minister has been under increasing pressure in recent months from MPs on the right of his party to go further. Former Brexit minister Lord Frost resigned last year, calling for the government to deliver on the opportunities Brexit presented, adding in his letter to the PM: ""You know my concerns about the current direction of travel."" Did the EU ban crown marks on pint glasses? What's been causing lorry queues at Dover? In an announcement for the two-year anniversary of the UK's exit from the EU, No 10 said its new bill would ensure changes can be made more easily. Speaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said it would allow the UK to shape better regulations in areas where it is ""strong"" - citing areas like cyber technology, artificial intelligence, and gene editing. ""There are things that we can do differently in a way that will encourage business to invest even more,"" he told reporters. ""We won't diverge for the sake of it, but we're going to make sure this is the number one place to invest and do business because of freedoms that we have,"" he added. Downing Street said the changes would build on others since Brexit, which include: a move tosimplify alcohol dutiesfrom 2023 by moving way from EU-wide rules scrapping the EU-mandated 5%rate of VAT on tampons creating a new UK regime for regulating government support to industry The UK copied over the laws to smooth its exit from the EU on 31 January 2020, and kept them during a transition period that ended in January 2021. Since September, the government has been reviewing which of these it wants to keep in place, ditch or amend. Under Brexit withdrawal legislation passed in 2018, retained EU laws have a legal status of their own - and a special process for changing them. Downing Street said it wanted to make it easier for MPs to change these laws, arguing that removing or changing them could otherwise take years. It did not specify the provisions in the bill or how it calculated a claim that businesses would save Â£1bn through the cutting of red tape. Legislation inherited after Brexit - ""retained EU law"" in the jargon - can only be changed if Parliament passes new laws. But the ""Brexit Freedoms Bill"" will change that, by giving ministers more power to alter retained EU law more quickly, and not necessarily with votes in Parliament. It's very unlikely that the fussy clerks in the House of Commons will allow the government to give the bill such a political name, and so I bet it gets relabelled as something much more boring. Whatever it's called, to Conservative backbenchers it promises a bout of post-Brexit deregulation. But the same MPs will also worry that it's a power-grab by ministers at their expense. It's part of a policy blitz this week that's visible from space. There's going to be a new compensation scheme for airline passengers whose flights are delayed. Also due is the paper fleshing out the PM's flagship policy of ""levelling up"". But all of this could be made to look like a sideshow by two things the government has no control over: Sue Gray's report into lockdown-busting parties in Whitehall that could drop at any time, and the diplomatic crisis between Ukraine and Russia. However, the bill has sparked concerns in the devolved administrations - which have obtained new powers in certain policy areas since Brexit. A source said that a meeting between the Attorney General Suella Braverman and devolved ministers on Saturday was ""last-minute, fractious, and cack-handed"". The Scottish government's Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution Angus Robertson said the bill would ""undermine devolution"". And Mick Antoniw, the Welsh Minister for the Constitution, said the UK government was driving a ""coach and horses through the concept of mutual consent"". The situation in Northern Ireland is more complicated because of its special Brexit deal, known as the Protocol, which the UK iscurrently trying to renegotiate. It keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, meaning that a significant amount of EU law continues to apply. For example,there are question marksover whether the changes to alcohol taxes will be allowed. The UK government said it would ""continue to work closely with the devolved administrations"". Meanwhile, Labour criticised ministers for not using Brexit to scrap VAT on energy bills, which had to be at least 5% in the EU. Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said the public ""overwhelmingly support"" the change, adding: ""It is time the government started listening"".

"The Royal College of Physicians suggests two-third of Welsh physicians feel overwhelmed Taking time off work should be one of life's little luxuries, leaving the stress of the workplace behind you. But working on the NHS frontline during the pandemic, one hospital doctor told BBC Wales he felt guilty for taking time off work. With growing waiting lists and staff shortages putting pressure on colleagues, Dr Sacha Moore said he did not want to add to their stress. The Welsh government said it had more NHS training places than ever before. It comes as research suggests two-third of Welsh physicians feel overwhelmed, with the Royal College of Physicians saying more doctors are needed, along with investment in social care and hospital at home services. Arecord number of patients are waiting for non-urgent hospital treatmentin Wales, with the figure of 682,279 up by nearly 50% since before the Covid pandemic. Is the pandemic entering its endgame? Is it too soon to lift the Omicron restrictions? Watch Coronavirus in Intensive Care on BBC iPlayer Add to that about10,000 Welsh NHS staff were off workeither sick or self-isolating in January - the highest since the first Covid wave - when Omicron cases caused disruption to services. So when Dr Moore took his holiday this month, he struggled to put work to one side. ""I think the annual leave is very important but it does come with guilt,"" said Dr Moore, based at Wales' biggest hospital, the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. This video can not be played Intensive care consultant describes hospital pressure in September 2021 He added: ""You know that you not being there does increase the stress and pressure on them [his colleagues]. ""I view it very much as a recovery, rather than a holiday. It's just a period of time to recover to then be ready to go again."" Attempting to clear the waiting list backlog and covering for colleagues off with Covid-related illnesses when people power is already tight may feel relentless, but Dr Moore said doctors always put patient safety first. ""We always ensure that patient safety is the primary focus, but perhaps some of the additional things we would wish to do ourselves, we simply cannot,"" added Dr Moore, a junior doctor who has just finished his training in renal medicine. Sacha Moore has spent time training in hospitals across Wales ""Pre-pandemic it would be very common for families to come on to the ward to see their relative and perhaps ask to speak to one of us, to answer any questions or address any concerns. ""But when there are one or two doctors on a ward for perhaps 27 or 30 acutely unwell individuals, phoning all of those families is simply not something we have time to do, despite the fact that we would really like to do it. ""Sometimes that can feel like you're letting your patient down."" ""That can contribute to feeling overwhelmed and exhausted - mixed in with a feeling of moral injury or not quite having done everything you wish for an individual. I've certainly struggled with that."" The flow of patients through the hospital is hindered by a lack of social care in the community, meaning around 1,000 patients in Wales who are well enough to be discharged are currently spending longer in hospital than necessary. As a result, beds are not available for patients being brought into A&E by ambulance, creating longer waits for those dialling 999. This video can not be played Inside Wales' largest hospital in the first wave of Covid-19 in May 2020 It has prompted the Royal College of Physicians to call for greater investment in the ""hospital at home"" scheme, to prevent patients ending up in A&E in the first place. Consultant geriatrician Liz Davies said those schemes were vital, but availability is patchy. She set up Wales' first older person's assessment service at Morriston Hospital's emergency department in Swansea, where frail patients are seen by a geriatrician like herself, or specialist nurses, relieving the pressure on A&E staff and improving patient outcomes. ""Our service does very well in terms of avoiding hospital readmissions,"" Ms Davies, who was awarded a British Empire Medal for her work, said. Consultant geriatrician Liz Davies was awarded a British Empire Medal for her work ""But we rely on our 'hospital at home' partners in the community. ""They probably take about 25% of the patients we discharge. They provide acute medical services - mostly antibiotics, iron infusions - that would traditionally be given by the hospital. ""Without investment in those teams a lot of our services are hindered."" Wales' self-isolation cut to five full days Q&A: How do I get a booster in Wales? What are the new Covid rules for Wales? Sam Rice, a consultant physician and endocrinologist based in west Wales, agreed that the flow of patients in the hospitals he works in are also impacted. ""We'll have three wards that are maybe full with people who previously would have been discharged with carers, or into nursing homes and to residential homes. ""And that's actually probably providing more of a pressure on the system at the moment than the current Covid related difficulties."" This video can not be played Clive Myrie returns to a Covid ward to see how the NHS is coping in England In turn that can create issues for those waiting on planned care. Though Mr Rice said his own specialist area - focusing on hormone-related issues, thyroid problems and diabetes - had been relatively fortunate, as he now did far more over the phone. ""I'm interacting with more people than I was a couple of years ago,"" he said. ""I'm probably doing 100% more activity in terms of the number of people that I interact with post pandemic than I was pre-pandemic and that's just because of the advancements of virtual working."" Consultant endocrinologist Sam Rice now sees more patients than pre-Covid because of virtual appointments He calculated that in one clinic he had saved around 1,000km travel as he was not driving to the clinic, and neither were his patients. While he felt telephone consultations were here to stay, a balance was needed between remote reviews of test results and face to face appointments. ""I was able to keep the waiting list relatively well under control,"" he said. ""What did happen though, is because there was a general reduction in people visiting their GPs, the number of referrals dropped off and there's definitely been a surge since that kicked back in again."" This video can not be played 'Relentless' demand on ambulance staff ""Without a doubt it's been a brutal couple of years,"" he said, explaining that as staff - or their children - came down with Covid, colleagues had to double the work. ""We've learned to be quite resilient and robust and have good mechanisms for looking after ourselves and each other. ""But for people looking into the NHS wondering what sort of service am I going to get - the service is going to be first rate - it always has been."" The Welsh government said: ""We know NHS staff have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic, putting their own wellbeing at risk to keep the rest of us safe and that the relentless pressure of the pandemic will have consequences."" A spokesman said it was ""committed to improving access to the necessary support for doctors who are struggling with their mental health"" and an extra Â£1m was being invested in behavioural and cognitive therapy for primary and secondary care doctors, as well as other NHS staff. He added that Â£262m had been invested in training and there were more places ""than ever before"" in a bid to boost the workforce and tackle issues raised by the pandemic.

"Jason Holder became only the fourth man to take four wickets in four balls in a T20 international Fifth Twenty20 international, Barbados West Indies 179-4 (20 overs):Pollard 41* (25), Rashid 2-17 England 162 all out (19.5 overs):Vince 55 (35), Holder 5-27 West Indies won by 17 runs, won series 3-2 Scorecard Jason Holder took four wickets from the final four balls to send England to a 17-run defeat in the deciding Twenty20 and give West Indies a 3-2 series win in Barbados. With England needing 20 from the last over, Barbadian Holder had Sam Billings, Chris Jordan and Adil Rashid caught on the leg-side boundary and then bowled Saqib Mahmood. West Indies earlier overcame being subdued by England's spinners to take advantage of some poor death bowling in their 179-4. Rovman Powell clubbed 35 not out from 17 balls and captain Kieron Pollard supported with an unbeaten 41. James Vince looked to be carrying England in the chase, but crucially top-edged Akeal Hosein to the mid-wicket boundary for 55. Left-arm spinner Hosein took a wicket in each of three successive overs, his 4-30 reducing England to 119-6. Sam Billings kept them afloat with 41, only for Holder to give England's seamers a lesson, ending with 5-27 as the tourists were bowled out for 162. England return to the Caribbean in March for a three-Test series, with a squad due to be named in the coming weeks. Before then, director of cricket Ashley Giles will submit a report on their Ashes hammering, potentially sparking changes to the management of the England men's teams. While England ultimately lost this game by unravelling at the end of West Indies' innings, former captain Holder's achievement in becoming only the fourth man to take four wickets in four balls in a T20 international, on his home ground, was electrifying. England's batters got stuck in the chase, a middle-order collapse to Hosein typical of a series when none of the second-string made a compelling case to dislodge any of the first-choice players missing after taking part in the Ashes. As usual, Vince oozed elegance in his second T20 half-century, adding 46 with Moeen Ali, who never matched the fluency of his 63 in Saturday's fourth match with just 14 from 19 balls. Hosein was held back while Moeen remained, but after the England skipper miscued to give Holder his first wicket, Hosein removed Liam Livingstone, Vince and Phil Salt. England needed 48 from the final three overs, only for Billings and Jordan to take 20 off the 18th, giving the tourists a glimmer of hope. Curiously, both teams had 160 going into their final over, but the difference was Holder, even if he did start with a no-ball. Jordan, the man who conceded 19 from West Indies' final set, skied to the leg-side fence, with Billings and Rashid falling in almost identical fashion. Hardly anyone inside the Kensington Oval spotted that Mahmood had inside-edged on to his leg stump. When they did, it sparked joyous celebrations. It was a curious innings from West Indies, thanks mainly to the disparity in quality between England's pace and spin bowling. The hosts motored in the powerplay, meandered in the middle overs, then surged at the end. They took 58 from the first six overs, 47 from the next nine and 74 off the final five. The early charge was led by Kyle Mayers, who whipped almost all of his 31 through the leg side. He was cut off by a wonderful relay catch on the boundary - Jason Roy nonchalantly offloading from deep mid-wicket to long-on Salt to give the masterful Rashid his first wicket. England's four scalps were shared between the leg-spin of Rashid and Livingstone as England applied the brakes in a period of nine overs where only one was delivered by a pace bowler. At one point, West Indies went 42 balls between boundaries, with impetus eventually coming from Powell, who despite hitting a scintillating hundred in the third match of the series, was held back at number six and did not arrive until the 15th over. From a low stance, he belted four sixes when England returned to pace at the death, and skipper Pollard followed in his slipstream. Overall, England's spin trio returned 4-54 from 10 overs, while their pace counterparts went wicketless and leaked 122 runs from the same amount. England captain Moeen Ali:""West Indies were the better team. We didn't adapt to the conditions and just fell short. ""We are working on our death bowling but I didn't think we were too bad today. We'll get better as time goes on. They were smarter than us today with bat and ball."" West Indies skipper Kieron Pollard:""Every single person in the dressing room, well done to every single one of them. This is Jason Holder's ground, his town, but it was total team effort from us. The guys worked hard throughout the series."" Man of the match Jason Holder:""It was a classic finish. It was not the best of starts from us but we just tried to stay in the game.

"Ministers will meet later to decide whether or not to scrap mandatory Covid vaccinations for NHS staff in England. Front-line NHS workers in England must be fully vaccinated by 1 April, meaning they need a first dose by Thursday. If they are not jabbed by April, they will be redeployed or dismissed. Around 77,000 have had no jab at all. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the jabs requirement was being ""kept under review"" but thatit was the ""duty"" of NHS staff to get vaccinated. The policy was proposed when Delta was the dominant variant that was circulating and evidence showed being vaccinated significantly cut the risk of catching and spreading the virus. Since then, a more contagious and slightly milder variant called Omicron has emerged. It has led to an increase in breakthrough infections among people who are vaccinated, although the jabs are still doing a great job at preventing severe cases. Mr Javid told the Health and Social Care Select Committee on Tuesday that it was right to ""reflect"" on the policy now Omicron was dominant. But it is understood no final decisions have been made. The government has been under pressure from some within the health service to scrap the mandate, arguing that it would lead to a staffing crisis. The Royal College of Midwives warned the policy could have a""catastrophic impact"",externalon maternity services, while the Royal College of GPs and Royal College of Nursingcalled for the deadline to be delayed. But the Department of Health and Social Care has previously insisted the policy was ""the right thing to do to protect patients"". The UK Health Security Agency says vaccines have proven to be effective against hospitalisation, mortality, infection and transmission. ""Several studies have provided evidence that vaccines are effective at preventing infection,""a recent report said.,external ""Uninfected individuals cannot transmit; therefore, the vaccines are also effective at preventing transmission."" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told BBC Breakfast that while any change to policy would be a decision for the health secretary, he said ""fundamental facts"" had changed due to Omicron and so any decision would take that into account. There are practical and ethical reasons why the mandatory vaccination policy may go. On a practical level the NHS in England can ill-afford staff to be forced out - there are already nearly 100,000 vacancies. And then on an ethical level - as some staff are pointing out - is it right to insist on vaccination when the benefits are not overwhelmingly clear cut with the rise of the Omicron variant? Vaccination against hepatitis B is a condition of employment for some staff, but that is more than 90% effective against infection and immunity last for years. By comparison immunity against Covid infection after two doses has largely gone after 20 weeks. A booster can initially increase protection to around 70% but by 10 weeks that has started to wane significantly too. It certainly helps to reduce spread, but is it enough to over-ride freedom to choose? And if staffing levels drop further because of the mandate could the risks that pose outweigh the benefits the vaccine brings? Protests against the policyhave been held in cities across the country - and someNHS staff have said they are even considering moving to work in the UK nationswhere vaccination is not compulsory. There are no plans in Scotland and Wales to make Covid jabs mandatory for NHS workers or care home staff, while there will be a public consultation on the issue in Northern Ireland. Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing's director for England, said that while the college would urge all nursing staff to get vaccinated, it ""makes no sense"" to risk losing thousands of workers when there were already many vacancies. She told BBC Breakfast that losing nurses and care staff ""actually puts patients at more risk than not having nurses at all"". Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, said she was ""saddened for all the people who may have lost their jobs needlessly"", with mandatory vaccination already in place in that sector since November. She said the policy had had a ""devastating impact"". Government figures suggest 40,000 care staff had not been vaccinated by the deadline - but it is unclear how many of these lost their jobs because of medical exemptions and redeployment to roles away from the frontline. ""The people who we've lost, we hope they'll think about coming back and we will do everything we can to try and encourage them to come back, but they will have found other roles and they may be happier in their other roles now and not want to move again,"" she said. While the mandatory vaccinations policy is due to come in to force for NHS workers on 1 April, Thursday is the final day on which workers could get their first dose with time to be fully vaccinated by that date due to the separation needed between first and second doses. The latest figures show that almost 95% of NHS staff have had at least one Covid jab, leaving about 77,000 who have not. That compares to around 91% of the general population in England who have had at least one jab, although that includes people aged 12 and over. Speaking to MPs on the select committee last week, Mr Javid said not all of them were in patient-facing roles. He said that while it was the ""professional duty of every NHS worker to get vaccinated"" it was ""reasonable to assume"" that not everyone would do so. Mr Javid said the jabs requirement would be ""kept under review"". When pressed on whether that meant the government was considering scrapping it he added: ""We're reflecting on it because we do have to accept that the virus has changed."" One of those who has said he isprepared to lose his job over mandatory vaccinesis specialist paramedic Matt Taylor, 42, who is unvaccinated. He works in primary care in Cumbria and said that he found the argument for the vaccine ""a bit weak"" as the vaccine has not eradicated Covid as some jabs have done with other diseases in the past.
