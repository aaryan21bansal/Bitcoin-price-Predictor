"Fighters at Hairatan At Afghanistan's border with Uzbekistan a cargo train rolls over a bridge and into the newly created ""Islamic Emirate"". The Taliban's white and black flag flutters next to the Uzbek one. Some traders have welcomed the group's return to power. The driver of a truck being loaded with wheat tells me in the past he was regularly forced to pay bribes to corrupt police officials whenever passing their checkpoints. ""Now, it's not like that,"" he says. ""I could drive all the way to Kabul and not pay a penny."" It's been exactly one month since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. Now cash is in short supply, and the country is facing a mounting economic crisis. One source in the business community tells us trade levels have dropped significantly, as Afghan importers aren't able to pay for new goods. The Taliban's head of customs at Hairatan port, Maulvi Saeed, tells us the group is cutting duty rates to promote trade, and wants to encourage wealthy traders to return to the country. ""It will create jobs for the people, and the businessmen will be rewarded in the afterlife,"" he says. Around an hour's drive away is Mazar-i-Sharif, the country's fourth largest city. On the surface life appears to be continuing as normal, though many are suffering financially. I head to the intricately tiled Blue Mosque, the cultural heart of the city. I was last here in August, shortly before the Taliban takeover. Back then, the grounds were teeming with young men and women posing for selfies. The Blue Mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif Now the Taliban have allocated separate visiting times according to gender: women can come in the mornings, men the rest of the day. When we visit, there are plenty of women strolling around, but there seem to be significantly fewer than before. ""Things are alright, but maybe people still need more time to get used to the new government,"" one woman suggests timidly. I'm meeting Haji Hekmat, an influential local Taliban leader. ""You might have brought security,"" I put to him, ""but your critics say you're killing the culture here."" ""No,"" he replies emphatically, ""Western influences have been here for the past 20 yearsâ¦ Control of Afghanistan has passed from one foreign hand to another for 40 years, we have lost our own traditions and values. We are bringing our culture back to life."" According to his understanding of Islam, the mixing of men and women is prohibited. Haji Hekmat: ""Western influences have been here for the past 20 yearsâ¦ We are bringing our culture back to life"" Haji Hekmat seems genuinely convinced the Taliban enjoy the support of the people. Out of his earshot, however, one female visitor whispered to a colleague, ""These are not good people."" Whilst the Taliban's interpretation of Islam might clash less with the values of those in more rural, socially conservative villages - in bigger Afghan cities, many remain deeply suspicious of the group. Haji Hekmat puts this down to years of ""propaganda"" but a history of suicide bombings and targeted assassinations in urban areas is clearly also responsible. As we leave the Blue Mosque, we spot a large and excited crowd by the main road, and elbow our way to the centre. Four dead bodies with bullet wounds are laid out on display. One has a small handwritten note on top of it describing the men as kidnappers, warning other criminals their punishment will be the same. Despite the smell of the bodies under the hot sun, the crowd snap photos and try to push past each other for a better look. Violent crime has long been a major problem in Afghanistan's big cities, and even their critics credit the Taliban with improving security. One onlooker tells us, ""If they are kidnappers it's a good thing. It will be a lesson for others."" PROFILES:Who's who in the Taliban leadership INVESTIGATION:Taliban kill civilians in resistance stronghold VOICES:Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women But lots of others in the city don't feel safe. Law student Farzana, tells us, ""Every time I step out of my house and I see the Taliban, I shiver with fear."" Private universities like hers are open, but those run by the government remain shut for now. Under the new Taliban rule, male and female students who are studying in the same classroom must be separated by a curtain. For Farzana, that's not the priority though. She's concerned that the Taliban may not let women work - something the group has denied. For the moment, though, women in Afghanistan are being told to stay at home for their own safety, unless they are teachers or medics. Male and female university students are separated by a curtain ""Right now I feel hopeless,"" Farzana says, ""but I'm doing my best to stay optimistic for the future."" The last time the Taliban were in power, they introduced far more restrictive measures than they have so far on this occasion, banning women from leaving home without a male companion for example. Much of the fear in Afghan cities today is that similar laws could eventually be introduced again. Whilst the Taliban are in firm control of the country, they're yet to win the hearts and minds of many residents. Haji Hekmat acknowledges, ""Taking over the country militarily was hard, implementing the rule of law and protecting it is even harder."" Additional reporting by Malik Mudasir and Shams Ahmadzai.

"Fashion firms Asos and Primark have announced new sustainability commitments, with both saying they will keep prices affordable. Asos says it is aiming to achieve a net-zero impact on the environment by 2030. Primark says its clothes will be made using recycled or ""more sustainably sourced materials"" by the same date. The budget retailer has also promised to halve carbon emissions across its operations. Critics warned, however, that these goals will be hard to track as fast-fashion supply chains often lack transparency. On Thursday, Asos set out new environmental and social targets. They include: Reducing carbon emissions generated by its clothes production and deliveries Ensuring all of its own-brand products are made from sustainable or recycled materials by 2030 Giving customers more information on its supply chain Recruiting a more diverse workforce, including 50% female representation across its leadership team Its chief executive, Nick Beighton, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We need to work with our partners on this to offset any minimal cost increases we anticipate from doing this."" He added that he expects more consumers to choose to shop with Asos based on those commitments. ""The responsibility for a sustainable future lies with all of us and businesses must lead the way,"" he said. Boohoo boss: 'We're not a throwaway fashion brand' Small changes you can make for a greener life Asda to start selling second-hand clothes in shops In a statement, Primark also said it would design its clothes to be more durable so they can be recycled and last longer - without increasing its prices. It said it would ""pursue a living wage for workers in its supply chain"", but did not specify how much this wage would be in the countries where it has employees or when this would happen. Primark has 397 stores across 14 countries and employs about 70,000 people. The company's chief executive, Paul Marchant, said: ""Sustainability shouldn't be priced at a premium that only a minority can afford. ""Because of who we are, we believe we have the opportunity to make more sustainable fashion choices affordable to all."" Primark said it would eliminate single-use plastics in its own operations, but it doesnot own the majority of factories which manufacture its clothes.,external However, Noelle Hatley, lecturer in fashion business at Manchester Metropolitan University's Fashion Institute, said that using language such as ""ambitions"" and ""pursuing"" was vague. ""They need to be setting measurable targets, how many suppliers and factories and by what date will living wages be paid?"" Over the next year, Primark said it would make all men's, women's and kids' entry price point T-shirts from sustainably sourced cotton. But Ms Hatley said that ""without transparency of costings it is difficult to know how they can achieve this as the fast fashion business model relies on 'unsustainable' or 'below real cost' prices"". Though she said the announcement is encouraging, Ms Hatley added that if prices are being maintained, it ""would be good for them to share how they are achieving this; for example, are they accepting a lower margin, or is the factory being paid the same for what could be more expensive materials?"" Kate Fletcher, research professor at the Centre for Sustainable Fashion at the University of the Arts London, said that the problem of fast-fashion is volume and questions remain about how Primark is going to put limits around how many pieces it produces. ""The real change comes with the detail not in the commitments and aspirations,"" she said. ""What I'd like to see are details on what the real and living wages would be in different countries."" Primark was one of a number of retailers that attracted strong criticism in 2013 after more than 1,100 workers were killed in the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh. The Irish firm - which was one of 23 brands being produced at the garment factory - extended payments to victims and families affected. A worker in a Bangladeshi factory typically earns around 10p an hour. It was one of theworst industrial accidents in recent memoryand prompted more scrutiny of working conditions in garment factories. The global fashion industry produced an estimated 2.1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2018, and uses more energy than both aviation and shipping combined. It alsoaccounts for nearly 20% of waste water,external. Asos was also criticised ina recent report by the Royal Society of Arts,external(RSA) that found that more than a third of items listed on its website were made entirely from new plastics. The RSA pointed out that Asos had performed better than other firms such as Boohoo and Missguided, but said that fast fashion firms had more work to do. In the UK, citizens buy more new clothes than any other European country and anestimated 350,000 tonnes of clothes end up in landfill every year,external.

"Most people do not believe workers will return to the office full-time after the coronavirus pandemic, an exclusive survey for the BBC suggests. A total of 70% of 1,684 people polled predicted that workers would ""never return to offices at the same rate"". The majority of workers said that they would prefer to work from home either full-time or at least some of the time. But managers raised concerns that creativity in the workplace would be affected. Half of 530 senior leaders also surveyed by polling organisation YouGov for the BBC said that workers staying at home would adversely affect both creativity and collaboration - against just 38% of the general public. Bosses at big firms such as investment bank Goldman Sachs andtech giant Applehave rejected calls for more flexibility, with the former evencalling working from home an ""aberration"". Managers and members of the public surveyed for the BBC agreed, however, that neither productivity nor the economy would be harmed by continuing work-from-home policies. BT's chief executive Philip Jansen, for example, told the BBC that it is planning to let most of its office workers work on-site three or four days of the week in future - although thousands of its engineers won't be offered the same flexibility. ""We are a people business so collaboration, dynamism, teamwork, creativity... is really important to us,"" he said. According to the research, more than three-quarters of people believe their boss will allow them to continue working from home some of the time. According to the latest official figures,external, the proportion of workers who did at least some work from home in 2020 increased to 37%, up from 27% the previous year.

Under the scheme, Jobcentre work coaches match young people aged between 16 and 24 who are on Universal Credit to new, temporary, roles. While Maisie is grateful for the six-month contract, she's keen to be in the office as much as possible so she can make a good impression. ""I've never had a job where I'm speaking to people online or emailing,"" she says, referring to her past experience in retail. She adds: ""I'm more productive when I am in the office because it's more of a professional environment and you get to see people."" Having started the role remotely, she only got to meet her colleagues for the first time in-person recently. ""We recently had team drinks and I finally got to meet everyone. It was really nice, I got to see everyone in person and get an idea of who they are, rather than just what their email is."" She says she will still take the opportunity to work from home some days, though, perhaps towards the end of the week. More than 60% of those surveyed thought young people would struggle to progress without face-to-face contact or in-person mentoring. As experts have pointed out, under-25s in particular were hit hard by job losses or reduced hours at the onset of the pandemic. Five ways we think office work will change Should I be working at home or going to the office? The bespoke research for the BBC suggests that some inequalities may be exacerbated by the pandemic, while others might have improved. Half of the workers surveyed thought that women's careers might be boosted by home-working, with childcare duties being less of a hindrance. One enthusiastic home-worker is Antony Howard, who works in procurement for a large defence company in Manchester. He's found big benefits to logging on remotely for the last 16 months, from avoiding expensive coffee shops to cutting down on travel time. ""My health and carbon footprint have never been better. I'm no longer commuting 92 miles a day and I'm more productive,"" he says. While he's also been saving money by shopping more locally, he does worry about those newer to the company. ""We've had 17-year-old apprentices starting in September who have never been on-site,"" he says. ""For me as a 57-year-old, hybrid working is a great scenario, but for the younger ones starting out, they need that workplace experience, that structure."" Even so, he hopes that the pandemic will ""recalibrate"" the workplace. Rather than being a novelty, he says, ""I think this is the new now."" Recruiters are finding it tricky to navigate the expectations of candidates demanding hybrid and remote working, and companies who want people back in the office for at least some of the time. Kam Vara says people are turning down jobs which don't offer remote working Kam Vara, a consultant at Katie Bard recruitment, says it has been a very challenging few months. ""It used to be that people would fit their lives around their work. Covid is teaching people that it doesn't work that way any more"", she says. ""People are turning down opportunities because they don't offer remote working, and they would rather sit tight and wait for the right job to become available"". She adds: ""It feels quite messy right now. What an employer is looking for is some sort of order. To get people into the office and have some structure. But what employees are looking for is something very different. It's going to be like this for a while until the jigsaw fits together."" In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson recommended a ""gradual return to work"" over the summer as coronavirus restrictions eased. Across the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep clocking on remotely where possible. And working remotely full-time for office staff could well become the norm again. This video can not be played Q&A: How do you bring people back to workplace? On Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPsthat advising people in England should work from home again would be part of the government's contingency plans if there was considerable pressure on the NHS this winter. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, added that the policy could make ""a significant difference to transmission if we get into trouble"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday: ""The most important and effective way of reducing spread of the virus is not to be in contact with other people."" The BBC commissioned polling organisation YouGov to survey 1,684 working adults and 530 senior leaders in business about their predictions and opinions on working from home. YouGov also re-ran a previous survey of 4,041 British adults, first conducted in March 2021, about their current working from home situation. Have your working arrangements changed?

The 64-year-old becomes the 10th culture secretary in 10 years. Born in Liverpool in 1957, Dorries started out as a nurse before entering politics in 2000. Prior to her election in 2005 she worked a special adviser to Oliver Letwin, the then shadow chancellor. The politician and author said she was ""very"" happy with her new appointment A staunch Brexiteer, Dorries has had an occasionally fractious relationships with the leaders of her party.

"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

"Microsoft has announced users can now delete all passwords from their accounts and instead login using an authenticator app or other solution. The technology giant made passwordless accounts available for business users of its products in March. And that system is now being made available to all Microsoft or Windows users. It said ""nearly 100% of our employees"" were already using the new, more secure system for their corporate accounts. If passwordless login is enabled, users re-logging in to a Microsoft account will be asked to give their fingerprint, or other secure unlock, on their mobile phone. Why passwords don't work, and what will replace them Pets' names 'used as passwords by millions' Gadget-makers face ban on easy-to-guess passwords And this is far more secure than using passwords, which can be guessed or stolen, according to Microsoft. ""Only you can provide fingerprint authentication or provide the right response on your mobile at the right time,"" it said. Windows users will still be able to use quick-login features such as a Pin code, though. Some rare exceptions will still need passwords, such as Office 2010, Xbox 360 consoles, and Windows 8.1 or earlier machines. And if access to the authenticator app is lost - for example, if the phone it is installed on is lost or stolen or a user forgets when upgrading - backup options can be used, including: Windows Hello facial recognition, which requires a compatible laptop or special camera a physical security key, which must be used on the device logging in Short Message Service (SMS) or email codes But SMS and email are two of the most common channels for cyber-criminals targeting specific individuals And Microsoft says security-conscious users who have two-factor authentication set up will need to have access to two different recovery methods. Microsoft's messaging tells customers no passwords are more secure Prof Alan Woodward, part of a research team investigating passwordless authentication, at the University of Surrey, called it ""quite a bold step from Microsoft"". ""This isn't just logging into PCs, it's logging into online services as well"" - including important ones such as cloud storage, he said. Microsoft laid out its reasons for the new system,externalin a series of blog posts. Security vice-president Vasu Jakkal wrote: ""Passwords are incredibly inconvenient to create, remember, and manage across all the accounts in our lives. ""We are expected to create complex and unique passwords, remember them, and change them frequently - but nobody likes doing that."" The separate authenticator app - not pictured in this stock photo - is claimed to be more secure than a password Instead, people tended to create insecure passwords that technically cleared the bar for using symbols, numbers or case sensitivity - but in order to remember them, used a repeated formula or the same password on multiple websites. And that led to hackers guessing them or revealing them in a data breach and reusing them. ""Hackers don't break in, they log in,"" the blog post read. The new passwordless feature greets users with a box saying: ""A passwordless account reduces the risk of phishing and password attacks."" And once the feature is set up, a confirmation tells users: ""You have increased the security of your account and improved your sign-in experience by removing your password"". Microsoft's claims about poor password use were largely true, Prof Woodward said. ""The message has been pummelled home about what good password hygiene looks like - but it's easier said than done,"" he said. Passwords were a decades-old concept ""and maybe the time is now right to start looking for something different"". But there were no currently agreed standards. ""There are a number of different ways this could be done - and it would be good if everybody moved on, really, and tried to find a way of doing this,"" Prof Woodward said.

"Boris Johnson is overseeing a reshuffle of his cabinet. BBC editors and correspondents look back at the performances of the politicians leaving their job - and the challenges facing those who are taking over. Dominic Raab is always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And given that his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected suggests that he fought his move pretty hard. Being justice secretary, running prisons, courts and the legal system, is of course a huge job. And it matches his legal experience too. But there's no doubt that it is a demotion, losing out on one of the most prestigious jobs in government as foreign secretary. Downing Street doesn't want this to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, as a debacle in Afghanistan, Mr Raab even taking his family holiday during the crisis. But even with the bauble of deputy prime minister as part of his title (you wonder if title was a product of the tetchy conversations), Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government. What's Johnson's reshuffle really all about? The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post. As a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit. She will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy. Like the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: ""I don't think anyone would describe me as diplomatic."" Next week, Ms Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York. She will play a key role in the government's efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair. For the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting. Gavin Williamson found himself in the hot seat when schools closed their classrooms, and moved to on-and-off remote learning. It put him in the firing line for criticism from overstretched and exasperated head teachers and parents, as government policy led to sudden changes in direction. As schools in England geared up to support the poorest families through hard times, they faced delays, first with food vouchers, then with devices. Confusing England footballer Marcus Rashford with another black sportsman added to the perception of being prone to gaffes. But it was in the days before and after A-level results of 2020 in England when the chaos peaked. The education secretary defended the system, before a massive U-turn that felt inevitable. Mr Williamson has said he is most proud of his contribution to giving skills a higher profile. The cost of implementing an eye-catching promise of a life-long learning loan will be in his successor's in-tray, as will looming decisions about future university funding. For a government committed to levelling up, the long-term impact of the pandemic on the poorest children's education is the other big challenge. The Â£3bn promised for catch-up fell so far short that the government's own adviser resigned earlier this year. There have been eight justice secretaries since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 - and Robert Buckland's two years, one month and 22 days makes him the third-longest holder of a post that the entire legal establishment regards as having being treated as an afterthought. Mr Buckland, a respected lawyer and former judge, leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. That's 4,000 more than in January, when official watchdogs warned that the backlog was already of grave concern. The upshot is that some victims will be waiting four years for justice. Incoming Justice Secretary Dominic Raab may not have actually been appointed to deal with this problem - but to take on an ideological challenge. Mr Raab has credentials for speaking up on some human rights legal issues, yet he is also one of the most vocal critics of the Human Rights Act, one of the cornerstones of the modern British constitution. He's long called for it to be replaced or repealed - and the government's long-promised review of human rights law is now in his hands. We'll soon find out where Mr Raab ultimately stands on one of the most important but misunderstood legal issues of our times. She's the 10th culture secretary in 10 years. Nadine Dorries, a successful novelist, a former contestant on I'm a Celebrity (which led to a brief suspension of the Conservative whip) and a strong advocate of gender equality on the BBC certainly has a track record in taking an interest in cultural matters. In 2017 she tweeted: ""Left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy, tearing down historic statues, removing books from universities, dumbing down panto."" Her move to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) came on the day her predecessor, Oliver Dowden, was due to deliver his opinions on the future of Channel 4. That speech was instead made by media minister John Whittingdale. Sport, gambling, the future of the BBC, broadband services: the DCMS has a broad remit that covers everything from dealing with the tech giants to helping to alleviate loneliness. And over recent months Mr Dowden has increasingly entered debates about so-called ""woke culture"", statues and removing ""contested heritage"". This is political territory on which the new culture secretary has already expressed strong views.

Raducanu retired from her fourth-round matchwith Ajla Tomljanovic at SW19 because of breathing difficulties and McEnroe was criticised at the time for describing the occasion as being ""a little bit too much for her"". Speaking on CNN, McEnroe stood by his comments but insisted they had been blown out of proportion and that he always intended to be supportive.

He went on to praise Raducanu's achievements in taking her maiden Grand Slam victory. ""More important than what I said is how she handled it moving forward, because I'm sure there was a lot of concern about she would handle this sort of newfound fame.

"This video can not be played The US, UK and Australian leaders welcomed what President Biden described as a ""historic step"" The UK, US and Australia have announced a historic security pact in the Asia-Pacific, in what's seen as an effort to counter China. It will let Australia build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time, using technology provided by the US. The Aukus pact, which will also cover AI and other technologies, is one of the countries' biggest defence partnerships in decades, analysts say. China has condemned the agreement as ""extremely irresponsible"". Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it ""seriously undermines regional peace and stability and intensifies the arms race"". China's embassy in Washington accused the countries of a ""Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice"". The pact also created a row with France, which has now lost a deal with Australia to build 12 submarines. ""It's really a stab in the back,"" France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio. The new partnership was announced in a joint virtual press conference between US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. And while China was not mentioned directly, the three leaders referred repeatedly to regional security concerns which they said had ""grown significantly"". This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China Speaking to the BBC, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said China was ""embarking on one of the biggest military spends in history"". ""It is growing its navy [and] air force at a huge rate. Obviously it is engaged in some disputed areas,"" he said. ""Our partners in those regions want to be able to stand their own ground."" In recent years, Beijing has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea. ANALYSIS: Why this pact signals a major shift EXPLAINED: Tensions in the South China Sea On Thursday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pact would ""preserve security and stability around the world"" and generate ""hundreds of high-skilled jobs"". He also said the relationship with France was ""rock solid"". The Aukus alliance is probably the most significant security arrangement between the three nations since World War Two, analysts say. The pact will focus on military capability, separating it from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance which also includes New Zealand and Canada. While Australia's submarines is the big-ticket item, Aukus will also involve the sharing of cyber capabilities and other undersea technologies. ""This is an historic opportunity for the three nations, with like-minded allies and partners, to protect shared values and promote security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,"" the joint statement read. ""This really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter [China's] aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific,"" said Guy Boekenstein from the Asia Society Australia. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said trust with Australia ""had been betrayed"" Western nations have been wary of China's infrastructure investment on Pacific islands, and have also criticised China's trade sanctions against countries like Australia. Australia had in the past maintained good relations with China, its biggest trading partner. But the relationship has broken down in recent years amid political tensions. But there is tension now too with France, after Australia tore up the A$50bn (â¬31bn; Â£27bn) deal to build 12 submarines. ""We had established a relationship of trust with Australia, this trust has been betrayed,"" Mr Le Drian said. These submarines are much faster and harder to detect than conventionally powered fleets. They can stay submerged for months, shoot missiles longer distances and also carry more. Having them stationed in Australia is critical to US influence in the region, analysts say. The US is sharing its submarine technology for the first time in 50 years. It had previously only shared technology with the UK. Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines, after the US, UK, France, China, India and Russia. Australia has reaffirmed it has no intention of obtaining nuclear weapons. Meanwhile New Zealand said it would ban Australia's submarines from its waters, in line with an existing policy on the presence of nuclear-powered submarines. New Zealand, although a Five Eyes member, has been more cautiousin aligning with either the US or China in the Pacific. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her nation had not been approached to join the pact. Is the Five Eyes alliance in trouble?

"Maggie Nichols, who came forward initially as 'Athlete A' What did it take to bring down Dr Larry Nassar - the USA Gymnastics team doctor who abused hundreds of young women? Why did the abuse continue for more than two decades? And did USA Gymnastics (USAG) cover it up? These are some of the questions explored in Athlete A, a new documentary out on Netflix. BBC Sport spoke to directors Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk, as well as Rachael Denhollander - the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar and a key contributor to the film. Oct 2017: Olympic gymnast Maroney makes abuse claim Jan 2018: Nassar abused me - four-time Olympic champion Biles Feb 2018: Nassar jailed for up to 300 years for abusing at least 265 women Dec 2018: US Olympics Committee apologises for Nassar failings Jan 2020: USAG offers $215m to abused athletes Nassar, a former USAG team doctor, wassentenced to more than 300 years for molesting young gymnastsin 2018. An investigation by the Indianapolis Star, which began in 2016 with help from survivors, police and attorneys, brought Nassar to justice. But the documentary reveals Nassar was never the main target for the newspaper. ""When we started to work with the IndyStar, we started to realise the investigation that led them to Nassar was actually an investigation into USA Gymnastics policy, around how it dealt with reports of sexual abuse,"" Shenk tells BBC Sport. Cohen adds: ""Larry Nassar was just one bad guy within a system that has tolerated abuse for decades. The truth that was exposed was that they had been burying cases for many, many years."" In a filmed deposition shown in the documentary, former USAG president Steve Penny admits the organisation did not always pass reports of assault straight to police. Penny resigned from USAG in 2017 and was subsequentlyarrested for allegedly tampering with evidencein relation to Nassar. Penny refutes any suggestion of a cover-up and denies any wrongdoing. USAG says it has shifted its organisation ""to be more athlete-centric"" with newly created athlete health and wellness roles, a new ""safe sport"" policy, and new educational initiatives. Cohen and Shenk say the initial story came from former USA gymnast, Jennifer Sey, who was national champion in 1986 before retiring from the sport in 1988. In 2008, she published a book called Chalked Up: Inside Elite Gymnastics' Merciless Coaching, Overzealous Parents, Eating Disorders, And Elusive Olympic Dreams. ""When the Larry Nassar news started to break a few years ago, she was very much in touch with the gymnasts at the centre of that story,"" says Shenk. ""Ultimately, she got to know the journalists who were telling the story."" Shenk adds that access to the IndyStar investigation enabled them to start filming before Nassar went to trial. ""As the number of survivors coming forward kept rising, we were able to document that,"" he says. Jennifer Sey retired from gymnastics before the 1988 Olympics There are a lot of heroes in this film - journalists Marisa Kwiatkowski, Mark Alesia, Tim Evans and Steve Berta at the IndyStar; Detective Lieutenant Andrea Munford, who found child pornography images at Nassar's house; lawyers John Manly and Angela Povilaitis, who represented the survivors. Of the survivors, there are three main focal points - former USA gymnasts Maggie Nichols, Denhollander and Jamie Dantzscher. The titular ""Athlete A"" is Nichols, who reported Nassar to USAG in June 2015. Her family argue in the film that the claim was not dealt with properly. ""We were not going to go public, because we were told there was an FBI investigation and we could possibly jeopardise it,"" says Nichols' father, John. Rachael Denhollander was the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar Denhollander, who is now a lawyer, was the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar. She was 15 when she went to see him for an appointment at Michigan State University. Over a year and a half, he repeatedly abused her, under the guise of treatment. Some 16 years later, when Denhollander came across the IndyStar article alleging malpractice at USAG in 2016, she came forward to share her story. She had previously reported Nassar to a gym where she was working, but it was not taken further. Alesia, a journalist at the IndyStar, explains how Denhollander turned up with about 100 pages of medical notes and a case prepared against Nassar. At around the same time, Dantzscher also spoke to the paper, anonymously. In response to these public statements, Nassar's lawyers denied he had ever touched a patient inappropriately during treatment. Hundreds of women, who knew that to be untrue, then came forward. Jamie Dantzscher won team bronze at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney In the documentary, Sey argues that emotional and physical abuse ""was actually the norm"" during her time as a gymnast. Former USAG coaches Bela and Martha Karolyi, who came over from Communist Romania, where they coached 14-year-old Nadia Comaneci to a perfect score at the 1976 Olympics, are portrayed as having created a dangerous atmosphere. ""They brought with them the Eastern European methodology, which included not feeding the athletes very much and abusing them in various physical and psychological ways,"" Cohen tells BBC Sport. She argues that laid way for ""a way of thinking that would enable a predator like Nassar"". Bela and Martha Karolyi both deny the allegations and say they were never physically or verbally abusive. Dantzscher describes how, at the time, Nassar seemed like ""the only nice person"" in gymnastics. She tells stories about him sneaking the girls candy at the Karolyi ranch, where the athletes trained monthly and where parents were not allowed access. Larry Nassar has been sentenced to over 300 years in jail When Denhollander took her story to the IndyStar, she also told Michigan State University Police, and she says she was not surprised to discover there had been multiple reports against him, from as far back as 1997. ""Larry was able to stay every time by simply saying: 'These women are confused'"" Denhollander tells BBC Sport. ""It is a product of a community and a culture that sends the message that the sexual assault and abuse of women is not a big deal."" Shenk says: ""Ultimately, it's a story about people who were taken advantage of by an organisation that lost sight of its responsibility."" He believes that those in power were guilty of neglect as gymnastics became more marketable. ""The Olympics is a big event in the United States. But, over the years, it became very much about the marketing of the athletes. Unfortunately, many of the organisations, including USA Gymnastics, did not have policies in place to protect the, often very young, athletes."" Shenk tells us there is some unfinished business. 'We still don't have a final settlement for many of the survivors who have filed suits against USA Gymnastics,"" he says. Earlier this year, USAGproposed a settlement,externalthatit is reported,externalwould release Penny, the Karolyis and others from liability. That was criticised by American four-time Olympic champion Simone Biles and Denhollander, among others. When asked what still needs to be done to mean justice has been done, Denhollander is unequivocal: ""The answer is everything.""

"Britain is about to embark on a world tour - in the shape of the Royal Navy's aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by a fleet of warships. The Royal Navy says it will be the most powerful UK naval deployment in a generation. The government sees the fleet, named the Carrier Strike Group, as a potent symbol of ""Global Britain"" - and as proof of Boris Johnson's promise to restore the Royal Navy as Europe's foremost naval power and end what he called an ""era of retreat"". The prime minister spent this morning on board HMS Queen Elizabeth in Portsmouth naval base, ahead of its maiden operational deployment. But is this world tour more than a symbol of national virility or a flag-waving exercise? And what's the point of sailing halfway across the world? Over the next 28 weeks the Carrier Strike Group will cover 26,000 miles - further than the distance around the world at the equator. F-35B Lightning aircraft returning to HMS Queen Elizabeth during a training exercise HMS Queen Elizabeth will first sail into the Mediterranean. From there, she is planning to launch her F-35 jets to conduct airstrikes over Iraq against the group known as Islamic State. It would be the carrier's first combat operation - even though the RAF has been doing the same mission for the past seven years from its land base on Cyprus. Perhaps more controversial is the decision to then go east. The strike group will sail through the Suez Canal, out to the Indian Ocean and on to the Philippine Sea. HMS Queen Elizabeth is scheduled to make a number of port stops along way - including Oman, Singapore, South Korea and Japan. Like the US, Britain is responding to the rise of China. But unlike America, Britain has less influence and fewer resources to match. For UK foreign policy it means a more modest ""tilt"" to Asia rather than the US ""pivot"". HMS Queen Elizabeth will be accompanied by two Royal Navy Frigates, two Destroyers, two supply ships and -  beneath the surface - an Astute Class Submarine. An American Navy Destroyer and a Dutch Frigate will be part of the strike group. There'll also be more American jets on board the carrier: 10 US Marine Corps F-35s compared to the Britain's eight. The government insists the addition of allies is a sign of strength rather than weakness. But it is also an indication that Britain's Armed Forces are now smaller and can do less on their own. This video can not be played Watch: What's it like on board HMS Queen Elizabeth? The strike group will sail through the South China Sea where China has been expanding its claim to territorial waters. But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace insists Britain is not looking for a ""confrontation"". Instead, he says the carrier group will exercise its right to freedom of navigation. So do not expect a repeat of what happened in 2018 when another Royal Navy Warship, HMS Albion, deliberately sailed close to the disputed Paracel Islands,prompting an angry response from Beijing. The prime minister visited HMS Queen Elizabeth in Portsmouth earlier These sensitivities highlight ambiguities in Britain's policy towards China. The British government says it still wants a constructive relationship - not least on trade. Two former defence chiefs have questioned the decision to send the strike group east. Lord Nicholas Houghton recently told MPs that ""it was not necessarily the best way of seeking an accommodation"" with Beijing, while Lord David Richards said Britain should be focusing its attention closer to home ""on Nato and the Euro-Atlantic area"". But the deployment has as much to do with boosting trade and strengthening diplomatic ties in the region. At sea it'll be conducting military exercises with allies, including Japan, Australia and the US. During her port visits, HMS Queen Elizabeth will become a giant floating trade and diplomatic mission. In the words of the head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Tony Radakin: ""Navies follow trade and trade follows navies."" He says this deployment shows the Navy is ""flying the flag for Britain and carrying forward the prime minister's vision"" of a ""Global Britain"". Some argue there might have been better ways of sending a strong message to China. Dr Peter Roberts, director of military sciences at RUSI, a defence and security think tank, says that instead of what he calls ""a predictable, long and slow deployment"", the Royal Navy could have dispatched two of its hunter-killer submarines. If they set off north, under the Arctic ice, and then popped up in the Pacific, he suggests, that would have had a greater impact on challenging both Russian and Chinese behaviour. The former national security adviser, Lord Peter Ricketts, believes it still makes sense to send the carrier east as a ""symbol of working closely with allies"". This is not least to get a return on the significant investment in the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers. But, he adds, ""this is a piece of diplomatic theatre, not a military strategy"".

"A PM is rarely as powerful as on a reshuffle day ""This is a mad way to run the country,"" confessed a member of the government. Whether prime ministers wield sharp knives or attack with blunt spoons, reshuffle days like this are indeed a strange mixture of bravado and farce. Bravado when, earlier, one cabinet minister told me, ""I think I'm OK,"" as, ashen-faced, looking nauseous and clammy, they were en route to see the prime minister before promptly being sacked. And farce when, as legend has it, on several occasions, would-be ministers end up jobless, because the post-it notes with their name on fell off the board. Forgotten, their career plunged to the floor too. The way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: ""Is it on?"" And inhabitants of the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. But, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. Johnson rings changes with major cabinet reshuffle Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? And Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet. The most significant switch came in one of the chunkiest jobs of all. Removing the foreign secretary is a big deal. Dominic Raab's always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected, suggesting he fought his move pretty hard. Sources suggest he managed to wangle the ill-defined title of deputy prime minister out of Mr Johnson. Being justice secretary, running prisons, courts, and the legal system, is of course a huge job. Downing Street insists it's not a demotion, and that it doesn't want this move to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, like a debacle in Afghanistan. But even with the DPM bauble, Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government. There are some other slightly puzzling aspects. Steve Barclay was, until the reshuffle, chief secretary to the Treasury, wielding the calculator on what is a hugely important Spending Review, when cash for departments for the next few years is fixed. That review is coming in just a few weeks' time, so you might wonder at the wisdom of moving Mr Barclay right now. He's being replaced by Simon Clarke, a previous inhabitant of a Treasury role, a strong supporter of Mr Johnson and North East MP. He's also, at 6ft 7ins, around a foot taller than his new boss in Number 11 - cue the inevitable jokes about Number 10 wanting to make the chancellor feel small. Anne-Marie Trevelyan is back on the top team In a similar vein Anne-Marie Trevelyan, also a strong Johnson backer, returns to cabinet as trade secretary. Irrespective of the merit of her move to that department, Ms Trevelyan had been part of the government's team preparing for COP26, a major international event that starts in about 50 days. If it's a true priority, unpicking a part of the team right now may raise a few eyebrows. There are many more jobs to be allocated, more intrigue to come when middle-ranking and junior ministers get their P45s or offers. But the shape of the cabinet itself is clear. What's harder to divine is any one strong political ideology, or any radical guiding idea. Certainly, politicians popular with the Tory party like Truss seem to have prospered. Loyalty to the prime minister himself seems to have been rewarded. But it's not a Brexit cabinet, or a small-state cabinet, or to use Tory verbiage, a ""one-nation"" cabinet for those more in the middle. It's a Johnson cabinet, with no particular bent towards any one faction or tribe. For some of his backers, that is one of Mr Johnson's attributes - he's not wedded to principle, but staying on top. For other Tories, that's rather the problem - with no one strong ideology other than a desire to win, it begs the question of what it's all really for. For Downing Street, though, this is a day for the doers. After the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done. Whether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case. Nearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister. And while the shuffling of his cabinet pack has passed, so far largely without incident, there is no doubt about the scale of the challenge, individual and collective, that they face.

"Jess Brammar has been appointed to a senior role in BBC News, despite an impartiality row over her old tweets. A former editor of HuffPost UK, she will now oversee the BBC's domestic and international news channels. It comes after weeks of wrangling, during which time BBC board member Sir Robbie Gibb was said to have objected to her appointment. Some media outlets drew attention to her now-deleted tweets, which were critical of Brexit and the government. Sir Robbie was said to have warned that hiring Brammar would anger ministers, at a time when the BBC is about to enter negotiations for the licence fee that funds its operations. But her appointment was confirmed by BBC chairman Richard Sharp at the Royal Television Society's Cambridge Convention on Wednesday, Brammar said she was ""looking forward to cracking on with the job"". The newly-created role of executive editor will involve oversight of the BBC News channel and its international equivalent, BBC World. Brammar has previously worked at BBC programmes Question Time and Newsnight, as well as at ITN. But her appointment was mired in controversy for several weeks, after it emerged she had criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson on social media. In July, the Financial Times reported,externalSir Robbie had warned the BBC's outgoing director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, that the government's ""fragile trust in the BBC will be shattered"" were Brammar to be appointed. Sir Robbie, who previously worked as communications director to former prime minister Theresa May,was appointed to the BBC board in April. Jacob Rees-Mogg agreed, commenting later that month that Brammar's potential appointment ""damages the whole perception of independence and impartiality at the BBC"". He added: ""They really do damage themselves"". Brammar previous tweets included accusing the PM of lying in a TV interview, and also compared Brexit to the TV series Better Call Saul, ""but less funny or interesting or enjoyable"". Earlier this year, she criticised the Society of Editors' response to claims by Meghan Markle of racism in the British press. ""I'm aware I won't make myself popular with my peers,"" Brammar tweeted, ""but I'm just going to stand up and say it: I don't agree with [the] statement from my industry body that it is 'untrue that sections of the UK press were bigoted'."" Unsworth confirmed Brammar's appointment in an email to staff on Wednesday, while addressing the recent controversy. ""Jess is an award-winning editor with wide-ranging experience in broadcasting,"" she wrote. Addressing the recent controversy, she added: ""BBC News has to be impartial and independent. BBC journalists are hired from a variety of different backgrounds, but while working at the BBC, they leave any personal opinions at the door."" ""Any individual should be judged on how they do their job at the BBC, not on what they have done in different organisations with very different objectives,"" she added. ""It is extremely disappointing that anyone should receive public and personal criticism - or online abuse - simply for applying for a job at the BBC."" Writing on Twitter for the first time in several weeks, Brammar added that ""couldn't be more thrilled to be joining such an incredibly talented team"". Allow Twitter content?

"Dominic Raab has resigned as deputy prime minister, following an investigation into claims of alleged bullying. Mr Raab, who was also the justice secretary, had always denied the allegations but said he would quit if bullying claims were upheld. He has done that, but in his resignation letter to Rishi Sunak, and in an article penned for the Telegraph newspaper, Mr Raabalso hit back. While the report from senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC makes uncomfortable reading in parts, Mr Raab - who's changed his Twitter handle to ""MP for Esher and Walton, father of two, boxing fan"" - has thrown a punch of his own. In his letter to the PM, he said ministers needed to be able to give direct critical feedback and exercise direct oversight over their civil servant officials. He apologised for any ""unintended"" stress caused, but referred to the ""pace, standards and challenge"" he brought to the Ministry of Justice. The report cleared the former frontbencher of shouting and swearing at staff, and he was not found to have used physical gestures - but it did say that style of working as a minister was ""inquisitorial, direct, impatient and fastidious"". And it paints a picture of a man who worked from 7.30 in the morning until late at night and at weekends. Mr Raab was found to have described the work of officials as ""utterly useless"" and ""woeful"" while he was justice secretary. And as foreign secretary, a role he served in from 2019 to 2021, the report says in one instance ""he acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting. His conduct also involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates."" Date of birth:25 February 1974 (age 49) Job:Justice secretary, deputy prime minister, lord chancellor, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton Education:Dr Challoner's Grammar School, Amersham, Oxford and Cambridge universities Family:Married to Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive, with two sons Before politics:Foreign Office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague Despite resigning, Mr Raab is entitled to a pay-off of nearly Â£17,000, a quarter of his ministerial salary, as long as he is not reappointed to another position within three weeks. But the MP, who paid his own legal fees during the investigation, faces a pay cut of Â£67,505 as he loses his ministerial salary. As an ordinary backbencher, he will earn Â£86,584 a year. Mr Raab was born in 1974, the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938. He was brought up in Buckinghamshire and attended Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, before studying law at Oxford University and switching to Cambridge for his masters degree. He worked as a lawyer in the commercial sector and the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide to Brexit-supporting Conservative MP David Davis, and then Remain-backing Dominic Grieve. Raab under fire over Dover-Calais comment Raab 'confident' PM will recover from coronavirus Raab ex-colleagues speak as bullying probe nears end First elected to Parliament in 2010, the following year Mr Raab angered then-Home Secretary Theresa May by describing some feminists as ""obnoxious bigots"" in an online article also claiming men were getting ""a raw deal"". Mrs May accused him of fuelling ""gender warfare"". Mr Raab remained on the backbenches for five years after becoming an MP. But the karate black-belt became a junior justice minister following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015. He played a prominent role in the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked by Mrs May when she took over as prime minister. In 2017, Mr Raab was branded ""offensive"" by then-Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying ""the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty; it's someone who has a cash flow problem"". But in June that year he returned to government, as a justice minister, this time middle-ranking rather than junior. In Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle he became housing minister - one of the highest-profile non-cabinet roles in government. And in July that year, when David Davis quit, the prime minister promoted Mr Raab to Brexit secretary, a cabinet post. Yet his improved relationship with Mrs May did not last long. In November 2018, he quit, arguing that he could not ""in good conscience"" support the ""backstop"" arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. As an influential Brexiteer, his comments were seen as significant in increasing opposition to Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs repeatedly rejected. After Mrs May announced she was standing down, Mr Raab entered the contest to become Conservative leader, and prime minister. In a crowded field, he failed to get the 33 MPs' votes he needed to progress to the third round. Fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove outlasted him. Mr Johnson,to whom Mr Raab gave his supportafter his elimination from the race, promoted him to foreign secretary and first secretary of state - effectively deputy prime minister. But he only narrowly managed to hold on to his Esher and Walton seat at the 2019 general election, seeing off a strong Liberal Democrat challenge by 2,743 votes. The overall Conservative landslide, however, on a promise to ""get Brexit done"", meant he saw his dream of leaving the EU come true on 31 January 2020. As foreign secretary and first secretary of state, he was the UK government's de-facto second-in-command. He was left in charge of running much of the government when the prime minister was hospitalised with Covid-19 in April 2020. Colleagues, including Mr Johnson's arch-critic and former aide Dominic Cummings, have praised Mr Raab's performance under extreme pressure. But he has continued to anger opponents with some of his comments, in 2020 telling talkRadio's Julia Hartley-Brewer he would only ""take the knee"" - go down on bended knee - for ""the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me"". He later qualified his remarks - following opposition criticism of his ""insulting"" and ""flippant"" tone - saying he ""fully"" supported the Black Lives Matter campaign. In fact, some of his remarks and gaffes have resulted in mockery. Despite a reputation for being a creature of habit, he dismissed an eye-catchingclaim by a former diary secretary that he insisted on the same Pret A Manger lunch every day. And as Brexit secretary, he came under fire for saying he""hadn't quite understood"" how reliant UK trade in goods was on the Dover-Calais crossing. As foreign secretary, Mr Raab was heavily criticised for his handling of the aftermath of the fall of Afghanistan, specifically for remaining on holiday in Crete while the Taliban marched back to power. He insisted he'd been across the detail and was in touch with the key players. Downing Street stood by the minister, however he was later demoted to the role of justice secretary, which although still a cabinet position is not as prestigious as foreign secretary. Mr Raab stayed publicly loyal to Mr Johnson, being one of the few ministers not to resign during the final chaotic week of his premiership. This video can not be played The deputy party leaders swap exchanges on bullying claims against him and her previous labelling for her opponents. In the leadership race that followed, he enthusiastically threw his backing behind Rishi Sunak - and in August fiercely attacked the rival candidate Liz Truss, calling her economic plans ""electoral suicide"". That broadside wasn't forgotten by Ms Truss's team and Mr Raab was not included in her cabinet when she became prime minister. However, Ms Truss was soon gone and Mr Raab returned to government in the familiar roles of justice secretary and deputy prime minister. As Mr Sunak's deputy, he stood in for his boss at Prime Minister's Question opposite Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy. Their exchanges across the despatch box were often fiery. As well as a big drop in salary, Mr Raab also loses the status of his position at the very top of government. Whether he will return to high office remains to be seen.

"This video can not be played Shamima Begum speaks of her regret at joining ISIS: 'It kills me inside' Shamima Begum, who left the UK for Syria as a teenager, says she will regret joining the Islamic State group for the rest of her life and has offered to help the UK fight terrorism. She told the BBC she could be ""useful to society"" and it would be a waste to let her ""rot"" in a Syrian camp. The 22-year-old is accused of playing an active role in IS - she denies that. Sajid Javid is standing by his decision to revoke her citizenship. Shamima Begum was 15 when she and two other east London schoolgirls travelled to Syria to join IS. There, she married a Dutch recruit and lived under IS rule for more than three years. In 2019, she was found, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp. Her baby later died of pneumonia and Ms Begum said she had previously lost two other children. The then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Ms Begum of her UK citizenship on national security grounds. Who is Shamima Begum and how do you lose your citizenship? Shamima Begum cannot return to UK, court rules Ms Begum has previously said the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, in which 22 people - some of them children - were killed in a bombing claimed by IS, was similar to military strikes on IS strongholds and called the terror attack ""retaliation"". Asked by BBC reporter Josh Baker how it made her feel to think back to being part of a group that committed genocide and murder around the world, she said: ""It makes me sick to my stomach really. It makes me hate myself."" In the interview for BBC Sounds and BBC 5 live, Ms Begum also said she only now felt comfortable talking about her true feelings. Our reporter asked whether she had changed her opinion on IS because it had not created a caliphate. ""I have had these opinions for a very long time but only now I feel comfortable to express my real opinion,"" she replied. She said if allowed back into the UK, she could advise on the tactics used by IS to persuade people to go to Syria and could share ways to speak to people who are at risk of being radicalised. She said she felt ""an obligation"" to do so, adding that she did not want any other young girls to destroy their lives like she had. This video can not be played Shamima Begum spoke to the BBC from a refugee camp in Syria in February 2019 On Wednesday, Ms Begum spoke to ITV's Good Morning Britain and made a direct offer to Boris Johnson to become ""an asset"" in the fight against terror. Speaking from a Syrian refugee camp, she said there was ""no evidence"" she was a key player in preparing terrorist acts and was prepared to prove her innocence in court. ""I know there are some people, no matter what I say or what I do, they will not believe that I have changed, believe that I want to help,"" she said. ""But for those who have even a drop of mercy and compassion and empathy in their hearts, I tell you from the bottom of my heart that I regret every, every decision I've made since I stepped into Syria and I will live with it for the rest of my life. ""No one can hate me more than I hate myself for what I've done and all I can say is 'I'm sorry' and just give me a second chance."" She said she would ""rather die than go back to IS"" and added: ""The only crime I committed was being dumb enough to join IS."" Ms Begum says she wants a trial, saying she is ""willing to go to court and face the people who made these claims and refute these claims, because I know I did nothing in IS but be a mother and a wife"". But Sajid Javid, now health secretary, suggested there was no likelihood Ms Begum would be allowed to return and fight her citizenship case. He told GMB that the decision to strip her of her UK citizenship was ""both morally right, absolutely right, but also legally correct and the right one to protect the British people"". ""I won't go into details of the case, but what I will say is that you certainly haven't seen what I saw,"" he added. ""If you did know what I knew, because you are sensible, responsible people, you would have made exactly the same decision - of that I have no doubt."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""The government's top priority remains maintaining our national security and keeping the public safe."" Liberty, a human rights group, previously called the decision to revoke Ms Begum's citizenship ""an extremely dangerous precedent"" and said the right to a fair trial was not something democratic governments should take away on a whim. One of the other girls who travelled with Ms Begum, Kadiza Sultana, was reportedly killed in a bombing raid, but the fate of the third - Amira Abase - is unknown. Ms Begum has previously said her husband had been held in a prison where men were tortured and had surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters. Josh Baker from theI'm Not A Monsterpodcast spoke to Shamima Begum for a forthcoming BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 5 Live podcast series. Who is Shamima Begum and how can you lose your citizenship?

"A PM is rarely as powerful as on a reshuffle day ""This is a mad way to run the country,"" confessed a member of the government. Whether prime ministers wield sharp knives or attack with blunt spoons, reshuffle days like this are indeed a strange mixture of bravado and farce. Bravado when, earlier, one cabinet minister told me, ""I think I'm OK,"" as, ashen-faced, looking nauseous and clammy, they were en route to see the prime minister before promptly being sacked. And farce when, as legend has it, on several occasions, would-be ministers end up jobless, because the post-it notes with their name on fell off the board. Forgotten, their career plunged to the floor too. The way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: ""Is it on?"" And inhabitants of the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. But, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. Johnson rings changes with major cabinet reshuffle Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? And Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet. The most significant switch came in one of the chunkiest jobs of all. Removing the foreign secretary is a big deal. Dominic Raab's always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected, suggesting he fought his move pretty hard. Sources suggest he managed to wangle the ill-defined title of deputy prime minister out of Mr Johnson. Being justice secretary, running prisons, courts, and the legal system, is of course a huge job. Downing Street insists it's not a demotion, and that it doesn't want this move to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, like a debacle in Afghanistan. But even with the DPM bauble, Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government. There are some other slightly puzzling aspects. Steve Barclay was, until the reshuffle, chief secretary to the Treasury, wielding the calculator on what is a hugely important Spending Review, when cash for departments for the next few years is fixed. That review is coming in just a few weeks' time, so you might wonder at the wisdom of moving Mr Barclay right now. He's being replaced by Simon Clarke, a previous inhabitant of a Treasury role, a strong supporter of Mr Johnson and North East MP. He's also, at 6ft 7ins, around a foot taller than his new boss in Number 11 - cue the inevitable jokes about Number 10 wanting to make the chancellor feel small. Anne-Marie Trevelyan is back on the top team In a similar vein Anne-Marie Trevelyan, also a strong Johnson backer, returns to cabinet as trade secretary. Irrespective of the merit of her move to that department, Ms Trevelyan had been part of the government's team preparing for COP26, a major international event that starts in about 50 days. If it's a true priority, unpicking a part of the team right now may raise a few eyebrows. There are many more jobs to be allocated, more intrigue to come when middle-ranking and junior ministers get their P45s or offers. But the shape of the cabinet itself is clear. What's harder to divine is any one strong political ideology, or any radical guiding idea. Certainly, politicians popular with the Tory party like Truss seem to have prospered. Loyalty to the prime minister himself seems to have been rewarded. But it's not a Brexit cabinet, or a small-state cabinet, or to use Tory verbiage, a ""one-nation"" cabinet for those more in the middle. It's a Johnson cabinet, with no particular bent towards any one faction or tribe. For some of his backers, that is one of Mr Johnson's attributes - he's not wedded to principle, but staying on top. For other Tories, that's rather the problem - with no one strong ideology other than a desire to win, it begs the question of what it's all really for. For Downing Street, though, this is a day for the doers. After the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done. Whether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case. Nearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister. And while the shuffling of his cabinet pack has passed, so far largely without incident, there is no doubt about the scale of the challenge, individual and collective, that they face.

"Nadhim Zahawi arriving in Downing Street for the reshuffle Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed the new education secretary for England - replacing Gavin Williamson in the Cabinet reshuffle. Mr Zahawi leaves his previous post as the minister responsible for the Covid vaccines roll-out. The departing education secretary had faced much criticism over his handling of schools during the pandemic. ""We can't pretend we are sorry that Gavin Williamson has gone,"" said teachers' union leader Kevin Courtney. Mr Zahawi, who has previously been a junior education minister, was born in Iraq. His family moved to the UK in 1976 when he was aged nine, attending independent schools in London and then studying chemical engineering at University College London. He will now be responsible for schools, colleges and universities in England, as they recover from the disruption of the pandemic. ""Education is a crucial part of our levelling up agenda so it's an honour to be back at the Department for Education as secretary of state,"" said Mr Zahawi. ""Children and young people have had a tough time during this pandemic and I'll be listening to them and their families as we accelerate our work to build back better and fairer."" Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union with Mr Courtney, urged the incoming education secretary to push for extra funding in next month's public spending review. Where did it all go wrong for Gavin Williamson? How did Williamson survive the exams chaos? The big U-turns of the summer exams ""The money promised to schools to date is a small fraction of the amount judged to be needed by the government's former education recovery tsar,"" said Ms Bousted. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""One of the most pressing tasks facing Mr Zahawi will be to ensure that the government now fulfils its promise to deliver a properly funded recovery package so that every pupil in the country receives the support they need and deserve. ""With the comprehensive spending review only weeks away, there really is no time to waste."" ""The Department for Education may now be under new management but the same challenges remain,"" said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. ""More ambition is needed on post-Covid education recovery, investment in schools and colleges, support for children with special educational needs, and closing the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers,"" he said. Mr Williamson's departing message said it had been a privilege to serve as education secretary ""despite the challenges of the global pandemic"". And he highlighted his efforts to raise the status of further education and skills. ""I'm particularly proud of the transformational reforms I've led in Post-16 education: in further education colleges, our skills agenda, apprenticeships and more,"" tweeted Mr Williamson. Mr Williamson - the first big casualty of the reshuffle - had faced much criticism during the pandemic, with particular problems around last summer's exams, which saw protests and U-turns over how grades were decided. ""He failed to engage with our suggestions on how to make schools safer during Covid - and thereby kept them closed longer,"" said Mr Courtney. But David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, commended Mr Williamson's support for further education, despite the disruption of the pandemic. ""It was always going to be a bumpy ride for Gavin Williamson. Despite that, he helped convince the prime minister and chancellor that post-16 education and skills should be a priority,"" said Mr Hughes. Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, described his time in office as ""disastrous"". ""Rather than responding to the challenges of a global pandemic, he led the charge in a completely pointless culture war against university staff and students. ""A culture war that was entirely fabricated and led to no positive change in the sector,"" said Dr Grady. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: ""Two years of exams chaos and staff abandoned, unsupported and demoralised. That is Gavin Williamson's legacy. ""The prime minister has allowed this to happen, keeping a failing education secretary in post for months and refusing to fight for children's futures.""

Here is a quick round-up from the cabinet reshuffle:  For a full run down of the new cabinet, click here.  This evening there's a brand new cabinet. It's the second major reshuffle since Boris Johnson became leader of the Conservative party and took over as prime minister from Theresa May in July 2019. The last one took place in February 2020. Some of the names in the new-look government may be familiar to you - others, not so much. To help, our visual journalism team has put together a handy guide so you can see who's ended up where. You can find ithere. Dominic Raab, who is leaving his post as foreign secretary,says it has been a ""privilege"",externalto serve in the role. He highlighted overseeing ""a merger of departments, publication of the integrated review and the UK's Indo-Pacific tilt"" as among his highlights. ""Global Britain  is a force for good in the world served by the finest cadre of diplomats & development experts,"" he said. Raab said he was ""delighted"" to become justice secretary, deputy PM and Lord Chancellor. Helen CattPolitical correspondent At least we know this reshuffle is now over - the prime minister's tweet signals that. There had been expectation that Johnson would freshen up his team for a while, but the question was always when was the best time to do it. It is the Conservative Party conference in a couple of weeks and the rule of thumb in Westminster is you either go before or you have to wait until the following year. So while the reshuffle won't have come as a surprise, the scale of it might have - with wide-ranging changes and some big figures getting the sack. After a busy day of reshuffling his top team, Boris Johnson takes a brief moment to head to Twitter. And he promises the new recruits will ""work tirelessly"" in their roles. Allow Twitter content?

Kit Malthouse stays at the Home Office We have had another flurry of confirmations coming out of No 10. Kit Malthouse will remain as a Home Office minister and attend cabinet too. Former Brexit adviser Lord Frost stays at the Cabinet Office and the leader of the Tories in the House of Lords will still be Baroness Evans. Nigel Adams has also made a move from the Foreign Office to take on a ministerial job in the Cabinet Office. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post. As a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit. She will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy. Like the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: âI donât think anyone would describe me as diplomatic."" Next week, Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York. She will play a key role in the governmentâs efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair. For the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting. Former health minister Nadine Dorries has been appointed the new culture secretary, replacing Oliver Dowden. The Tory MP for Mid Bedfordshire is best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Born in Liverpool in 1957, Dorries started out as a nurse before entering politics. Outside politics she is a published author. Read more about the new culture secretary here. Boris Johnson surprised a few MPs and angered
others when he sacked Robert Buckland as justice secretary. In a letter to the PM, Buckland says it was ""the honour of a lifetime"" to serve in the role and added that he was ""very sorry"" to be leaving. In a handwritten PS at the bottom of his letter he has added: ""Please continue investing in ISVAs!!"" ISVAs are independent sexual violence advisers provide support to victims going through the criminal justice system. More now on the new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. The former trade secretary has previously spoken candidly about her diplomacy skills - telling the BBC's Nick Robinson in 2018: ""I don't think anyone describes me as a diplomat... and I'm not very diplomatic."" Truss made the admission during an interview for Robinson'sPolitical Thinking podcast, when asked about her views on the then-Brexit deal. As foreign secretary, Truss will lead the UK's diplomatic mission across the world and be responsible for maintaining and enhancing Britain's image abroad. She will also be involved in issues of national security, oversee the MI6 intelligence service, honours and Europe. The Bar Council - which represents barristers - has also drawn attention to the fact Dominic Raab will become the eighth justice secretary in just 10 years. In a statement, they praised the outgoing minister, Robert Buckland, saying they were ""grateful for his willingness, as a former practising barrister, to work
collaboratively and listen to the legal professions"". They welcomed lucky number eight, who is also a qualified lawyer, but added: ""The need for a consistent and
strong voice in government for our justice system could not be greater."" In more ministers-not-moving news, George Eustice stays on as environment secretary. Eustice - who is also a farmer - has most recently been in the headlines for his department's decisionto cull Geronimo the alpacaafter the animal tested positive for bovine tuberculosis. He said it was ""soul-destroying"" to have to put animals down but necessary. Grant Shapps, who has led the Department for Transport since 2019, remains as its secretary of state, Downing Street says. Shapps has been the face of the government's pandemic travel restrictions and is due to provide an update on the red, amber and green travel lists on Thursday. Brandon Lewis is keeping his job as Northern Ireland secretary. And there's no change for Welsh Secretary Simon Hart and Alister Jack, who keeps the job of secretary of state for Scotland. Meanwhile universities minister Michelle Donelan, policing minister Kit Malthouse, Leader of the House of Lords Baroness Evans,  Attorney General Suella Braverman and MP Simon Clarke are in Downing Street.

"Liz Truss has been promoted to one of the key jobs in government Boris Johnson has fired a string of cabinet ministers - and promoted new faces to replace them - in a major reshuffle. The prime minister sacked under-fire Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and moved Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to the justice department. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel keep their jobs. But there are promotions for Liz Truss, who goes to the Foreign Office, and Nadine Dorries, who gets culture. Downing Street said the aim of the reshuffle was to ""put in place a strong and united team to build back better from the pandemic"". More moves are expected over the coming hours, as Mr Johnson seeks to fill vacant positions. Who is Dominic Raab? Nadine Dorries becomes new culture secretary Liz Truss: fast track to foreign secretary Where did it go wrong for Gavin Williamson? In addition to justice secretary and Lord Chancellor, Mr Raab has also been given the title of deputy prime minister, after what is understood to have been a lengthy and difficult conversation with the prime minister. A source denied Mr Raab was angry with the move from the Foreign Office, but he is understood to be unhappy with the way his handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan was portrayed. In other moves: Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi is promoted to education secretary Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick is fired - and replaced by Michael Gove Treasury minister Steve Barclay replaces Mr Gove as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden is given the role of minister without portfolio at the Cabinet Office Mr Dowden will also co-chair the Conservative Party, replacing Amanda Milling Simon Clarke becomes Chief Secretary to the Treasury Nick Gibb, the schools minister, leaves government after seven years The big winners from the reshuffle include Ms Dorries, a junior health minister and best-selling novelist who has never sat in the cabinet before, and Ms Truss, who moves into one of the top three jobs in government from the Department for International Trade. New Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Michael Gove will get the added responsibility of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda - spreading wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum. The way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks, ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: ""Is it on?"" People in the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. But, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. And Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet - the most significant switch coming in one of the chunkiest jobs of all. Read more from Laura Losers from the reshuffle include Mr Williamson, who has faced repeated opposition calls to quit, or be sacked, over his handling of disruption to schools and exams during the pandemic. He said he was ""proud"" of the ""transformational reforms I've led in post-16 education: in further education colleges, our skills agenda, apprenticeships and more"". Dominic Raab is no longer foreign secretary and Gavin Williamson has been sacked as education secretary by the PM For Labour, shadow education secretary Kate Green said Mr Williamson had ""failed children and young people, their parents and our hard-working education staff throughout one of the most testing periods in our history"". Robert Buckland also looks set for a return to the backbenches after being replaced by Mr Raab as justice secretary and Lord Chancellor. Nadine Dorries has been promoted to the cabinet for the first time BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said Mr Buckland was a respected figure in the legal profession, but leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: ""Appointing a failed foreign secretary who was fired for being missing in action to be the sixth justice secretary in six years shows how little this government cares about victims of crime.""

"Boris Johnson is overseeing a reshuffle of his cabinet. BBC editors and correspondents look back at the performances of the politicians leaving their job - and the challenges facing those who are taking over. Dominic Raab is always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And given that his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected suggests that he fought his move pretty hard. Being justice secretary, running prisons, courts and the legal system, is of course a huge job. And it matches his legal experience too. But there's no doubt that it is a demotion, losing out on one of the most prestigious jobs in government as foreign secretary. Downing Street doesn't want this to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, as a debacle in Afghanistan, Mr Raab even taking his family holiday during the crisis. But even with the bauble of deputy prime minister as part of his title (you wonder if title was a product of the tetchy conversations), Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government. What's Johnson's reshuffle really all about? The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post. As a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit. She will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy. Like the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: ""I don't think anyone would describe me as diplomatic."" Next week, Ms Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York. She will play a key role in the government's efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair. For the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting. Gavin Williamson found himself in the hot seat when schools closed their classrooms, and moved to on-and-off remote learning. It put him in the firing line for criticism from overstretched and exasperated head teachers and parents, as government policy led to sudden changes in direction. As schools in England geared up to support the poorest families through hard times, they faced delays, first with food vouchers, then with devices. Confusing England footballer Marcus Rashford with another black sportsman added to the perception of being prone to gaffes. But it was in the days before and after A-level results of 2020 in England when the chaos peaked. The education secretary defended the system, before a massive U-turn that felt inevitable. Mr Williamson has said he is most proud of his contribution to giving skills a higher profile. The cost of implementing an eye-catching promise of a life-long learning loan will be in his successor's in-tray, as will looming decisions about future university funding. For a government committed to levelling up, the long-term impact of the pandemic on the poorest children's education is the other big challenge. The Â£3bn promised for catch-up fell so far short that the government's own adviser resigned earlier this year. There have been eight justice secretaries since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 - and Robert Buckland's two years, one month and 22 days makes him the third-longest holder of a post that the entire legal establishment regards as having being treated as an afterthought. Mr Buckland, a respected lawyer and former judge, leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. That's 4,000 more than in January, when official watchdogs warned that the backlog was already of grave concern. The upshot is that some victims will be waiting four years for justice. Incoming Justice Secretary Dominic Raab may not have actually been appointed to deal with this problem - but to take on an ideological challenge. Mr Raab has credentials for speaking up on some human rights legal issues, yet he is also one of the most vocal critics of the Human Rights Act, one of the cornerstones of the modern British constitution. He's long called for it to be replaced or repealed - and the government's long-promised review of human rights law is now in his hands. We'll soon find out where Mr Raab ultimately stands on one of the most important but misunderstood legal issues of our times. She's the 10th culture secretary in 10 years. Nadine Dorries, a successful novelist, a former contestant on I'm a Celebrity (which led to a brief suspension of the Conservative whip) and a strong advocate of gender equality on the BBC certainly has a track record in taking an interest in cultural matters. In 2017 she tweeted: ""Left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy, tearing down historic statues, removing books from universities, dumbing down panto."" Her move to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) came on the day her predecessor, Oliver Dowden, was due to deliver his opinions on the future of Channel 4. That speech was instead made by media minister John Whittingdale. Sport, gambling, the future of the BBC, broadband services: the DCMS has a broad remit that covers everything from dealing with the tech giants to helping to alleviate loneliness. And over recent months Mr Dowden has increasingly entered debates about so-called ""woke culture"", statues and removing ""contested heritage"". This is political territory on which the new culture secretary has already expressed strong views.

"Nadhim Zahawi arriving in Downing Street for the reshuffle Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed the new education secretary for England - replacing Gavin Williamson in the Cabinet reshuffle. Mr Zahawi leaves his previous post as the minister responsible for the Covid vaccines roll-out. The departing education secretary had faced much criticism over his handling of schools during the pandemic. ""We can't pretend we are sorry that Gavin Williamson has gone,"" said teachers' union leader Kevin Courtney. Mr Zahawi, who has previously been a junior education minister, was born in Iraq. His family moved to the UK in 1976 when he was aged nine, attending independent schools in London and then studying chemical engineering at University College London. He will now be responsible for schools, colleges and universities in England, as they recover from the disruption of the pandemic. ""Education is a crucial part of our levelling up agenda so it's an honour to be back at the Department for Education as secretary of state,"" said Mr Zahawi. ""Children and young people have had a tough time during this pandemic and I'll be listening to them and their families as we accelerate our work to build back better and fairer."" Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union with Mr Courtney, urged the incoming education secretary to push for extra funding in next month's public spending review. Where did it all go wrong for Gavin Williamson? How did Williamson survive the exams chaos? The big U-turns of the summer exams ""The money promised to schools to date is a small fraction of the amount judged to be needed by the government's former education recovery tsar,"" said Ms Bousted. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""One of the most pressing tasks facing Mr Zahawi will be to ensure that the government now fulfils its promise to deliver a properly funded recovery package so that every pupil in the country receives the support they need and deserve. ""With the comprehensive spending review only weeks away, there really is no time to waste."" ""The Department for Education may now be under new management but the same challenges remain,"" said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. ""More ambition is needed on post-Covid education recovery, investment in schools and colleges, support for children with special educational needs, and closing the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers,"" he said. Mr Williamson's departing message said it had been a privilege to serve as education secretary ""despite the challenges of the global pandemic"". And he highlighted his efforts to raise the status of further education and skills. ""I'm particularly proud of the transformational reforms I've led in Post-16 education: in further education colleges, our skills agenda, apprenticeships and more,"" tweeted Mr Williamson. Mr Williamson - the first big casualty of the reshuffle - had faced much criticism during the pandemic, with particular problems around last summer's exams, which saw protests and U-turns over how grades were decided. ""He failed to engage with our suggestions on how to make schools safer during Covid - and thereby kept them closed longer,"" said Mr Courtney. But David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, commended Mr Williamson's support for further education, despite the disruption of the pandemic. ""It was always going to be a bumpy ride for Gavin Williamson. Despite that, he helped convince the prime minister and chancellor that post-16 education and skills should be a priority,"" said Mr Hughes. Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, described his time in office as ""disastrous"". ""Rather than responding to the challenges of a global pandemic, he led the charge in a completely pointless culture war against university staff and students. ""A culture war that was entirely fabricated and led to no positive change in the sector,"" said Dr Grady. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: ""Two years of exams chaos and staff abandoned, unsupported and demoralised. That is Gavin Williamson's legacy. ""The prime minister has allowed this to happen, keeping a failing education secretary in post for months and refusing to fight for children's futures.""

"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

"Maggie Nichols, who came forward initially as 'Athlete A' What did it take to bring down Dr Larry Nassar - the USA Gymnastics team doctor who abused hundreds of young women? Why did the abuse continue for more than two decades? And did USA Gymnastics (USAG) cover it up? These are some of the questions explored in Athlete A, a new documentary out on Netflix. BBC Sport spoke to directors Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk, as well as Rachael Denhollander - the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar and a key contributor to the film. Oct 2017: Olympic gymnast Maroney makes abuse claim Jan 2018: Nassar abused me - four-time Olympic champion Biles Feb 2018: Nassar jailed for up to 300 years for abusing at least 265 women Dec 2018: US Olympics Committee apologises for Nassar failings Jan 2020: USAG offers $215m to abused athletes Nassar, a former USAG team doctor, wassentenced to more than 300 years for molesting young gymnastsin 2018. An investigation by the Indianapolis Star, which began in 2016 with help from survivors, police and attorneys, brought Nassar to justice. But the documentary reveals Nassar was never the main target for the newspaper. ""When we started to work with the IndyStar, we started to realise the investigation that led them to Nassar was actually an investigation into USA Gymnastics policy, around how it dealt with reports of sexual abuse,"" Shenk tells BBC Sport. Cohen adds: ""Larry Nassar was just one bad guy within a system that has tolerated abuse for decades. The truth that was exposed was that they had been burying cases for many, many years."" In a filmed deposition shown in the documentary, former USAG president Steve Penny admits the organisation did not always pass reports of assault straight to police. Penny resigned from USAG in 2017 and was subsequentlyarrested for allegedly tampering with evidencein relation to Nassar. Penny refutes any suggestion of a cover-up and denies any wrongdoing. USAG says it has shifted its organisation ""to be more athlete-centric"" with newly created athlete health and wellness roles, a new ""safe sport"" policy, and new educational initiatives. Cohen and Shenk say the initial story came from former USA gymnast, Jennifer Sey, who was national champion in 1986 before retiring from the sport in 1988. In 2008, she published a book called Chalked Up: Inside Elite Gymnastics' Merciless Coaching, Overzealous Parents, Eating Disorders, And Elusive Olympic Dreams. ""When the Larry Nassar news started to break a few years ago, she was very much in touch with the gymnasts at the centre of that story,"" says Shenk. ""Ultimately, she got to know the journalists who were telling the story."" Shenk adds that access to the IndyStar investigation enabled them to start filming before Nassar went to trial. ""As the number of survivors coming forward kept rising, we were able to document that,"" he says. Jennifer Sey retired from gymnastics before the 1988 Olympics There are a lot of heroes in this film - journalists Marisa Kwiatkowski, Mark Alesia, Tim Evans and Steve Berta at the IndyStar; Detective Lieutenant Andrea Munford, who found child pornography images at Nassar's house; lawyers John Manly and Angela Povilaitis, who represented the survivors. Of the survivors, there are three main focal points - former USA gymnasts Maggie Nichols, Denhollander and Jamie Dantzscher. The titular ""Athlete A"" is Nichols, who reported Nassar to USAG in June 2015. Her family argue in the film that the claim was not dealt with properly. ""We were not going to go public, because we were told there was an FBI investigation and we could possibly jeopardise it,"" says Nichols' father, John. Rachael Denhollander was the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar Denhollander, who is now a lawyer, was the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar. She was 15 when she went to see him for an appointment at Michigan State University. Over a year and a half, he repeatedly abused her, under the guise of treatment. Some 16 years later, when Denhollander came across the IndyStar article alleging malpractice at USAG in 2016, she came forward to share her story. She had previously reported Nassar to a gym where she was working, but it was not taken further. Alesia, a journalist at the IndyStar, explains how Denhollander turned up with about 100 pages of medical notes and a case prepared against Nassar. At around the same time, Dantzscher also spoke to the paper, anonymously. In response to these public statements, Nassar's lawyers denied he had ever touched a patient inappropriately during treatment. Hundreds of women, who knew that to be untrue, then came forward. Jamie Dantzscher won team bronze at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney In the documentary, Sey argues that emotional and physical abuse ""was actually the norm"" during her time as a gymnast. Former USAG coaches Bela and Martha Karolyi, who came over from Communist Romania, where they coached 14-year-old Nadia Comaneci to a perfect score at the 1976 Olympics, are portrayed as having created a dangerous atmosphere. ""They brought with them the Eastern European methodology, which included not feeding the athletes very much and abusing them in various physical and psychological ways,"" Cohen tells BBC Sport. She argues that laid way for ""a way of thinking that would enable a predator like Nassar"". Bela and Martha Karolyi both deny the allegations and say they were never physically or verbally abusive. Dantzscher describes how, at the time, Nassar seemed like ""the only nice person"" in gymnastics. She tells stories about him sneaking the girls candy at the Karolyi ranch, where the athletes trained monthly and where parents were not allowed access. Larry Nassar has been sentenced to over 300 years in jail When Denhollander took her story to the IndyStar, she also told Michigan State University Police, and she says she was not surprised to discover there had been multiple reports against him, from as far back as 1997. ""Larry was able to stay every time by simply saying: 'These women are confused'"" Denhollander tells BBC Sport. ""It is a product of a community and a culture that sends the message that the sexual assault and abuse of women is not a big deal."" Shenk says: ""Ultimately, it's a story about people who were taken advantage of by an organisation that lost sight of its responsibility."" He believes that those in power were guilty of neglect as gymnastics became more marketable. ""The Olympics is a big event in the United States. But, over the years, it became very much about the marketing of the athletes. Unfortunately, many of the organisations, including USA Gymnastics, did not have policies in place to protect the, often very young, athletes."" Shenk tells us there is some unfinished business. 'We still don't have a final settlement for many of the survivors who have filed suits against USA Gymnastics,"" he says. Earlier this year, USAGproposed a settlement,externalthatit is reported,externalwould release Penny, the Karolyis and others from liability. That was criticised by American four-time Olympic champion Simone Biles and Denhollander, among others. When asked what still needs to be done to mean justice has been done, Denhollander is unequivocal: ""The answer is everything.""

Well, after all the rumours flying around the corridors of power, today we got our answers of who would stay and who would go. Here is a quick round-up from the cabinet reshuffle:  For a full run down of the new cabinet, click here.  This evening there's a brand new cabinet. It's the second major reshuffle since Boris Johnson became leader of the Conservative party and took over as prime minister from Theresa May in July 2019. The last one took place in February 2020. Some of the names in the new-look government may be familiar to you - others, not so much. To help, our visual journalism team has put together a handy guide so you can see who's ended up where. You can find ithere. Dominic Raab, who is leaving his post as foreign secretary,says it has been a ""privilege"",externalto serve in the role. He highlighted overseeing ""a merger of departments, publication of the integrated review and the UK's Indo-Pacific tilt"" as among his highlights. ""Global Britain  is a force for good in the world served by the finest cadre of diplomats & development experts,"" he said. Raab said he was ""delighted"" to become justice secretary, deputy PM and Lord Chancellor. Helen CattPolitical correspondent At least we know this reshuffle is now over - the prime minister's tweet signals that. There had been expectation that Johnson would freshen up his team for a while, but the question was always when was the best time to do it. It is the Conservative Party conference in a couple of weeks and the rule of thumb in Westminster is you either go before or you have to wait until the following year. So while the reshuffle won't have come as a surprise, the scale of it might have - with wide-ranging changes and some big figures getting the sack. After a busy day of reshuffling his top team, Boris Johnson takes a brief moment to head to Twitter. And he promises the new recruits will ""work tirelessly"" in their roles. Allow Twitter content?

Kit Malthouse stays at the Home Office We have had another flurry of confirmations coming out of No 10. Kit Malthouse will remain as a Home Office minister and attend cabinet too. Former Brexit adviser Lord Frost stays at the Cabinet Office and the leader of the Tories in the House of Lords will still be Baroness Evans. Nigel Adams has also made a move from the Foreign Office to take on a ministerial job in the Cabinet Office. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post. As a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit. She will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy. Like the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: âI donât think anyone would describe me as diplomatic."" Next week, Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York. She will play a key role in the governmentâs efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair. For the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting. Former health minister Nadine Dorries has been appointed the new culture secretary, replacing Oliver Dowden. The Tory MP for Mid Bedfordshire is best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Born in Liverpool in 1957, Dorries started out as a nurse before entering politics. Outside politics she is a published author. Read more about the new culture secretary here. Boris Johnson surprised a few MPs and angered
others when he sacked Robert Buckland as justice secretary. In a letter to the PM, Buckland says it was ""the honour of a lifetime"" to serve in the role and added that he was ""very sorry"" to be leaving. In a handwritten PS at the bottom of his letter he has added: ""Please continue investing in ISVAs!!"" ISVAs are independent sexual violence advisers provide support to victims going through the criminal justice system. More now on the new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. The former trade secretary has previously spoken candidly about her diplomacy skills - telling the BBC's Nick Robinson in 2018: ""I don't think anyone describes me as a diplomat... and I'm not very diplomatic."" Truss made the admission during an interview for Robinson'sPolitical Thinking podcast, when asked about her views on the then-Brexit deal. As foreign secretary, Truss will lead the UK's diplomatic mission across the world and be responsible for maintaining and enhancing Britain's image abroad. She will also be involved in issues of national security, oversee the MI6 intelligence service, honours and Europe. The Bar Council - which represents barristers - has also drawn attention to the fact Dominic Raab will become the eighth justice secretary in just 10 years. In a statement, they praised the outgoing minister, Robert Buckland, saying they were ""grateful for his willingness, as a former practising barrister, to work
collaboratively and listen to the legal professions"". They welcomed lucky number eight, who is also a qualified lawyer, but added: ""The need for a consistent and
strong voice in government for our justice system could not be greater."" In more ministers-not-moving news, George Eustice stays on as environment secretary. Eustice - who is also a farmer - has most recently been in the headlines for his department's decisionto cull Geronimo the alpacaafter the animal tested positive for bovine tuberculosis. He said it was ""soul-destroying"" to have to put animals down but necessary. Grant Shapps, who has led the Department for Transport since 2019, remains as its secretary of state, Downing Street says. Shapps has been the face of the government's pandemic travel restrictions and is due to provide an update on the red, amber and green travel lists on Thursday. Brandon Lewis is keeping his job as Northern Ireland secretary. And there's no change for Welsh Secretary Simon Hart and Alister Jack, who keeps the job of secretary of state for Scotland. Meanwhile universities minister Michelle Donelan, policing minister Kit Malthouse, Leader of the House of Lords Baroness Evans,  Attorney General Suella Braverman and MP Simon Clarke are in Downing Street.

"Liz Truss has been promoted to one of the key jobs in government Boris Johnson has fired a string of cabinet ministers - and promoted new faces to replace them - in a major reshuffle. The prime minister sacked under-fire Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and moved Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to the justice department. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel keep their jobs. But there are promotions for Liz Truss, who goes to the Foreign Office, and Nadine Dorries, who gets culture. Downing Street said the aim of the reshuffle was to ""put in place a strong and united team to build back better from the pandemic"". More moves are expected over the coming hours, as Mr Johnson seeks to fill vacant positions. Who is Dominic Raab? Nadine Dorries becomes new culture secretary Liz Truss: fast track to foreign secretary Where did it go wrong for Gavin Williamson? In addition to justice secretary and Lord Chancellor, Mr Raab has also been given the title of deputy prime minister, after what is understood to have been a lengthy and difficult conversation with the prime minister. A source denied Mr Raab was angry with the move from the Foreign Office, but he is understood to be unhappy with the way his handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan was portrayed. In other moves: Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi is promoted to education secretary Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick is fired - and replaced by Michael Gove Treasury minister Steve Barclay replaces Mr Gove as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden is given the role of minister without portfolio at the Cabinet Office Mr Dowden will also co-chair the Conservative Party, replacing Amanda Milling Simon Clarke becomes Chief Secretary to the Treasury Nick Gibb, the schools minister, leaves government after seven years The big winners from the reshuffle include Ms Dorries, a junior health minister and best-selling novelist who has never sat in the cabinet before, and Ms Truss, who moves into one of the top three jobs in government from the Department for International Trade. New Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Michael Gove will get the added responsibility of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda - spreading wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum. The way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks, ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: ""Is it on?"" People in the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. But, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. And Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet - the most significant switch coming in one of the chunkiest jobs of all. Read more from Laura Losers from the reshuffle include Mr Williamson, who has faced repeated opposition calls to quit, or be sacked, over his handling of disruption to schools and exams during the pandemic. He said he was ""proud"" of the ""transformational reforms I've led in post-16 education: in further education colleges, our skills agenda, apprenticeships and more"". Dominic Raab is no longer foreign secretary and Gavin Williamson has been sacked as education secretary by the PM For Labour, shadow education secretary Kate Green said Mr Williamson had ""failed children and young people, their parents and our hard-working education staff throughout one of the most testing periods in our history"". Robert Buckland also looks set for a return to the backbenches after being replaced by Mr Raab as justice secretary and Lord Chancellor. Nadine Dorries has been promoted to the cabinet for the first time BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said Mr Buckland was a respected figure in the legal profession, but leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: ""Appointing a failed foreign secretary who was fired for being missing in action to be the sixth justice secretary in six years shows how little this government cares about victims of crime.""

"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

"Boris Johnson is overseeing a reshuffle of his cabinet. BBC editors and correspondents look back at the performances of the politicians leaving their job - and the challenges facing those who are taking over. Dominic Raab is always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And given that his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected suggests that he fought his move pretty hard. Being justice secretary, running prisons, courts and the legal system, is of course a huge job. And it matches his legal experience too. But there's no doubt that it is a demotion, losing out on one of the most prestigious jobs in government as foreign secretary. Downing Street doesn't want this to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, as a debacle in Afghanistan, Mr Raab even taking his family holiday during the crisis. But even with the bauble of deputy prime minister as part of his title (you wonder if title was a product of the tetchy conversations), Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government. What's Johnson's reshuffle really all about? The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post. As a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit. She will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy. Like the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: ""I don't think anyone would describe me as diplomatic."" Next week, Ms Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York. She will play a key role in the government's efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair. For the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting. Gavin Williamson found himself in the hot seat when schools closed their classrooms, and moved to on-and-off remote learning. It put him in the firing line for criticism from overstretched and exasperated head teachers and parents, as government policy led to sudden changes in direction. As schools in England geared up to support the poorest families through hard times, they faced delays, first with food vouchers, then with devices. Confusing England footballer Marcus Rashford with another black sportsman added to the perception of being prone to gaffes. But it was in the days before and after A-level results of 2020 in England when the chaos peaked. The education secretary defended the system, before a massive U-turn that felt inevitable. Mr Williamson has said he is most proud of his contribution to giving skills a higher profile. The cost of implementing an eye-catching promise of a life-long learning loan will be in his successor's in-tray, as will looming decisions about future university funding. For a government committed to levelling up, the long-term impact of the pandemic on the poorest children's education is the other big challenge. The Â£3bn promised for catch-up fell so far short that the government's own adviser resigned earlier this year. There have been eight justice secretaries since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 - and Robert Buckland's two years, one month and 22 days makes him the third-longest holder of a post that the entire legal establishment regards as having being treated as an afterthought. Mr Buckland, a respected lawyer and former judge, leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. That's 4,000 more than in January, when official watchdogs warned that the backlog was already of grave concern. The upshot is that some victims will be waiting four years for justice. Incoming Justice Secretary Dominic Raab may not have actually been appointed to deal with this problem - but to take on an ideological challenge. Mr Raab has credentials for speaking up on some human rights legal issues, yet he is also one of the most vocal critics of the Human Rights Act, one of the cornerstones of the modern British constitution. He's long called for it to be replaced or repealed - and the government's long-promised review of human rights law is now in his hands. We'll soon find out where Mr Raab ultimately stands on one of the most important but misunderstood legal issues of our times. She's the 10th culture secretary in 10 years. Nadine Dorries, a successful novelist, a former contestant on I'm a Celebrity (which led to a brief suspension of the Conservative whip) and a strong advocate of gender equality on the BBC certainly has a track record in taking an interest in cultural matters. In 2017 she tweeted: ""Left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy, tearing down historic statues, removing books from universities, dumbing down panto."" Her move to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) came on the day her predecessor, Oliver Dowden, was due to deliver his opinions on the future of Channel 4. That speech was instead made by media minister John Whittingdale. Sport, gambling, the future of the BBC, broadband services: the DCMS has a broad remit that covers everything from dealing with the tech giants to helping to alleviate loneliness. And over recent months Mr Dowden has increasingly entered debates about so-called ""woke culture"", statues and removing ""contested heritage"". This is political territory on which the new culture secretary has already expressed strong views.

"Nadhim Zahawi arriving in Downing Street for the reshuffle Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed the new education secretary for England - replacing Gavin Williamson in the Cabinet reshuffle. Mr Zahawi leaves his previous post as the minister responsible for the Covid vaccines roll-out. The departing education secretary had faced much criticism over his handling of schools during the pandemic. ""We can't pretend we are sorry that Gavin Williamson has gone,"" said teachers' union leader Kevin Courtney. Mr Zahawi, who has previously been a junior education minister, was born in Iraq. His family moved to the UK in 1976 when he was aged nine, attending independent schools in London and then studying chemical engineering at University College London. He will now be responsible for schools, colleges and universities in England, as they recover from the disruption of the pandemic. ""Education is a crucial part of our levelling up agenda so it's an honour to be back at the Department for Education as secretary of state,"" said Mr Zahawi. ""Children and young people have had a tough time during this pandemic and I'll be listening to them and their families as we accelerate our work to build back better and fairer."" Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union with Mr Courtney, urged the incoming education secretary to push for extra funding in next month's public spending review. Where did it all go wrong for Gavin Williamson? How did Williamson survive the exams chaos? The big U-turns of the summer exams ""The money promised to schools to date is a small fraction of the amount judged to be needed by the government's former education recovery tsar,"" said Ms Bousted. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""One of the most pressing tasks facing Mr Zahawi will be to ensure that the government now fulfils its promise to deliver a properly funded recovery package so that every pupil in the country receives the support they need and deserve. ""With the comprehensive spending review only weeks away, there really is no time to waste."" ""The Department for Education may now be under new management but the same challenges remain,"" said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. ""More ambition is needed on post-Covid education recovery, investment in schools and colleges, support for children with special educational needs, and closing the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers,"" he said. Mr Williamson's departing message said it had been a privilege to serve as education secretary ""despite the challenges of the global pandemic"". And he highlighted his efforts to raise the status of further education and skills. ""I'm particularly proud of the transformational reforms I've led in Post-16 education: in further education colleges, our skills agenda, apprenticeships and more,"" tweeted Mr Williamson. Mr Williamson - the first big casualty of the reshuffle - had faced much criticism during the pandemic, with particular problems around last summer's exams, which saw protests and U-turns over how grades were decided. ""He failed to engage with our suggestions on how to make schools safer during Covid - and thereby kept them closed longer,"" said Mr Courtney. But David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, commended Mr Williamson's support for further education, despite the disruption of the pandemic. ""It was always going to be a bumpy ride for Gavin Williamson. Despite that, he helped convince the prime minister and chancellor that post-16 education and skills should be a priority,"" said Mr Hughes. Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, described his time in office as ""disastrous"". ""Rather than responding to the challenges of a global pandemic, he led the charge in a completely pointless culture war against university staff and students. ""A culture war that was entirely fabricated and led to no positive change in the sector,"" said Dr Grady. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: ""Two years of exams chaos and staff abandoned, unsupported and demoralised. That is Gavin Williamson's legacy. ""The prime minister has allowed this to happen, keeping a failing education secretary in post for months and refusing to fight for children's futures.""

"Boris Johnson has appointed several new ministers to his cabinet, to replace those whose resignations this week ultimately prompted him to announce he would step down as prime minister. A fuller reshuffle is likely once Mr Johnson's successor is in place, but in the interim period Nadhim Zahawi has been promoted to chancellor, after Rishi Sunak quit, and Stephen Barclay has replaced Sajid Javid as health secretary. James Cleverly and Greg Clark also return to the cabinet, replacing Mr Zahawi as education secretary and the sacked Michael Gove as levelling up, housing and communities secretary respectively. Who else is in the current cabinet? Here is a guide to the people in Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces, as well as those who have changed roles. Boris Johnson became prime minister in December 2019 and immediately faced the UK's looming exit from the EU and the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The health crisis has been described as perhaps the biggest challenge the country has faced since World War Two. Mr Johnsonâs election win secured him the largest Tory majority in Parliament since 1987. He succeeded Theresa May as prime minister. His only previous cabinet post was foreign secretary, which he quit over differences with Mrs May over Brexit. Since being at 10 Downing Street, he married his fiancee Carrie Symonds and the couple have had two children. Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed chancellor following the resignation of Rishi Sunak. A former child refugee who fled Iraq with his parents in the 1970s, Mr Zahawi co-founded the market research firm YouGov and is now believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons. A strong media performer, the minister has been relied upon regularly to defend the prime minister on broadcast media rounds. Mr Zahawi was promoted to the cabinet in September 2021 after overseeing the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme and served as education secretary for eight months. He was elected as Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon in May 2010 and has also served as a business minister. Priti Patel was appointed home secretary in Boris Johnsonâs first cabinet and has kept her position since then. A prominent Brexiteer, Ms Patel had previously argued that Mr Johnson was the only person who could save Brexit and the Tories. She had previously served as Theresa May's international development secretary, until she was forced to quit following a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. She was first elected to the seat of Witham, Essex, in 2010, after working for several years in PR for the Conservative Party, as well as lobbying for tobacco and alcohol industries. Liz Truss replaced Dominic Raab as foreign secretary in September 2021. Her first role in Boris Johnson's cabinet was as international trade secretary. She was previously in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as the first female lord chancellor between 2016 and 2017. She served as environment secretary in David Cameron's government from 2014-16. Ms Truss was elected to Parliament in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. In a widely-publicised speech in June 2018, she attacked cabinet colleagues for demanding more money, saying it would only lead to higher taxation. Kit Malthouse replaces Stephen Barclay as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He was previously a minister jointly at the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice and attended cabinet. He came to the fore in the Brexit debate, when his name was put to a so-called compromise plan to replace Theresa May's proposed Northern Ireland backstop with ""alternative arrangements"". He was a deputy mayor of London from 2008, serving under Boris Johnson, and became MP for North West Hampshire in 2015. A chartered accountant who has run a number of small businesses, he lays claim to signing trade deals around the world in more than two decades of frontline politics. Ben Wallace has been defence secretary since July 2019. Mr Wallace trained at Sandhurst before joining the Scots Guards as a platoon commander. During his eight-year spell in the Army, he served in Northern Ireland, Germany, Cyprus and Central America. He was a member of the Scottish Parliament, before winning his seat of Lancaster and Wyre in 2005. The MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed replaced Liz Truss as international trade secretary in September 2021. She returned after losing her place in the cabinet when the Department for International Development was scrapped. Ms Trevelyan was promoted to a role as Armed Forces minister shortly after the Conservativesâ 2019 election victory. An outspoken Brexiteer, she resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in November 2018 in protest at the Brexit withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May. The former chartered accountant has also served on the Public Accounts Committee, responsible for scrutinising government spending. Stephen Barclay has become health secretary after Sajid Javid quit the role. He had been Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and minister for the Cabinet Office since September 2021. In February, Boris Johnson also appointed him as the new chief of staff at No 10. He had previously served as chief secretary to the Treasury and Brexit secretary. The former insurance company solicitor was elected MP for North East Cambridgeshire in 2010. James Cleverly has taken over as education secretary after Nadhim Zahawi was made chancellor and his replacement, Michelle Donelan, quit hours later. The former soldier, who rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Royal Artillery, is one of the partyâs most effective media performers. Theresa May made him party chairman and Boris Johnson initially promoted him to the cabinet as minister without portfolio before demoting him in his February 2020 reshuffle. Despite supporting Mrs Mayâs Withdrawal Agreement, he is popular with Brexiteers and served in the London Assembly while Mr Johnson was mayor. The father-of-two has been MP for Braintree in Essex since 2015. Jacob Rees-Mogg takes on a newly created role in cabinet having previously been an attending member as the Leader of the House of Commons. He is one of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers and a key member of party's European Research Group (ERG). He was a constant critic of former Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit. Before being elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010, Mr Rees-Mogg worked in finance, originally based in Hong Kong and later moving back to London. He set up his own investment management company in 2007. Mr Rees-Mogg, a Catholic, is married with six children. He is against abortion and gay marriage, but it was his position on Brexit, as well as his old-fashioned dress and courteous manner, which have brought him mainstream attention. Nadine Dorries remains culture secretary, having replaced Oliver Dowden in the role in September 2021. She was previously a minister for health and social care. Ms Dorries was elected as the Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire in May 2005. In November 2012, she was temporarily suspended from the Conservative party after taking part in reality TV programme I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. Before she entered politics Ms Dorries trained as a nurse, then went on to set up her own business and later became a director at BUPA. Kwasi Kwarteng remains as business secretary. The MP for Spelthorne in Surrey, seen as a rising star on the right of the party for many years, had been energy minister since July 2019. He was previously a junior Brexit minister. Before becoming an MP in 2010, he worked as an analyst in financial services. Greg Clark was named as levelling up, housing and communities secretary after Michael Gove was sacked by Boris Johnson. He is responsible for ""levelling up"" - the programme to help communities who feel they have been left behind. Mr Clark was local government and communities secretary â covering much of the same brief as his latest role â for a year under David Cameron, and had been a minister in several other departments during the coalition. He also served in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as business secretary and, more recently, chaired the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee. A former business consultant and BBC executive, Mr Clark has been MP for Royal Tunbridge Wells since 2005. Therese Coffey remains as work and pensions secretary. The former environment minister was initially appointed to the role after Amber Rudd resigned over the government's approach to Brexit. Ms Coffey has previously served in a number of roles including Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. She backed Remain in the 2016 referendum and voted in favour of Theresa May's Brexit deal. However, she later spoke about the need to honour the referendum result and supported Boris Johnson's Tory leadership bid. Dominic Raab replaced Robert Buckland as justice secretary in September 2021. Mr Raab faced criticism and calls for his resignation over his handling of the Afghanistan crisis. He was appointed foreign secretary and first secretary of state in Boris Johnson's first cabinet. A staunch Brexiteer, Mr Raab served as a justice minister in 2015, but was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister the following year. He made a return as Brexit secretary in July 2018 after the resignation of David Davis, but quit only months later in opposition to Mrs Mayâs Brexit deal. Mr Raab started his career as an international lawyer, before joining the Foreign Office as a diplomat. Grant Shapps remains transport secretary. The former international development minister was appointed to transport in July 2019. He was once seen as a high-flyer in the Tory party until he resigned following allegations he ignored warnings about bullying when he was party co-chairman. He was born in Watford and educated at a local grammar school, before going on to Manchester Polytechnic to study business and finance. He later set up his own successful printing business. Mr Shapps was elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire in 2005. George Eustice has been environment secretary since February 2020. Mr Eustice previously held ministerial posts under David Cameron and Theresa May, but resigned in 2019 in protest the latter's promise to allow MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal failed to pass the House of Commons. He has represented the Cornish constituency of Camborne and Redruth since 2010. Shailesh Vara was appointed Northern Ireland secretary following Brandon Lewisâs resignation. He was a minister at the Northern Ireland Office from July 2018 to November 2018. He has been a minister in the justice and work & pensions departments, and also spent time as a government whip. Mr Vara, who is married with two children, was elected Conservative MP for North West Cambridgeshire in 2005. Businessman Alister Jack was elected MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017 and has supported what he calls ""a successful Brexit for Scotland"". He founded tent-hire and self-storage companies and is also a dairy farmer. His constituency includes the busiest ferry-port serving Northern Ireland. He was appointed assistant government whip in February 2019. Robert Buckland returns to the cabinet, becoming Welsh secretary following Simon Hartâs resignation. The former solicitor general moved to be prisons minister in the justice department and served as justice secretary from July 2019 to September 2021. He supported Boris Johnson for the leadership describing him as a ""moderate, open-minded, one-nation Conservative"". He was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority, and has subsequently held the seat with an increased share of the vote. He was born in Llanelli and practised as a lawyer specialising in criminal law and planning before becoming an MP. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016, her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University, where she studied social and political sciences. She went on to become deputy director of the Conservative research department. She was previously deputy director of the centre-right Policy Exchange think-tank.

"Boris Johnson is overseeing a reshuffle of his cabinet. BBC editors and correspondents look back at the performances of the politicians leaving their job - and the challenges facing those who are taking over. Dominic Raab is always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And given that his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected suggests that he fought his move pretty hard. Being justice secretary, running prisons, courts and the legal system, is of course a huge job. And it matches his legal experience too. But there's no doubt that it is a demotion, losing out on one of the most prestigious jobs in government as foreign secretary. Downing Street doesn't want this to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, as a debacle in Afghanistan, Mr Raab even taking his family holiday during the crisis. But even with the bauble of deputy prime minister as part of his title (you wonder if title was a product of the tetchy conversations), Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government. What's Johnson's reshuffle really all about? The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post. As a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit. She will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy. Like the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: ""I don't think anyone would describe me as diplomatic."" Next week, Ms Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York. She will play a key role in the government's efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair. For the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting. Gavin Williamson found himself in the hot seat when schools closed their classrooms, and moved to on-and-off remote learning. It put him in the firing line for criticism from overstretched and exasperated head teachers and parents, as government policy led to sudden changes in direction. As schools in England geared up to support the poorest families through hard times, they faced delays, first with food vouchers, then with devices. Confusing England footballer Marcus Rashford with another black sportsman added to the perception of being prone to gaffes. But it was in the days before and after A-level results of 2020 in England when the chaos peaked. The education secretary defended the system, before a massive U-turn that felt inevitable. Mr Williamson has said he is most proud of his contribution to giving skills a higher profile. The cost of implementing an eye-catching promise of a life-long learning loan will be in his successor's in-tray, as will looming decisions about future university funding. For a government committed to levelling up, the long-term impact of the pandemic on the poorest children's education is the other big challenge. The Â£3bn promised for catch-up fell so far short that the government's own adviser resigned earlier this year. There have been eight justice secretaries since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 - and Robert Buckland's two years, one month and 22 days makes him the third-longest holder of a post that the entire legal establishment regards as having being treated as an afterthought. Mr Buckland, a respected lawyer and former judge, leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. That's 4,000 more than in January, when official watchdogs warned that the backlog was already of grave concern. The upshot is that some victims will be waiting four years for justice. Incoming Justice Secretary Dominic Raab may not have actually been appointed to deal with this problem - but to take on an ideological challenge. Mr Raab has credentials for speaking up on some human rights legal issues, yet he is also one of the most vocal critics of the Human Rights Act, one of the cornerstones of the modern British constitution. He's long called for it to be replaced or repealed - and the government's long-promised review of human rights law is now in his hands. We'll soon find out where Mr Raab ultimately stands on one of the most important but misunderstood legal issues of our times. She's the 10th culture secretary in 10 years. Nadine Dorries, a successful novelist, a former contestant on I'm a Celebrity (which led to a brief suspension of the Conservative whip) and a strong advocate of gender equality on the BBC certainly has a track record in taking an interest in cultural matters. In 2017 she tweeted: ""Left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy, tearing down historic statues, removing books from universities, dumbing down panto."" Her move to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) came on the day her predecessor, Oliver Dowden, was due to deliver his opinions on the future of Channel 4. That speech was instead made by media minister John Whittingdale. Sport, gambling, the future of the BBC, broadband services: the DCMS has a broad remit that covers everything from dealing with the tech giants to helping to alleviate loneliness. And over recent months Mr Dowden has increasingly entered debates about so-called ""woke culture"", statues and removing ""contested heritage"". This is political territory on which the new culture secretary has already expressed strong views.

"This video can not be played Pictures from South Korea's Ministry of National Defence show the launch North and South Korea have tested ballistic missiles hours apart from each other, highlighting an arms race on the peninsula as nuclear talks with the North remain stalled. The North fired two ballistic missiles across its east coast, its first test with such missiles in six months and a fresh breach of UN resolutions. The tests came as South Korea and China discussed the North's nuclear issue. Hours later, the South tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile. The test of the missile known as SLBM was pre-planned and not in reaction to the North's latest launches. It makes South Korea the seventh country in the world with such technology. President Moon Jae-in, who attended the test, said South Korea now hadÂ ""sufficient deterrence to respond to North Korea's provocations at any time"", urging the South to continue increasing its weapons programmes to ""overwhelm North Korea's asymmetric power"". The comments were criticised by Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who described them as illogical and regrettable, warning that they could lead to a breakdown in ties, state news agency KCNA reported. In North Korea's test, the short-range missiles flew around 800km (500 miles) at a maximum altitude of 60km, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. They were launched from central inland areas of the country, and flew east towards the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, the JCS added. South Korea and the US were conducting analysis to determine which type of missile was used. The Japanese defence minister said later the missiles had landed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone. South Korean television broadcast file footage in report about the North's latest test with ballistic missiles UN resolutions ban North Korea from carrying out tests with ballistic missiles - which can carry either nuclear or conventional warheads - in efforts to curb the country's nuclear programme. ""It's extraordinary timing that you have not one but two Koreas testing ballistic missiles on the same day,"" Prof John Delury at Yonsei University told AFP news agency. ""It does speak to the fact that there's an arms race in this region."" The recent launches show North Korea has continued to develop its weapons despite a severe economic crisis. Experts say Pyongyang carries out such tests to improve its technology while trying to increase its leverage in negotiations with Washington. The US wants the country to give up its nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for sanctions relief, but the North has refused. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the North Korean launch ""outrageous"" while the US said it posed a threat to the neighbours and the international community. Earlier, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks with his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, in Seoul, and said all parties should work to promote peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. North Korea tested a long-range cruise missile last weekend Ballistic missiles are classed according to how far they can travel, the furthest of which being an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea has in the past tested ICBMs said to be capable of reaching nearly all of Western Europe and about half of the US mainland. Last weekend, Pyongyang said it tested a long-range cruise missile capable of hitting much of Japan, calling it ""a strategic weapon of great significance"". Experts say it could possibly carry a nuclear warhead. The UN Security Council does not forbid the test of cruise missiles. But it considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening because they can carry bigger and more powerful payloads, have a much longer range, and can travel faster. North Korea is facing food shortages, and has spent more than a year in isolation. It cut off most trade with its closest ally China to stop the spread of Covid-19. Last March, Pyongyang defied sanctions and tested ballistic missiles, which triggered a strong rebuke from the US, Japan and South Korea. And last month the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a ""deeply troubling"" development.

"Fashion firms Asos and Primark have announced new sustainability commitments, with both saying they will keep prices affordable. Asos says it is aiming to achieve a net-zero impact on the environment by 2030. Primark says its clothes will be made using recycled or ""more sustainably sourced materials"" by the same date. The budget retailer has also promised to halve carbon emissions across its operations. Critics warned, however, that these goals will be hard to track as fast-fashion supply chains often lack transparency. On Thursday, Asos set out new environmental and social targets. They include: Reducing carbon emissions generated by its clothes production and deliveries Ensuring all of its own-brand products are made from sustainable or recycled materials by 2030 Giving customers more information on its supply chain Recruiting a more diverse workforce, including 50% female representation across its leadership team Its chief executive, Nick Beighton, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We need to work with our partners on this to offset any minimal cost increases we anticipate from doing this."" He added that he expects more consumers to choose to shop with Asos based on those commitments. ""The responsibility for a sustainable future lies with all of us and businesses must lead the way,"" he said. Boohoo boss: 'We're not a throwaway fashion brand' Small changes you can make for a greener life Asda to start selling second-hand clothes in shops In a statement, Primark also said it would design its clothes to be more durable so they can be recycled and last longer - without increasing its prices. It said it would ""pursue a living wage for workers in its supply chain"", but did not specify how much this wage would be in the countries where it has employees or when this would happen. Primark has 397 stores across 14 countries and employs about 70,000 people. The company's chief executive, Paul Marchant, said: ""Sustainability shouldn't be priced at a premium that only a minority can afford. ""Because of who we are, we believe we have the opportunity to make more sustainable fashion choices affordable to all."" Primark said it would eliminate single-use plastics in its own operations, but it doesnot own the majority of factories which manufacture its clothes.,external However, Noelle Hatley, lecturer in fashion business at Manchester Metropolitan University's Fashion Institute, said that using language such as ""ambitions"" and ""pursuing"" was vague. ""They need to be setting measurable targets, how many suppliers and factories and by what date will living wages be paid?"" Over the next year, Primark said it would make all men's, women's and kids' entry price point T-shirts from sustainably sourced cotton. But Ms Hatley said that ""without transparency of costings it is difficult to know how they can achieve this as the fast fashion business model relies on 'unsustainable' or 'below real cost' prices"". Though she said the announcement is encouraging, Ms Hatley added that if prices are being maintained, it ""would be good for them to share how they are achieving this; for example, are they accepting a lower margin, or is the factory being paid the same for what could be more expensive materials?"" Kate Fletcher, research professor at the Centre for Sustainable Fashion at the University of the Arts London, said that the problem of fast-fashion is volume and questions remain about how Primark is going to put limits around how many pieces it produces. ""The real change comes with the detail not in the commitments and aspirations,"" she said. ""What I'd like to see are details on what the real and living wages would be in different countries."" Primark was one of a number of retailers that attracted strong criticism in 2013 after more than 1,100 workers were killed in the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh. The Irish firm - which was one of 23 brands being produced at the garment factory - extended payments to victims and families affected. A worker in a Bangladeshi factory typically earns around 10p an hour. It was one of theworst industrial accidents in recent memoryand prompted more scrutiny of working conditions in garment factories. The global fashion industry produced an estimated 2.1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2018, and uses more energy than both aviation and shipping combined. It alsoaccounts for nearly 20% of waste water,external. Asos was also criticised ina recent report by the Royal Society of Arts,external(RSA) that found that more than a third of items listed on its website were made entirely from new plastics. The RSA pointed out that Asos had performed better than other firms such as Boohoo and Missguided, but said that fast fashion firms had more work to do. In the UK, citizens buy more new clothes than any other European country and anestimated 350,000 tonnes of clothes end up in landfill every year,external.

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: There's no single trigger for bringing back restrictions but we'll keep an eye on the NHS Pressure on the NHS is the main factor that would lead to tighter Covid restrictions in England, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid told the BBC there was not a ""single trigger"" for the government moving to its ""Plan B"" measures. But he said how the NHS was coping was the number one issue to watch. Government scientists have warned that there could be a large jump in Covid hospital admissions if restrictions are not tightened soon. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said its modelling suggested hospitalisations could reach 2,000 to 7,000 per day next month. Currently there is an average of just over 750 Covid admissions per day in England. The scientists said a ""relatively light set of measures"" could keep case numbers down if they were brought in early enough. Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to avoid the need for additional restrictions by getting more people vaccinated. Can England avoid 'lockdown lite' this winter? Plan A or Plan B - what could happen this winter? Booster jab rollout to begin in UK next week As he announced his winter plan for tackling Covid in England on Tuesday, he said some measures would be kept in reserve for if the NHS faced unsustainable pressure - including vaccine passports, mandatory face masks and advising people to work from home. Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast: ""We don't want to get to a position ever again where there's unsustainable pressure on the NHS so it's not able to see people in the usual way when it needs to, particularly emergency patients. ""So in my mind that is the number one issue that we need to always, always keep an eye on."" The health secretary said factors would include hospital admission numbers, pressures on A&E and staffing levels. Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Javid was pressed on why the government was not acting early to prevent a rise in hospital admissions. He said the UK now had ""much better defences"" than it did a year ago, including vaccines, new treatments and an improved testing and surveillance system. This video can not be played Protecting the NHS from being overwhelmed ""has to remain the objective"" says the PM Papers released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),externalon Tuesday, dated 8 September, said there was ""potential for another large wave of hospitalisations"". Virus modellers advising the committee - the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) - said it was possible the virus would spread more rapidly after the return of schools and more people going back to their workplaces. They said high levels of home-working had been very important for curbing the epidemic in recent months, with a significant decrease ""highly likely"" to lead to a rapid increase in hospital admissions. As well as encouraging working from home, they suggested ""light-touch measures"" such as clear messaging telling people to ""act cautiously"", more widespread testing, a return to requiring all contacts of cases to isolate, and more mask-wearing. If hospitalisation rates were allowed to get too high then much more stringent and disruptive measures would be needed, they said. However, the body acknowledged its previous warning - that lifting all restrictions over the summer might prompt a large scale outbreak - had not been borne out by events. Daily Covid cases have also been falling in England over the past week. The modellers who report into the Sage committee were too pessimistic back in July when they assumed the opening up of society would lead to a surge in infections and hospital admissions. The latest set of papers notes that the closure of schools, warm weather and large numbers of people being required to self-isolate played a bigger than expected role in curbing infections. But they go on to say that the peak time for cases expected previously from August has now simply been pushed back to October through to December. The return of schools and colleges could push up case rates. Another large wave of hospitalisations looms, they say. They lean towards early light touch intervention by ministers, for example getting more people to work from home again. In effect this is calling on the government to enact Plan B for England soon. Sceptics will say modellers have got it wrong before and a pinch of salt is needed with the latest papers. But few would deny the possibility of a very difficult winter ahead. Epidemiologist Prof Andrew Hayward says the focus should now be on the number of hospital admissions and the ability of the NHS to cope, rather on the number Covid cases, because of the impact of vaccines. Prof Hayward, who is a member of Sage but was speaking in a personal capacity, also said working from home would make ""a significant difference to transmission if we get into trouble"". ""The most important and effective way of reducing spread of the virus is not to be in contact with other people,"" he told the Today programme. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which feeds into Sage, said the number of contacts people had per week had risen to the highest number for a year - but this was mostly down to people going into work. He told Times Radio people should be allowed to continue to work from home if they can, rather than being forced back into the office. The country is entering the autumn with a much higher level of cases, hospital admissions and deaths than last year. On Tuesday, the UK reported a further 26,628 cases and another 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The most recent data showed there were 8,413 Covid patients in hospital. On 15 September last year, there were 3,105 daily cases and 27 deaths reported, along with 1,066 Covid patients in hospital. However, vaccines are now offering extensive protection against severe illness. Some 81.2% of people aged 16 and over in the UK are fully vaccinated. All over-50s in the UK - as well as those in other vulnerable groups -are to be offered a booster shot at least six months after their second dose, with 12 to 15-year-olds also being offered a single dose.

"Price rises have seen the biggest jump since records began in 1997 as the economy continued to reopen. Official figures show that the increase in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, hit 3.2% in the year to August. Higher prices in restaurants and for recreation and food were behind the spike, up from 2% the previous month. The cost of living rose less rapidly in July because of lower clothing and footwear prices. However,the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) urged caution in reading too much into August's price increases, which it described as ""temporary"". Eating and drinking out cost more last month in comparison with August last year, when the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme was running and diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. At the same time, business owners in the hospitality and tourism sectors received a VAT discount, designed to help some of the industries worst hit by the pandemic. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""August saw the largest rise in annual inflation month-on-month since the series was introduced almost a quarter of a century ago. ""However, much of this is likely to be temporary, as last year, restaurant and cafe prices fell substantially due to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, while this year, prices rose."" In August this year, transport costs also increased. Average petrol prices stood at 134.6 pence a litre, compared with 113.1 pence a litre a year earlier, when travel was reduced under lockdown restrictions. Used car prices were also partly to blame for price rises - they increased by 4.9% in just one month. Since April, they have gone up by more than 18%amid a shortage of new models. How will price rises affect you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that price rises seen in August were ""almost unavoidable"" because of the discounts available in 2020. ""Inflation, which is a year-on-year comparison, was always going to look strong compared to last year,"" she said. ""Some of that rise reflected genuine factors too. In particular, we are now seeing the effects of higher global shipping costs and shortages of staff driving up food price inflation."" She also expects, however, that the cost of living could continue to increase rapidly, with inflation exceeding 4% by November. Diners bought more than 160 million meals under the Eat Out to Help Out scheme last August The latest official figures will add to the debate about whether interest rates need to go up to curb consumer spending and moderate prices. Inflation now exceeds the Bank of England's 2% target, aimed at keeping cost increases steady. But Capital Economics points out that inflation is likely to fall back almost as sharply next year and that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is not expected to raise interest rates until 2023. The central bank's deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, insisted in Julythat it would not stop its efforts to boost the economy, despite the forecast of higher costs. ""While we know [inflation] is going to go further over the next few months, I'm not convinced that the current inflation in retail goods prices should in and of itself mean higher inflation 18 to 24 months ahead, the horizon more relevant for monetary policy,"" he said. Most of the inflation in goods prices was down to oil price rises and supply chain issues, he said, which was likely to ""fall away"" in the early part of 2022. But given that Wednesday's latest figures breach the Bank's target, it must now write to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to explain what it will do to ensure that price prices are steady in future. Shopping bills set to rise this autumn, says BRC Inflation spike temporary, says Bank deputy 'Customers will go elsewhere and won't come back' James Lyon Shaw, who owns the Greene Oak Pub in Windsor, Berkshire, told the BBC the rise in inflation had to be taken in context and that businesses, including his own, needed to ""ride the storm"". He is paying his employees 10 to 20% more an hour compared to last year due to the wider workforce shortages. He said increases in food prices depended on where restaurants and pubs source their food, with rises in haulage and logistics costs hitting profit margins. ""We just have got to get through, you've got to be pragmatic, get on and adapt your business."" He questioned if people had enjoyed access to ""cheap food"" for too long and whether there needed to be a shift in attitudes to pay for more sustainably produced products. Yaelâ¯Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, added: ""Higher inflation will inevitably raise questions for the Bank of England on the timing of tightening monetary policy and interest rate hikes to contain inflationary risks further down the line."" She added: ""However, any tightening now risks scuppering the recovery before it has a chance to take hold, so a delay until the middle of next year is likely."" UK businesses are reporting difficultiesin sourcing goods and recruiting staff because of disruption caused by the pandemic and problems such as HGV driver shortages, exacerbated by Brexit. According to a survey of 2,000 people by Retail Economics, more than half of consumers are concerned about rising costs as a result. The market research firm said on Wednesday that worries about the cost of living had reached their highest point in more than five years. A record monthly spike in inflation, up to levels not seen for more than eight years, reflects a spluttering restart to the economy. Demand has rebounded, but the supply of goods and labour has not. In August, there were one-off factors from the discounts and support measures last year. As inflation is above 3%, the Bank of England governor has to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why. Stripping out the impact of Eat Out to Help Out last year would have meant this was not necessary. This inflation number will go higher still in the coming months because of rising home energy bills. Alongside the rise in petrol prices and frankly incredible increase in used car prices, these inflationary pressures are becoming very visible. The maths suggests that inflation could top 4% and then fall just as sharply, as long as there are no further economic shocks. Public perceptions matter significantly in regard to wage settlements for next year. While the number is high and rising, this is still consistent with a ""transitory"" post-lockdown reopening inflation spike, predicted by the central bank. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Stephen Crabb says the benefit freeze was a mistake Next month's Â£20-a-week cut in universal credit risks pushing working people into poverty, a senior Conservative MP has warned. The government says the Â£20 top-up was always a temporary measure to help people through the pandemic. But former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb says the government risks repeating the mistake it made in 2015 when it froze working age benefits. Labour is calling for the cut to be axed during a debate in the Commons. Its leader, Sir Keir Starmer, attacked the government during Prime Minister's Questions, saying it was ""clobbering working people"" with the cut, coupled withthe rise in National Insurance to cover the new health and social care tax. But Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""encourage high wages and high skills"", and the government was focused on supporting people into work with better pay. Labour plans to force a vote on the cut on Wednesday, but the result will not be binding on the government. Mr Crabb has joined a growing number of Tory MPs - including five other former work and pensions secretaries - who are against removing the Â£20 uplift. ""I was part of the team that took that decision to freeze benefits - and wages didn't go up in the way that we believed they would. Levels of poverty increased,"" he told BBC News. ""We should seek to learn the lessons of that rather than just repeat it."" The-then Chancellor George Osborne said low-paid workers would be better off despite the four-year freeze, thanks to tax changes and increases in the minimum wage. But Mr Crabb - who was Welsh Secretary at the time - said it had amounted to a ""real-terms cut"" in benefits, which had been ""a contributing factor to the rise of in-work poverty"". Coffey: Universal Credit cut is two hours extra work Why are my universal credit payments being reduced? Make universal credit top-up permanent - Tory MPs Employment reached record levels before the pandemic, but the UK also saw a significant increase in the number of households with at least one adult in paid work falling into relative poverty,according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies,external. There are 5.9 million people receiving universal credit payments across the country, according to the latest government figures - almost double the three million making claims before the pandemic. While some are seeking jobs and others are unable to work, 40% of claimants are already employed. The Resolution Foundation think tank said workers would have to put in an nine extra hours a week to make up for the loss of Â£20, once pension contributions, childcare and travel costs had been taken into account. Mr Crabb is not the only Conservative calling for the Â£20 universal credit top-up - which will disappear on 6 October - to be made permanent. West Midlands metro mayor Andy Streettold the i paper,externalhe was ""very concerned"" about the potential impact of the cut - and Amber Valley MP Nigel Mills said the government ""would be in trouble"" if there was a Commons vote on it. Opening Labour's Opposition Day debate in the Commons, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said removing the top-up would be ""the single biggest overnight cut in the history of the welfare state"", affecting one in 14 British workers. He added: ""The human cost of taking this money away cannot be overstated - Â£20 might not seem like much to some people but it's the difference between having food in the fridge and still being able to put the heating on, or being able to get their kids new school shoes without worrying how you'll pay for it."" But his government counterpart, Therese Coffey -who was criticised over comments on the cut earlier this week- said more people were getting back into work under the Conservative government, and there was ""a record number"" of vacancies for those seeking jobs. ""It was right that we took prompt and decisive action to support our nation during this challenging time,"" she added. ""[But] this was a temporary uplift recognising the financial impact of people newly unemployed so that it would be somewhat of a cushion in regards to their financial circumstances. ""As our economy continues to recover, it is right that we are investing in jobs and skills to boost pay, prospects and prosperity for people right across the UK as part of our plan to level up and build back better."" Catherine says the stereotypes about benefit claimants are false Catherine, a mature student training to be a primary school teacher, is a client of Pembrokeshire Action to Combat Hardship, a food bank in Stephen Crabb's constituency. She says the prospect of losing so much weekly income is ""quite scary"". ""Do we put the heating on, or do we put a jumper on? Can we manage to make this week's shopping to stretch a bit further?"" Catherine is in receipt of student finance as well as universal credit, as a single parent. She says the ""stereotype"" that people on benefits are not making an effort, is ""absolute rubbish"". ""I'm doing everything I can to better my prospects for myself and my family. I've paid into the system in the past I will pay into the system in the future."" The number of people claiming universal credit hasnearly doubled since the start of the pandemic,external, which Mr Crabb says undermines a key government argument for axing the Â£20 top-up. ""Almost half of people on universal credit have only known this level of benefit. The idea of this being people going back to a level of benefit they were used to - that's completely false."" He suggested that introducing the Â£20 top-up was effectively a ""recognition that the current level of working age benefits was too low"". And with 40% of people on universal credit using it to top up their wages, he feared the ""very sharp"" cut would hurt ""people who are trying to do the so-called 'right thing' by going out to work"". ""As a Conservative that is deeply problematic for me,"" the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP added. A government spokesperson said the universal credit uplift had achieved its aim of helping claimants through the ""economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic"". ""Universal credit will continue to provide vital support for those both in and out of work and it's right that the government should focus on our Plan for Jobs, supporting people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more,"" the spokesperson added.

"Dominic Raab has resigned as deputy prime minister, following an investigation into claims of alleged bullying. Mr Raab, who was also the justice secretary, had always denied the allegations but said he would quit if bullying claims were upheld. He has done that, but in his resignation letter to Rishi Sunak, and in an article penned for the Telegraph newspaper, Mr Raabalso hit back. While the report from senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC makes uncomfortable reading in parts, Mr Raab - who's changed his Twitter handle to ""MP for Esher and Walton, father of two, boxing fan"" - has thrown a punch of his own. In his letter to the PM, he said ministers needed to be able to give direct critical feedback and exercise direct oversight over their civil servant officials. He apologised for any ""unintended"" stress caused, but referred to the ""pace, standards and challenge"" he brought to the Ministry of Justice. The report cleared the former frontbencher of shouting and swearing at staff, and he was not found to have used physical gestures - but it did say that style of working as a minister was ""inquisitorial, direct, impatient and fastidious"". And it paints a picture of a man who worked from 7.30 in the morning until late at night and at weekends. Mr Raab was found to have described the work of officials as ""utterly useless"" and ""woeful"" while he was justice secretary. And as foreign secretary, a role he served in from 2019 to 2021, the report says in one instance ""he acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting. His conduct also involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates."" Date of birth:25 February 1974 (age 49) Job:Justice secretary, deputy prime minister, lord chancellor, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton Education:Dr Challoner's Grammar School, Amersham, Oxford and Cambridge universities Family:Married to Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive, with two sons Before politics:Foreign Office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague Despite resigning, Mr Raab is entitled to a pay-off of nearly Â£17,000, a quarter of his ministerial salary, as long as he is not reappointed to another position within three weeks. But the MP, who paid his own legal fees during the investigation, faces a pay cut of Â£67,505 as he loses his ministerial salary. As an ordinary backbencher, he will earn Â£86,584 a year. Mr Raab was born in 1974, the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938. He was brought up in Buckinghamshire and attended Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, before studying law at Oxford University and switching to Cambridge for his masters degree. He worked as a lawyer in the commercial sector and the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide to Brexit-supporting Conservative MP David Davis, and then Remain-backing Dominic Grieve. Raab under fire over Dover-Calais comment Raab 'confident' PM will recover from coronavirus Raab ex-colleagues speak as bullying probe nears end First elected to Parliament in 2010, the following year Mr Raab angered then-Home Secretary Theresa May by describing some feminists as ""obnoxious bigots"" in an online article also claiming men were getting ""a raw deal"". Mrs May accused him of fuelling ""gender warfare"". Mr Raab remained on the backbenches for five years after becoming an MP. But the karate black-belt became a junior justice minister following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015. He played a prominent role in the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked by Mrs May when she took over as prime minister. In 2017, Mr Raab was branded ""offensive"" by then-Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying ""the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty; it's someone who has a cash flow problem"". But in June that year he returned to government, as a justice minister, this time middle-ranking rather than junior. In Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle he became housing minister - one of the highest-profile non-cabinet roles in government. And in July that year, when David Davis quit, the prime minister promoted Mr Raab to Brexit secretary, a cabinet post. Yet his improved relationship with Mrs May did not last long. In November 2018, he quit, arguing that he could not ""in good conscience"" support the ""backstop"" arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. As an influential Brexiteer, his comments were seen as significant in increasing opposition to Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs repeatedly rejected. After Mrs May announced she was standing down, Mr Raab entered the contest to become Conservative leader, and prime minister. In a crowded field, he failed to get the 33 MPs' votes he needed to progress to the third round. Fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove outlasted him. Mr Johnson,to whom Mr Raab gave his supportafter his elimination from the race, promoted him to foreign secretary and first secretary of state - effectively deputy prime minister. But he only narrowly managed to hold on to his Esher and Walton seat at the 2019 general election, seeing off a strong Liberal Democrat challenge by 2,743 votes. The overall Conservative landslide, however, on a promise to ""get Brexit done"", meant he saw his dream of leaving the EU come true on 31 January 2020. As foreign secretary and first secretary of state, he was the UK government's de-facto second-in-command. He was left in charge of running much of the government when the prime minister was hospitalised with Covid-19 in April 2020. Colleagues, including Mr Johnson's arch-critic and former aide Dominic Cummings, have praised Mr Raab's performance under extreme pressure. But he has continued to anger opponents with some of his comments, in 2020 telling talkRadio's Julia Hartley-Brewer he would only ""take the knee"" - go down on bended knee - for ""the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me"". He later qualified his remarks - following opposition criticism of his ""insulting"" and ""flippant"" tone - saying he ""fully"" supported the Black Lives Matter campaign. In fact, some of his remarks and gaffes have resulted in mockery. Despite a reputation for being a creature of habit, he dismissed an eye-catchingclaim by a former diary secretary that he insisted on the same Pret A Manger lunch every day. And as Brexit secretary, he came under fire for saying he""hadn't quite understood"" how reliant UK trade in goods was on the Dover-Calais crossing. As foreign secretary, Mr Raab was heavily criticised for his handling of the aftermath of the fall of Afghanistan, specifically for remaining on holiday in Crete while the Taliban marched back to power. He insisted he'd been across the detail and was in touch with the key players. Downing Street stood by the minister, however he was later demoted to the role of justice secretary, which although still a cabinet position is not as prestigious as foreign secretary. Mr Raab stayed publicly loyal to Mr Johnson, being one of the few ministers not to resign during the final chaotic week of his premiership. This video can not be played The deputy party leaders swap exchanges on bullying claims against him and her previous labelling for her opponents. In the leadership race that followed, he enthusiastically threw his backing behind Rishi Sunak - and in August fiercely attacked the rival candidate Liz Truss, calling her economic plans ""electoral suicide"". That broadside wasn't forgotten by Ms Truss's team and Mr Raab was not included in her cabinet when she became prime minister. However, Ms Truss was soon gone and Mr Raab returned to government in the familiar roles of justice secretary and deputy prime minister. As Mr Sunak's deputy, he stood in for his boss at Prime Minister's Question opposite Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy. Their exchanges across the despatch box were often fiery. As well as a big drop in salary, Mr Raab also loses the status of his position at the very top of government. Whether he will return to high office remains to be seen.

"Influencers are to be signed up by the City regulator in a campaign to warn people about the pitfalls of high-risk investments. Some celebrities have been criticised for their part in promoting trading apps which have proved popular among young people drawn into investing. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants to reach these risk-takers in a planned Â£11m awareness campaign. It is part of a wider strategy to ensure investors are well-treated. ""Investors have never had more freedom. Technology has democratised the market, new products have become available and people have better access to their life savings than before,"" said Sarah Pritchard, executive director of markets at the FCA. ""But that freedom comes with risk. We want to give consumers greater confidence to invest and to help them do so safely, understanding the level of risk."" GameStop - David and Goliath or a political fable? 'Thrill of investing' leads young to take risks Inthe strategy,external, the FCA has repeated its warning that some people have invested money for the first time during the pandemic in products which have unsuitably high risks for their financial circumstances. It has warned they are getting involved in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange owing to the thrill of investing, rather than for long-term savings goals. Advertising authorities took action against a post by Lauren Goodger Alongside that, there has been concern that some celebrities have been endorsing certain products without making their own gain clear. In August, an Instagram post by TV star Lauren Goodger was banned because she did not clearly mark it as an advert. A survey by investment platform Interactive Investor found that 45% of young investors aged 18 to 29 said their first ever investment was in cryptocurrency, while many were funding this through a cocktail of credit cards, student loans, and other loans. As a result, the FCA is planning a campaign to help people make well-informed decisions. ""We plan to use a range of channels to reach our audience, including partnerships with influencers, social media, online videos, paid ads on Google and more,"" the strategy said. The FCA also points out that nearly 8.6 million people currently hold more than Â£10,000 of investible assets in cash. In a major boost for the investment industry, in the next five years the regulator aims to reduce the number of consumers by a fifth who could benefit from investment earnings but are missing out. This could potentially mean 1.7 million people, each with more than Â£10,000 put away, making the jump from cash savings to investments. Laura Suter, from investment company AJ Bell, said: ""For many of these individuals, investing is a logical route, as they don't need the safety of cash or immediate access to their money, but it's often a job on the to-do list that people don't get around to."" Liz Field, of the Personal Investment Management and Financial Advice Association, said that the FCA should have been more ambitious in its supervisory role.

"Thousands of leaseholders who bought homes from a major housebuilder will no longer be subjected to ground rents that double every 10 or 15 years. Countryside Properties will keep rents at the same level as when they first bought their home after a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority. Countryside is the latest housebuilder to scrap the ""unfair"" contract terms. Millions of buyers signed leasehold contracts that campaigners say make homes impossible to mortgage or sell. The regulator launched its investigation into leaseholds in 2019 because it was worried that leaseholders were facing huge and unexpected increases in the cost of buying a freehold or massive increases in ground rents, which kick in every 10 to 15 years. The commitment from Countryside comes after the CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers in September 2020. These were Countryside and Taylor Wimpey, for using ""possibly unfair contract terms"", and Barratt Developments and Persimmon Homes over the possible mis-selling of leasehold homes. The watchdog's investigation into Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey is continuing. Court threat to housebuilders over leasehold 'trap' 'We've been caught in a leasehold trap' Leasehold property buyers 'misled by developers' Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said Countryside leaseholders could breathe a ""sigh of relief"", following the contract changes. ""No one should feel like a prisoner in their home, trapped by terms that mean they can struggle to sell or mortgage their property,"" he said. ""We will continue to robustly tackle developers and investors - as we have done over the past two years - to make sure that people aren't taken advantage of."" Some of the biggest names in property have changed their terms recently, while others remain under investigation. In June, Persimmon agreedfor its leaseholders to buy the freehold of their property at a discount, while Aviva, which buys freeholds from house builders, pledged to repay homeowners who saw their ground rents double. With a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property, but they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold. However, leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell. There were an estimated 4.6 million leasehold dwellings in England between 2019 and 2020, which equated to 19% of the English housing stock. More than two thirds (3.2 million) of the leasehold dwellings were flats and 1.5 million were houses,official figures said.,external Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC), said the changes would help people ""escape onerous ground rents that make their homes unmortgageable and unsellable"". ""We are delighted that Countryside are the next domino to fall in this whole sorry saga of doubling ground rents,"" she added. Countryside Properties confirmed it no longer sells leasehold homes with doubling ground rents. It will also remove terms which converted clauses which meant ground rent increased in line with the Retail Prices Index (RPI). Iain McPherson, chief executive of Countryside, said the housebuilder had ""engaged extensively and constructively with the CMA throughout the course of its review to reach this positive outcome for affected leaseholders"". For Baz Jafar, the leaseholder of a one-bedroom flat which was sold to him by Countryside, the agreement to scrap ground rent increases has been a ""long time coming"". The 31-year-old, along with many others living in the same block of flats in north London, discovered the onerous clauses ""one or two years"" after buying the properties. He told the BBC most leaseholders in the building had used solicitors recommended by Countryside. ""We found we could not really move to different mortgage companies,"" said Mr Jafar. ""We could not really sell [the homes] because mortgage companies found these increased terms unacceptable."" Mr Jafar said when he and others raised the issue with Countryside, the company said rising ground rent payments were ""industry standard"". ""The whole thing stank from the beginning,"" said Mr Jafar. ""Countryside say they are really happy to come to a solution for leaseholders. People are only affected because Countryside wrote these leases in the first place. ""I'm disappointed that they [Countryside] have not given any admission of liability. I do not think they should be given any credit for what they are doing."" Dr Coscelli said Taylor Wimpey and freehold investors had the ""opportunity to do the right thing"" to remove ""problematic clauses from their contracts"". ""If they refuse, we stand ready to step in and take further action - through the courts, if necessary,"" he said. NCL co-founder Jo Darbyshire, who lives in a Taylor Wimpey house that was sold in 2010 with ground rent of Â£295, doubling every 10 years, said it was ""about time"" for the housebuilder to ""do the right thing and match what Countryside are doing"". Taylor Wimpey declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said said new legislation would ""put an end to this practice"" by housebuilders for future homeowners, by setting ground rents in new leases at zero. Ground rents typically start at about Â£250 a year. Doubling clauses mean that this amount escalates over time. Campaigners often say the leasehold system was not properly explained to them when they bought their properties, leaving them trapped in unsellable homes. Three firms have now agreed to change their ways, but the CMA is continuing to investigate the use of ground rent by Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Homes. The government is introducing new legislation to scrap ground rent on new leases, but homeowners who have already paid high charges in the past want compensation. For the four million leaseholders across England and Wales, ground rent is only part of the problem. They do not own a single brick of the building, so they need permission to do any work on the property and can be charged a fee for it.

"Liz Truss has been promoted to one of the key jobs in government Boris Johnson has fired a string of cabinet ministers - and promoted new faces to replace them - in a major reshuffle. The prime minister sacked under-fire Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and moved Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to the justice department. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel keep their jobs. But there are promotions for Liz Truss, who goes to the Foreign Office, and Nadine Dorries, who gets culture. Downing Street said the aim of the reshuffle was to ""put in place a strong and united team to build back better from the pandemic"". More moves are expected over the coming hours, as Mr Johnson seeks to fill vacant positions. Who is Dominic Raab? Nadine Dorries becomes new culture secretary Liz Truss: fast track to foreign secretary Where did it go wrong for Gavin Williamson? In addition to justice secretary and Lord Chancellor, Mr Raab has also been given the title of deputy prime minister, after what is understood to have been a lengthy and difficult conversation with the prime minister. A source denied Mr Raab was angry with the move from the Foreign Office, but he is understood to be unhappy with the way his handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan was portrayed. In other moves: Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi is promoted to education secretary Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick is fired - and replaced by Michael Gove Treasury minister Steve Barclay replaces Mr Gove as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden is given the role of minister without portfolio at the Cabinet Office Mr Dowden will also co-chair the Conservative Party, replacing Amanda Milling Simon Clarke becomes Chief Secretary to the Treasury Nick Gibb, the schools minister, leaves government after seven years The big winners from the reshuffle include Ms Dorries, a junior health minister and best-selling novelist who has never sat in the cabinet before, and Ms Truss, who moves into one of the top three jobs in government from the Department for International Trade. New Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Michael Gove will get the added responsibility of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda - spreading wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum. The way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks, ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: ""Is it on?"" People in the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. But, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. And Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet - the most significant switch coming in one of the chunkiest jobs of all. Read more from Laura Losers from the reshuffle include Mr Williamson, who has faced repeated opposition calls to quit, or be sacked, over his handling of disruption to schools and exams during the pandemic. He said he was ""proud"" of the ""transformational reforms I've led in post-16 education: in further education colleges, our skills agenda, apprenticeships and more"". Dominic Raab is no longer foreign secretary and Gavin Williamson has been sacked as education secretary by the PM For Labour, shadow education secretary Kate Green said Mr Williamson had ""failed children and young people, their parents and our hard-working education staff throughout one of the most testing periods in our history"". Robert Buckland also looks set for a return to the backbenches after being replaced by Mr Raab as justice secretary and Lord Chancellor. Nadine Dorries has been promoted to the cabinet for the first time BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said Mr Buckland was a respected figure in the legal profession, but leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: ""Appointing a failed foreign secretary who was fired for being missing in action to be the sixth justice secretary in six years shows how little this government cares about victims of crime.""

"Father-of-two Brian Phelan died after being stabbed on a rural road near Newry in 2018 A 30-year-old man has been found guilty of the murder of Brian Phelan on the outskirts of Newry in July 2018. Mr Phelan was stabbed three times in the neck and twice in the body during an attack on a remote Carrivekeeney Road, near to the village of Camlough. He had gone there with Daniel Martin James Carroll, of Edward Street in Portadown, but originally from Newry. Carroll was found guilty of Mr Phelan's murder at Newry Crown Court on Wednesday. During a two-week trial, the court heard that on the day of his death Mr Phelan had met Carroll in Bessbrook before travelling to the road with the intention of buying quad bikes. The road, which runs up the side of Camlough mountain, effectively comes to a dead end for vehicles, however a path does lead across the mountain. It was the defence's case that three men with paramilitary links had appeared from a nearby field, attacked Mr Phelan, threatened him and then made off in the direction of the mountain. Although he said he knew them, Carroll would not name the men stating that his life and that of his family was at risk. The defence said that the mountain path could have been accessed by small vehicles such as quadbikes. However, the prosecution said this version of events, which Carroll put forward 15 months after Brian Phelan's death, was complete nonsense. It said the defendant had attacked the victim and then fled the scene, changing his T-shirt before being arrested nearly two hours later at a family member's home in Newry. Although no definite motive was identified, the jury had been told of Carroll's previous record, which included unprovoked violence. Giving evidence, a police officer had also suggested there could have been a financial disagreement between the two men. A jury of six men and five women took less than 90 minutes to reach a unanimous guilty verdict. Social distancing meant that only a small number of Brian Phelan's friends and family were permitted inside the courtroom. There were emotional scenes from those in the public gallery with a loud cheer from the adjoining foyer. Before being sent down, the judge told Carroll that he would be sentenced to life imprisonment. A tariff hearing to determine the minimum amount of time he will spend in prison before being considered for parole will be set in November.

I'd been having a few beers at a mate's house watching the game. He wasn't that into football. Switched the game off at half-time and continued drinking. It was only when we got to Kelly's night club in Portrush, Northern Ireland, that I discovered Liverpool had turned it round. Raucous atmosphere in there that night from the Liverpool fans. John, Northern Ireland Liverpool v AC Milan (20:00 BST) Inter Milan against Real Madrid looks like it'll be an interesting game but the pick of the bunch there is the repeat of the 2005 Champions League final, when Liverpool pulled off a remarkable fightback against AC Milan before winning on penalties.

It's up to his representatives and the club to determine how long he stays. ""I have no idea [why talks are taking so long],"" Rodgers added. ""I concentrate on the football. There's no drama.

""The players have feelings and soul, and you know it hurts when you cannot achieve,"" said the Spaniard. ""For them now it's a new, new challenge to try. When these guys win three Premier Leagues in the last four years, and every year we have the feeling that we can do better - we reached the final of the Champions League - yes, it's a motor. They want it.""

"This video can not be played M25 protests: Campaigners from Insulate Britain block junctions for the second time in a week Police have made 71 arrests as climate change protesters caused fresh disruption on the M25, blocking roundabouts and the motorway itself. Insulate Britain activists stopped traffic on three sections of the road for the second time in three days. There were long delays at junctions 1a and 1b for Dartford, Kent; eight for Reigate and nine for Leatherhead, Surrey; and 23 for South Mimms, Herts. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the action was putting lives at risk. Hetweeted,external: ""These actions are not only highly disruptive to those going to work and transporting vital goods, but are putting lives at risk on a busy motorway. ""Not to mention the resulting traffic delays will only add to vehicle emissions."" Demonstrators, who targeted the UK's busiest motorway as part of their campaign for government action on home insulation, sat on the road, while stranded motorists beeped their horns. Videos posted on social media showed angry drivers remonstrating with the activists. Police said the road was clear of protesters at about midday, but a four-vehicle collision at junction nine was not cleared until just before 16:00 BST. Climate change protesters returned to the M25 after protests on Monday The action caused delays on the A1(M) in Hertfordshire when motorists were unable to get on to the M25 at junction 23 Surrey Police said the protest was reported at junctions eight and 10 just after 08:00 BST on Wednesday and in total it arrested 32 people. Herts Police said its officers were called at about the same time to near junction one of the A1(M) southbound / junction 23 of the M25 at South Mimms and were on the scene within minutes, detaining 18 people. It said it attempted to engage with the group, following ""clear, national standards"", and balancing ""the rights of people to protest with the rights of those affected"". ""However, protesters ignored repeated requests from officers to move to a safer and less disruptive location, and alleged that they had glued themselves to the tarmac, making it clear that their aim was to cause as much disruption as possible,"" Supt Adam Willmot said. He thanked the public for their ""patience and understanding"". Kent Police said it was called at about 08:20 to junctions 1a and 1b for the Dartford Tunnel and Princes Road and arrested 21 people, Hertfordshire Police detained 18 people at junction 23 for the A1(M) Activists blocked roundabouts at M25 junctions as well as the carriageway in some areas The action follows protests on Monday whenfive junctions were blockedand 77 arrests made. Announcing Wednesday's action, the campaign group posted on social media: ""Insulate Britain are back"". It said 89 of its members were taking part in the latest action. In atweet,external, it said: ""You're angry. So are we... But sitting in the road makes Boris Johnson sit up and take notice, so we're staying, until 10 Downing Street #getonwiththejob."" In a statement, it added: ""Proper jobs for hundreds of thousands of people to start the first real step - to insulate all the homes of this country - which pound for pound gives us the biggest reduction in carbon emissions. ""It is a total no-brainer and yet this government refuses to get on with the job."" In response to Monday's protests, a government spokeswoman said: ""People's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted, especially on busy motorways where lives are put at risk and resulting traffic delays will only add to vehicle emissions. ""We are investing Â£1.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures, and our upcoming Heat and Buildings Strategy will set out how we decarbonise the nation's homes in a way that is fair, practical and affordable."" During the latest protest, some activists sat down on the motorway carriageway Edmund King from the AA said: ""Whilst most people understand the need to take action on climate change, these motorway blockade tactics are just backfiring as they are alienating the working public stuck in this chaos and subsequently pumping out more emissions,"" he said. ""Essential deliveries, emergency services, people missing hospital and business appointments are all hit by these blockades."" One driver caught up in delays in Hertfordshire said: ""I can understand why they're protesting but to do this is just ridiculous. ""If it's protesting against climate change, you've got all these vehicles stationary on the road with their engines running so they're not achieving anything."" Hertfordshire Police said it attempted to engage with the group before making arrests As police worked to remove the glue from Stephanie's hand, she told commuters she was ""sorry"" about the action but that protesters had ""tried everything else"" One protester, who wished to be known only as Stephanie, and who had glued herself to the road in Hertfordshire, said: ""I understand [the affected drivers'] frustration because it's annoying when people disrupt your day. ""I'm sorry about that, I really am, but the climate crisis is going to be far, far more disruptive than this."" She added that she did not want to be there but they had ""tried everything else"". ""I am terrified for my children. Their lives are going to be full of floods, fires and food shortages - we're already seeing it now,"" she said.

"The John Lewis Partnership is looking to fill thousands of seasonal jobs to meet increased demand around Christmas. It plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers in its UK John Lewis and Waitrose stores and distribution centres. The employee-owned business said this was 2,000 more temporary roles than the previous year. New joiners will be offered free food and drink to ""help ensure we can attract the help we need"", it said. The partnership is hiring people for its supermarkets, department stores and warehouses, including delivery drivers for its online grocery division. It has 34 John Lewis department stores and 331 Waitrose supermarket stores alongside its online operation. The partnership is also looking to fill 550 permanent, full-time, driver and warehouse jobs. How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Job vacancies surge past one million in new record Nikki Humphrey, people director at the John Lewis Partnership, said: ""We know that as the first Christmas after lockdown, customers will want to make it really special and we're throwing everything we can into helping them celebrate - our festive team will have a crucial role to play."" ""We look forward to welcoming people into our team across the country,"" she added. The jobs will be advertised online from Thursday, with 4,700 temporary roles available in Waitrose stores and 2,300 in John Lewis. The move comes after the number of job vacancies in the UK surged past one million for the first time. According to new official figures released on Wednesday, the number of jobs in the three months to August rose above one million for the first time since records began in 2001. The most popular sectors in terms of vacancies were social work, hospitality, science, retail and manufacturing. But business lobby groups warned that demand for more staff had reached a critical point. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that firms faced an ""acute hiring crisis"". ""With Brexit and Covid-19 driving a more deep-seated decline in labour supply, the end of furlough is unlikely to be a silver bullet to the ongoing shortages,"" he said. ""These recruitment difficulties are likely to dampen the recovery by limiting firms' ability to fulfil orders and meet customer demand."" Supermarket bosses have said that it is vital to fix the labour shortage problems before key trading over the Christmas period. The John Lewis Partnership will also launch Christmas promotions in shops from October and will use a new 300,000 sq-ft distribution centre in Leicestershire to ensure it can meet demand ahead of the Black Friday sales. Last year, the UK's Christmas celebrations were hindered by restrictions on the number of people allowed to meet up due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With fewer restrictions expected this year, retailers are hoping for a bumper festive period.

"Working from home could curb the spread of Covid during winter, Sage member Andrew Hayward says Sage says England's Covid hospital admissions could rise if restrictions are not tightened Hospitalisations could reach 2,000 to 7,000 per day next month - currently there are around 1,000, it says However the group did acknowledge a previous warning was not borne out by events Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there will be ""no single trigger"" for reimposing restrictions But he says pressure on the NHS will be the ""number one issue"" to watch And he adds another lockdown ""cannot be 100% ruled out"", although ""no one wants to see it"" Edited by Owen Amos That's all from the Covid live page today - our writers were Lauren Turner and Jen Meierhans, and the editor was Owen Amos. For the latest news and reaction from Boris Johnson's reshuffle,follow live here. We are going to end our Covid live coverage shortly - so here's a recap of the coronavirus news so far: Sweden is increasing its efforts to get more people vaccinated - with authorities warning those unvaccinated might have to cope with restrictions longer. More than 80% of Swedes over the age of 16, the age eligible for vaccines, have had one dose of vaccine. Nearly 75% are fully vaccinated. But some areas, especially low-income communities, lag behind the rest of the population. ""More efforts are needed to make vaccine coverage even higher and more equal,"" health and social affairs minister Lena Hallengren said. ""We don't want blank spots on the vaccination map in Sweden. Everyone has the right to the protection that we know that the vaccine offers."" During the pandemic, Sweden has mostly relied on voluntary measures instead of strict lockdowns. The country is to abolish almost all remaining restrictions and recommendations in two weeks. The country - which has a population of around 10m - is currently seeing around 1,000 Covid cases a day,according to Worldometers.,external The average number of Covid deaths per day has been in single figures since June. This picture, from May last year, was taken in Stockholm as Sweden embarked on a Covid policy different to most other Western nations At PMQs earlier, there was discussion of the end of the Â£20-a-week Covid uplift to universal credit, which is due next month. There were further talks on the issue in the House of Commons afterwards, with work and pensions secretary Therese Coffey saying opposition parties had ""demonised"" universal credit. She told MPs: ""Universal credit proved itself even more during the Covid pandemic, showing that it worked both by design and in delivery."" SNP communities spokesperson Patricia Gibson said: ""Talking about the impact of losing Â£20 per week for people who are already struggling and a very real impact on their lives is not a scare story."" But Ms Coffey said more people would be ""better off"" if they moved over to the system from legacy benefits - even without the Â£20 increase. Ms Coffey said the government timed the end of the uplift to match the end of the furlough scheme. ""As our economy continues to recover it is right that we are investing in jobs and skills to boost pay, prospects and prosperity for people right across the UK as part of our plan to level up and build back better,"" she said.

When the pandemic reached Singapore last year, tens of thousands of migrant workers caught Covid - and after those outbreaks,workers were mainly confined to their dormitory sites,other than when they were working. On Wednesday, a group of 100 migrant workers visited Singapore's Little India area for their first taste of freedom in more than a year, under a pilot programme to ease movement measures. It was part of a plan to allow up to 500 fully vaccinated migrant workers to visit certain public locations for six hours each week. Earlier the health secretary said he did not want to give US rapper Nicki Minaj the ""oxygen of publicity"" after she tweeted ""untruths"" about side effects of the coronavirus vaccine. Minaj told her 22m followers that when a friend of her cousin had the jab, his testicles swelled up and he became impotent. Her comments were brought up at yesterday's coronavirus briefing when Professor Whitty said Minaj ""should be ashamed"". The PM said he'd rather get information on coronavirus from Dr Nikki Kanani, NHS England's medical director of primary care, than from Nicki Minaj. Find out how BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg and Piers Morgan ending up being involved. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring The Russian government has launched a lottery in an effort
to promote its flagging vaccination campaign.  A total of 100m roubles (about Â£1m or $1.3m) is on offer,
and you only have to get the jab to enter.  According to Russian state TVâs Channel One, the first 500
winners got their prizes yesterday - 100,000 roubles each (Â£1,000) - and the second draw
will take place in a monthâs time.  The chances of winning may seem slim given that more than
42m Russians have entered the draw by getting vaccinated, but, according to
Channel One, everyone is a winner in this lottery.  ""All those citizens who have demonstrated a responsible attitude
towards their health, theyâve already received a lot,â Oksana Drapkina, who
oversees the lottery, said.  ""The most important thing they got is
health, itâs priceless.""  The lottery is the latest government initiative aimed at
promoting Covid vaccination in Russia, where state-controlled media have been
broadcasting calls for Russians to get inoculated.  However, the campaign has been hampered by widespread
scepticism. According toofficial
data,external, less than a third of Russiaâs population have been fully vaccinated
against coronavirus.  A number of other places have also combined their vaccination programmes with cash prizes. In May, the US state ofOhio announced the first $1m winner in their Vax-a-Million lottery. The vaccine lottery was covered on Russian TV's Channel One Scotland's health secretary has been warned he could put lives at risk after urging people to ""think twice"" before calling an ambulance. Earlier, Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland people should only call for an ambulance when it is ""absolutely critical"" as the country is in for ""an extraordinarily difficult winter"". Scottish Conservative public health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane described the health secretary's comments as ""astonishing"". He says: ""Humza Yousaf is making people feel guilty about dialling 999 and seeking urgent help. ""This sort of reckless messaging could put lives at risk. When people suffer conditions like heart attacks or strokes, they might think twice about calling an ambulance, which could lead to unnecessary deaths."" Other opposition politicians have also condemned Yousaf's comments. The PM's top team is being reshuffled this afternoon, Downing Street says, with an aim to have a ""strong and united team"" to recover from the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed to the BBC that the new-look cabinet is being put together today. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, are among those rumoured to be looking at new jobs. Downing Street said: ""The PM will be appointing ministers this afternoon with a focus on uniting and levelling up the whole country."" News of the reshuffle comes just after Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. Boris Johnson has mostly stuck with the same cabinet team he appointed after winning the December 2019 general election - other than appointing Rishi Sunak as chancellor in February 2020.

effective to use as a booster - but it is only being recommended for people who are
allergic to the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna).  I understand that concern about a rare blood clotting side effect is the reason
why the AZ vaccine is not being used.  The vaccine is already limited in
the UK to those over 40. And for those who have only had the AZ jab so far - several trials have shown that the Pfizer
vaccine produces a very strong antibody response, and that mixing vaccine types
can enhance immunity.  Nearly 50 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have
been given by the NHS, more than any other vaccine, and it has already
prevented tens of thousands of deaths in the UK.  Because of the
restrictions around its use for younger adults, it has been given to a higher
proportion of older adults than Pfizer - and therefore will have likely saved
more lives.  But its future use in the UK now looks very uncertain.  The AZ vaccine has been produced on a not-for-profit basis, at
around three pounds per dose, a fifth of the cost of the Pfizer vaccine. It is also easier to store and transport, making it a vital global tool in the
pandemic.  The vaccine has been licensed in more than 160 countries,
although it has not been approved in the United States, despite a successful
trial there.  All the vaccines used in the UK give significant defences against
severe Covid. But it remains unclear which will have the most lasting
protection.  The messenger RNA vaccines score best in the initial weeks
after immunisation, but their immunity wanes more quickly than the AstraZeneca
vaccine, which uses a disabled virus. So it would be wrong to completely
write off the Oxford-AZ jab as a booster.  If the vaccine is shown to give
more durable immunity, it may yet have a continuing role here.  What is certain is how important the vaccine is globally. More than 1.2 billion doses have been distributed worldwide - and that figure
should hit 2 billion by the end of the year. An alert has been sent to more than 100 councillors and bosses after someone tested positive for Covid after a full council meeting in Birmingham. All attendees have been advised to book a PCR test via the NHS - and those who have not received two jabs have been told to self-isolate for ten days. Images from the meeting at the Rep studio theatre yesterdayshow people sitting around tables and very few people wearing masks.,external A statement from the council says those present should follow the NHS advice""in light of the significant mixing that took place"".,external A curfew in the 12 Sydney suburbs hit hardest by the Delta variant is coming to an end on Wednesday night. The NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard signed off on the order on Wednesday afternoon, theSydney Morning Herald,externalreported. The curfew had been in place from 9pm to 5am. But despite meeting the ""fantastic milestone"", he said people should not drop their guard. A number of ""lockdown"" restrictions remain in place in Sydney,external, with more freedoms for people who are double-vaccinated. According to government figures, just over 80% of the NSW population aged 16 and over has now received one Covid-19 vaccine dose. And the rate for having both vaccines is now 48% - while that's higher than the national average, there is some way to go before it reaches the 70% level needed for the easing of some restrictions. Meanwhile, the state of Victoria has had a second consecutive daily fall in new cases, as its rate for first vaccine doses nears the 70% level. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford says this morning we've learned of thehighest rate of inflation for a decade, adding ""for ordinary workers and families, prices are going up at the very moment they can least afford it"". He notes the PM's Covid winter plan - but says there needs to be a ""winter action plan to fight the Tory poverty pandemic"". He asks how much theplanned welfare cutswill affect the average nurse. Mr Johnson replies the government is ""protecting people on low incomes up and down the country"" by measures like freezing fuel duty, supporting child care, the living wage and ""investing massively in health and social care"". This, he says, will help fund they increase in nurses' pay ""they so deserve"". Mr Blackford retorts that the government is in fact effectively cutting the pay of key workers - the very people the nation is relying on to face ""another difficult winter"". Mr Johnson replies the NHS is being funded across the whole of the UK ""with record sums"".  Sir Keir Starmer tells the House of Commons working people are being ""hammered"" by a new 1.25% Health and Social Care Levy, scheduled for 2022, and a Â£20 cut touniversal credit next month. He says: ""A working single parent who is a qualified nurse would lose Â£1,143, a supermarket worker could lose Â£1,093, a teaching assistant could lose Â£1,818."" Boris Johnson says: ""It is absolutely ridiculous he should attack the government over salaries for nurses when we put them up by 3% on top of the 12.8% rise that we introduced; when we are hiring 50,000 nurses; and when we're just putting another Â£36bn into the NHS and social care on top of the Â£3bn this government invested when we came into office."" The PM says 1 in 10 people are on an NHS waiting list and the NHS backlog needs to be fixed - hence why taxes are rising. We're following Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons - where leader of the opposition Sir Keir Starmer has asked about the planned end of universal credit. The Â£20 weekly rise in universal credit was brought in during the coronavirus pandemic - the government has said the uplift will be removed by October as it was always intended to be a ""temporary measure"". Starmer asks: ""How many hours a week would a single parent working full time on the minimum wage have to work to get back the Â£20 a week the prime minister plans to take away from them in his unverisal credit cuts?"" Starmer says the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffeyestimated the figure at two hours' work- but the Labour leader says it's more like nine hours. Boris Johnson says: ""Under this government for the first time in a decade wages are rising."" Coronavirus testing in Fujian Province China has fully vaccinated 91% of children aged 12-17, state television has reported. This is higher than the proportion of people fully vaccinated across all ages, which is just under 70%, according to the most recent figures. Under 12s are not yet eligible for vaccination, despite the fact the two main vaccines used in China have been approved for use in all those over the age of three. Authorities say schools still need to be vigilant, according to Reuters. There has been an outbreak in the southeastern province of Fujian, with 152 cases - including infections among unvaccinated children in primary schools and nurseries. The outbreak is centred around the cities of Putian and Xiamen, which have now suspended in-person classes at nurseries and primary schools and most face-to-face teaching at secondary schools too. State television reported that students and teachers are being asked to stay home during the forthcoming mid-autumn festival holiday next week, and a week-long holiday starting 1 October.  Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris From today, health workers in France who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid risk being suspended without pay.  It's part of a package of measures announced by President Macron last month to  coerce people into getting vaccinated.  Some 2.7 million French people are affected by the measure â not just doctors and nurses,  but staff at old people's homes, ambulance drivers, as well as hospital cooks, cleaners and administrators.  They've had until today  to get themselves vaccinated with at least one jab, and the vast majority have done so â but there's a small percentage of health workers who have said that on principle they wonât take the injection.  They now face suspension from their jobs without pay.  A nursing staff member wears a handmade mask during a protest in Lyon on Tuesday against mandatory vaccines On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced measures to deal with a posible rise in Covid cases in England over the winter - with a contingency ""Plan B"" if things get worse. Here are some of the things the plans involve: Plan A  Plan B If Plan A is not sufficient to prevent ""unsustainable pressure"" on the NHS, the government says Plan B will be required ""as a last resort"" - including:  The PM says parts of Plan B could be introduced gradually, rather than all at once -you can read up on it here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government's approach in England is clear - it's going to try to rely almost entirely on the vaccines to protect the country from Covid this winter. The winter plansays vaccines, including the rollout of boosters and jabs for children, are the Plan A. There is, however, a Plan B. This includes greater use of face coverings, Covid passports and working-from-home orders - a ""lockdown lite"" as it has been dubbed. What are the chances of avoiding this? Currently, the numbers in hospital are pretty flat, however. They have risen by only a fifth in six weeks. If this trajectory remains constant, it will certainly put hospitals under strain - but it would be hard to argue the Covid pressure was unsustainable. Infection levels could go up however. Case numbers have been bobbling around since the rapid rise stopped in mid-July. Essentially, the epidemic has been stable. That is a pretty remarkable achievement given how infectious the Delta variant is and the fact society is fully open. It suggests we are on our way out of the pandemic. But, as the prime minister and leading scientists have kept stressing this week, it is not completely over. Here's my full analysis of the chance of avoiding ""lockdown lite"". Â© 2025 BBC.

When the pandemic reached Singapore last year, tens of thousands of migrant workers caught Covid - and after those outbreaks,workers were mainly confined to their dormitory sites,other than when they were working. On Wednesday, a group of 100 migrant workers visited Singapore's Little India area for their first taste of freedom in more than a year, under a pilot programme to ease movement measures. It was part of a plan to allow up to 500 fully vaccinated migrant workers to visit certain public locations for six hours each week. Earlier the health secretary said he did not want to give US rapper Nicki Minaj the ""oxygen of publicity"" after she tweeted ""untruths"" about side effects of the coronavirus vaccine. Minaj told her 22m followers that when a friend of her cousin had the jab, his testicles swelled up and he became impotent. Her comments were brought up at yesterday's coronavirus briefing when Professor Whitty said Minaj ""should be ashamed"". The PM said he'd rather get information on coronavirus from Dr Nikki Kanani, NHS England's medical director of primary care, than from Nicki Minaj. Find out how BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg and Piers Morgan ending up being involved. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring The Russian government has launched a lottery in an effort
to promote its flagging vaccination campaign.  A total of 100m roubles (about Â£1m or $1.3m) is on offer,
and you only have to get the jab to enter.  According to Russian state TVâs Channel One, the first 500
winners got their prizes yesterday - 100,000 roubles each (Â£1,000) - and the second draw
will take place in a monthâs time.  The chances of winning may seem slim given that more than
42m Russians have entered the draw by getting vaccinated, but, according to
Channel One, everyone is a winner in this lottery.  ""All those citizens who have demonstrated a responsible attitude
towards their health, theyâve already received a lot,â Oksana Drapkina, who
oversees the lottery, said.  ""The most important thing they got is
health, itâs priceless.""  The lottery is the latest government initiative aimed at
promoting Covid vaccination in Russia, where state-controlled media have been
broadcasting calls for Russians to get inoculated.  However, the campaign has been hampered by widespread
scepticism. According toofficial
data,external, less than a third of Russiaâs population have been fully vaccinated
against coronavirus.  A number of other places have also combined their vaccination programmes with cash prizes. In May, the US state ofOhio announced the first $1m winner in their Vax-a-Million lottery. The vaccine lottery was covered on Russian TV's Channel One Scotland's health secretary has been warned he could put lives at risk after urging people to ""think twice"" before calling an ambulance. Earlier, Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland people should only call for an ambulance when it is ""absolutely critical"" as the country is in for ""an extraordinarily difficult winter"". Scottish Conservative public health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane described the health secretary's comments as ""astonishing"". He says: ""Humza Yousaf is making people feel guilty about dialling 999 and seeking urgent help. ""This sort of reckless messaging could put lives at risk. When people suffer conditions like heart attacks or strokes, they might think twice about calling an ambulance, which could lead to unnecessary deaths."" Other opposition politicians have also condemned Yousaf's comments. The PM's top team is being reshuffled this afternoon, Downing Street says, with an aim to have a ""strong and united team"" to recover from the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed to the BBC that the new-look cabinet is being put together today. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, are among those rumoured to be looking at new jobs. Downing Street said: ""The PM will be appointing ministers this afternoon with a focus on uniting and levelling up the whole country."" News of the reshuffle comes just after Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. Boris Johnson has mostly stuck with the same cabinet team he appointed after winning the December 2019 general election - other than appointing Rishi Sunak as chancellor in February 2020.

effective to use as a booster - but it is only being recommended for people who are
allergic to the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna).  I understand that concern about a rare blood clotting side effect is the reason
why the AZ vaccine is not being used.  The vaccine is already limited in
the UK to those over 40. And for those who have only had the AZ jab so far - several trials have shown that the Pfizer
vaccine produces a very strong antibody response, and that mixing vaccine types
can enhance immunity.  Nearly 50 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have
been given by the NHS, more than any other vaccine, and it has already
prevented tens of thousands of deaths in the UK.  Because of the
restrictions around its use for younger adults, it has been given to a higher
proportion of older adults than Pfizer - and therefore will have likely saved
more lives.  But its future use in the UK now looks very uncertain.  The AZ vaccine has been produced on a not-for-profit basis, at
around three pounds per dose, a fifth of the cost of the Pfizer vaccine. It is also easier to store and transport, making it a vital global tool in the
pandemic.  The vaccine has been licensed in more than 160 countries,
although it has not been approved in the United States, despite a successful
trial there.  All the vaccines used in the UK give significant defences against
severe Covid. But it remains unclear which will have the most lasting
protection.  The messenger RNA vaccines score best in the initial weeks
after immunisation, but their immunity wanes more quickly than the AstraZeneca
vaccine, which uses a disabled virus. So it would be wrong to completely
write off the Oxford-AZ jab as a booster.  If the vaccine is shown to give
more durable immunity, it may yet have a continuing role here.  What is certain is how important the vaccine is globally. More than 1.2 billion doses have been distributed worldwide - and that figure
should hit 2 billion by the end of the year. An alert has been sent to more than 100 councillors and bosses after someone tested positive for Covid after a full council meeting in Birmingham. All attendees have been advised to book a PCR test via the NHS - and those who have not received two jabs have been told to self-isolate for ten days.

The NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard signed off on the order on Wednesday afternoon, theSydney Morning Herald,externalreported. The curfew had been in place from 9pm to 5am. But despite meeting the ""fantastic milestone"", he said people should not drop their guard. A number of ""lockdown"" restrictions remain in place in Sydney,external, with more freedoms for people who are double-vaccinated. According to government figures, just over 80% of the NSW population aged 16 and over has now received one Covid-19 vaccine dose. And the rate for having both vaccines is now 48% - while that's higher than the national average, there is some way to go before it reaches the 70% level needed for the easing of some restrictions. Meanwhile, the state of Victoria has had a second consecutive daily fall in new cases, as its rate for first vaccine doses nears the 70% level. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford says this morning we've learned of thehighest rate of inflation for a decade, adding ""for ordinary workers and families, prices are going up at the very moment they can least afford it"". He notes the PM's Covid winter plan - but says there needs to be a ""winter action plan to fight the Tory poverty pandemic"". He asks how much theplanned welfare cutswill affect the average nurse. Mr Johnson replies the government is ""protecting people on low incomes up and down the country"" by measures like freezing fuel duty, supporting child care, the living wage and ""investing massively in health and social care"". This, he says, will help fund they increase in nurses' pay ""they so deserve"". Mr Blackford retorts that the government is in fact effectively cutting the pay of key workers - the very people the nation is relying on to face ""another difficult winter"". Mr Johnson replies the NHS is being funded across the whole of the UK ""with record sums"".  Sir Keir Starmer tells the House of Commons working people are being ""hammered"" by a new 1.25% Health and Social Care Levy, scheduled for 2022, and a Â£20 cut touniversal credit next month. He says: ""A working single parent who is a qualified nurse would lose Â£1,143, a supermarket worker could lose Â£1,093, a teaching assistant could lose Â£1,818."" Boris Johnson says: ""It is absolutely ridiculous he should attack the government over salaries for nurses when we put them up by 3% on top of the 12.8% rise that we introduced; when we are hiring 50,000 nurses; and when we're just putting another Â£36bn into the NHS and social care on top of the Â£3bn this government invested when we came into office."" The PM says 1 in 10 people are on an NHS waiting list and the NHS backlog needs to be fixed - hence why taxes are rising. We're following Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons - where leader of the opposition Sir Keir Starmer has asked about the planned end of universal credit. The Â£20 weekly rise in universal credit was brought in during the coronavirus pandemic - the government has said the uplift will be removed by October as it was always intended to be a ""temporary measure"". Starmer asks: ""How many hours a week would a single parent working full time on the minimum wage have to work to get back the Â£20 a week the prime minister plans to take away from them in his unverisal credit cuts?"" Starmer says the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffeyestimated the figure at two hours' work- but the Labour leader says it's more like nine hours. Boris Johnson says: ""Under this government for the first time in a decade wages are rising."" Coronavirus testing in Fujian Province China has fully vaccinated 91% of children aged 12-17, state television has reported. This is higher than the proportion of people fully vaccinated across all ages, which is just under 70%, according to the most recent figures. Under 12s are not yet eligible for vaccination, despite the fact the two main vaccines used in China have been approved for use in all those over the age of three. Authorities say schools still need to be vigilant, according to Reuters. There has been an outbreak in the southeastern province of Fujian, with 152 cases - including infections among unvaccinated children in primary schools and nurseries. The outbreak is centred around the cities of Putian and Xiamen, which have now suspended in-person classes at nurseries and primary schools and most face-to-face teaching at secondary schools too. State television reported that students and teachers are being asked to stay home during the forthcoming mid-autumn festival holiday next week, and a week-long holiday starting 1 October.  Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris From today, health workers in France who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid risk being suspended without pay.  It's part of a package of measures announced by President Macron last month to  coerce people into getting vaccinated.  Some 2.7 million French people are affected by the measure â not just doctors and nurses,  but staff at old people's homes, ambulance drivers, as well as hospital cooks, cleaners and administrators.  They've had until today  to get themselves vaccinated with at least one jab, and the vast majority have done so â but there's a small percentage of health workers who have said that on principle they wonât take the injection.  They now face suspension from their jobs without pay.  A nursing staff member wears a handmade mask during a protest in Lyon on Tuesday against mandatory vaccines On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced measures to deal with a posible rise in Covid cases in England over the winter - with a contingency ""Plan B"" if things get worse. Here are some of the things the plans involve: Plan A  Plan B If Plan A is not sufficient to prevent ""unsustainable pressure"" on the NHS, the government says Plan B will be required ""as a last resort"" - including:  The PM says parts of Plan B could be introduced gradually, rather than all at once -you can read up on it here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government's approach in England is clear - it's going to try to rely almost entirely on the vaccines to protect the country from Covid this winter. The winter plansays vaccines, including the rollout of boosters and jabs for children, are the Plan A. There is, however, a Plan B. This includes greater use of face coverings, Covid passports and working-from-home orders - a ""lockdown lite"" as it has been dubbed. What are the chances of avoiding this? Currently, the numbers in hospital are pretty flat, however. They have risen by only a fifth in six weeks. If this trajectory remains constant, it will certainly put hospitals under strain - but it would be hard to argue the Covid pressure was unsustainable. Infection levels could go up however. Case numbers have been bobbling around since the rapid rise stopped in mid-July. Essentially, the epidemic has been stable. That is a pretty remarkable achievement given how infectious the Delta variant is and the fact society is fully open. It suggests we are on our way out of the pandemic. But, as the prime minister and leading scientists have kept stressing this week, it is not completely over. Here's my full analysis of the chance of avoiding ""lockdown lite"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Price rises have seen the biggest jump since records began in 1997 as the economy continued to reopen. Official figures show that the increase in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, hit 3.2% in the year to August. Higher prices in restaurants and for recreation and food were behind the spike, up from 2% the previous month. The cost of living rose less rapidly in July because of lower clothing and footwear prices. However,the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) urged caution in reading too much into August's price increases, which it described as ""temporary"". Eating and drinking out cost more last month in comparison with August last year, when the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme was running and diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. At the same time, business owners in the hospitality and tourism sectors received a VAT discount, designed to help some of the industries worst hit by the pandemic. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""August saw the largest rise in annual inflation month-on-month since the series was introduced almost a quarter of a century ago. ""However, much of this is likely to be temporary, as last year, restaurant and cafe prices fell substantially due to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, while this year, prices rose."" In August this year, transport costs also increased. Average petrol prices stood at 134.6 pence a litre, compared with 113.1 pence a litre a year earlier, when travel was reduced under lockdown restrictions. Used car prices were also partly to blame for price rises - they increased by 4.9% in just one month. Since April, they have gone up by more than 18%amid a shortage of new models. How will price rises affect you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that price rises seen in August were ""almost unavoidable"" because of the discounts available in 2020. ""Inflation, which is a year-on-year comparison, was always going to look strong compared to last year,"" she said. ""Some of that rise reflected genuine factors too. In particular, we are now seeing the effects of higher global shipping costs and shortages of staff driving up food price inflation."" She also expects, however, that the cost of living could continue to increase rapidly, with inflation exceeding 4% by November. Diners bought more than 160 million meals under the Eat Out to Help Out scheme last August The latest official figures will add to the debate about whether interest rates need to go up to curb consumer spending and moderate prices. Inflation now exceeds the Bank of England's 2% target, aimed at keeping cost increases steady. But Capital Economics points out that inflation is likely to fall back almost as sharply next year and that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is not expected to raise interest rates until 2023. The central bank's deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, insisted in Julythat it would not stop its efforts to boost the economy, despite the forecast of higher costs. ""While we know [inflation] is going to go further over the next few months, I'm not convinced that the current inflation in retail goods prices should in and of itself mean higher inflation 18 to 24 months ahead, the horizon more relevant for monetary policy,"" he said. Most of the inflation in goods prices was down to oil price rises and supply chain issues, he said, which was likely to ""fall away"" in the early part of 2022. But given that Wednesday's latest figures breach the Bank's target, it must now write to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to explain what it will do to ensure that price prices are steady in future. Shopping bills set to rise this autumn, says BRC Inflation spike temporary, says Bank deputy 'Customers will go elsewhere and won't come back' James Lyon Shaw, who owns the Greene Oak Pub in Windsor, Berkshire, told the BBC the rise in inflation had to be taken in context and that businesses, including his own, needed to ""ride the storm"". He is paying his employees 10 to 20% more an hour compared to last year due to the wider workforce shortages. He said increases in food prices depended on where restaurants and pubs source their food, with rises in haulage and logistics costs hitting profit margins. ""We just have got to get through, you've got to be pragmatic, get on and adapt your business."" He questioned if people had enjoyed access to ""cheap food"" for too long and whether there needed to be a shift in attitudes to pay for more sustainably produced products. Yaelâ¯Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, added: ""Higher inflation will inevitably raise questions for the Bank of England on the timing of tightening monetary policy and interest rate hikes to contain inflationary risks further down the line."" She added: ""However, any tightening now risks scuppering the recovery before it has a chance to take hold, so a delay until the middle of next year is likely."" UK businesses are reporting difficultiesin sourcing goods and recruiting staff because of disruption caused by the pandemic and problems such as HGV driver shortages, exacerbated by Brexit. According to a survey of 2,000 people by Retail Economics, more than half of consumers are concerned about rising costs as a result. The market research firm said on Wednesday that worries about the cost of living had reached their highest point in more than five years. A record monthly spike in inflation, up to levels not seen for more than eight years, reflects a spluttering restart to the economy. Demand has rebounded, but the supply of goods and labour has not. In August, there were one-off factors from the discounts and support measures last year. As inflation is above 3%, the Bank of England governor has to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why. Stripping out the impact of Eat Out to Help Out last year would have meant this was not necessary. This inflation number will go higher still in the coming months because of rising home energy bills. Alongside the rise in petrol prices and frankly incredible increase in used car prices, these inflationary pressures are becoming very visible. The maths suggests that inflation could top 4% and then fall just as sharply, as long as there are no further economic shocks. Public perceptions matter significantly in regard to wage settlements for next year. While the number is high and rising, this is still consistent with a ""transitory"" post-lockdown reopening inflation spike, predicted by the central bank. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Stephen Crabb says the benefit freeze was a mistake Next month's Â£20-a-week cut in universal credit risks pushing working people into poverty, a senior Conservative MP has warned. The government says the Â£20 top-up was always a temporary measure to help people through the pandemic. But former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb says the government risks repeating the mistake it made in 2015 when it froze working age benefits. Labour is calling for the cut to be axed during a debate in the Commons. Its leader, Sir Keir Starmer, attacked the government during Prime Minister's Questions, saying it was ""clobbering working people"" with the cut, coupled withthe rise in National Insurance to cover the new health and social care tax. But Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""encourage high wages and high skills"", and the government was focused on supporting people into work with better pay. Labour plans to force a vote on the cut on Wednesday, but the result will not be binding on the government. Mr Crabb has joined a growing number of Tory MPs - including five other former work and pensions secretaries - who are against removing the Â£20 uplift. ""I was part of the team that took that decision to freeze benefits - and wages didn't go up in the way that we believed they would. Levels of poverty increased,"" he told BBC News. ""We should seek to learn the lessons of that rather than just repeat it."" The-then Chancellor George Osborne said low-paid workers would be better off despite the four-year freeze, thanks to tax changes and increases in the minimum wage. But Mr Crabb - who was Welsh Secretary at the time - said it had amounted to a ""real-terms cut"" in benefits, which had been ""a contributing factor to the rise of in-work poverty"". Coffey: Universal Credit cut is two hours extra work Why are my universal credit payments being reduced? Make universal credit top-up permanent - Tory MPs Employment reached record levels before the pandemic, but the UK also saw a significant increase in the number of households with at least one adult in paid work falling into relative poverty,according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies,external. There are 5.9 million people receiving universal credit payments across the country, according to the latest government figures - almost double the three million making claims before the pandemic. While some are seeking jobs and others are unable to work, 40% of claimants are already employed. The Resolution Foundation think tank said workers would have to put in an nine extra hours a week to make up for the loss of Â£20, once pension contributions, childcare and travel costs had been taken into account. Mr Crabb is not the only Conservative calling for the Â£20 universal credit top-up - which will disappear on 6 October - to be made permanent. West Midlands metro mayor Andy Streettold the i paper,externalhe was ""very concerned"" about the potential impact of the cut - and Amber Valley MP Nigel Mills said the government ""would be in trouble"" if there was a Commons vote on it. Opening Labour's Opposition Day debate in the Commons, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said removing the top-up would be ""the single biggest overnight cut in the history of the welfare state"", affecting one in 14 British workers. He added: ""The human cost of taking this money away cannot be overstated - Â£20 might not seem like much to some people but it's the difference between having food in the fridge and still being able to put the heating on, or being able to get their kids new school shoes without worrying how you'll pay for it."" But his government counterpart, Therese Coffey -who was criticised over comments on the cut earlier this week- said more people were getting back into work under the Conservative government, and there was ""a record number"" of vacancies for those seeking jobs. ""It was right that we took prompt and decisive action to support our nation during this challenging time,"" she added. ""[But] this was a temporary uplift recognising the financial impact of people newly unemployed so that it would be somewhat of a cushion in regards to their financial circumstances. ""As our economy continues to recover, it is right that we are investing in jobs and skills to boost pay, prospects and prosperity for people right across the UK as part of our plan to level up and build back better."" Catherine says the stereotypes about benefit claimants are false Catherine, a mature student training to be a primary school teacher, is a client of Pembrokeshire Action to Combat Hardship, a food bank in Stephen Crabb's constituency. She says the prospect of losing so much weekly income is ""quite scary"". ""Do we put the heating on, or do we put a jumper on? Can we manage to make this week's shopping to stretch a bit further?"" Catherine is in receipt of student finance as well as universal credit, as a single parent. She says the ""stereotype"" that people on benefits are not making an effort, is ""absolute rubbish"". ""I'm doing everything I can to better my prospects for myself and my family. I've paid into the system in the past I will pay into the system in the future."" The number of people claiming universal credit hasnearly doubled since the start of the pandemic,external, which Mr Crabb says undermines a key government argument for axing the Â£20 top-up. ""Almost half of people on universal credit have only known this level of benefit. The idea of this being people going back to a level of benefit they were used to - that's completely false."" He suggested that introducing the Â£20 top-up was effectively a ""recognition that the current level of working age benefits was too low"". And with 40% of people on universal credit using it to top up their wages, he feared the ""very sharp"" cut would hurt ""people who are trying to do the so-called 'right thing' by going out to work"". ""As a Conservative that is deeply problematic for me,"" the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP added. A government spokesperson said the universal credit uplift had achieved its aim of helping claimants through the ""economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic"". ""Universal credit will continue to provide vital support for those both in and out of work and it's right that the government should focus on our Plan for Jobs, supporting people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more,"" the spokesperson added.

"Stefan Sutherland's body was found 11 days after he was reported missing Police say they have found no criminality involved in the death of a man whose body was found on a Highland beach 11 days after he went missing. Stefan Sutherland died after vanishing from Lybster, in Caithness, in 2013. His family believed his death was suspicious and campaigned for a new investigation. Police Scotland's major investigation team has completed a 16-month review of the case, which involved officers speaking to more than 500 people. Mr Sutherland's sister Katrina Sutherland said she and her family were unhappy with the outcome of the review. She told BBC Radio Scotland: ""It is disappointing after a two-year investigation to come up with the same response we had seven years ago."" Ms Sutherland said a ""huge effort"" went into to securing the review. She added: ""We can only thank the people that talked to the police from the bottom of our hearts. A lot of people gave a lot of time to give police information."" Sister's plea for answers over brother's death Police visit sites linked to man's death in 2013 Mr Sutherland's disappearance on 6 September 2013 was followed by searches of the local area by police, search dogs and a mountain rescue team. His body was discovered by a member of the public on the shoreline near Occumster near Lybster. Mr Sutherland had lived in the local area. Mr Sutherland's family dispute that his death was accidental and say blood was found at a house he visited before he disappeared. Katrina Sutherland believes her brother's death was suspicious Assistant Chief Constable John Hawkins said during the review more than 200 statements were taken and officers re-interviewed witnesses spoken to in 2013. They also traced a number of new witnesses. The senior officer said: ""Stefan's death was a tragedy for his family, his friends and the close-knit Caithness community. Our sympathies remain with them all today. ""These inquiries found no evidence of criminality in relation to Stefan's death which was supported by an expert review of forensic evidence, witness testimony and all facts established during both the initial investigation in 2013 and the latest review. ''I recognise the years of campaigning by the Sutherland family, who have rightly sought answers to a number of questions surrounding Stefan's death."" Mr Hawkins said the review found that many of these questions and concerns were based on ""unsubstantiated information"" being passed to the family ""which understandably caused significant grief and worry to the Sutherland family and the local community"". Police Scotland said it would investigate any new information received.

Here is a quick round-up from the cabinet reshuffle:  For a full run down of the new cabinet, click here.  This evening there's a brand new cabinet. It's the second major reshuffle since Boris Johnson became leader of the Conservative party and took over as prime minister from Theresa May in July 2019. The last one took place in February 2020. Some of the names in the new-look government may be familiar to you - others, not so much. To help, our visual journalism team has put together a handy guide so you can see who's ended up where.

Raab said he was ""delighted"" to become justice secretary, deputy PM and Lord Chancellor. Helen CattPolitical correspondent At least we know this reshuffle is now over - the prime minister's tweet signals that. There had been expectation that Johnson would freshen up his team for a while, but the question was always when was the best time to do it. It is the Conservative Party conference in a couple of weeks and the rule of thumb in Westminster is you either go before or you have to wait until the following year. So while the reshuffle won't have come as a surprise, the scale of it might have - with wide-ranging changes and some big figures getting the sack. After a busy day of reshuffling his top team, Boris Johnson takes a brief moment to head to Twitter. And he promises the new recruits will ""work tirelessly"" in their roles. Allow Twitter content?

Kit Malthouse stays at the Home Office We have had another flurry of confirmations coming out of No 10. Kit Malthouse will remain as a Home Office minister and attend cabinet too. Former Brexit adviser Lord Frost stays at the Cabinet Office and the leader of the Tories in the House of Lords will still be Baroness Evans. Nigel Adams has also made a move from the Foreign Office to take on a ministerial job in the Cabinet Office. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post. As a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit. She will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy. Like the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: âI donât think anyone would describe me as diplomatic."" Next week, Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York. She will play a key role in the governmentâs efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair. For the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting. Former health minister Nadine Dorries has been appointed the new culture secretary, replacing Oliver Dowden. The Tory MP for Mid Bedfordshire is best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Born in Liverpool in 1957, Dorries started out as a nurse before entering politics. Outside politics she is a published author. Read more about the new culture secretary here. Boris Johnson surprised a few MPs and angered
others when he sacked Robert Buckland as justice secretary. In a letter to the PM, Buckland says it was ""the honour of a lifetime"" to serve in the role and added that he was ""very sorry"" to be leaving. In a handwritten PS at the bottom of his letter he has added: ""Please continue investing in ISVAs!!"" ISVAs are independent sexual violence advisers provide support to victims going through the criminal justice system. More now on the new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. The former trade secretary has previously spoken candidly about her diplomacy skills - telling the BBC's Nick Robinson in 2018: ""I don't think anyone describes me as a diplomat... and I'm not very diplomatic."" Truss made the admission during an interview for Robinson'sPolitical Thinking podcast, when asked about her views on the then-Brexit deal. As foreign secretary, Truss will lead the UK's diplomatic mission across the world and be responsible for maintaining and enhancing Britain's image abroad. She will also be involved in issues of national security, oversee the MI6 intelligence service, honours and Europe. The Bar Council - which represents barristers - has also drawn attention to the fact Dominic Raab will become the eighth justice secretary in just 10 years. In a statement, they praised the outgoing minister, Robert Buckland, saying they were ""grateful for his willingness, as a former practising barrister, to work
collaboratively and listen to the legal professions"". They welcomed lucky number eight, who is also a qualified lawyer, but added: ""The need for a consistent and
strong voice in government for our justice system could not be greater."" In more ministers-not-moving news, George Eustice stays on as environment secretary. Eustice - who is also a farmer - has most recently been in the headlines for his department's decisionto cull Geronimo the alpacaafter the animal tested positive for bovine tuberculosis. He said it was ""soul-destroying"" to have to put animals down but necessary. Grant Shapps, who has led the Department for Transport since 2019, remains as its secretary of state, Downing Street says. Shapps has been the face of the government's pandemic travel restrictions and is due to provide an update on the red, amber and green travel lists on Thursday. Brandon Lewis is keeping his job as Northern Ireland secretary. And there's no change for Welsh Secretary Simon Hart and Alister Jack, who keeps the job of secretary of state for Scotland.

"Liz Truss has been promoted to one of the key jobs in government Boris Johnson has fired a string of cabinet ministers - and promoted new faces to replace them - in a major reshuffle. The prime minister sacked under-fire Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and moved Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to the justice department. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel keep their jobs. But there are promotions for Liz Truss, who goes to the Foreign Office, and Nadine Dorries, who gets culture. Downing Street said the aim of the reshuffle was to ""put in place a strong and united team to build back better from the pandemic"". More moves are expected over the coming hours, as Mr Johnson seeks to fill vacant positions. Who is Dominic Raab? Nadine Dorries becomes new culture secretary Liz Truss: fast track to foreign secretary Where did it go wrong for Gavin Williamson? In addition to justice secretary and Lord Chancellor, Mr Raab has also been given the title of deputy prime minister, after what is understood to have been a lengthy and difficult conversation with the prime minister. A source denied Mr Raab was angry with the move from the Foreign Office, but he is understood to be unhappy with the way his handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan was portrayed. In other moves: Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi is promoted to education secretary Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick is fired - and replaced by Michael Gove Treasury minister Steve Barclay replaces Mr Gove as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden is given the role of minister without portfolio at the Cabinet Office Mr Dowden will also co-chair the Conservative Party, replacing Amanda Milling Simon Clarke becomes Chief Secretary to the Treasury Nick Gibb, the schools minister, leaves government after seven years The big winners from the reshuffle include Ms Dorries, a junior health minister and best-selling novelist who has never sat in the cabinet before, and Ms Truss, who moves into one of the top three jobs in government from the Department for International Trade. New Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Michael Gove will get the added responsibility of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda - spreading wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum. The way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks, ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: ""Is it on?"" People in the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. But, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. And Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet - the most significant switch coming in one of the chunkiest jobs of all. Read more from Laura Losers from the reshuffle include Mr Williamson, who has faced repeated opposition calls to quit, or be sacked, over his handling of disruption to schools and exams during the pandemic. He said he was ""proud"" of the ""transformational reforms I've led in post-16 education: in further education colleges, our skills agenda, apprenticeships and more"". Dominic Raab is no longer foreign secretary and Gavin Williamson has been sacked as education secretary by the PM For Labour, shadow education secretary Kate Green said Mr Williamson had ""failed children and young people, their parents and our hard-working education staff throughout one of the most testing periods in our history"". Robert Buckland also looks set for a return to the backbenches after being replaced by Mr Raab as justice secretary and Lord Chancellor. Nadine Dorries has been promoted to the cabinet for the first time BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said Mr Buckland was a respected figure in the legal profession, but leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: ""Appointing a failed foreign secretary who was fired for being missing in action to be the sixth justice secretary in six years shows how little this government cares about victims of crime.""

"Stephen Crabb says the benefit freeze was a mistake Next month's Â£20-a-week cut in universal credit risks pushing working people into poverty, a senior Conservative MP has warned. The government says the Â£20 top-up was always a temporary measure to help people through the pandemic. But former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb says the government risks repeating the mistake it made in 2015 when it froze working age benefits. Labour is calling for the cut to be axed during a debate in the Commons. Its leader, Sir Keir Starmer, attacked the government during Prime Minister's Questions, saying it was ""clobbering working people"" with the cut, coupled withthe rise in National Insurance to cover the new health and social care tax. But Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""encourage high wages and high skills"", and the government was focused on supporting people into work with better pay. Labour plans to force a vote on the cut on Wednesday, but the result will not be binding on the government. Mr Crabb has joined a growing number of Tory MPs - including five other former work and pensions secretaries - who are against removing the Â£20 uplift. ""I was part of the team that took that decision to freeze benefits - and wages didn't go up in the way that we believed they would. Levels of poverty increased,"" he told BBC News. ""We should seek to learn the lessons of that rather than just repeat it."" The-then Chancellor George Osborne said low-paid workers would be better off despite the four-year freeze, thanks to tax changes and increases in the minimum wage. But Mr Crabb - who was Welsh Secretary at the time - said it had amounted to a ""real-terms cut"" in benefits, which had been ""a contributing factor to the rise of in-work poverty"". Coffey: Universal Credit cut is two hours extra work Why are my universal credit payments being reduced? Make universal credit top-up permanent - Tory MPs Employment reached record levels before the pandemic, but the UK also saw a significant increase in the number of households with at least one adult in paid work falling into relative poverty,according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies,external. There are 5.9 million people receiving universal credit payments across the country, according to the latest government figures - almost double the three million making claims before the pandemic. While some are seeking jobs and others are unable to work, 40% of claimants are already employed. The Resolution Foundation think tank said workers would have to put in an nine extra hours a week to make up for the loss of Â£20, once pension contributions, childcare and travel costs had been taken into account. Mr Crabb is not the only Conservative calling for the Â£20 universal credit top-up - which will disappear on 6 October - to be made permanent. West Midlands metro mayor Andy Streettold the i paper,externalhe was ""very concerned"" about the potential impact of the cut - and Amber Valley MP Nigel Mills said the government ""would be in trouble"" if there was a Commons vote on it. Opening Labour's Opposition Day debate in the Commons, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said removing the top-up would be ""the single biggest overnight cut in the history of the welfare state"", affecting one in 14 British workers. He added: ""The human cost of taking this money away cannot be overstated - Â£20 might not seem like much to some people but it's the difference between having food in the fridge and still being able to put the heating on, or being able to get their kids new school shoes without worrying how you'll pay for it."" But his government counterpart, Therese Coffey -who was criticised over comments on the cut earlier this week- said more people were getting back into work under the Conservative government, and there was ""a record number"" of vacancies for those seeking jobs. ""It was right that we took prompt and decisive action to support our nation during this challenging time,"" she added. ""[But] this was a temporary uplift recognising the financial impact of people newly unemployed so that it would be somewhat of a cushion in regards to their financial circumstances. ""As our economy continues to recover, it is right that we are investing in jobs and skills to boost pay, prospects and prosperity for people right across the UK as part of our plan to level up and build back better."" Catherine says the stereotypes about benefit claimants are false Catherine, a mature student training to be a primary school teacher, is a client of Pembrokeshire Action to Combat Hardship, a food bank in Stephen Crabb's constituency. She says the prospect of losing so much weekly income is ""quite scary"". ""Do we put the heating on, or do we put a jumper on? Can we manage to make this week's shopping to stretch a bit further?"" Catherine is in receipt of student finance as well as universal credit, as a single parent. She says the ""stereotype"" that people on benefits are not making an effort, is ""absolute rubbish"". ""I'm doing everything I can to better my prospects for myself and my family. I've paid into the system in the past I will pay into the system in the future."" The number of people claiming universal credit hasnearly doubled since the start of the pandemic,external, which Mr Crabb says undermines a key government argument for axing the Â£20 top-up. ""Almost half of people on universal credit have only known this level of benefit. The idea of this being people going back to a level of benefit they were used to - that's completely false."" He suggested that introducing the Â£20 top-up was effectively a ""recognition that the current level of working age benefits was too low"". And with 40% of people on universal credit using it to top up their wages, he feared the ""very sharp"" cut would hurt ""people who are trying to do the so-called 'right thing' by going out to work"". ""As a Conservative that is deeply problematic for me,"" the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP added. A government spokesperson said the universal credit uplift had achieved its aim of helping claimants through the ""economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic"". ""Universal credit will continue to provide vital support for those both in and out of work and it's right that the government should focus on our Plan for Jobs, supporting people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more,"" the spokesperson added.

"Dutch former model Thysia Huisman, in red, was among those to attend the video conference A group of former models have called on French lawmakers to abolish the law which determines how long victims of sexual assault have to report to the authorities. The women claim to have been sexually assaulted or raped by their French model agents more than 20 years ago. French law says they have run out of time to start criminal proceedings. But the women have said ""rape should not have an expiration date"". The women met Senator Nathalie Goulet (pictured) Some of them travelled to Paris to give testimony at the French senate, saying ""the law needs to change"". In the meeting with Senator Nathalie Goulet, the women, including Lesa Amoore, Thysia Huisman and Laurie Marsden, called for the time given for sexual assault to be reported to authorities to be ""expanded or thrown away entirely"". Ms Goulet said she was interested in a possible French version of the New York Child Victim Act, which allowed a one-year ""look-back window"", of which old claims past their statute of limitations could be brought back. ""We have a station in the next two weeks on the justice law, so maybe it will be an opportunity to put an amendment and try to discuss this subject,"" Ms Goulet told the women. ""We all feel the same, this statute of limitations, we have to work on it."" But Ms Goulet added a note of caution to the women, saying ""but we have to be realistic. Left to right: Ebba Karlsson, Anne-Claire LeJeune and Lisa Brinkworth attended the senate hearing in Paris ""It is crystal clear that you want to change the regulations, but it will never be for the past, it will be for the future, if we are successful. ""On the other side, we have another way than criminal proceedings, we also have civil proceedings which might be easier."" The director of advocacy group The Model Alliance, Sara Ziff, told the meeting that ""unfortunately the fashion industry from 30 years ago is the same industry today"". French authorities have already begun a preliminary investigation against Gerald Marie who was one of the world's biggest model agents. Fifteen women, so far, have given statements to French authorities alleging sexual assault or rape against him. Another former model agent, Jean-Luc Brunel,who has been investigated over the sexual harassment and rape of minors,is the other man some of the women appearing at the senate have accused. Mr Brunel, who is currently on remand, has denied any wrongdoing. Laurie Marsden claims that in 1982, Marie attempted to rape her after a party. Now a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist, she says it is important to highlight the trauma victims go through before they're ready to talk to anyone. ""I have worked with trauma survivors for the last 24 years and I intend to speak about why women don't come forward and how it can take many, many years to get over the shame and fear and the overwhelming feelings that are triggered over sexual assault. ""And many people will not talk about it and will not disclose it, really because they are not psychologically capable of doing so. And that's a really important point that has not been taken into account when the laws were written."" Gerald Marie said in a statement, he ""refutes with dismay these false and defamatory allegations"". Lisa Brinkworth recorded her account of the assault on camera at the time Former BBC reporter, Lisa Brinkworth also took part in the senate discussion.She posed as a model in a documentaryfor the BBC's Donal McIntyre Investigates series in 1998. She alleges she was sexually assaulted by Gerald Marie during filming. Have you been personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

"This video can not be played Pictures from South Korea's Ministry of National Defence show the launch North and South Korea have tested ballistic missiles hours apart from each other, highlighting an arms race on the peninsula as nuclear talks with the North remain stalled. The North fired two ballistic missiles across its east coast, its first test with such missiles in six months and a fresh breach of UN resolutions. The tests came as South Korea and China discussed the North's nuclear issue. Hours later, the South tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile. The test of the missile known as SLBM was pre-planned and not in reaction to the North's latest launches. It makes South Korea the seventh country in the world with such technology. President Moon Jae-in, who attended the test, said South Korea now hadÂ ""sufficient deterrence to respond to North Korea's provocations at any time"", urging the South to continue increasing its weapons programmes to ""overwhelm North Korea's asymmetric power"". The comments were criticised by Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who described them as illogical and regrettable, warning that they could lead to a breakdown in ties, state news agency KCNA reported. In North Korea's test, the short-range missiles flew around 800km (500 miles) at a maximum altitude of 60km, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. They were launched from central inland areas of the country, and flew east towards the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, the JCS added. South Korea and the US were conducting analysis to determine which type of missile was used. The Japanese defence minister said later the missiles had landed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone. South Korean television broadcast file footage in report about the North's latest test with ballistic missiles UN resolutions ban North Korea from carrying out tests with ballistic missiles - which can carry either nuclear or conventional warheads - in efforts to curb the country's nuclear programme. ""It's extraordinary timing that you have not one but two Koreas testing ballistic missiles on the same day,"" Prof John Delury at Yonsei University told AFP news agency. ""It does speak to the fact that there's an arms race in this region."" The recent launches show North Korea has continued to develop its weapons despite a severe economic crisis. Experts say Pyongyang carries out such tests to improve its technology while trying to increase its leverage in negotiations with Washington. The US wants the country to give up its nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for sanctions relief, but the North has refused. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the North Korean launch ""outrageous"" while the US said it posed a threat to the neighbours and the international community. Earlier, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks with his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, in Seoul, and said all parties should work to promote peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. North Korea tested a long-range cruise missile last weekend Ballistic missiles are classed according to how far they can travel, the furthest of which being an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea has in the past tested ICBMs said to be capable of reaching nearly all of Western Europe and about half of the US mainland. Last weekend, Pyongyang said it tested a long-range cruise missile capable of hitting much of Japan, calling it ""a strategic weapon of great significance"". Experts say it could possibly carry a nuclear warhead. The UN Security Council does not forbid the test of cruise missiles. But it considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening because they can carry bigger and more powerful payloads, have a much longer range, and can travel faster. North Korea is facing food shortages, and has spent more than a year in isolation. It cut off most trade with its closest ally China to stop the spread of Covid-19. Last March, Pyongyang defied sanctions and tested ballistic missiles, which triggered a strong rebuke from the US, Japan and South Korea. And last month the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a ""deeply troubling"" development.

"Liz Truss has been promoted to one of the key jobs in government Boris Johnson has fired a string of cabinet ministers - and promoted new faces to replace them - in a major reshuffle.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel keep their jobs. But there are promotions for Liz Truss, who goes to the Foreign Office, and Nadine Dorries, who gets culture.

"Prices in the UK went up by 2.6% in the 12 months to November, the highest level for eight months. It means inflation has been above the Bank of England's target for two months in a row. The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and cut twice in 2024, taking rates to 4.75%. Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 but is Â£1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This virtual ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, withvinyl records and air fryersadded in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed. The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation. The main inflation measure is called theConsumer Prices Index (CPI),external, and the latest figure is published every month. CPIrose by 2.6% in the year to November 2024, up from 2.3% in the 12 months to October. The November figure is the highest rate since March 2024. This was largely as a result of increased fuel and clothing prices. Inflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years. However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly. Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine. It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of high food prices. Some parts of the economy, like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers - are still seeing significant price rises. UK inflation rise - what does it mean for me? When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high. The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more. In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises. But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy. For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. The Bank of England cut rates twice in 2024 - to 5% in August, and againto 4.75% in November. As expected,it held rates at 4.75% at its December meeting. The Bank also considersother measures,external, such as ""core inflation"" when deciding whether and how to change rates. Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.5% in November, up from 3.3% in the year to October. In October, the Bank governor Andrew Bailey said itcould be a ""bit more aggressive"" at cutting borrowing costs, if inflation remained under control. However, after the Budget at the end of that month, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained -includingan increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers- would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices. Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Baileysaid the path for rates would likely be ""downward from here"" but warned cuts would be gradual. After the December meeting, he said ""a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right"", but added ""with the heightened uncertainty in the economy, we can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year."" The next interest rate decision will be on Thursday 6 February. Will UK interest rate cut make my mortgage cheaper?

Average annual growth in pay (excluding bonuses) during the three-month period was 5.2%, up from 4.8% between July and September. This was the first increase for more than a year, and means wages are growing significantly more quickly than inflation.

The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2% in October, up from 1.7% in September. In June, the European Central Bank (ECB)cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%,the first fall in five years. It has since cut rates three times:to 3.5% in September, to 3.25% in October and to 3% in December,external. US inflation was2.7% in November, up from to 2.6% in October, as a result of higher petrol and food costs. At its September meeting,the US central bank lowered rates for the first time in four years, cutting its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points to between 4.75% and 5%. The cut was larger than many analysts had predicted. In November, the Federal Reserve announced a further cut,taking the key rate to between 4.5% and 4.75%.

Well, after all the rumours flying around the corridors of power, today we got our answers of who would stay and who would go. Here is a quick round-up from the cabinet reshuffle:  For a full run down of the new cabinet, click here.  This evening there's a brand new cabinet. It's the second major reshuffle since Boris Johnson became leader of the Conservative party and took over as prime minister from Theresa May in July 2019. The last one took place in February 2020. Some of the names in the new-look government may be familiar to you - others, not so much. To help, our visual journalism team has put together a handy guide so you can see who's ended up where. You can find ithere. Dominic Raab, who is leaving his post as foreign secretary,says it has been a ""privilege"",externalto serve in the role. He highlighted overseeing ""a merger of departments, publication of the integrated review and the UK's Indo-Pacific tilt"" as among his highlights. ""Global Britain  is a force for good in the world served by the finest cadre of diplomats & development experts,"" he said. Raab said he was ""delighted"" to become justice secretary, deputy PM and Lord Chancellor. Helen CattPolitical correspondent At least we know this reshuffle is now over - the prime minister's tweet signals that. There had been expectation that Johnson would freshen up his team for a while, but the question was always when was the best time to do it. It is the Conservative Party conference in a couple of weeks and the rule of thumb in Westminster is you either go before or you have to wait until the following year. So while the reshuffle won't have come as a surprise, the scale of it might have - with wide-ranging changes and some big figures getting the sack. After a busy day of reshuffling his top team, Boris Johnson takes a brief moment to head to Twitter. And he promises the new recruits will ""work tirelessly"" in their roles. Allow Twitter content?

James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post. As a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit. She will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy. Like the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: âI donât think anyone would describe me as diplomatic."" Next week, Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York. She will play a key role in the governmentâs efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair. For the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting. Former health minister Nadine Dorries has been appointed the new culture secretary, replacing Oliver Dowden. The Tory MP for Mid Bedfordshire is best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Born in Liverpool in 1957, Dorries started out as a nurse before entering politics. Outside politics she is a published author. Read more about the new culture secretary here. Boris Johnson surprised a few MPs and angered
others when he sacked Robert Buckland as justice secretary. In a letter to the PM, Buckland says it was ""the honour of a lifetime"" to serve in the role and added that he was ""very sorry"" to be leaving. In a handwritten PS at the bottom of his letter he has added: ""Please continue investing in ISVAs!!"" ISVAs are independent sexual violence advisers provide support to victims going through the criminal justice system. More now on the new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. The former trade secretary has previously spoken candidly about her diplomacy skills - telling the BBC's Nick Robinson in 2018: ""I don't think anyone describes me as a diplomat... and I'm not very diplomatic."" Truss made the admission during an interview for Robinson'sPolitical Thinking podcast, when asked about her views on the then-Brexit deal. As foreign secretary, Truss will lead the UK's diplomatic mission across the world and be responsible for maintaining and enhancing Britain's image abroad. She will also be involved in issues of national security, oversee the MI6 intelligence service, honours and Europe. The Bar Council - which represents barristers - has also drawn attention to the fact Dominic Raab will become the eighth justice secretary in just 10 years. In a statement, they praised the outgoing minister, Robert Buckland, saying they were ""grateful for his willingness, as a former practising barrister, to work
collaboratively and listen to the legal professions"". They welcomed lucky number eight, who is also a qualified lawyer, but added: ""The need for a consistent and
strong voice in government for our justice system could not be greater."" In more ministers-not-moving news, George Eustice stays on as environment secretary. Eustice - who is also a farmer - has most recently been in the headlines for his department's decisionto cull Geronimo the alpacaafter the animal tested positive for bovine tuberculosis. He said it was ""soul-destroying"" to have to put animals down but necessary. Grant Shapps, who has led the Department for Transport since 2019, remains as its secretary of state, Downing Street says. Shapps has been the face of the government's pandemic travel restrictions and is due to provide an update on the red, amber and green travel lists on Thursday.

"Dutch former model Thysia Huisman, in red, was among those to attend the video conference A group of former models have called on French lawmakers to abolish the law which determines how long victims of sexual assault have to report to the authorities. The women claim to have been sexually assaulted or raped by their French model agents more than 20 years ago. French law says they have run out of time to start criminal proceedings. But the women have said ""rape should not have an expiration date"". The women met Senator Nathalie Goulet (pictured) Some of them travelled to Paris to give testimony at the French senate, saying ""the law needs to change"". In the meeting with Senator Nathalie Goulet, the women, including Lesa Amoore, Thysia Huisman and Laurie Marsden, called for the time given for sexual assault to be reported to authorities to be ""expanded or thrown away entirely"". Ms Goulet said she was interested in a possible French version of the New York Child Victim Act, which allowed a one-year ""look-back window"", of which old claims past their statute of limitations could be brought back. ""We have a station in the next two weeks on the justice law, so maybe it will be an opportunity to put an amendment and try to discuss this subject,"" Ms Goulet told the women. ""We all feel the same, this statute of limitations, we have to work on it."" But Ms Goulet added a note of caution to the women, saying ""but we have to be realistic. Left to right: Ebba Karlsson, Anne-Claire LeJeune and Lisa Brinkworth attended the senate hearing in Paris ""It is crystal clear that you want to change the regulations, but it will never be for the past, it will be for the future, if we are successful. ""On the other side, we have another way than criminal proceedings, we also have civil proceedings which might be easier."" The director of advocacy group The Model Alliance, Sara Ziff, told the meeting that ""unfortunately the fashion industry from 30 years ago is the same industry today"". French authorities have already begun a preliminary investigation against Gerald Marie who was one of the world's biggest model agents. Fifteen women, so far, have given statements to French authorities alleging sexual assault or rape against him. Another former model agent, Jean-Luc Brunel,who has been investigated over the sexual harassment and rape of minors,is the other man some of the women appearing at the senate have accused. Mr Brunel, who is currently on remand, has denied any wrongdoing. Laurie Marsden claims that in 1982, Marie attempted to rape her after a party. Now a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist, she says it is important to highlight the trauma victims go through before they're ready to talk to anyone. ""I have worked with trauma survivors for the last 24 years and I intend to speak about why women don't come forward and how it can take many, many years to get over the shame and fear and the overwhelming feelings that are triggered over sexual assault. ""And many people will not talk about it and will not disclose it, really because they are not psychologically capable of doing so. And that's a really important point that has not been taken into account when the laws were written."" Gerald Marie said in a statement, he ""refutes with dismay these false and defamatory allegations"". Lisa Brinkworth recorded her account of the assault on camera at the time Former BBC reporter, Lisa Brinkworth also took part in the senate discussion.She posed as a model in a documentaryfor the BBC's Donal McIntyre Investigates series in 1998. She alleges she was sexually assaulted by Gerald Marie during filming. Have you been personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

Well, after all the rumours flying around the corridors of power, today we got our answers of who would stay and who would go. Here is a quick round-up from the cabinet reshuffle:  For a full run down of the new cabinet, click here.  This evening there's a brand new cabinet. It's the second major reshuffle since Boris Johnson became leader of the Conservative party and took over as prime minister from Theresa May in July 2019. The last one took place in February 2020. Some of the names in the new-look government may be familiar to you - others, not so much. To help, our visual journalism team has put together a handy guide so you can see who's ended up where. You can find ithere. Dominic Raab, who is leaving his post as foreign secretary,says it has been a ""privilege"",externalto serve in the role. He highlighted overseeing ""a merger of departments, publication of the integrated review and the UK's Indo-Pacific tilt"" as among his highlights. ""Global Britain  is a force for good in the world served by the finest cadre of diplomats & development experts,"" he said. Raab said he was ""delighted"" to become justice secretary, deputy PM and Lord Chancellor. Helen CattPolitical correspondent At least we know this reshuffle is now over - the prime minister's tweet signals that. There had been expectation that Johnson would freshen up his team for a while, but the question was always when was the best time to do it. It is the Conservative Party conference in a couple of weeks and the rule of thumb in Westminster is you either go before or you have to wait until the following year. So while the reshuffle won't have come as a surprise, the scale of it might have - with wide-ranging changes and some big figures getting the sack. After a busy day of reshuffling his top team, Boris Johnson takes a brief moment to head to Twitter. And he promises the new recruits will ""work tirelessly"" in their roles. Allow Twitter content?

Nigel Adams has also made a move from the Foreign Office to take on a ministerial job in the Cabinet Office. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post.

"Working from home could curb the spread of Covid during winter, Sage member Andrew Hayward says Sage says England's Covid hospital admissions could rise if restrictions are not tightened Hospitalisations could reach 2,000 to 7,000 per day next month - currently there are around 1,000, it says However the group did acknowledge a previous warning was not borne out by events Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there will be ""no single trigger"" for reimposing restrictions But he says pressure on the NHS will be the ""number one issue"" to watch And he adds another lockdown ""cannot be 100% ruled out"", although ""no one wants to see it"" Edited by Owen Amos That's all from the Covid live page today - our writers were Lauren Turner and Jen Meierhans, and the editor was Owen Amos. For the latest news and reaction from Boris Johnson's reshuffle,follow live here. We are going to end our Covid live coverage shortly - so here's a recap of the coronavirus news so far: Sweden is increasing its efforts to get more people vaccinated - with authorities warning those unvaccinated might have to cope with restrictions longer. More than 80% of Swedes over the age of 16, the age eligible for vaccines, have had one dose of vaccine. Nearly 75% are fully vaccinated. But some areas, especially low-income communities, lag behind the rest of the population. ""More efforts are needed to make vaccine coverage even higher and more equal,"" health and social affairs minister Lena Hallengren said. ""We don't want blank spots on the vaccination map in Sweden. Everyone has the right to the protection that we know that the vaccine offers."" During the pandemic, Sweden has mostly relied on voluntary measures instead of strict lockdowns. The country is to abolish almost all remaining restrictions and recommendations in two weeks. The country - which has a population of around 10m - is currently seeing around 1,000 Covid cases a day,according to Worldometers.,external The average number of Covid deaths per day has been in single figures since June. This picture, from May last year, was taken in Stockholm as Sweden embarked on a Covid policy different to most other Western nations At PMQs earlier, there was discussion of the end of the Â£20-a-week Covid uplift to universal credit, which is due next month. There were further talks on the issue in the House of Commons afterwards, with work and pensions secretary Therese Coffey saying opposition parties had ""demonised"" universal credit. She told MPs: ""Universal credit proved itself even more during the Covid pandemic, showing that it worked both by design and in delivery."" SNP communities spokesperson Patricia Gibson said: ""Talking about the impact of losing Â£20 per week for people who are already struggling and a very real impact on their lives is not a scare story."" But Ms Coffey said more people would be ""better off"" if they moved over to the system from legacy benefits - even without the Â£20 increase. Ms Coffey said the government timed the end of the uplift to match the end of the furlough scheme. ""As our economy continues to recover it is right that we are investing in jobs and skills to boost pay, prospects and prosperity for people right across the UK as part of our plan to level up and build back better,"" she said.

When the pandemic reached Singapore last year, tens of thousands of migrant workers caught Covid - and after those outbreaks,workers were mainly confined to their dormitory sites,other than when they were working. On Wednesday, a group of 100 migrant workers visited Singapore's Little India area for their first taste of freedom in more than a year, under a pilot programme to ease movement measures. It was part of a plan to allow up to 500 fully vaccinated migrant workers to visit certain public locations for six hours each week. Earlier the health secretary said he did not want to give US rapper Nicki Minaj the ""oxygen of publicity"" after she tweeted ""untruths"" about side effects of the coronavirus vaccine. Minaj told her 22m followers that when a friend of her cousin had the jab, his testicles swelled up and he became impotent. Her comments were brought up at yesterday's coronavirus briefing when Professor Whitty said Minaj ""should be ashamed"". The PM said he'd rather get information on coronavirus from Dr Nikki Kanani, NHS England's medical director of primary care, than from Nicki Minaj. Find out how BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg and Piers Morgan ending up being involved. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring The Russian government has launched a lottery in an effort
to promote its flagging vaccination campaign.  A total of 100m roubles (about Â£1m or $1.3m) is on offer,
and you only have to get the jab to enter.  According to Russian state TVâs Channel One, the first 500
winners got their prizes yesterday - 100,000 roubles each (Â£1,000) - and the second draw
will take place in a monthâs time.  The chances of winning may seem slim given that more than
42m Russians have entered the draw by getting vaccinated, but, according to
Channel One, everyone is a winner in this lottery.  ""All those citizens who have demonstrated a responsible attitude
towards their health, theyâve already received a lot,â Oksana Drapkina, who
oversees the lottery, said.  ""The most important thing they got is
health, itâs priceless.""  The lottery is the latest government initiative aimed at
promoting Covid vaccination in Russia, where state-controlled media have been
broadcasting calls for Russians to get inoculated.  However, the campaign has been hampered by widespread
scepticism. According toofficial
data,external, less than a third of Russiaâs population have been fully vaccinated
against coronavirus.  A number of other places have also combined their vaccination programmes with cash prizes. In May, the US state ofOhio announced the first $1m winner in their Vax-a-Million lottery. The vaccine lottery was covered on Russian TV's Channel One Scotland's health secretary has been warned he could put lives at risk after urging people to ""think twice"" before calling an ambulance. Earlier, Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland people should only call for an ambulance when it is ""absolutely critical"" as the country is in for ""an extraordinarily difficult winter"". Scottish Conservative public health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane described the health secretary's comments as ""astonishing"". He says: ""Humza Yousaf is making people feel guilty about dialling 999 and seeking urgent help. ""This sort of reckless messaging could put lives at risk. When people suffer conditions like heart attacks or strokes, they might think twice about calling an ambulance, which could lead to unnecessary deaths."" Other opposition politicians have also condemned Yousaf's comments. The PM's top team is being reshuffled this afternoon, Downing Street says, with an aim to have a ""strong and united team"" to recover from the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed to the BBC that the new-look cabinet is being put together today. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, are among those rumoured to be looking at new jobs. Downing Street said: ""The PM will be appointing ministers this afternoon with a focus on uniting and levelling up the whole country."" News of the reshuffle comes just after Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. Boris Johnson has mostly stuck with the same cabinet team he appointed after winning the December 2019 general election - other than appointing Rishi Sunak as chancellor in February 2020.

effective to use as a booster - but it is only being recommended for people who are
allergic to the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna).  I understand that concern about a rare blood clotting side effect is the reason
why the AZ vaccine is not being used.  The vaccine is already limited in
the UK to those over 40. And for those who have only had the AZ jab so far - several trials have shown that the Pfizer
vaccine produces a very strong antibody response, and that mixing vaccine types
can enhance immunity.  Nearly 50 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have
been given by the NHS, more than any other vaccine, and it has already
prevented tens of thousands of deaths in the UK.  Because of the
restrictions around its use for younger adults, it has been given to a higher
proportion of older adults than Pfizer - and therefore will have likely saved
more lives.  But its future use in the UK now looks very uncertain.  The AZ vaccine has been produced on a not-for-profit basis, at
around three pounds per dose, a fifth of the cost of the Pfizer vaccine. It is also easier to store and transport, making it a vital global tool in the
pandemic.  The vaccine has been licensed in more than 160 countries,
although it has not been approved in the United States, despite a successful
trial there.  All the vaccines used in the UK give significant defences against
severe Covid. But it remains unclear which will have the most lasting
protection.  The messenger RNA vaccines score best in the initial weeks
after immunisation, but their immunity wanes more quickly than the AstraZeneca
vaccine, which uses a disabled virus. So it would be wrong to completely
write off the Oxford-AZ jab as a booster.  If the vaccine is shown to give
more durable immunity, it may yet have a continuing role here.  What is certain is how important the vaccine is globally. More than 1.2 billion doses have been distributed worldwide - and that figure
should hit 2 billion by the end of the year. An alert has been sent to more than 100 councillors and bosses after someone tested positive for Covid after a full council meeting in Birmingham. All attendees have been advised to book a PCR test via the NHS - and those who have not received two jabs have been told to self-isolate for ten days. Images from the meeting at the Rep studio theatre yesterdayshow people sitting around tables and very few people wearing masks.,external A statement from the council says those present should follow the NHS advice""in light of the significant mixing that took place"".,external A curfew in the 12 Sydney suburbs hit hardest by the Delta variant is coming to an end on Wednesday night. The NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard signed off on the order on Wednesday afternoon, theSydney Morning Herald,externalreported. The curfew had been in place from 9pm to 5am. But despite meeting the ""fantastic milestone"", he said people should not drop their guard. A number of ""lockdown"" restrictions remain in place in Sydney,external, with more freedoms for people who are double-vaccinated. According to government figures, just over 80% of the NSW population aged 16 and over has now received one Covid-19 vaccine dose. And the rate for having both vaccines is now 48% - while that's higher than the national average, there is some way to go before it reaches the 70% level needed for the easing of some restrictions. Meanwhile, the state of Victoria has had a second consecutive daily fall in new cases, as its rate for first vaccine doses nears the 70% level. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford says this morning we've learned of thehighest rate of inflation for a decade, adding ""for ordinary workers and families, prices are going up at the very moment they can least afford it"". He notes the PM's Covid winter plan - but says there needs to be a ""winter action plan to fight the Tory poverty pandemic"". He asks how much theplanned welfare cutswill affect the average nurse. Mr Johnson replies the government is ""protecting people on low incomes up and down the country"" by measures like freezing fuel duty, supporting child care, the living wage and ""investing massively in health and social care"". This, he says, will help fund they increase in nurses' pay ""they so deserve"". Mr Blackford retorts that the government is in fact effectively cutting the pay of key workers - the very people the nation is relying on to face ""another difficult winter"". Mr Johnson replies the NHS is being funded across the whole of the UK ""with record sums"".  Sir Keir Starmer tells the House of Commons working people are being ""hammered"" by a new 1.25% Health and Social Care Levy, scheduled for 2022, and a Â£20 cut touniversal credit next month. He says: ""A working single parent who is a qualified nurse would lose Â£1,143, a supermarket worker could lose Â£1,093, a teaching assistant could lose Â£1,818."" Boris Johnson says: ""It is absolutely ridiculous he should attack the government over salaries for nurses when we put them up by 3% on top of the 12.8% rise that we introduced; when we are hiring 50,000 nurses; and when we're just putting another Â£36bn into the NHS and social care on top of the Â£3bn this government invested when we came into office."" The PM says 1 in 10 people are on an NHS waiting list and the NHS backlog needs to be fixed - hence why taxes are rising. We're following Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons - where leader of the opposition Sir Keir Starmer has asked about the planned end of universal credit. The Â£20 weekly rise in universal credit was brought in during the coronavirus pandemic - the government has said the uplift will be removed by October as it was always intended to be a ""temporary measure"". Starmer asks: ""How many hours a week would a single parent working full time on the minimum wage have to work to get back the Â£20 a week the prime minister plans to take away from them in his unverisal credit cuts?"" Starmer says the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffeyestimated the figure at two hours' work- but the Labour leader says it's more like nine hours. Boris Johnson says: ""Under this government for the first time in a decade wages are rising."" Coronavirus testing in Fujian Province China has fully vaccinated 91% of children aged 12-17, state television has reported. This is higher than the proportion of people fully vaccinated across all ages, which is just under 70%, according to the most recent figures. Under 12s are not yet eligible for vaccination, despite the fact the two main vaccines used in China have been approved for use in all those over the age of three. Authorities say schools still need to be vigilant, according to Reuters. There has been an outbreak in the southeastern province of Fujian, with 152 cases - including infections among unvaccinated children in primary schools and nurseries. The outbreak is centred around the cities of Putian and Xiamen, which have now suspended in-person classes at nurseries and primary schools and most face-to-face teaching at secondary schools too. State television reported that students and teachers are being asked to stay home during the forthcoming mid-autumn festival holiday next week, and a week-long holiday starting 1 October.  Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris From today, health workers in France who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid risk being suspended without pay.  It's part of a package of measures announced by President Macron last month to  coerce people into getting vaccinated.  Some 2.7 million French people are affected by the measure â not just doctors and nurses,  but staff at old people's homes, ambulance drivers, as well as hospital cooks, cleaners and administrators.  They've had until today  to get themselves vaccinated with at least one jab, and the vast majority have done so â but there's a small percentage of health workers who have said that on principle they wonât take the injection.

Kit Malthouse stays at the Home Office We have had another flurry of confirmations coming out of No 10. Kit Malthouse will remain as a Home Office minister and attend cabinet too. Former Brexit adviser Lord Frost stays at the Cabinet Office and the leader of the Tories in the House of Lords will still be Baroness Evans. Nigel Adams has also made a move from the Foreign Office to take on a ministerial job in the Cabinet Office. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post. As a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit. She will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy. Like the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: âI donât think anyone would describe me as diplomatic."" Next week, Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York. She will play a key role in the governmentâs efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair. For the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting. Former health minister Nadine Dorries has been appointed the new culture secretary, replacing Oliver Dowden. The Tory MP for Mid Bedfordshire is best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Born in Liverpool in 1957, Dorries started out as a nurse before entering politics. Outside politics she is a published author. Read more about the new culture secretary here. Boris Johnson surprised a few MPs and angered
others when he sacked Robert Buckland as justice secretary. In a letter to the PM, Buckland says it was ""the honour of a lifetime"" to serve in the role and added that he was ""very sorry"" to be leaving. In a handwritten PS at the bottom of his letter he has added: ""Please continue investing in ISVAs!!"" ISVAs are independent sexual violence advisers provide support to victims going through the criminal justice system. More now on the new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. The former trade secretary has previously spoken candidly about her diplomacy skills - telling the BBC's Nick Robinson in 2018: ""I don't think anyone describes me as a diplomat... and I'm not very diplomatic."" Truss made the admission during an interview for Robinson'sPolitical Thinking podcast, when asked about her views on the then-Brexit deal. As foreign secretary, Truss will lead the UK's diplomatic mission across the world and be responsible for maintaining and enhancing Britain's image abroad. She will also be involved in issues of national security, oversee the MI6 intelligence service, honours and Europe. The Bar Council - which represents barristers - has also drawn attention to the fact Dominic Raab will become the eighth justice secretary in just 10 years. In a statement, they praised the outgoing minister, Robert Buckland, saying they were ""grateful for his willingness, as a former practising barrister, to work
collaboratively and listen to the legal professions"". They welcomed lucky number eight, who is also a qualified lawyer, but added: ""The need for a consistent and
strong voice in government for our justice system could not be greater."" In more ministers-not-moving news, George Eustice stays on as environment secretary. Eustice - who is also a farmer - has most recently been in the headlines for his department's decisionto cull Geronimo the alpacaafter the animal tested positive for bovine tuberculosis. He said it was ""soul-destroying"" to have to put animals down but necessary. Grant Shapps, who has led the Department for Transport since 2019, remains as its secretary of state, Downing Street says. Shapps has been the face of the government's pandemic travel restrictions and is due to provide an update on the red, amber and green travel lists on Thursday. Brandon Lewis is keeping his job as Northern Ireland secretary. And there's no change for Welsh Secretary Simon Hart and Alister Jack, who keeps the job of secretary of state for Scotland. Meanwhile universities minister Michelle Donelan, policing minister Kit Malthouse, Leader of the House of Lords Baroness Evans,  Attorney General Suella Braverman and MP Simon Clarke are in Downing Street.

"Working from home could curb the spread of Covid during winter, Sage member Andrew Hayward says Sage says England's Covid hospital admissions could rise if restrictions are not tightened Hospitalisations could reach 2,000 to 7,000 per day next month - currently there are around 1,000, it says However the group did acknowledge a previous warning was not borne out by events Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there will be ""no single trigger"" for reimposing restrictions But he says pressure on the NHS will be the ""number one issue"" to watch And he adds another lockdown ""cannot be 100% ruled out"", although ""no one wants to see it"" Edited by Owen Amos That's all from the Covid live page today - our writers were Lauren Turner and Jen Meierhans, and the editor was Owen Amos. For the latest news and reaction from Boris Johnson's reshuffle,follow live here. We are going to end our Covid live coverage shortly - so here's a recap of the coronavirus news so far: Sweden is increasing its efforts to get more people vaccinated - with authorities warning those unvaccinated might have to cope with restrictions longer. More than 80% of Swedes over the age of 16, the age eligible for vaccines, have had one dose of vaccine. Nearly 75% are fully vaccinated. But some areas, especially low-income communities, lag behind the rest of the population. ""More efforts are needed to make vaccine coverage even higher and more equal,"" health and social affairs minister Lena Hallengren said. ""We don't want blank spots on the vaccination map in Sweden. Everyone has the right to the protection that we know that the vaccine offers."" During the pandemic, Sweden has mostly relied on voluntary measures instead of strict lockdowns. The country is to abolish almost all remaining restrictions and recommendations in two weeks. The country - which has a population of around 10m - is currently seeing around 1,000 Covid cases a day,according to Worldometers.,external The average number of Covid deaths per day has been in single figures since June. This picture, from May last year, was taken in Stockholm as Sweden embarked on a Covid policy different to most other Western nations At PMQs earlier, there was discussion of the end of the Â£20-a-week Covid uplift to universal credit, which is due next month. There were further talks on the issue in the House of Commons afterwards, with work and pensions secretary Therese Coffey saying opposition parties had ""demonised"" universal credit. She told MPs: ""Universal credit proved itself even more during the Covid pandemic, showing that it worked both by design and in delivery."" SNP communities spokesperson Patricia Gibson said: ""Talking about the impact of losing Â£20 per week for people who are already struggling and a very real impact on their lives is not a scare story."" But Ms Coffey said more people would be ""better off"" if they moved over to the system from legacy benefits - even without the Â£20 increase. Ms Coffey said the government timed the end of the uplift to match the end of the furlough scheme. ""As our economy continues to recover it is right that we are investing in jobs and skills to boost pay, prospects and prosperity for people right across the UK as part of our plan to level up and build back better,"" she said.

When the pandemic reached Singapore last year, tens of thousands of migrant workers caught Covid - and after those outbreaks,workers were mainly confined to their dormitory sites,other than when they were working. On Wednesday, a group of 100 migrant workers visited Singapore's Little India area for their first taste of freedom in more than a year, under a pilot programme to ease movement measures. It was part of a plan to allow up to 500 fully vaccinated migrant workers to visit certain public locations for six hours each week. Earlier the health secretary said he did not want to give US rapper Nicki Minaj the ""oxygen of publicity"" after she tweeted ""untruths"" about side effects of the coronavirus vaccine. Minaj told her 22m followers that when a friend of her cousin had the jab, his testicles swelled up and he became impotent. Her comments were brought up at yesterday's coronavirus briefing when Professor Whitty said Minaj ""should be ashamed"". The PM said he'd rather get information on coronavirus from Dr Nikki Kanani, NHS England's medical director of primary care, than from Nicki Minaj. Find out how BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg and Piers Morgan ending up being involved. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring The Russian government has launched a lottery in an effort
to promote its flagging vaccination campaign.  A total of 100m roubles (about Â£1m or $1.3m) is on offer,
and you only have to get the jab to enter.  According to Russian state TVâs Channel One, the first 500
winners got their prizes yesterday - 100,000 roubles each (Â£1,000) - and the second draw
will take place in a monthâs time.  The chances of winning may seem slim given that more than
42m Russians have entered the draw by getting vaccinated, but, according to
Channel One, everyone is a winner in this lottery.  ""All those citizens who have demonstrated a responsible attitude
towards their health, theyâve already received a lot,â Oksana Drapkina, who
oversees the lottery, said.  ""The most important thing they got is
health, itâs priceless.""  The lottery is the latest government initiative aimed at
promoting Covid vaccination in Russia, where state-controlled media have been
broadcasting calls for Russians to get inoculated.  However, the campaign has been hampered by widespread
scepticism. According toofficial
data,external, less than a third of Russiaâs population have been fully vaccinated
against coronavirus.  A number of other places have also combined their vaccination programmes with cash prizes. In May, the US state ofOhio announced the first $1m winner in their Vax-a-Million lottery. The vaccine lottery was covered on Russian TV's Channel One Scotland's health secretary has been warned he could put lives at risk after urging people to ""think twice"" before calling an ambulance. Earlier, Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland people should only call for an ambulance when it is ""absolutely critical"" as the country is in for ""an extraordinarily difficult winter"". Scottish Conservative public health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane described the health secretary's comments as ""astonishing"". He says: ""Humza Yousaf is making people feel guilty about dialling 999 and seeking urgent help. ""This sort of reckless messaging could put lives at risk. When people suffer conditions like heart attacks or strokes, they might think twice about calling an ambulance, which could lead to unnecessary deaths."" Other opposition politicians have also condemned Yousaf's comments. The PM's top team is being reshuffled this afternoon, Downing Street says, with an aim to have a ""strong and united team"" to recover from the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed to the BBC that the new-look cabinet is being put together today. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, are among those rumoured to be looking at new jobs. Downing Street said: ""The PM will be appointing ministers this afternoon with a focus on uniting and levelling up the whole country."" News of the reshuffle comes just after Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. Boris Johnson has mostly stuck with the same cabinet team he appointed after winning the December 2019 general election - other than appointing Rishi Sunak as chancellor in February 2020.

effective to use as a booster - but it is only being recommended for people who are
allergic to the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna).  I understand that concern about a rare blood clotting side effect is the reason
why the AZ vaccine is not being used.  The vaccine is already limited in
the UK to those over 40. And for those who have only had the AZ jab so far - several trials have shown that the Pfizer
vaccine produces a very strong antibody response, and that mixing vaccine types
can enhance immunity.  Nearly 50 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have
been given by the NHS, more than any other vaccine, and it has already
prevented tens of thousands of deaths in the UK.  Because of the
restrictions around its use for younger adults, it has been given to a higher
proportion of older adults than Pfizer - and therefore will have likely saved
more lives.  But its future use in the UK now looks very uncertain.  The AZ vaccine has been produced on a not-for-profit basis, at
around three pounds per dose, a fifth of the cost of the Pfizer vaccine. It is also easier to store and transport, making it a vital global tool in the
pandemic.  The vaccine has been licensed in more than 160 countries,
although it has not been approved in the United States, despite a successful
trial there.  All the vaccines used in the UK give significant defences against
severe Covid. But it remains unclear which will have the most lasting
protection.  The messenger RNA vaccines score best in the initial weeks
after immunisation, but their immunity wanes more quickly than the AstraZeneca
vaccine, which uses a disabled virus. So it would be wrong to completely
write off the Oxford-AZ jab as a booster.  If the vaccine is shown to give
more durable immunity, it may yet have a continuing role here.  What is certain is how important the vaccine is globally. More than 1.2 billion doses have been distributed worldwide - and that figure
should hit 2 billion by the end of the year. An alert has been sent to more than 100 councillors and bosses after someone tested positive for Covid after a full council meeting in Birmingham. All attendees have been advised to book a PCR test via the NHS - and those who have not received two jabs have been told to self-isolate for ten days. Images from the meeting at the Rep studio theatre yesterdayshow people sitting around tables and very few people wearing masks.,external A statement from the council says those present should follow the NHS advice""in light of the significant mixing that took place"".,external A curfew in the 12 Sydney suburbs hit hardest by the Delta variant is coming to an end on Wednesday night. The NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard signed off on the order on Wednesday afternoon, theSydney Morning Herald,externalreported. The curfew had been in place from 9pm to 5am. But despite meeting the ""fantastic milestone"", he said people should not drop their guard. A number of ""lockdown"" restrictions remain in place in Sydney,external, with more freedoms for people who are double-vaccinated. According to government figures, just over 80% of the NSW population aged 16 and over has now received one Covid-19 vaccine dose. And the rate for having both vaccines is now 48% - while that's higher than the national average, there is some way to go before it reaches the 70% level needed for the easing of some restrictions. Meanwhile, the state of Victoria has had a second consecutive daily fall in new cases, as its rate for first vaccine doses nears the 70% level. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford says this morning we've learned of thehighest rate of inflation for a decade, adding ""for ordinary workers and families, prices are going up at the very moment they can least afford it"". He notes the PM's Covid winter plan - but says there needs to be a ""winter action plan to fight the Tory poverty pandemic"". He asks how much theplanned welfare cutswill affect the average nurse. Mr Johnson replies the government is ""protecting people on low incomes up and down the country"" by measures like freezing fuel duty, supporting child care, the living wage and ""investing massively in health and social care"". This, he says, will help fund they increase in nurses' pay ""they so deserve"". Mr Blackford retorts that the government is in fact effectively cutting the pay of key workers - the very people the nation is relying on to face ""another difficult winter"". Mr Johnson replies the NHS is being funded across the whole of the UK ""with record sums"".  Sir Keir Starmer tells the House of Commons working people are being ""hammered"" by a new 1.25% Health and Social Care Levy, scheduled for 2022, and a Â£20 cut touniversal credit next month. He says: ""A working single parent who is a qualified nurse would lose Â£1,143, a supermarket worker could lose Â£1,093, a teaching assistant could lose Â£1,818."" Boris Johnson says: ""It is absolutely ridiculous he should attack the government over salaries for nurses when we put them up by 3% on top of the 12.8% rise that we introduced; when we are hiring 50,000 nurses; and when we're just putting another Â£36bn into the NHS and social care on top of the Â£3bn this government invested when we came into office."" The PM says 1 in 10 people are on an NHS waiting list and the NHS backlog needs to be fixed - hence why taxes are rising. We're following Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons - where leader of the opposition Sir Keir Starmer has asked about the planned end of universal credit. The Â£20 weekly rise in universal credit was brought in during the coronavirus pandemic - the government has said the uplift will be removed by October as it was always intended to be a ""temporary measure"". Starmer asks: ""How many hours a week would a single parent working full time on the minimum wage have to work to get back the Â£20 a week the prime minister plans to take away from them in his unverisal credit cuts?"" Starmer says the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffeyestimated the figure at two hours' work- but the Labour leader says it's more like nine hours. Boris Johnson says: ""Under this government for the first time in a decade wages are rising."" Coronavirus testing in Fujian Province China has fully vaccinated 91% of children aged 12-17, state television has reported. This is higher than the proportion of people fully vaccinated across all ages, which is just under 70%, according to the most recent figures. Under 12s are not yet eligible for vaccination, despite the fact the two main vaccines used in China have been approved for use in all those over the age of three. Authorities say schools still need to be vigilant, according to Reuters. There has been an outbreak in the southeastern province of Fujian, with 152 cases - including infections among unvaccinated children in primary schools and nurseries. The outbreak is centred around the cities of Putian and Xiamen, which have now suspended in-person classes at nurseries and primary schools and most face-to-face teaching at secondary schools too. State television reported that students and teachers are being asked to stay home during the forthcoming mid-autumn festival holiday next week, and a week-long holiday starting 1 October.

A spokesman for the PM said the three leaders would be making ""a strategic national security announcement"". We'll bring you more as soon as we can.

Kit Malthouse stays at the Home Office We have had another flurry of confirmations coming out of No 10. Kit Malthouse will remain as a Home Office minister and attend cabinet too. Former Brexit adviser Lord Frost stays at the Cabinet Office and the leader of the Tories in the House of Lords will still be Baroness Evans. Nigel Adams has also made a move from the Foreign Office to take on a ministerial job in the Cabinet Office. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post. As a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit. She will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy. Like the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: âI donât think anyone would describe me as diplomatic."" Next week, Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York. She will play a key role in the governmentâs efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair. For the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting. Former health minister Nadine Dorries has been appointed the new culture secretary, replacing Oliver Dowden. The Tory MP for Mid Bedfordshire is best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Born in Liverpool in 1957, Dorries started out as a nurse before entering politics. Outside politics she is a published author. Read more about the new culture secretary here. Boris Johnson surprised a few MPs and angered
others when he sacked Robert Buckland as justice secretary. In a letter to the PM, Buckland says it was ""the honour of a lifetime"" to serve in the role and added that he was ""very sorry"" to be leaving. In a handwritten PS at the bottom of his letter he has added: ""Please continue investing in ISVAs!!"" ISVAs are independent sexual violence advisers provide support to victims going through the criminal justice system. More now on the new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. The former trade secretary has previously spoken candidly about her diplomacy skills - telling the BBC's Nick Robinson in 2018: ""I don't think anyone describes me as a diplomat... and I'm not very diplomatic."" Truss made the admission during an interview for Robinson'sPolitical Thinking podcast, when asked about her views on the then-Brexit deal. As foreign secretary, Truss will lead the UK's diplomatic mission across the world and be responsible for maintaining and enhancing Britain's image abroad. She will also be involved in issues of national security, oversee the MI6 intelligence service, honours and Europe. The Bar Council - which represents barristers - has also drawn attention to the fact Dominic Raab will become the eighth justice secretary in just 10 years. In a statement, they praised the outgoing minister, Robert Buckland, saying they were ""grateful for his willingness, as a former practising barrister, to work
collaboratively and listen to the legal professions"". They welcomed lucky number eight, who is also a qualified lawyer, but added: ""The need for a consistent and
strong voice in government for our justice system could not be greater."" In more ministers-not-moving news, George Eustice stays on as environment secretary. Eustice - who is also a farmer - has most recently been in the headlines for his department's decisionto cull Geronimo the alpacaafter the animal tested positive for bovine tuberculosis. He said it was ""soul-destroying"" to have to put animals down but necessary. Grant Shapps, who has led the Department for Transport since 2019, remains as its secretary of state, Downing Street says. Shapps has been the face of the government's pandemic travel restrictions and is due to provide an update on the red, amber and green travel lists on Thursday. Brandon Lewis is keeping his job as Northern Ireland secretary. And there's no change for Welsh Secretary Simon Hart and Alister Jack, who keeps the job of secretary of state for Scotland. Meanwhile universities minister Michelle Donelan, policing minister Kit Malthouse, Leader of the House of Lords Baroness Evans,  Attorney General Suella Braverman and MP Simon Clarke are in Downing Street.

Well, after all the rumours flying around the corridors of power, today we got our answers of who would stay and who would go. Here is a quick round-up from the cabinet reshuffle:  For a full run down of the new cabinet, click here.  This evening there's a brand new cabinet. It's the second major reshuffle since Boris Johnson became leader of the Conservative party and took over as prime minister from Theresa May in July 2019. The last one took place in February 2020. Some of the names in the new-look government may be familiar to you - others, not so much. To help, our visual journalism team has put together a handy guide so you can see who's ended up where. You can find ithere. Dominic Raab, who is leaving his post as foreign secretary,says it has been a ""privilege"",externalto serve in the role. He highlighted overseeing ""a merger of departments, publication of the integrated review and the UK's Indo-Pacific tilt"" as among his highlights. ""Global Britain  is a force for good in the world served by the finest cadre of diplomats & development experts,"" he said. Raab said he was ""delighted"" to become justice secretary, deputy PM and Lord Chancellor. Helen CattPolitical correspondent At least we know this reshuffle is now over - the prime minister's tweet signals that. There had been expectation that Johnson would freshen up his team for a while, but the question was always when was the best time to do it. It is the Conservative Party conference in a couple of weeks and the rule of thumb in Westminster is you either go before or you have to wait until the following year. So while the reshuffle won't have come as a surprise, the scale of it might have - with wide-ranging changes and some big figures getting the sack. After a busy day of reshuffling his top team, Boris Johnson takes a brief moment to head to Twitter. And he promises the new recruits will ""work tirelessly"" in their roles. Allow Twitter content?

"Dutch former model Thysia Huisman, in red, was among those to attend the video conference A group of former models have called on French lawmakers to abolish the law which determines how long victims of sexual assault have to report to the authorities. The women claim to have been sexually assaulted or raped by their French model agents more than 20 years ago. French law says they have run out of time to start criminal proceedings. But the women have said ""rape should not have an expiration date"". The women met Senator Nathalie Goulet (pictured) Some of them travelled to Paris to give testimony at the French senate, saying ""the law needs to change"". In the meeting with Senator Nathalie Goulet, the women, including Lesa Amoore, Thysia Huisman and Laurie Marsden, called for the time given for sexual assault to be reported to authorities to be ""expanded or thrown away entirely"". Ms Goulet said she was interested in a possible French version of the New York Child Victim Act, which allowed a one-year ""look-back window"", of which old claims past their statute of limitations could be brought back. ""We have a station in the next two weeks on the justice law, so maybe it will be an opportunity to put an amendment and try to discuss this subject,"" Ms Goulet told the women. ""We all feel the same, this statute of limitations, we have to work on it."" But Ms Goulet added a note of caution to the women, saying ""but we have to be realistic. Left to right: Ebba Karlsson, Anne-Claire LeJeune and Lisa Brinkworth attended the senate hearing in Paris ""It is crystal clear that you want to change the regulations, but it will never be for the past, it will be for the future, if we are successful. ""On the other side, we have another way than criminal proceedings, we also have civil proceedings which might be easier."" The director of advocacy group The Model Alliance, Sara Ziff, told the meeting that ""unfortunately the fashion industry from 30 years ago is the same industry today"". French authorities have already begun a preliminary investigation against Gerald Marie who was one of the world's biggest model agents. Fifteen women, so far, have given statements to French authorities alleging sexual assault or rape against him. Another former model agent, Jean-Luc Brunel,who has been investigated over the sexual harassment and rape of minors,is the other man some of the women appearing at the senate have accused. Mr Brunel, who is currently on remand, has denied any wrongdoing. Laurie Marsden claims that in 1982, Marie attempted to rape her after a party. Now a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist, she says it is important to highlight the trauma victims go through before they're ready to talk to anyone. ""I have worked with trauma survivors for the last 24 years and I intend to speak about why women don't come forward and how it can take many, many years to get over the shame and fear and the overwhelming feelings that are triggered over sexual assault. ""And many people will not talk about it and will not disclose it, really because they are not psychologically capable of doing so. And that's a really important point that has not been taken into account when the laws were written."" Gerald Marie said in a statement, he ""refutes with dismay these false and defamatory allegations"". Lisa Brinkworth recorded her account of the assault on camera at the time Former BBC reporter, Lisa Brinkworth also took part in the senate discussion.She posed as a model in a documentaryfor the BBC's Donal McIntyre Investigates series in 1998. She alleges she was sexually assaulted by Gerald Marie during filming. Have you been personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

"This video can not be played Pictures from South Korea's Ministry of National Defence show the launch North and South Korea have tested ballistic missiles hours apart from each other, highlighting an arms race on the peninsula as nuclear talks with the North remain stalled. The North fired two ballistic missiles across its east coast, its first test with such missiles in six months and a fresh breach of UN resolutions. The tests came as South Korea and China discussed the North's nuclear issue. Hours later, the South tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile. The test of the missile known as SLBM was pre-planned and not in reaction to the North's latest launches. It makes South Korea the seventh country in the world with such technology. President Moon Jae-in, who attended the test, said South Korea now hadÂ ""sufficient deterrence to respond to North Korea's provocations at any time"", urging the South to continue increasing its weapons programmes to ""overwhelm North Korea's asymmetric power"". The comments were criticised by Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who described them as illogical and regrettable, warning that they could lead to a breakdown in ties, state news agency KCNA reported. In North Korea's test, the short-range missiles flew around 800km (500 miles) at a maximum altitude of 60km, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. They were launched from central inland areas of the country, and flew east towards the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, the JCS added. South Korea and the US were conducting analysis to determine which type of missile was used. The Japanese defence minister said later the missiles had landed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone. South Korean television broadcast file footage in report about the North's latest test with ballistic missiles UN resolutions ban North Korea from carrying out tests with ballistic missiles - which can carry either nuclear or conventional warheads - in efforts to curb the country's nuclear programme. ""It's extraordinary timing that you have not one but two Koreas testing ballistic missiles on the same day,"" Prof John Delury at Yonsei University told AFP news agency. ""It does speak to the fact that there's an arms race in this region."" The recent launches show North Korea has continued to develop its weapons despite a severe economic crisis. Experts say Pyongyang carries out such tests to improve its technology while trying to increase its leverage in negotiations with Washington. The US wants the country to give up its nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for sanctions relief, but the North has refused. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the North Korean launch ""outrageous"" while the US said it posed a threat to the neighbours and the international community. Earlier, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks with his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, in Seoul, and said all parties should work to promote peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. North Korea tested a long-range cruise missile last weekend Ballistic missiles are classed according to how far they can travel, the furthest of which being an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea has in the past tested ICBMs said to be capable of reaching nearly all of Western Europe and about half of the US mainland. Last weekend, Pyongyang said it tested a long-range cruise missile capable of hitting much of Japan, calling it ""a strategic weapon of great significance"". Experts say it could possibly carry a nuclear warhead. The UN Security Council does not forbid the test of cruise missiles. But it considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening because they can carry bigger and more powerful payloads, have a much longer range, and can travel faster. North Korea is facing food shortages, and has spent more than a year in isolation. It cut off most trade with its closest ally China to stop the spread of Covid-19. Last March, Pyongyang defied sanctions and tested ballistic missiles, which triggered a strong rebuke from the US, Japan and South Korea. And last month the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a ""deeply troubling"" development.

"Working from home could curb the spread of Covid during winter, Sage member Andrew Hayward says Sage says England's Covid hospital admissions could rise if restrictions are not tightened Hospitalisations could reach 2,000 to 7,000 per day next month - currently there are around 1,000, it says However the group did acknowledge a previous warning was not borne out by events Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there will be ""no single trigger"" for reimposing restrictions But he says pressure on the NHS will be the ""number one issue"" to watch And he adds another lockdown ""cannot be 100% ruled out"", although ""no one wants to see it"" Edited by Owen Amos That's all from the Covid live page today - our writers were Lauren Turner and Jen Meierhans, and the editor was Owen Amos. For the latest news and reaction from Boris Johnson's reshuffle,follow live here. We are going to end our Covid live coverage shortly - so here's a recap of the coronavirus news so far: Sweden is increasing its efforts to get more people vaccinated - with authorities warning those unvaccinated might have to cope with restrictions longer. More than 80% of Swedes over the age of 16, the age eligible for vaccines, have had one dose of vaccine. Nearly 75% are fully vaccinated. But some areas, especially low-income communities, lag behind the rest of the population. ""More efforts are needed to make vaccine coverage even higher and more equal,"" health and social affairs minister Lena Hallengren said. ""We don't want blank spots on the vaccination map in Sweden. Everyone has the right to the protection that we know that the vaccine offers."" During the pandemic, Sweden has mostly relied on voluntary measures instead of strict lockdowns. The country is to abolish almost all remaining restrictions and recommendations in two weeks. The country - which has a population of around 10m - is currently seeing around 1,000 Covid cases a day,according to Worldometers.,external The average number of Covid deaths per day has been in single figures since June. This picture, from May last year, was taken in Stockholm as Sweden embarked on a Covid policy different to most other Western nations At PMQs earlier, there was discussion of the end of the Â£20-a-week Covid uplift to universal credit, which is due next month. There were further talks on the issue in the House of Commons afterwards, with work and pensions secretary Therese Coffey saying opposition parties had ""demonised"" universal credit. She told MPs: ""Universal credit proved itself even more during the Covid pandemic, showing that it worked both by design and in delivery."" SNP communities spokesperson Patricia Gibson said: ""Talking about the impact of losing Â£20 per week for people who are already struggling and a very real impact on their lives is not a scare story."" But Ms Coffey said more people would be ""better off"" if they moved over to the system from legacy benefits - even without the Â£20 increase. Ms Coffey said the government timed the end of the uplift to match the end of the furlough scheme. ""As our economy continues to recover it is right that we are investing in jobs and skills to boost pay, prospects and prosperity for people right across the UK as part of our plan to level up and build back better,"" she said.

When the pandemic reached Singapore last year, tens of thousands of migrant workers caught Covid - and after those outbreaks,workers were mainly confined to their dormitory sites,other than when they were working. On Wednesday, a group of 100 migrant workers visited Singapore's Little India area for their first taste of freedom in more than a year, under a pilot programme to ease movement measures. It was part of a plan to allow up to 500 fully vaccinated migrant workers to visit certain public locations for six hours each week. Earlier the health secretary said he did not want to give US rapper Nicki Minaj the ""oxygen of publicity"" after she tweeted ""untruths"" about side effects of the coronavirus vaccine. Minaj told her 22m followers that when a friend of her cousin had the jab, his testicles swelled up and he became impotent. Her comments were brought up at yesterday's coronavirus briefing when Professor Whitty said Minaj ""should be ashamed"". The PM said he'd rather get information on coronavirus from Dr Nikki Kanani, NHS England's medical director of primary care, than from Nicki Minaj. Find out how BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg and Piers Morgan ending up being involved. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring The Russian government has launched a lottery in an effort
to promote its flagging vaccination campaign.  A total of 100m roubles (about Â£1m or $1.3m) is on offer,
and you only have to get the jab to enter.  According to Russian state TVâs Channel One, the first 500
winners got their prizes yesterday - 100,000 roubles each (Â£1,000) - and the second draw
will take place in a monthâs time.  The chances of winning may seem slim given that more than
42m Russians have entered the draw by getting vaccinated, but, according to
Channel One, everyone is a winner in this lottery.  ""All those citizens who have demonstrated a responsible attitude
towards their health, theyâve already received a lot,â Oksana Drapkina, who
oversees the lottery, said.  ""The most important thing they got is
health, itâs priceless.""  The lottery is the latest government initiative aimed at
promoting Covid vaccination in Russia, where state-controlled media have been
broadcasting calls for Russians to get inoculated.  However, the campaign has been hampered by widespread
scepticism. According toofficial
data,external, less than a third of Russiaâs population have been fully vaccinated
against coronavirus.  A number of other places have also combined their vaccination programmes with cash prizes. In May, the US state ofOhio announced the first $1m winner in their Vax-a-Million lottery. The vaccine lottery was covered on Russian TV's Channel One Scotland's health secretary has been warned he could put lives at risk after urging people to ""think twice"" before calling an ambulance. Earlier, Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland people should only call for an ambulance when it is ""absolutely critical"" as the country is in for ""an extraordinarily difficult winter"". Scottish Conservative public health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane described the health secretary's comments as ""astonishing"". He says: ""Humza Yousaf is making people feel guilty about dialling 999 and seeking urgent help. ""This sort of reckless messaging could put lives at risk. When people suffer conditions like heart attacks or strokes, they might think twice about calling an ambulance, which could lead to unnecessary deaths."" Other opposition politicians have also condemned Yousaf's comments. The PM's top team is being reshuffled this afternoon, Downing Street says, with an aim to have a ""strong and united team"" to recover from the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed to the BBC that the new-look cabinet is being put together today. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, are among those rumoured to be looking at new jobs. Downing Street said: ""The PM will be appointing ministers this afternoon with a focus on uniting and levelling up the whole country."" News of the reshuffle comes just after Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. Boris Johnson has mostly stuck with the same cabinet team he appointed after winning the December 2019 general election - other than appointing Rishi Sunak as chancellor in February 2020.

effective to use as a booster - but it is only being recommended for people who are
allergic to the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna).  I understand that concern about a rare blood clotting side effect is the reason
why the AZ vaccine is not being used.  The vaccine is already limited in
the UK to those over 40. And for those who have only had the AZ jab so far - several trials have shown that the Pfizer
vaccine produces a very strong antibody response, and that mixing vaccine types
can enhance immunity.  Nearly 50 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have
been given by the NHS, more than any other vaccine, and it has already
prevented tens of thousands of deaths in the UK.  Because of the
restrictions around its use for younger adults, it has been given to a higher
proportion of older adults than Pfizer - and therefore will have likely saved
more lives.  But its future use in the UK now looks very uncertain.  The AZ vaccine has been produced on a not-for-profit basis, at
around three pounds per dose, a fifth of the cost of the Pfizer vaccine. It is also easier to store and transport, making it a vital global tool in the
pandemic.  The vaccine has been licensed in more than 160 countries,
although it has not been approved in the United States, despite a successful
trial there.  All the vaccines used in the UK give significant defences against
severe Covid. But it remains unclear which will have the most lasting
protection.  The messenger RNA vaccines score best in the initial weeks
after immunisation, but their immunity wanes more quickly than the AstraZeneca
vaccine, which uses a disabled virus. So it would be wrong to completely
write off the Oxford-AZ jab as a booster.  If the vaccine is shown to give
more durable immunity, it may yet have a continuing role here.  What is certain is how important the vaccine is globally. More than 1.2 billion doses have been distributed worldwide - and that figure
should hit 2 billion by the end of the year. An alert has been sent to more than 100 councillors and bosses after someone tested positive for Covid after a full council meeting in Birmingham. All attendees have been advised to book a PCR test via the NHS - and those who have not received two jabs have been told to self-isolate for ten days. Images from the meeting at the Rep studio theatre yesterdayshow people sitting around tables and very few people wearing masks.,external A statement from the council says those present should follow the NHS advice""in light of the significant mixing that took place"".,external A curfew in the 12 Sydney suburbs hit hardest by the Delta variant is coming to an end on Wednesday night. The NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard signed off on the order on Wednesday afternoon, theSydney Morning Herald,externalreported. The curfew had been in place from 9pm to 5am. But despite meeting the ""fantastic milestone"", he said people should not drop their guard. A number of ""lockdown"" restrictions remain in place in Sydney,external, with more freedoms for people who are double-vaccinated. According to government figures, just over 80% of the NSW population aged 16 and over has now received one Covid-19 vaccine dose. And the rate for having both vaccines is now 48% - while that's higher than the national average, there is some way to go before it reaches the 70% level needed for the easing of some restrictions. Meanwhile, the state of Victoria has had a second consecutive daily fall in new cases, as its rate for first vaccine doses nears the 70% level. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford says this morning we've learned of thehighest rate of inflation for a decade, adding ""for ordinary workers and families, prices are going up at the very moment they can least afford it"". He notes the PM's Covid winter plan - but says there needs to be a ""winter action plan to fight the Tory poverty pandemic"". He asks how much theplanned welfare cutswill affect the average nurse. Mr Johnson replies the government is ""protecting people on low incomes up and down the country"" by measures like freezing fuel duty, supporting child care, the living wage and ""investing massively in health and social care"". This, he says, will help fund they increase in nurses' pay ""they so deserve"". Mr Blackford retorts that the government is in fact effectively cutting the pay of key workers - the very people the nation is relying on to face ""another difficult winter"". Mr Johnson replies the NHS is being funded across the whole of the UK ""with record sums"".  Sir Keir Starmer tells the House of Commons working people are being ""hammered"" by a new 1.25% Health and Social Care Levy, scheduled for 2022, and a Â£20 cut touniversal credit next month. He says: ""A working single parent who is a qualified nurse would lose Â£1,143, a supermarket worker could lose Â£1,093, a teaching assistant could lose Â£1,818."" Boris Johnson says: ""It is absolutely ridiculous he should attack the government over salaries for nurses when we put them up by 3% on top of the 12.8% rise that we introduced; when we are hiring 50,000 nurses; and when we're just putting another Â£36bn into the NHS and social care on top of the Â£3bn this government invested when we came into office."" The PM says 1 in 10 people are on an NHS waiting list and the NHS backlog needs to be fixed - hence why taxes are rising. We're following Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons - where leader of the opposition Sir Keir Starmer has asked about the planned end of universal credit. The Â£20 weekly rise in universal credit was brought in during the coronavirus pandemic - the government has said the uplift will be removed by October as it was always intended to be a ""temporary measure"". Starmer asks: ""How many hours a week would a single parent working full time on the minimum wage have to work to get back the Â£20 a week the prime minister plans to take away from them in his unverisal credit cuts?"" Starmer says the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffeyestimated the figure at two hours' work- but the Labour leader says it's more like nine hours. Boris Johnson says: ""Under this government for the first time in a decade wages are rising."" Coronavirus testing in Fujian Province China has fully vaccinated 91% of children aged 12-17, state television has reported. This is higher than the proportion of people fully vaccinated across all ages, which is just under 70%, according to the most recent figures. Under 12s are not yet eligible for vaccination, despite the fact the two main vaccines used in China have been approved for use in all those over the age of three. Authorities say schools still need to be vigilant, according to Reuters. There has been an outbreak in the southeastern province of Fujian, with 152 cases - including infections among unvaccinated children in primary schools and nurseries. The outbreak is centred around the cities of Putian and Xiamen, which have now suspended in-person classes at nurseries and primary schools and most face-to-face teaching at secondary schools too. State television reported that students and teachers are being asked to stay home during the forthcoming mid-autumn festival holiday next week, and a week-long holiday starting 1 October.  Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris From today, health workers in France who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid risk being suspended without pay.  It's part of a package of measures announced by President Macron last month to  coerce people into getting vaccinated.  Some 2.7 million French people are affected by the measure â not just doctors and nurses,  but staff at old people's homes, ambulance drivers, as well as hospital cooks, cleaners and administrators.  They've had until today  to get themselves vaccinated with at least one jab, and the vast majority have done so â but there's a small percentage of health workers who have said that on principle they wonât take the injection.  They now face suspension from their jobs without pay.  A nursing staff member wears a handmade mask during a protest in Lyon on Tuesday against mandatory vaccines On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced measures to deal with a posible rise in Covid cases in England over the winter - with a contingency ""Plan B"" if things get worse. Here are some of the things the plans involve: Plan A  Plan B If Plan A is not sufficient to prevent ""unsustainable pressure"" on the NHS, the government says Plan B will be required ""as a last resort"" - including:  The PM says parts of Plan B could be introduced gradually, rather than all at once -you can read up on it here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government's approach in England is clear - it's going to try to rely almost entirely on the vaccines to protect the country from Covid this winter. The winter plansays vaccines, including the rollout of boosters and jabs for children, are the Plan A. There is, however, a Plan B. This includes greater use of face coverings, Covid passports and working-from-home orders - a ""lockdown lite"" as it has been dubbed. What are the chances of avoiding this? Currently, the numbers in hospital are pretty flat, however. They have risen by only a fifth in six weeks. If this trajectory remains constant, it will certainly put hospitals under strain - but it would be hard to argue the Covid pressure was unsustainable. Infection levels could go up however. Case numbers have been bobbling around since the rapid rise stopped in mid-July. Essentially, the epidemic has been stable. That is a pretty remarkable achievement given how infectious the Delta variant is and the fact society is fully open. It suggests we are on our way out of the pandemic. But, as the prime minister and leading scientists have kept stressing this week, it is not completely over. Here's my full analysis of the chance of avoiding ""lockdown lite"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Four 'amateur astronauts' launched into orbit by SpaceX Four amateur astronauts have blasted off from Florida on their private mission to orbit. TheInspiration4,externalcrew, comprising one billionaire and three ""ordinary citizens"", rode out of the Kennedy Space Center in a Dragon capsule provided by the SpaceX rocket company. The quartet will spend the next three days circling the Earth. It's another milestone in the space tourism market, which is experiencing a resurgence after a decade's hiatus. Earlier this summer, billionaire businessmenSir Richard BransonandJeff Bezoswent above Earth's atmosphere in their own space vehicles. And following this latest mission, there'll be three privateer visits to the International Space Station (ISS) - one in October, carrying a Russian movie director and an actress, and two either side of the New Year. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon? Cancer survivor joins historic space mission Billionaire Branson rockets to the edge of space Mr Isaacman (nearest) shouted ""Punch it, SpaceX!"" moments before launch The Inspiration4 crew of Jared Issacman, Hayley Arceneaux, Sian Proctor and Chris Sembroski have had six months of intensive training with SpaceX. However, onboard computer systems will be in control of their Dragon capsule, overseen by SpaceX teams on the ground. The Dragon is not going anywhere near the ISS. It's on a ""free flight"" to a target altitude of 575km (360 miles). That's about 150km above the orbiting laboratory, and roughly the height from where the Hubble Space Telescope views the cosmos. (L-R) Sembroski, Proctor, Isaacman and Arceneaux trained for six months Even if they don't have a destination as such, the foursome will have plenty to keep them occupied. They've taken up scientific experiments to be conducted inside their Dragon capsule, and SpaceX has modified their temporary home to include a big window, which the crew is sure to be using during downtime to wonder at the Earth below. The Inspiration4 venture was purchased from SpaceX by Mr Isaacman, 38, who made his fortune developing systems to process credit card payments. But rather than go on an ""outing with fishing buddies"", he decided, as he saw it, to inject real purpose into the flight. So, he gifted the three adjacent seats to people with inspirational stories. Fans of Haley Arceneaux turned out to watch the flight go up This is perhaps best illustrated in 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. She overcame bone cancer as a child and as an adult has gone back to work for the medical facility that cured her - theSt Jude Children's Research Hospital,externalin Memphis, Tennessee. Mr Isaacman wants to raise $200m for St Jude's work. Haley Arceneaux was treated for cancer at St Jude as a 10 year-old Dr Sian Proctor, 51, is a geoscientist and science communicator. She actually came close to being a Nasa astronaut in 2009 but missed out in the final round of selection. Dr Proctor won her seat through her role as an artist and by demonstrating her entrepreneurial skills. She plans to paint while looking out the Dragon's domed window. Chris Sembroski, 42, is a US Air Force veteran and works as an engineer with aerospace company Lockheed Martin. He'd made a donation to St Jude that also entered him into a lottery draw for the fourth position in the crew. Mr Sembroski didn't win the lottery - but a friend did, and asked him to take the place. The Dragon capsule and its Falcon rocket head out over the Atlantic Ocean SpaceX and Inspiration4 have described Wednesday's launch as the first ""all-civilian mission to orbit"". That depends very much on your definition of ""civilian"". The first man to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, was technically a civilian, having resigned his Navy commission in 1960, nine years before Apollo 11. The big window during development at SpaceX Artwork: The glass dome should provide stunning views But there's no doubting the Dragon flight commanded by Mr Isaacman has significance. Space activity - even human spaceflight - is becoming ever more commercial, and the idea that people can go to orbit outside of the purview of the major national space agencies will increasingly look normal. The 2000s saw several super-wealthy individuals spend a fortnight on the ISS. That particular era of space tourism ended in 2009 when spare seats on Russian rockets were bought up for the exclusive use of Nasa astronauts. But this second era looks as though it will be more resilient, simply because there are many more private space companies chasing the business, and this should bring down prices for a wider pool of customers. Elon Musk's vision is for humans to be living on Mars Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, is intent on making humans ""a multi-planet species"". And Mr Isaacman regards Inspiration4 as a signpost of where things are going. He was very keen that his Dragon go higher than astronauts usually go. And not since the final shuttle servicing mission of Hubble in 2009 have people been to an altitude above 570km. ""We've been going to the space station (420km) for some time, and there's just unbelievable science and research and great contributions that are coming out of there. But if we're going to go to the Moon again, and we're going to go to Mars and beyond, we've got to get a little outside of our comfort zone and take that next step in that direction,"" he said before launch. ""So that was really the rationale (for our choice of altitude)."" Some commentators have voiced concern about the collective impact on the Earth's climate of spaceflights like this one. SpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket uses highly refined kerosene fuel which produces the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (COâ), along with nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to warming. Emissions from rocket launches remain tiny compared with the aviation industry, though they are projected to grow.

"Price rises have seen the biggest jump since records began in 1997 as the economy continued to reopen. Official figures show that the increase in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, hit 3.2% in the year to August. Higher prices in restaurants and for recreation and food were behind the spike, up from 2% the previous month. The cost of living rose less rapidly in July because of lower clothing and footwear prices. However,the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) urged caution in reading too much into August's price increases, which it described as ""temporary"". Eating and drinking out cost more last month in comparison with August last year, when the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme was running and diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. At the same time, business owners in the hospitality and tourism sectors received a VAT discount, designed to help some of the industries worst hit by the pandemic. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""August saw the largest rise in annual inflation month-on-month since the series was introduced almost a quarter of a century ago. ""However, much of this is likely to be temporary, as last year, restaurant and cafe prices fell substantially due to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, while this year, prices rose."" In August this year, transport costs also increased. Average petrol prices stood at 134.6 pence a litre, compared with 113.1 pence a litre a year earlier, when travel was reduced under lockdown restrictions. Used car prices were also partly to blame for price rises - they increased by 4.9% in just one month. Since April, they have gone up by more than 18%amid a shortage of new models. How will price rises affect you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that price rises seen in August were ""almost unavoidable"" because of the discounts available in 2020. ""Inflation, which is a year-on-year comparison, was always going to look strong compared to last year,"" she said. ""Some of that rise reflected genuine factors too. In particular, we are now seeing the effects of higher global shipping costs and shortages of staff driving up food price inflation."" She also expects, however, that the cost of living could continue to increase rapidly, with inflation exceeding 4% by November. Diners bought more than 160 million meals under the Eat Out to Help Out scheme last August The latest official figures will add to the debate about whether interest rates need to go up to curb consumer spending and moderate prices. Inflation now exceeds the Bank of England's 2% target, aimed at keeping cost increases steady. But Capital Economics points out that inflation is likely to fall back almost as sharply next year and that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is not expected to raise interest rates until 2023. The central bank's deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, insisted in Julythat it would not stop its efforts to boost the economy, despite the forecast of higher costs. ""While we know [inflation] is going to go further over the next few months, I'm not convinced that the current inflation in retail goods prices should in and of itself mean higher inflation 18 to 24 months ahead, the horizon more relevant for monetary policy,"" he said. Most of the inflation in goods prices was down to oil price rises and supply chain issues, he said, which was likely to ""fall away"" in the early part of 2022. But given that Wednesday's latest figures breach the Bank's target, it must now write to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to explain what it will do to ensure that price prices are steady in future. Shopping bills set to rise this autumn, says BRC Inflation spike temporary, says Bank deputy 'Customers will go elsewhere and won't come back' James Lyon Shaw, who owns the Greene Oak Pub in Windsor, Berkshire, told the BBC the rise in inflation had to be taken in context and that businesses, including his own, needed to ""ride the storm"". He is paying his employees 10 to 20% more an hour compared to last year due to the wider workforce shortages. He said increases in food prices depended on where restaurants and pubs source their food, with rises in haulage and logistics costs hitting profit margins. ""We just have got to get through, you've got to be pragmatic, get on and adapt your business."" He questioned if people had enjoyed access to ""cheap food"" for too long and whether there needed to be a shift in attitudes to pay for more sustainably produced products. Yaelâ¯Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, added: ""Higher inflation will inevitably raise questions for the Bank of England on the timing of tightening monetary policy and interest rate hikes to contain inflationary risks further down the line."" She added: ""However, any tightening now risks scuppering the recovery before it has a chance to take hold, so a delay until the middle of next year is likely."" UK businesses are reporting difficultiesin sourcing goods and recruiting staff because of disruption caused by the pandemic and problems such as HGV driver shortages, exacerbated by Brexit. According to a survey of 2,000 people by Retail Economics, more than half of consumers are concerned about rising costs as a result. The market research firm said on Wednesday that worries about the cost of living had reached their highest point in more than five years. A record monthly spike in inflation, up to levels not seen for more than eight years, reflects a spluttering restart to the economy. Demand has rebounded, but the supply of goods and labour has not. In August, there were one-off factors from the discounts and support measures last year. As inflation is above 3%, the Bank of England governor has to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why. Stripping out the impact of Eat Out to Help Out last year would have meant this was not necessary. This inflation number will go higher still in the coming months because of rising home energy bills. Alongside the rise in petrol prices and frankly incredible increase in used car prices, these inflationary pressures are becoming very visible. The maths suggests that inflation could top 4% and then fall just as sharply, as long as there are no further economic shocks. Public perceptions matter significantly in regard to wage settlements for next year. While the number is high and rising, this is still consistent with a ""transitory"" post-lockdown reopening inflation spike, predicted by the central bank. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: There's no single trigger for bringing back restrictions but we'll keep an eye on the NHS Pressure on the NHS is the main factor that would lead to tighter Covid restrictions in England, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid told the BBC there was not a ""single trigger"" for the government moving to its ""Plan B"" measures. But he said how the NHS was coping was the number one issue to watch. Government scientists have warned that there could be a large jump in Covid hospital admissions if restrictions are not tightened soon. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said its modelling suggested hospitalisations could reach 2,000 to 7,000 per day next month. Currently there is an average of just over 750 Covid admissions per day in England. The scientists said a ""relatively light set of measures"" could keep case numbers down if they were brought in early enough. Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to avoid the need for additional restrictions by getting more people vaccinated. Can England avoid 'lockdown lite' this winter? Plan A or Plan B - what could happen this winter? Booster jab rollout to begin in UK next week As he announced his winter plan for tackling Covid in England on Tuesday, he said some measures would be kept in reserve for if the NHS faced unsustainable pressure - including vaccine passports, mandatory face masks and advising people to work from home. Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast: ""We don't want to get to a position ever again where there's unsustainable pressure on the NHS so it's not able to see people in the usual way when it needs to, particularly emergency patients. ""So in my mind that is the number one issue that we need to always, always keep an eye on."" The health secretary said factors would include hospital admission numbers, pressures on A&E and staffing levels. Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Javid was pressed on why the government was not acting early to prevent a rise in hospital admissions. He said the UK now had ""much better defences"" than it did a year ago, including vaccines, new treatments and an improved testing and surveillance system. This video can not be played Protecting the NHS from being overwhelmed ""has to remain the objective"" says the PM Papers released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),externalon Tuesday, dated 8 September, said there was ""potential for another large wave of hospitalisations"". Virus modellers advising the committee - the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) - said it was possible the virus would spread more rapidly after the return of schools and more people going back to their workplaces. They said high levels of home-working had been very important for curbing the epidemic in recent months, with a significant decrease ""highly likely"" to lead to a rapid increase in hospital admissions. As well as encouraging working from home, they suggested ""light-touch measures"" such as clear messaging telling people to ""act cautiously"", more widespread testing, a return to requiring all contacts of cases to isolate, and more mask-wearing. If hospitalisation rates were allowed to get too high then much more stringent and disruptive measures would be needed, they said. However, the body acknowledged its previous warning - that lifting all restrictions over the summer might prompt a large scale outbreak - had not been borne out by events. Daily Covid cases have also been falling in England over the past week. The modellers who report into the Sage committee were too pessimistic back in July when they assumed the opening up of society would lead to a surge in infections and hospital admissions. The latest set of papers notes that the closure of schools, warm weather and large numbers of people being required to self-isolate played a bigger than expected role in curbing infections. But they go on to say that the peak time for cases expected previously from August has now simply been pushed back to October through to December. The return of schools and colleges could push up case rates. Another large wave of hospitalisations looms, they say. They lean towards early light touch intervention by ministers, for example getting more people to work from home again. In effect this is calling on the government to enact Plan B for England soon. Sceptics will say modellers have got it wrong before and a pinch of salt is needed with the latest papers. But few would deny the possibility of a very difficult winter ahead. Epidemiologist Prof Andrew Hayward says the focus should now be on the number of hospital admissions and the ability of the NHS to cope, rather on the number Covid cases, because of the impact of vaccines. Prof Hayward, who is a member of Sage but was speaking in a personal capacity, also said working from home would make ""a significant difference to transmission if we get into trouble"". ""The most important and effective way of reducing spread of the virus is not to be in contact with other people,"" he told the Today programme. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which feeds into Sage, said the number of contacts people had per week had risen to the highest number for a year - but this was mostly down to people going into work. He told Times Radio people should be allowed to continue to work from home if they can, rather than being forced back into the office. The country is entering the autumn with a much higher level of cases, hospital admissions and deaths than last year. On Tuesday, the UK reported a further 26,628 cases and another 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The most recent data showed there were 8,413 Covid patients in hospital. On 15 September last year, there were 3,105 daily cases and 27 deaths reported, along with 1,066 Covid patients in hospital. However, vaccines are now offering extensive protection against severe illness. Some 81.2% of people aged 16 and over in the UK are fully vaccinated. All over-50s in the UK - as well as those in other vulnerable groups -are to be offered a booster shot at least six months after their second dose, with 12 to 15-year-olds also being offered a single dose.

"This video can not be played Pictures from South Korea's Ministry of National Defence show the launch North and South Korea have tested ballistic missiles hours apart from each other, highlighting an arms race on the peninsula as nuclear talks with the North remain stalled. The North fired two ballistic missiles across its east coast, its first test with such missiles in six months and a fresh breach of UN resolutions. The tests came as South Korea and China discussed the North's nuclear issue. Hours later, the South tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile. The test of the missile known as SLBM was pre-planned and not in reaction to the North's latest launches. It makes South Korea the seventh country in the world with such technology. President Moon Jae-in, who attended the test, said South Korea now hadÂ ""sufficient deterrence to respond to North Korea's provocations at any time"", urging the South to continue increasing its weapons programmes to ""overwhelm North Korea's asymmetric power"". The comments were criticised by Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who described them as illogical and regrettable, warning that they could lead to a breakdown in ties, state news agency KCNA reported. In North Korea's test, the short-range missiles flew around 800km (500 miles) at a maximum altitude of 60km, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. They were launched from central inland areas of the country, and flew east towards the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, the JCS added. South Korea and the US were conducting analysis to determine which type of missile was used. The Japanese defence minister said later the missiles had landed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone. South Korean television broadcast file footage in report about the North's latest test with ballistic missiles UN resolutions ban North Korea from carrying out tests with ballistic missiles - which can carry either nuclear or conventional warheads - in efforts to curb the country's nuclear programme. ""It's extraordinary timing that you have not one but two Koreas testing ballistic missiles on the same day,"" Prof John Delury at Yonsei University told AFP news agency. ""It does speak to the fact that there's an arms race in this region."" The recent launches show North Korea has continued to develop its weapons despite a severe economic crisis. Experts say Pyongyang carries out such tests to improve its technology while trying to increase its leverage in negotiations with Washington. The US wants the country to give up its nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for sanctions relief, but the North has refused. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the North Korean launch ""outrageous"" while the US said it posed a threat to the neighbours and the international community. Earlier, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks with his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, in Seoul, and said all parties should work to promote peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. North Korea tested a long-range cruise missile last weekend Ballistic missiles are classed according to how far they can travel, the furthest of which being an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea has in the past tested ICBMs said to be capable of reaching nearly all of Western Europe and about half of the US mainland. Last weekend, Pyongyang said it tested a long-range cruise missile capable of hitting much of Japan, calling it ""a strategic weapon of great significance"". Experts say it could possibly carry a nuclear warhead. The UN Security Council does not forbid the test of cruise missiles. But it considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening because they can carry bigger and more powerful payloads, have a much longer range, and can travel faster. North Korea is facing food shortages, and has spent more than a year in isolation. It cut off most trade with its closest ally China to stop the spread of Covid-19. Last March, Pyongyang defied sanctions and tested ballistic missiles, which triggered a strong rebuke from the US, Japan and South Korea. And last month the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a ""deeply troubling"" development.
