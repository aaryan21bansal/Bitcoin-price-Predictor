"Unemployment fell by 27,000 in the three months to February to 1.34 million,official Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show.,external The number of people in work was also virtually unchanged at a record high of 32.7 million, with a jump of 179,000. The figure has increased by 457,000 over the past year, all among full-time employees and the self-employed. Average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, had an estimated rise of 3.4%, before adjusting for inflation. When adjusted for inflation, pay, including bonuses, increased by 1.5% on the year, the highest figure since the summer of 2016. The UK's unemployment rate of 3.9% is now lower than at any time since the end of 1975. ONS deputy head of labour market statistics Matt Hughes said: ""The jobs market remains robust, with the number of people in work continuing to grow. ""The increase over the past year is all coming from full-timers, both employees and the self-employed. ""Earnings have now been growing ahead of inflation for over a year, but in real terms, wage levels have not yet returned to their pre-downturn peak."" Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""The UK jobs market continues to go from strength to strength, proving the underlying resilience of the British economy. ""But we must not take this for granted. We need to work urgently to get behind a Brexit deal that protects this jobs record and gives employers the certainty to continue to invest in their workforce and boost wages."" Mike Amesbury, Labour's shadow employment minister, said: ""Behind today's headline figures, average wages are still less than they were 10 years ago and in-work poverty is rising faster than employment. ""Too many people are trapped in low-paid, insecure work and 70% of children in poverty now live in working families."" Food price inflation highest in almost six years, says retail group Unemployment rises again in Wales The number of economically inactive people fell by 114,000 in the latest quarter to 8.53 million, a rate of just under 21%, the joint lowest on record. The number of vacancies was almost unchanged at 852,000. Anxiety over Brexit has deterred some businesses from investing - but not, it would appear, hiring more workers as yet. Hiring plans tend to lag behind changes in economic activity, as employers wait to assess changes in demand, so the resilience of the labour market is perhaps unsurprising - particularly as consumer spending remains solid for now. But economists say employment could yet falter later in the year if the uncertainty is drawn out. Wages growth continues to comfortably outpace inflation compared with a year ago (although in real terms, the level of average wages remains below the pre-crisis levels). The level of vacancies is down on the record of 864,000 seen at the start of the year, in another sign of strong demand. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""This modest pay growth is doing little for workers still feeling the effects of the longest pay squeeze for 200 years. ""And with over half of those in poverty living in working households, we need a more ambitious plan to support jobs and wages."" Federation of Small Businesses national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""At a time when political uncertainty is making it impossible to plan and operating costs are spiralling, a tight labour market represents yet another headache for small business owners. ""One in five small UK employers rely on staff from the EU. The sharp drop in European arrivals is a real concern for many smaller firms, particularly those in sectors such as construction, care and engineering, where the contribution of EU team members is so vital. One in three small firms now say lack of access to the right personnel is a major barrier to growth."" Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We suspect that this could mark the peak of employment growth, as the Brexit uncertainty reached its crescendo and the surveys turned down sharply in March."" He added that employment growing more slowly than output could ease some pressure on labour costs and said that he did not expect any interest rate rise until the second half of 2020.

"Jeremy Corbyn has pledged that Labour would scrap formal tests in primary schools in England, known as Sats. The tests left children in floods of tears or vomiting with worry, he told members of the National Education Union in Liverpool to loud whoops and cheers. He said it would free up schools struggling with funding cuts and congested classrooms, and help teacher recruitment and retention. The move means school league tables based on the tests would be ended too. ""We need to prepare children for life, not just exams,"" he said to a hall of cheering teachers Members of the teaching union have called for primary school tests to be ditched for many years and gave the Labour leader a standing ovation. They have long argued that the high-stakes nature of the tests skews children's education, and turns primary schools into exam factories. Mr Corbyn told members the next Labour government would end the Sats all pupils have to sit at seven and 11, the results of which are used to hold schools to account. Do Sats really matter - and if so, to whom? School league tables and Sats Sats for seven-year olds scrapped Instead, Labour would introduce alternative assessments which would be based on ""the clear principle of understanding the learning needs of every child."" Jeremy Corbyn says a Labour government would scrap Sats tests in England's primary schools The government has already said it is phasing out Sats for pupils aged seven, and instead it wants to bring in a new baseline assessment for reception classes. Reacting to the announcement, joint general secretary of the NEU, Dr Mary Bousted, said Mr Corbyn recognised the damage a test-driven system does to children and schools. ""We look forward to the return of a broad and balanced curriculum and to the rekindling of the spirit of creativity in our schools."" Head teachers' leaders also welcomed Labour's announcement. Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said children's progress could be measured through ""everyday teacher assessment and classroom tests"", while Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders called Sats ""flawed"", with a new approach ""long overdue"". Schools Minister Nick Gibb said abolishing Sats ""would be a terrible retrograde step"" which would ""undo decades of improvement in children's reading and maths"". ""Labour plan to keep parents in the dark. ""They will prevent parents from knowing how good their child's school is at teaching maths, reading and writing,"" said Mr Gibb. But Mr Whiteman said Sats do not tell teachers or parents anything they do not already know about their child.

"Activists protest against the arrests at the Saudi embassy in Paris A court in Saudi Arabia has postponed a hearing in the trial of several of the country's most prominent women's rights activists, officials say. Some relatives were told that the judge had delayed the session for ""private reasons"", Reuters news agency said. The women were arrested last May and charged with offences including spying. They had been campaigning for an end to the country's male guardianship system and for the right to drive, before the ban was lifted last June. Since then, horrific details have emerged of their alleged mistreatment at the hands of the Saudi authorities. On Tuesday, Walid al-Hathloul, the brother of one of the best-known activists, Loujain al-Hathloul, told the BBC his sister was so traumatised by what had happened to her that she wanted to remain in jail, afraid of how her reputation had been unfairly smeared in her absence. Loujain al-Hathloul's brother tells the BBC that she was tortured in prison in Jeddah He said that following her arrest Ms Hathloul had been taken to a secret detention facility near the maximum security prison of Dhahban in Jeddah. There, she told her family, she was taken down to a basement and subjected to waterboarding and electrocution. He named Saud al-Qahtani, a close confidant of the Saudi Crown Prince, as the man who oversaw her torture, allegedly laughing as he threatened to have her raped and murdered. In February, a group of British MPs carried out an investigation, supported by a number of international human rights organisations, into the allegations of mistreatment of Ms Hathloul and other female activists. They concluded that the allegations were credible. In March the UN's Human Rights Council called for their release and more than 30 countries, including all 28 EU members, signed a statement condemning their prolonged detention. The Saudi government says the detained women enjoy all the rights afforded to them under Saudi law. But Mr Hathloul said everything about his sister's arrest and detention had been shrouded in secrecy and that the entire judicial process lacked transparency. It was not until November 2018, he said, six months after her arrest, that the family even learned what she was accused of. Saudi Arabia's enduring male guardianship system 'Why I fled Saudi Arabia and sought asylum in the UK' Saudi Arabia puts women's rights activists on trial The accusations, he said, included ""applying for a job at the UN and being in contact with human rights organisations"". He added that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to support its allegation of spying. While Saudi Arabia rejects all criticism of its judicial system, insisting it is based on Sharia (Islamic law), in practice it has always been opaque, with arbitrary judgements often handed down at the whim of a judge. This case has attracted particularly widespread international condemnation and is seen as further damaging the reputation of Saudi Arabia's controversial Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, known as MBS. Mohammed Bin Salman was once hailed as a reformer in the west - but is accused of suppressing dissenters Initially courted in the West as an enlightened reformer who reintroduced cinemas and public entertainment to the conservative kingdom, MBS remains under suspicion for his alleged involvement in last October's murder of the journalist Jamal al-Khashoggi, which his government denies. Commentators have explained the apparent paradox between the accelerated crackdown on human rights and the crown prince's simultaneous liberalisation of Saudi society as being the ruling family's determination to steer reforms at their pace, rather than at the one demanded by peaceful protesters. This, in a country where all political parties are banned, would be seen as a dangerous precedent. The next stage expected in the trial of Loujain al-Hathloul and her co-defendants is the judge's response to their defence, which has already been submitted. Her brother said the family were deeply worried about what would happen next, partly due to the lack of transparency. He said his sister was bearing up despite everything, but that she was disheartened that the Saudi authorities had so far failed to investigate her complaints of torture.

"The far-right Vox party has been called far-right, anti-immigration and anti-Islam Spain's election board has banned the far-right Vox party from participating in the only confirmed TV debate for the 28 April election. The controversial, anti-immigration party achieved a surprise victory in recent regional elections. Spain's Atresmedia network chose it to join the four major national parties for a debate on 23 April. However, the electoral commission ruled that Vox's inclusion would be a violation of electoral law. The network said it would respect the ruling but stood by its decision to include Vox in the debate. ""Atresmedia maintains that a debate between five candidates is of the greatest journalistic value and most relevance for voters,"" the network said in a statement after the ruling. Spain's current Prime Minister, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, had agreed to take part in the private network's five-party debate - including Vox - rather than the four-party option proposed by a public broadcaster. However, the electoral commission ruled that Vox's inclusion was not ""proportional"" under its electoral rules, since it does not hold any seats in the national parliament and attracted a very small percentage of the vote in the last general election. Rise of nationalists vowing to 'make Spain great again' Spanish election: Socialists battle to stop right-wing surge Vox: Who are Spain's far-right party? Vox's leader Santiago Abascalresponded defiantly on Twitter.,external ""It's clear who calls the shots still in Spain: the separatists. Until April 28. Because a great victory for #LongLiveSpain will see those parties who wish to destroy our co-existence, constitution and homeland banned"", he said. Several smaller parties had asked to be included in the debate, based on previous electoral performance. The 28 April ballot is being billed as a battle between the established parties, Catalan and Basque nationalists, and Vox. Founded in 2014, the party struggled to make an impact on Spain's political landscape until it took 12 parliamentary seats in Andalusia in December, beating expectations that it would win five. Vox has been derided as far-right and populist, anti-immigrant and anti-Islam but its leader Santiago Abascal believes its recent surge of support is because it is ""in step with what millions of Spaniards think"". Its leaders reject the far-right label, insisting it is a party of ""extreme necessity"" rather than extremism. Its overall support for Spain's membership of the EU, it says, differentiates it from many populist and far-right movements across Europe. The party proposes to ""make Spain great again"" and critics have described its ideology as a nationalist throwback to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.

"Parents protested about equalities education at some Birmingham primary schools Teachers are calling for same-sex relationships education to be made compulsory in UK primary schools. The demand, at the National Education Union conference in Liverpool, comes after protests at several primaries in Birmingham over an equality programme. The protesters said the programme, No Outsiders, clashed with their religious beliefs. Delegate Deborah Gwynn said primary school pupils would have family members who were members of same-sex couples. ""We want them to feel included,"" she said. The motion claimed parental opposition in Birmingham and elsewhere was being organised by a range of homophobic groups. Birmingham anti-LGBT lessons leaflet 'inflammatory' No Outsiders row: Drag queens read to children Parkfield School LGBT lessons 'not axed' despite protests Relationships education to be compulsory It called for the union to lobby the government and opposition parties to strengthen Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) guidance so that teaching about Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender relationships becomes statutory in both primary and secondary schools. She added that every child should be ""empowered to be the people that they want to be"". Tanveer Hammeed, a delegate from Leeds, said: ""RSE education needs to be for all, it needs to be inclusive, it needs to go through primary to secondary schools - no ifs, no buts."" Speakers also claimed there had been a conflation of issues of RSE and Islamaphobia, because of the predominance of Muslim parents protesting around the Birmingham schools, and that this was being stirred up by the Far Right. Supporters say No Outsiders, the programme at the centre of the Birmingham protests, simply teaches children ""about different families"" Teachers also expressed concerns about a return to the days when councils, and therefore schools, were banned from promoting homosexuality in any mainstream school. But they acknowledged that schools need to have a clear ""dialogue"" with parents about the necessity of inclusive education. From 2020, relationship, sex and heath education,externalwill be compulsory in all schools in England, while relationship and health education must be taught in primaries. But the guidance leaves head teachers to decide exactly what to teach and when. They also have to take into account the religious background of all pupils when planning it. In primaries, pupils will learn about ""healthy family life"" and how other people's families can look different from their own. With regard to education on same sex relationship issues, the government has saidall pupils have to learn about them ""in a timely manner"",,externalwith the Department for Education recommending that it is ""integral throughout programmes of study"".

"Lord Janner is alleged to have abused victims between the 1950s and 1980s Senior police officers may have influenced decisions about inquiries going ahead into child abuse allegations against a politician, a watchdog has said. Leicestershire Police inquiries into Lord Janner are being reviewed by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The IOPC also said documents may have been ""inappropriately modified"" and allegations not even recorded. The late Lord Janner and his family have always maintained his innocence. Leicestershire Police said it could not comment at this time. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The IOPC is examining inquiries from 1991, 2001 and 2006 and said it was considering the conduct and actions of 13 individuals, though none are serving officers. It has sent an update to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA). IICSA has received complaints from more than 30 people alleging the former Labour MP abused victims between the 1950s and 1980s. Prof Alexis Jay is leading the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) While emphasising its investigation was ongoing, the IOPC outlined ""matters of concern"" including: In the early 1990s, before a formal investigation into Lord Janner commenced, police records indicate ""a number of references to a relationship, including a sexual relationship, between Lord Janner and a child"", but there is no evidence the claims were looked into Once an investigation did begin, lines of inquiry ""appear from the evidence not to have been carried out"" and ""there is an indication that senior officers may have influenced decisions regarding the inquiries being carried out"" In 2001-2002 ""allegations made by former children's home residents appear from the evidence available not to have been investigated or recorded"" and ""documented results of investigative actions regarding Lord Janner appear to contain information that could be interpreted as misleading and/or inaccurate"" The update said a new referral was made to the IOPC in February, which ""based on the evidence reviewed"" indicated ""police documents may have been inappropriately modified"". The IOPC said all those under investigation had been issued with notices regarding potential criminal offences and potential gross misconduct. It said it hoped to produce a final report by the end of June. IICSA said it had paused its work regarding Lord Janner to avoid any duplication. Lord Janner, who was born in Cardiff, was an MP in Leicester for nearly 30 years. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2009 and died shortly after a judge had ruled he was not fit to stand trial for alleged child sex offences, in December 2015. His son Daniel Janner QC said: ""This private document should never have been published. ""It is yet another astonishing example of this discredited inquiry's mishandling of information."" He described the IICSA inquiry into his father as a ""macabre proxy prosecution of a dead innocent man who cannot answer back from the grave"".

"Jack Dorsey answered questions at TED on problems with his platform Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has again admitted there is much work to do to improve Twitter and cut down on the amount of abuse and misinformation on the platform. He said the firm might demote likes and follows, adding that in hindsight he would not have designed the platform to highlight these. He said that Twitter currently incentivised people ""to post outrage"". Instead he said it should invite people to unite around topics and communities. ""It may be best if it becomes an interest-based network,"" he told TED curators Chris Anderson and Whitney Pennington Rodgers. Rather than focus on following individual accounts, users could be encouraged to follow hashtags, trends and communities. Doing so would require a systematic change that represented a ""huge shift"" for Twitter. On the topic of abuse, he admitted that it was happening ""at scale"". Chris Anderson asked Mr Dorsey why he seemed to lack urgency in dealing with the problems on Twitter ""We've seen harassment, manipulation, misinformation which are dynamics we did not expect 13 years ago when we founded the company,"" he told TED curator Chris Anderson. ""What worries me is how we address them in a systematic way."" He has previously discussed the role played by likes and follows, which were designed to be prominent. ""One of the choices we made was to make the number of people that follow you big and bold. If I started Twitter now I would not emphasise follows and I would not create likes. ""We have to look at how we display follows and likes,"" he added. Ms Pennington Rodgers asked him why, according to Amnesty, women of colour on average received abuse in one of 10 tweets they posted. ""It's a pretty terrible situation,"" Mr Dorsey admitted. ""The dynamics of the system makes it super-easy to harass others."" He said that Twitter was increasingly using machine-learning to spot abuse and claimed that 38% of abusive tweets were now identified by algorithms and then highlighted to humans, who decide whether to remove them from the platform. He also said that the firm was working on making it easier to find its policies on abuse and was simplifying them. Asked if he would show urgency in dealing with the issues, he replied simply: ""Yes."" The TED audience were invited to contribute to the conversation via the hashtag #askJackatTED, which received more than 1,000 questions within 10 minutes of the talk starting. One of the questions came from journalist Carole Cadwalladr who spoke at TED on Monday and called on the tech firms, including Twitter, to directly address the issue of misinformation being shared widely on their platforms. But in her question to Mr Dorsey, she turned her attention to abuse she has received on Twitter. ""I'd like to know why a video that showed me being beaten up and threatened with a gun to soundtrack of Russian anthem stayed up for 72 hours despite 1000s of complaints?"" she wrote. Mr Dorsey did not address that question and neither did he answer another one about how to deal with the huge number of malicious bots posting misinformation. He was also shown a graph created by Zignal Labs which showed the number of human tweets versus tweets from suspected bots talking about topics in the recent election campaign in Israel. Bots seemed to dominate when it came to tweets about contender Benny Gantz, who was narrowly defeated by Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr Dorsey was asked about this but did not answer. Instead he said that the company was in the middle of measuring the ""conversational health"" of the platform, using a number of metrics, including how toxic conversations were and how much people are exposed to a variety of opinions. ""We have to create a healthy contribution to the network and a healthy conversation. On Twitter right now you don't necessarily walk away feeling you learned something.""

"The Independent Group is now a political party called Change UK The Electoral Commission has approved The Independent Group's application to register as a political party. The group -made up of 11 former Labour and Tory MPs who quit their parties in February- will become Change UK. The approval means they can put forward candidates in the European elections due to take place on 23 May - if the UK has not left the EU by then. But the Commission rejected the party's logo, saying it was ""likely to mislead voters"". Two former Conservative MEPs, Julie Girling and Richard Ashworth, confirmed they were joining Change UK and hope to stand as candidates in the European elections. Ms Girling said she was ""fully committed to a People's Vote on Brexit"" and was ""looking forward to being able to use my extensive experience as part of the Change UK team"". Meanwhile, cross-party talks between the government and the Labour Party are continuing this week to find a way through the impasse. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said no agreement had been reached and the government ""doesn't appear"" to be shifting its stance on key issues, including its opposition to a customs union with the EU. Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? How UK is gearing up for European elections UK MEPs could sit for 'months or longer' Change UK began to form when seven Labour MPs resigned the whip due to an ongoing row about the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism, and its position on Brexit. Two days later, another Labour MP, Joan Ryan, joined the ranks, followed by three Conservative backbenchers, who criticised the government for letting the ""hard-line anti-EU awkward squad"" take over their party. Since then, the group has been a vocal supporter of the ""People's Vote"" campaign, calling for another referendum on Brexit. The 11 MPs sat as a grouping in Parliament called ""The Independent Group"", butapplied to become a party at the end of March in case European elections went ahead. This video can not be played BBC Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth explains what we know so far about The Independent Group It did not meet the deadline for local elections in England, which are taking place at the start of May. Planning is already taking place for the European parliamentary ballot after the EU agreed to push back the Brexit deadline to 31 October. European Council President Donald Tusk has saidthe delay means the UK will take part in the electionsand British MEPs could sit for ""months or even longer"". However, Theresa May has insistedthe UK could still leave by 22 Mayand avoid taking part in the elections. There was some controversy over the choice of Change UK as the party name, with online petitions website Change.org saying it was""seeking guidance on the proposed use of our brand name"",external. Who will stand in Northern Ireland? But the Electoral Commission has approved the application, with former Tory MP Heidi Allen as interim leader, and the party's registered name as Change UK - The Independent Group. The Commission - which is responsible for overseeing elections in the UK -rejected the group's proposed emblem,external, however, which was a black square with white writing, saying: ""TIG #Change."" A spokeswoman from the Commission said: ""The emblem contained a hashtag, and we cannot assess the material linked to a hashtag, which will change over time, against the legal tests. ""The emblem also contained the acronym TIG, which we were not satisfied was sufficiently well known."" Change UK has yet to say whether they have submitted a new logo. But in a press release, the party confirmed it would launch its European election campaign on Tuesday, 23 April after receiving 3,700 applications from people wanting to stand in its name.

"Hundreds of millions of euros have been pledged to help rebuild Notre-Dame The dramatic sight of Notre-Dame being ravaged by flames on Monday captivated people around the world. The French cathedral, which dates back more than 850 years, has been partially destroyed despite the best efforts of firefighters who worked throughout the night. Now, as investigators work to establish the cause of the blaze, attention has turned to how the building can be repaired. A number of companies and business tycoons have pledged hundreds of millions of euros between them towards the restoration effort. So can the famous landmark be returned to its former glory? John David is better positioned than most to judge whether the famous cathedral can be saved. The master stonemason was part of a team of craftsmen who worked to rebuild England'sYork Minster cathedral when it was badly damaged by fire in 1984.It was set alight after it was hit by lightning, causing Â£2.25m ($3m) in damage. ""We went in and there were piles of charred timbers on the floor,"" he recalls. ""There was black ash and soot and the whole building smelt of smoke. There was a sort of gloom in the place."" But he says the team was confident it could be repaired and he feels equally optimistic about Notre-Dame. ""There was no fear about putting it back and I imagine that's the same in this case"" he says. ""It's quite achievable to see it [restored] and it's an opportunity to show that this work can still be done,"" he says. John David helped repair York Minster after it was hit by a lightning strike in 1984 Mr David says the restoration team must first remove the Notre-Dame's burnt scaffolding. There were extensive renovation works taking place at the time of the fire and a huge scaffold was covering much of its exterior. ""The scaffolding will be in the way and will have to be delicately taken down because it's suffered with the heat,"" he says. He explains that a protective cover will then need to be placed over the cathedral to shield it from the wind and rain. Any fallen timber and other debris inside the cathedral will need to be cleared out, Mr David says. But this debris won't just be removed and forgotten about. ""Early phases of the work will include the archaeological recording of surviving fragments of timber, stone and artworks,"" says Dr Kate Giles, from the University of York's department of archaeology. ""This will enable the Notre-Dame team to salvage what can be reused and provide crucial evidence for the design of new fabrics in the building,"" she says. The fire at Notre-Dame raged for more than 15 hours Once the cathedral is cleared, experts say a thorough survey will need to be carried out to establish the extent of the damage and to ensure it is safe to re-enter. ""Safety will be the prime concern,"" says Dr Amira Elnokaly, a lecturer in archaeology at the University of Lincoln. ""There should be critical inspections to avoid any risks of further collapses or falling debris."" The survey will then turn to the stonework at the top of the cathedral near the roof. ""The upper stone work, the vaulting and the top windows, will have been baked and the temperature will have spoiled and weakened the stone,"" says Paul Binski, a history of medieval art professor at the University of Cambridge. ""The first thing they're going to do is a massive survey of the stone,"" he says. ""They're going to have to scaffold the whole building and look very closely at its condition."" A view of the stone ceiling inside the Notre-Dame before the fire This is because the stone ceiling will have taken the brunt of the impact when the timber roof above collapsed, experts suggest. ""The 19th Century spire, the 19th Century roofing, what will have happened is that these will have crashed down on to the stone vault underneath, the rib vault, which rises to 108ft (33m),"" Prof Binski says. ""The vaulting system will have shielded what's in the church from the inferno above,"" he adds. ""Of course, it will likely have come down in parts, but it will have done a major protective job."" Indeed, images appear to show that the pulpit, pews and altar have escaped the fire largely unscathed. If some of the stonework does need to be replaced then, Prof Binski says, the team will probably use traditional methods to do so. ""It's important to look at the original construction methods and try to emulate them."" he explains. ""This involves building an awful lot of wood scaffolding inside the church because [stone vaulting] is built around a kind of wooden structure - like a mould. ""They're not built with cement but with something that's rather like putty."" Prof Binski says that if a large amount of the stone vaulting needs to be replaced it could be ""the biggest vaulting operation of this type undertaken since the Middle Ages"". ""The question is how long this is going to take and my guess is 5-10 years minimum to get the whole thing re-vaulted,"" he says. This estimate highlights the challenges facing the restoration team if they are to meet President Emmanuel Macron's suggested timescale. The French leader wants Notre-Dame rebuilt by the time Paris hosts the Summer Olympics in 2024. But Mr David says this is a feasible goal. ""I don't think it will take 10 years,"" he says. ""It might take two years to decide what to do, but [five years] is quite achievable."" The moment the spire fell The story of the fire in graphics Why blaze was difficult to tackle Photos from inside the cathedralappear to show that at least one of its famed rose windows has survived, although there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows. So how will the experts protect and restore these? ""They will do an initial survey when they establish what the highest priorities are in terms of historical and artistic significance,"" says Sarah Brown, an expert in stained glass windows. At least one of the three famous rose windows is reported to have survived the fire ""I suspect all of the windows will require some attention because a fire of that size will generate so much smoke and soot,"" she says. ""Even if the windows are in relatively good order they're certainly going to require cleaning. ""The biggest problem will be the heating up and then the rapid cooling down of the glass as it's been struck by water from the cannons,"" Ms Brown explains. ""This will bring about thermal shock that will cause micro-fractures in the glass which will be really difficult to stabilise."" She continues: ""They will need to re-lead these windows because the lead that keeps it all together will no longer hold good, but you cannot even attempt that until you've stabilised the heat-induced micro-fractures in the glass. There are modern adhesives that can do that, however."" And what if one of the cathedral's windows has been completely destroyed? ""The big question then is how they go about re-glazing the building,"" Ms Brown says. ""You can't leave it with nothing in the window,"" she says. ""Some might call for a new stained glass window but it's too early to say what should be done. Windows can be remarkably resilient, so let's hope that's been the case here.""

"Extinction Rebellion's attempts to clog the heart of London and other cities across the UK have undoubtedly driven the issue of climate change up the news agenda. But amid the die-ins - where protestors pretend to be dead - bridge swarmings and arrests, there hasn't been too much consideration of the group's actual plans to tackle rising temperatures. As a solution to the ""climate breakdown and ecological collapse that threaten our existence"", Extinction Rebellion is proposing three key steps. The government must, in their words, ""tell the truth"" about the scale of the crisis the world now faces. Secondly, the UK must enact legally binding policies to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025. The third step is the formation of a Citizens' Assembly to ""oversee the changes"" that will be needed to achieve this goal. This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion's fight against climate change is making headlines Getting to net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2025 would be an extremely difficult target, given that, right now, thegovernment is mulling a plan to commit to net zero by 2050. Consider the changes that would be needed to get to net zero in just six years. Gas boilers across the UK would have to be replaced with electricity, and you'd need to massively ramp up renewable energy, on a scale not yet seen, to meet this extra demand. Researchers atZero Carbon Britain,externalsuggested that if the UK wanted to get to net zero by 2030, Britain would need to get about 130 gigawatts of electricity from wind, meaning around 13,000 extra wind turbines off shore. This would take up an area twice the size of Wales. The UK would also need about 7 gigwatts of onshore wind, meaning another 3,500 turbines. There would also have to be significant dietary changes, with people cutting back on meat and dairy. Flying would have to be restricted. Severely. ""You could have an air flight every couple of years, but we can't allow the world to continue flying for hen parties in New York every couple of weeks,"" said Paul Allen who co-ordinates the Zero Carbon Britain research project. ""The numbers don't stack up. We can't do this, we have to be honest with ourselves."" Achieving net zero five years earlier than the Zero Carbon Britain plan would be an unprecedented challenge, akin to a wartime situation. It would not be impossible but it would depend on a fierce political commitment. ""The honest answer about whether you can hit net zero by 2025 is that until you go for it, nobody knows if you'll get there,"" said Andrew Simms from the Rapid Transition Alliance, which promotessolutions to climate change that could transform the world over the next 12 years. ""We tend to forget what can be achieved in really compressed periods of time when the whole of industry and the whole of government put their minds to it. ""It's like the speed with which we responded to the financial crisis in 2008. ""If we treated the wellbeing of the biosphere with the same integrity and seriousness with which we treated the integrity of the banking system you would rapidly see the alignment of resources and planning that would achieve these kind of goals."" Those involved with Extinction Rebellion say that the nature of the climate crisis is such that even large-scale carbon cutting plans just won't be enough. ""This is not the time to be realistic, this is the time for humanity to completely change course,"" said Dr Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of the organisation. ""This is not about fiddling around the edges, and adding a few solar panels to a few roofs; we have left it so late that we have to step up in a semi-miraculous way to deal with this situation."" Extinction Rebellion says that the key elements of their plan to get the UK to net zero will be set by a Citizens Assembly, composed of people representatively selected from across Britain. ""Let's have people decide what matters most to them, is it the health and safety and the ability to feed their own kids or does it matter to them that they carry on having holidays and meat?"" ""We need Joe the bus driver and Frances the hairdresser to get their heads around it,"" said Dr Bradbrook. Supporters of this approach point to Ireland as a country that has embraced theCitizens Assembly,externalidea to tackle difficult societal questions. The Assembly considered the question of Ireland's restrictions on abortion and suggested that a referendum be held to remove the ban. Thesignificant majoritythat supported repeal indicated that Assembly was an accurate barometer of public opinion. On climate change, Ireland's Assembly has also been an advocate of strong action, with big majorities favouring higher taxes on carbon-intensive activities among a number of recommendations. Protestors in the Netherlands pretend to be dead during a climate protest This in turn gave real political impetus to the establishment of a parliamentary committee on climate action. ""This led this committee to issue what is the strongest cross-party political statement of intent on climate action,"" said John Gibbons, an Irish environmental writer and commentator. ""It certainly has its weaknesses, but Ireland is, in the Taoiseach's own words, an international laggard on tackling climate change, so this report is a good deal better than expected."" Mr Gibbons points out that despite the actions of the Citizens Assembly and politicians, the country is way off target when it comes to cutting carbon. ""Huge compliance penalties are due to kick in post-2020, making ongoing inaction expensive as well as embarrassing for Ireland,"" he says. The government has to upholdUK law on climate change,external, that mandates a series of emissions cuts over time. Extinction Rebellion believes that many politicians want to go much further. They say that political forces are happy to see their protestors on the streets, disrupting traffic and transport. It believes the group is creating the space for a joined-up approach among politicians that has been absent until now. ""We've just got to get away from these left-right political fights - this is beyond that.

"This video can not be played A look inside fire-ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral Hundreds of millions of euros have been pledged to help rebuild Notre-Dame after a devastating fire partially destroyed the French cathedral. The fire, declared fully extinguished some 15 hours after it began, ravaged the 850-year-old building's roof and caused its spire to collapse. But firefighters who worked through the night managed to save the Paris landmark's main stone structure, including its two towers. The cause of the fire is not yet clear. Paris public prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz said his office was ""favouring the theory of an accident"", but had assigned 50 people to work on what he believed would be a ""long"" and ""complex"" investigation. Other officials have suggested it could be linked to extensive renovation works taking place at the cathedral. The cathedral's spire, before, during the fire and after Thoughts are now turning to how Notre-Dame will be rebuilt. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to reconstruct the historic building even as the fire still burned, while a number of companies and business tycoons have so far pledged about â¬600m ($677m; Â£519m) between them. Offers of help with the reconstruction have also poured in from around the globe, with European Council President Donald Tusk calling on EU member states to rally round. The blaze was discovered at 18:43 (16:43 GMT), and firefighters were called. The flames quickly reached the roof of the cathedral, destroying the wooden interior before toppling the spire. Fears grew that the cathedral's famous towers would also be destroyed. The whole of the roof was ""devastated"", according to the fire service But while a number of fires did begin in the towers, French Deputy Interior Minister Laurent NuÃ±ez said they were successfully stopped before they could spread. By the early hours of Tuesday, the fire was declared under control, with the Paris fire service saying it was fully extinguished by 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT). By Patrick Jackson, BBC News, Paris The pavements here on the Left Bank across the Seine are packed with people shuffling along, stopping to take photos or pose for selfies, staring over at the huge, grey bulk of the cathedral. Police stop the crowds getting any closer, as firefighters use a tapering crane to inspect the facade by the cold light of day. The shrill whistles of traffic police cut the air as the sirens of emergency vehicles pass  through the hum of the traffic. But every so often, the birdsong reminds you it's spring in the City of Light. In the little square, the charred odour is unmistakable, mingling with the scent of food from cafÃ©s. A group of excited Dutch 14-year-olds has come back to see the ruin after the drama of the blaze they witnessed last night, on their first trip to Paris. They have a packed agenda but they are solemn and respectful when they talk about the disaster. It's a sad moment for Dutch people too, they say. Everyone knows Notre-Dame. Search teams had already begun assessing the extent of the damage when dawn broke over the French capital. The cathedral's blackened stone and charred scaffolding were revealed to onlookers for the first time. More on the Notre Dame fire: A French view: The horror of watching our country's embodiment burn The images which captured a tragedy as it unfolded Notre-Dame: A history of Paris's beloved cathedral Gargoyles and relics: The treasures which make Notre Dame so special Fire brigade spokesman Lt-Col Gabriel Plus said: ""The whole of the roof has been devastated... a part of the vault has collapsed, the spire is no more."" However, it could have been much worse. Mr NuÃ±ez said that, had fire crews not entered the building, ""without doubt it would have collapsed"", French newspaper Le Monde reported. Photos appear to show that at least one of the cathedral's famed rose windows has survived, although there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows. Franck Riester, France's culture minister, warned that while the principal structure had been saved, the building was still unstable. Mr NuÃ±ez said that ""overall"", the structure was in good condition, but that ""some vulnerabilities"" had been identified in the stone vaults and the remainder of the building's ceiling. Experts have not yet been allowed on site to assess the damage, due to the dangers. Individuals and groups are mobilising to help rebuild Notre-Dame. Hundreds of millions of euros have already been pledged. Air France said in a statement that the company would offer free flights to anyone involved in the reconstruction. The images and graphics that explain the fire Billionaire FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of the Kering group that owns the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion brands, pledged â¬100m (Â£86m; $113m) towards rebuilding Notre-Dame, AFP news agency reports. Another â¬200m was pledged by Bernard Arnault's family and their company LVMH - a business empire which includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora - on Tuesday morning, according to Reuters news agency. French cosmetics giant L'Oreal and its founding Bettencourt family have promised to give a further â¬200m to the reconstruction effort. Total, the French oil giant, has also pledged â¬100m. The French charity Fondation du Patrimoine is launching an international appeal for funds for the cathedral, a Unesco World Heritage site. This video can not be played French President Emmanuel Macron: ""We will rebuild this cathedral"" ""We'll rebuild this cathedral all together and it's undoubtedly part of the French destiny and the project we'll have for the coming years,"" said Mr Macron, in an emotional address on Monday night.

"This video can not be played A look inside fire-ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral Saving France's 850-year-old Notre-Dame cathedral came down to a crucial time window of 15-30 minutes, France's deputy interior minister has said. Laurent NuÃ±ez praised the ""courage and determination"" of firefighters who ""risked their own lives"" to salvage the building's stone structure and its two towers. The fire ravaged the cathedral's roof and caused its spire to collapse. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild it within five years. The cause of the blaze is unclear. ""We now know it all came down to 15-30 minutes,"" Mr NuÃ±ez said, adding that police and fire services would spend the next 48 hours assessing the security and safety of the structure. Paris public prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz said his office was ""favouring the theory of an accident"", but had assigned 50 people to investigate the origin of the fire. The cathedral's spire, before, during the fire and after Other officials have suggested it could be linked to extensive renovation works taking place at the cathedral. Thoughts are now turning to how Notre-Dame will be rebuilt, which Mr Macron promised to make ""even more beautiful"". ""We will turn this catastrophe into an opportunity to come together"", he said. In a televised public address, Mr Macron also heaped praise on the fire services. ""The firefighters stopped the fire by taking the most extreme risks. They were 20 or 25, from each corner of France, from each region."" This video can not be played Hundreds gathered at a vigil for Notre-Dame A number of companies and business tycoons have so far pledged about â¬800m ($902m; Â£692m) between them to help with reconstruction efforts, AFP reports. Offers of help have also poured in from around the globe, with European Council President Donald Tusk calling on EU member states to rally round. Eric Fischer, head of the foundation in charge of restoring the 1,000-year-old Strasbourg cathedral, told AFP the Notre-Dame may take ""decades"" to rebuild. The blaze was discovered at 18:43 local time (16:43 GMT) on Monday, and firefighters were called.

Christophe Castaner, France's interior minister, warned that while the principal structure had been saved, the building was still unstable. ""We will be standing at [Notre Dame's] bedside"", he added. Mr NuÃ±ez said that ""overall"", the structure was in good condition, but that ""some vulnerabilities"" had been identified in the stone vaults and the remainder of the building's ceiling. Experts have not yet been allowed on site to assess the damage and French firefighters have sent a drone to survey the scale of the destruction. Heat and water damage will also need to be assessed. The cathedral's 18th Century organ has not been burned, but it is not clear whether it has been damaged by water, Bertrand de Feydeau, from the French charity Fondation du Patrimoine, told Associated Press. By Patrick Jackson, BBC News, Paris They sit or stand in a crowd, many of them young people, spilling over the end of the Boulevard Saint Michel, this first evening after the fire, singing hymns. On a table beneath the towering sculpture of Saint Michael stands a statue of Our Lady - Notre Dame. ""As a French Catholic,"" says Ãloi, 22, ""I felt really bad after the fire so I see this vigil as a way to say that even if the flames destroyed the cathedral, we can rebuild it because the Church is made not of stones but is a living body."" He believes the cathedral should be remade just the way it was, as a ""prayer to God"". ""We are Catholics,"" he adds, ""but all French people - Catholics, Muslims, atheists - are united around this disaster and in the hope it will be rebuilt."" And they are united in pride in the fire brigade. During the concert, an engine hurtles past on the road, and the singing stops as the crowd claps and cheers. Individuals and groups are mobilising to help rebuild Notre-Dame. Hundreds of millions of euros have already been pledged.

"The officers had forced entry to a home in Ash Grove, Darwen, before they were attacked Seven police officers have been sprayed with ammonia, with one suffering serious injuries to his eyes, throat and lungs. The attack happened after police forced entry to a home in Darwen, Lancashire, at about 02:00 BST following a call reporting a domestic incident. The officers were taken to hospital after they were sprayed with what is believed to be a cleaning liquid. A man escaped the home through a first floor window but was later arrested. A 46-year old man from Darwen was held on suspicion of wounding following the incident, which happened in the town's Ash Grove. Six of the officers suffered less serious injuries and were later discharged from the Royal Blackburn Hospital.

"This video can not be played Laleh Shahravesh on her plans to return to Dubai A British woman who faced prison in Dubai over a jibe she posted on Facebook has said she and her daughter plan to return to the country. Laleh Shahravesh, 55, was arrested at a Dubai airport after flying there to attend her ex-husband's funeral. She had faced up to two years in jail for calling his new wife a ""horse""but her case was settled with a fine. She told the BBC it was important for her daughter to revisit her father's grave without being ""clouded by fear"". In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett, Ms Shahravesh said she had travelled to Dubai to ""pay respect"" to her ex-husband, following his death from a heart attack, with her 14-year-old daughter Paris. ""It was meant to be something peaceful especially for Paris, it was very, very important for her grieving process,"" she said. ""Even though we did go to the cemetery it was clouded by fear, by sadness, by tears."" How to avoid being jailed abroad UAE spy-accused recovery will 'take years' She added that although the 33 days she spent in Dubai before returning to the UK were ""terrifying"" and ""traumatic"", ""we went there for a reason and I feel that we were robbed"". ""We've talked about it and we will probably go back because I have not been banned from returning,"" she said. The mother-of-one from Richmond in south-west London had faced prosecution over two Facebook comments she posted on pictures of her husband remarrying in 2016. She had been married to Pedro Correia Dos Santos for 18 years. Writing in Farsi Ms Shahravesh posted: ""I hope you go under the ground you idiot. Damn you. You left me for this horse."" In another post, she wrote: ""You married a horse you idiot."" The campaign group representing Ms Shahravesh, Detained in Dubai, said her ex-husband's new wife, who lives in the country, had reported the comments. Under the UAE's cyber-crime laws, a person can be jailed or fined for making defamatory statements on social media. At the time of her arrest, Ms Shahravesh was with her daughter, who later had to fly home on her own. However Ms Shahravesh was able to return to the UK last week, after being given a fine of AED3,000 (Â£625). Laleh Shahravesh was arrested in Dubai when she arrived with her teenage daughter Paris for her ex-husband's funeral Ms Shahravesh credited Detained in Dubai for helping to secure her release by bringing international media attention to her case. However, she said the British embassy ""did absolutely nothing to help my situation"", apart from providing details of lawyers, a photocopy of her passport and advising her to go to the police station to make a statement, where she says she was held for 12 hours. ""I wish to this day that I had not taken their advice to go to that police station that day,"" she added. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: ""We are pleased that Laleh has been able to return to the UK and reunite with her family.

"The judge was told he would have to sit as a juror A senior judge has revealed he was excused from jury service, because he was due to preside over the case in question. Keith Cutler, the resident judge of Winchester and Salisbury, said he was surprised when he got the call up. But his reason for not doing his duty was initially rejected when he contacted the Jury Central Summoning Bureau directly to explain. Judge Cutler said the bureau realised its mistake when he called them back. The judge, who served as the coroner for the inquest of Mark Duggan, said he would have happily served as a juror if it had been appropriate. He told a jury: ""I was selected for jury service here at Salisbury Crown Court for a trial starting 23 April. ""I told the Jury Central Summoning Bureau that I thought I would be inappropriate seeing I happened to be the judge and knew all the papers. ""They wrote back to me, they picked up on the fact I was the judge but said 'your appeal for refusal has been rejected but you could apply to the resident judge' but I told them 'I am the resident judge'. ""I had to phone them up and they realised it was a mistake."" The judge added: ""I would have liked to have done the jury service to see what it was like and whether I would have liked the judge."" A guide to jury summons issued by the Ministry of Justice states: ""The normal expectation is that everyone summoned for jury service will serve at the time for which they are summoned. ""However, it is recognised that there will be occasions when it is not reasonable for a person to serve at the time for which they are summoned.""

"The Independent Group is now a political party called Change UK The Electoral Commission has approved The Independent Group's application to register as a political party. The group -made up of 11 former Labour and Tory MPs who quit their parties in February- will become Change UK. The approval means they can put forward candidates in the European elections due to take place on 23 May - if the UK has not left the EU by then. But the Commission rejected the party's logo, saying it was ""likely to mislead voters"". Two former Conservative MEPs, Julie Girling and Richard Ashworth, confirmed they were joining Change UK and hope to stand as candidates in the European elections. Ms Girling said she was ""fully committed to a People's Vote on Brexit"" and was ""looking forward to being able to use my extensive experience as part of the Change UK team"". Meanwhile, cross-party talks between the government and the Labour Party are continuing this week to find a way through the impasse. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said no agreement had been reached and the government ""doesn't appear"" to be shifting its stance on key issues, including its opposition to a customs union with the EU. Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? How UK is gearing up for European elections UK MEPs could sit for 'months or longer' Change UK began to form when seven Labour MPs resigned the whip due to an ongoing row about the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism, and its position on Brexit. Two days later, another Labour MP, Joan Ryan, joined the ranks, followed by three Conservative backbenchers, who criticised the government for letting the ""hard-line anti-EU awkward squad"" take over their party. Since then, the group has been a vocal supporter of the ""People's Vote"" campaign, calling for another referendum on Brexit. The 11 MPs sat as a grouping in Parliament called ""The Independent Group"", butapplied to become a party at the end of March in case European elections went ahead. This video can not be played BBC Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth explains what we know so far about The Independent Group It did not meet the deadline for local elections in England, which are taking place at the start of May. Planning is already taking place for the European parliamentary ballot after the EU agreed to push back the Brexit deadline to 31 October. European Council President Donald Tusk has saidthe delay means the UK will take part in the electionsand British MEPs could sit for ""months or even longer"". However, Theresa May has insistedthe UK could still leave by 22 Mayand avoid taking part in the elections. There was some controversy over the choice of Change UK as the party name, with online petitions website Change.org saying it was""seeking guidance on the proposed use of our brand name"",external. Who will stand in Northern Ireland? But the Electoral Commission has approved the application, with former Tory MP Heidi Allen as interim leader, and the party's registered name as Change UK - The Independent Group. The Commission - which is responsible for overseeing elections in the UK -rejected the group's proposed emblem,external, however, which was a black square with white writing, saying: ""TIG #Change."" A spokeswoman from the Commission said: ""The emblem contained a hashtag, and we cannot assess the material linked to a hashtag, which will change over time, against the legal tests. ""The emblem also contained the acronym TIG, which we were not satisfied was sufficiently well known."" Change UK has yet to say whether they have submitted a new logo. But in a press release, the party confirmed it would launch its European election campaign on Tuesday, 23 April after receiving 3,700 applications from people wanting to stand in its name.

"Old-fashioned metal boxes that have been dragged around the ocean since 1931 have accidentally created a record of the history of ocean plastic. The devices - known as continuous plankton recorders (CPRs) - first ensnared a plastic bag off the coast of Ireland in 1965. This, researchers say, could be the first marine plastic litter found. The CPR record also revealed how much more plastic has been found in the ocean in recent decades. Can you spot ocean plastic from space? Are your clothes polluting the ocean? 'The most disgusting thing I've ever seen in the water' Researchers used a piece of research equipment that was invented in the 1920s By fishing for plankton for all those decades - a key species that indicates the productivity of the ocean and so of particular interest for monitoring the health of fisheries - the machines also produced a history of plastic litter. Lead researcher Dr Clare Ostle, from Plymouth's Marine Biological Association, explained that the ""fleet"" of CPRs were designed and built to be towed behind ships. They capture samples of plankton from the water column - trapping them on a mesh inside. But whenever something became entangled on the recorder and had to be removed, the crew responsible for the device would record what happened, in a log. ""We search through [those logs] and what we realised was that we had some really early, historic entanglement cases of plastics,"" Dr Ostle explained. ""We can build a time series from that - so we can actually see the increase in larger plastic entanglements."" This video can not be played The metal box that accidentally discovered the history of ocean plastics. One headline is that it shows what is believed to be the first recording of a plastic bag in the ocean - a bag that became ensnared on a CPR that was being towed off the coast of Ireland in 1965. Other highlights from the study include: Plastic fishing line found in 1957 Confirmation that there has been a significant and steady increase in ocean plastic since 1990 More hopefully, the number of plastic bags found in the ocean has decreased in recent years, but it's unclear whether that's related to bans and charges being introduced around the world A box in the Plymouth lab contains some of the plastics entangled in the plankton recorder Marine animals can become entangled in larger plastics - particularly cord, nets and ropes. A BBC documentary crewlast year filmed dead seabirds on a remote island that had starved to death with their stomachs filled with plastic fragments. Much smaller microplastics - often the product of larger items breaking down - have been found in fish, seafloor sediments and even in Antarctic ice. They remain more of an open question; scientists are investigating whether ingesting these tiny plastic fragments causes any harm. The researchers involved in this study hope that the ""wave of awareness"" about ocean plastic will help reduce the amount of litter that finds its way into the sea in the first place.

"Frankie Macritchie's family said the ""wonderful"" nine-year-old boy ""will be so very missed"" The family of a nine-year-old boy who was killed in a dog attack have paid tribute to ""a cheeky boy who had a very special heart"". Frankie Macritchie, from Plymouth, died after being attacked by the dog at a caravan park in Cornwall on Saturday. His family said he loved ""watching movies cuddled up with his mum and riding around in dad's car with his cool shades on"". Devon and Cornwall Police are still investigating how Frankie died. In a statement released through the force, Frankie's family described him as ""a fighter from the minute he was born"". They added: ""He loved trampolining and feeding lambs with his cousins, eating chips on the seafront, and sleepovers at all his aunties' and uncles' houses. ""Our wonderful little Frankie will be so very missed by all of his family with every breath that we take."" The family thanked police, medical and holiday park staff, and members of the public who came to Frankie's aid. Flowers and messages have been left at Frankie's school in Plymouth A team of psychologists has been helping pupils at Riverside Primary School in Barne Barton, Plymouth, where Frankie was a pupil. Head teacher Brian Jones called him a ""happy laid-back character"" with a ""great sense of humour"". Police said Frankie had been left alone in a caravan while adults were in an adjoining caravan. They were called to the holiday park at 05:00 BST on Saturday and found Frankie ""unresponsive"". A woman described by police as a family friend was later arrested at a railway station near Plymouth. The 28-year-old, held on suspicion of manslaughter and having a dog dangerously out of control, has since been released.

"Unlike TV programmes, social media platforms do not have to give warnings when potentially harmful flashing images are about to appear A growing number of people with epilepsy have said they are having seizures triggered by flashing images on social media, a charity has warned. The Epilepsy Society wants the government's newplans to tackle ""online harms""to recommend warnings about flashing images on social media. More than 18,000 people in the UK are thought to have epilepsy that can be triggered by photosensitivity. The charity says cyber-bullies post malicious content intentionally. How can you stop your kids viewing harmful web content? Tech Tent: Should we relax about screen time? The Epilepsy Society says anyone found guilty of posting harmful images intentionally should be prosecuted for assault. The government said it would consult with the charity on the issue. Facebook - which also owns Instagram - said it had ""strict policies in place to help people who encounter abusive behaviour"". Unlike TV programmes, which are regulated by Ofcom, social media sites do not have to give a warning when potentially harmful flashing images are about to appear. About 20,000 people in the UK have photosensitive epilepsy - where seizures are triggered by flashing lights or contrasting, fast-moving images, according to the Epilepsy Society. The condition is most common in children and young people. Doctors call for drug supply clarity 'Steep rise' in epilepsy meds shortage Epilepsy Society chief executive Clare Pelham said many Facebook and Instagram users shared videos with potentially dangerous content without realising the risk they posed. ""However, when it comes to deliberately targeting people with epilepsy with the intention of causing a seizure... we need to call that behaviour what it is - a pre-meditated and pre-planned intention to assault,"" she said. ""The government must bring this behaviour within the reach of the criminal law."" Malicious social media posts appear to have useful information about epilepsy on them, but have images embedded designed to provoke a seizure. The posts are tagged with keywords around epilepsy to ""deliberately target those with the condition"", the Epilepsy Society said. Sophie Harries, a 22-year-old dietitian from Somerset, was diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy aged 15. She said it used to be easier to avoid her seizure triggers, although she was not able to go clubbing, in case there was strobe lighting. ""That is still the case, but now I have to be careful of any videos uploaded to social media that contain strobe lighting or flashing imagery,"" she said. ""The videos tend to play automatically putting me at risk of a seizure. If my friends have been out clubbing I have to avoid social media for a while."" This video can not be played Sophie says it used to be easier to avoid her seizure triggers. She recently reported a film trailer to Instagram that contained flashing lights, but it said the video did not breach its terms of usage, she said. ""You can un-follow posts but they still tend to follow you around."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Harries said she recently came across a video containing flashing images, which was tagged deliberately to the Epilepsy Society's Instagram page ""in order to harm"". ""For a 15-year-old today it is an absolute minefield. Young people are permanently on social media with friendship groups."" The Epilepsy Society has written to Digital Secretary Jeremy Wright asking for his reassurance that the new Online Harms paper will safeguard people with epilepsy. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: ""We will place a legally binding duty of care on companies towards their users, overseen by an independent regulator who will set clear safety standards. ""We are currently consulting on this, and want to hear from the Epilepsy Society, and others, about what steps they would like to see platforms take to make the internet a safer place."" A spokesperson for Facebook and Instagram told the BBC that ""everyone deserves to enjoy the benefits of the internet safely"", adding the organisations were exploring ways to make platforms ""more inclusive"".

"This video can not be played Mr Burgon was questioned about the comments last year Shadow cabinet member Richard Burgon has said he regrets having said Zionism is the ""enemy of peace"". The Labour MP denied making the remark in a BBC interview last year, but he has now admitted doing so after footage emerged of him saying it. The Labour Friends of Israel group had accused him of ""seemingly misleading the public"". Mr Burgon said he would not use the ""simplistic language"" again today. The shadow justice secretary, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, was asked about the comments in a BBC interview in March 2018, following newspaper reports in 2016 that he had made them. Zionism refers to the movement to create, and protect, a Jewish state in the Middle East, roughly corresponding to the historical land of Israel. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? When asked on the BBC's Daily Politics show whether he had said Zionism was the enemy of peace, he replied: ""No and it's not my view"". ""I didn't make those comments, I asked when I was meant to have made those comments. No one could tell me and it's not my view"", he said at the time. ""So if it's not my view, I wouldn't have made those comments"", he added. However a new video shows Mr Burgon saying: ""The enemy of the Palestinian people is not the Jewish people. The enemy of the Palestinian people are Zionists, and Zionism is the enemy of peace and the enemy of the Palestinian people."" In a statement, Mr Burgon said he did not ""recall"" making the remark when asked about the 2016 newspaper reports, and had asked for details of the quote. ""I received no reply, so I believed it was inaccurate to have claimed that I had used that phrase. It is now clear that I did and I regret doing so"", he said. ""As I have subsequently said on numerous occasions when asked about this, I do not agree with that phrase"", he added. ""The terminology has different meanings to different people and the simplistic language used does not reflect how I now think about this complex issue and I would not use it again today"". Journalist Iggy Ostanin, who released the video, said the footage was from 2014 - before Mr Burgon was elected as MP for Leeds East at the 2015 general election. Mr Burgon said he had been criticising the ""aggressive expansionist policies"" of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In the video, Mr Burgon also called for MPs who are members of Labour Friends of Israel (LFI) to resign from the group ""in support of the Palestinian people"". LFI Director Jennifer Gerber said: ""For nearly two years, Richard Burgon has deployed half-denials and weasel words to escape responsibility for his appalling suggestion that Zionism is the enemy of peace."" ""Now that we've all seen exactly what he said, it's time for Mr Burgon to apologise both for this slur on the Jewish people's right to self-determination and for seemingly misleading the public about it"". ""Somebody who aspires to be one of the country's leading legal figures simply cannot behave in this fashion."" Amanda Bowman, Vice-President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said Mr Burgon ""should apologise for his comments and for his denial of them"". ""Richard Burgon's denial and the subsequent revelation of his 2014 incitement against Zionists encapsulate the total sham of Labour's approach to anti-Semitism"", she added.

"Widely held myths about sleep are damaging our health and our mood, as well as shortening our lives, say researchers. A team at New York University trawled the internet to find the most common claims about a good night's kip. Then, in a study published in the journal Sleep Health, they matched the claims to the best scientific evidence. They hope that dispelling sleep myths will improve people's physical and mental health and well-being. So, how many are you guilty of? This is the myth that just won't go away. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously had a brief four hours a night. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has madesimilar claims, and swapping hours in bed for extra time in the office is not uncommon in tales of business or entrepreneurial success. Yet the researchers said the belief that less than five hours' shut-eye was healthy, was one of the most damaging myths to health. ""We have extensive evidence to show sleeping five hours or less consistently, increases your risk greatly for adverse health consequences,"" said researcher Dr Rebecca Robbins. These included cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, and shorter life expectancy. Instead, she recommends everyone should aim for a consistent seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Thatcher: Can people get by on four hours' sleep? The relaxing nightcap is a myth, says the team, whether it's a glass of wine, a dram of whisky or a bottle of beer. ""It may help you fall asleep, but it dramatically reduces the quality of your rest that night,"" said Dr Robbins. It particularly disrupts your REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, which is important for memory and learning. So yes, you will have slept and may have nodded off more easily, but some of the benefits of sleep are lost. Alcohol is also a diuretic, so you may find yourself having to deal with a full bladder in the middle of the night too. Have you ever thought ""I need to wind down before bed, I'm going to watch some TV""? Well, the latest Brexit twists and turns on the BBC News at Ten might be bad for sleep. Dr Robbins argues: ""Often if we're watching the television it's the nightly newsâ¦ it's something that's going to cause you insomnia or stress right before bed when we're trying to power down and relax."" And as for Game of Thrones, it's hard to argue the Red Wedding was relaxing. The other issue with TV - along with smartphones and tablets - is they produce blue light, which can delay the body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Will the light from your phone kill you? You've spent so long trying to nod off you've managed to count all the sheep in New Zealand (that's about 28 million,external). So what should you do next? The answer is not to keep trying. ""We start to associate our bed with insomnia,"" said Dr Robbins. ""It does take the healthy sleeper about 15 minutes to fall asleep, but much longer than thatâ¦ make sure to get out of bed, change the environment and do something that's mindless."" Her tip - go fold some socks. Who isn't guilty of reaching for the snooze button on their phone, thinking that extra six minutes in bed is going to make all the difference? But the research team says that when the alarm goes off, we should just get up. Dr Robbins said: ""Realise you will be a bit groggy - all of us are - but resist the temptation to snooze. ""Your body will go back to sleep, but it will be very light, low-quality sleep."" Instead the advice is to throw open the curtains and expose yourself to as much bright light as possible. Snoring can be harmless, but it can also be a sign of the disorder sleep apnoea. This causes the walls of the throat to relax and narrow during sleep, and can briefly stop people breathing. People with the condition are more likely to develop high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat and have a heart attack or a stroke. One of the warning signs is loud snoring. NHS: Obstructive sleep apnoea,external Dr Robbins concludes: ""Sleep is one of the most important things we can all do tonight to improve our health, our mood, our wellbeing and our longevity.""

"This video can not be played Laleh Shahravesh on her plans to return to Dubai A British woman who faced prison in Dubai over a jibe she posted on Facebook has said she and her daughter plan to return to the country. Laleh Shahravesh, 55, was arrested at a Dubai airport after flying there to attend her ex-husband's funeral. She had faced up to two years in jail for calling his new wife a ""horse""but her case was settled with a fine. She told the BBC it was important for her daughter to revisit her father's grave without being ""clouded by fear"". In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett, Ms Shahravesh said she had travelled to Dubai to ""pay respect"" to her ex-husband, following his death from a heart attack, with her 14-year-old daughter Paris. ""It was meant to be something peaceful especially for Paris, it was very, very important for her grieving process,"" she said. ""Even though we did go to the cemetery it was clouded by fear, by sadness, by tears."" How to avoid being jailed abroad UAE spy-accused recovery will 'take years' She added that although the 33 days she spent in Dubai before returning to the UK were ""terrifying"" and ""traumatic"", ""we went there for a reason and I feel that we were robbed"". ""We've talked about it and we will probably go back because I have not been banned from returning,"" she said. The mother-of-one from Richmond in south-west London had faced prosecution over two Facebook comments she posted on pictures of her husband remarrying in 2016. She had been married to Pedro Correia Dos Santos for 18 years. Writing in Farsi Ms Shahravesh posted: ""I hope you go under the ground you idiot. Damn you. You left me for this horse."" In another post, she wrote: ""You married a horse you idiot."" The campaign group representing Ms Shahravesh, Detained in Dubai, said her ex-husband's new wife, who lives in the country, had reported the comments. Under the UAE's cyber-crime laws, a person can be jailed or fined for making defamatory statements on social media. At the time of her arrest, Ms Shahravesh was with her daughter, who later had to fly home on her own. However Ms Shahravesh was able to return to the UK last week, after being given a fine of AED3,000 (Â£625). Laleh Shahravesh was arrested in Dubai when she arrived with her teenage daughter Paris for her ex-husband's funeral Ms Shahravesh credited Detained in Dubai for helping to secure her release by bringing international media attention to her case. However, she said the British embassy ""did absolutely nothing to help my situation"", apart from providing details of lawyers, a photocopy of her passport and advising her to go to the police station to make a statement, where she says she was held for 12 hours. ""I wish to this day that I had not taken their advice to go to that police station that day,"" she added. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: ""We are pleased that Laleh has been able to return to the UK and reunite with her family. ""Our staff offered advice and support to her and her family while she was in the UAE, including on local lawyers and processes, and spoke to the Emirati authorities about her case on a number of occasions.""

"Unlike TV programmes, social media platforms do not have to give warnings when potentially harmful flashing images are about to appear A growing number of people with epilepsy have said they are having seizures triggered by flashing images on social media, a charity has warned. The Epilepsy Society wants the government's newplans to tackle ""online harms""to recommend warnings about flashing images on social media. More than 18,000 people in the UK are thought to have epilepsy that can be triggered by photosensitivity. The charity says cyber-bullies post malicious content intentionally. How can you stop your kids viewing harmful web content? Tech Tent: Should we relax about screen time? The Epilepsy Society says anyone found guilty of posting harmful images intentionally should be prosecuted for assault. The government said it would consult with the charity on the issue. Facebook - which also owns Instagram - said it had ""strict policies in place to help people who encounter abusive behaviour"". Unlike TV programmes, which are regulated by Ofcom, social media sites do not have to give a warning when potentially harmful flashing images are about to appear. About 20,000 people in the UK have photosensitive epilepsy - where seizures are triggered by flashing lights or contrasting, fast-moving images, according to the Epilepsy Society. The condition is most common in children and young people. Doctors call for drug supply clarity 'Steep rise' in epilepsy meds shortage Epilepsy Society chief executive Clare Pelham said many Facebook and Instagram users shared videos with potentially dangerous content without realising the risk they posed. ""However, when it comes to deliberately targeting people with epilepsy with the intention of causing a seizure... we need to call that behaviour what it is - a pre-meditated and pre-planned intention to assault,"" she said. ""The government must bring this behaviour within the reach of the criminal law."" Malicious social media posts appear to have useful information about epilepsy on them, but have images embedded designed to provoke a seizure. The posts are tagged with keywords around epilepsy to ""deliberately target those with the condition"", the Epilepsy Society said. Sophie Harries, a 22-year-old dietitian from Somerset, was diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy aged 15. She said it used to be easier to avoid her seizure triggers, although she was not able to go clubbing, in case there was strobe lighting. ""That is still the case, but now I have to be careful of any videos uploaded to social media that contain strobe lighting or flashing imagery,"" she said. ""The videos tend to play automatically putting me at risk of a seizure. If my friends have been out clubbing I have to avoid social media for a while."" This video can not be played Sophie says it used to be easier to avoid her seizure triggers. She recently reported a film trailer to Instagram that contained flashing lights, but it said the video did not breach its terms of usage, she said. ""You can un-follow posts but they still tend to follow you around."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Harries said she recently came across a video containing flashing images, which was tagged deliberately to the Epilepsy Society's Instagram page ""in order to harm"". ""For a 15-year-old today it is an absolute minefield. Young people are permanently on social media with friendship groups."" The Epilepsy Society has written to Digital Secretary Jeremy Wright asking for his reassurance that the new Online Harms paper will safeguard people with epilepsy. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: ""We will place a legally binding duty of care on companies towards their users, overseen by an independent regulator who will set clear safety standards. ""We are currently consulting on this, and want to hear from the Epilepsy Society, and others, about what steps they would like to see platforms take to make the internet a safer place."" A spokesperson for Facebook and Instagram told the BBC that ""everyone deserves to enjoy the benefits of the internet safely"", adding the organisations were exploring ways to make platforms ""more inclusive"".

"The fire at York Minster in 1984 was started by a lightning strike The battle to halt the devastating blaze at Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris evoked memories of the fire that took hold in York Minster 35 years ago. Millions of euros have been pledged to help rebuild Notre-Dame after Monday's fire destroyed much of the 850-year-old Gothic building. In the early hours of 9 July 1984, lightning set fire to York Minster's south transept causing Â£2.25m damage. Experts at York said restoring Notre-Dame was ""quite achievable"". John David, a master mason at York Minster, said Notre-Dame could be rebuilt using traditional crafts. Mr David, who was working at the Minster in 1984 and dealt with the reconstruction after that fire, said work to repair the building may take time, but it would be done properly. He said the two churches faced the same dilemma on reconstruction. More than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze in the south transept of the church in the centre of York Mr David said: ""At York Minster there were questions about whether we put an oak roof back on top or a steel roof or even a concrete roof. ""Some people think we can't do this sort of thing any more in traditional materials - we can, and so I think the roof will be reconstructed and put back on. ""I don't think it will take 10 years - it might take two years to decide what to do, but it's quite achievable."" Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamutweeted,externalto say he was offering prayers after the fire at Notre-Dame. The rose window at the Minster was cracked in about 40,000 places but was saved by York Glaziers Trust The blaze at York Minster left the south transept badly damaged Alan Stowe, who was the divisional fire commander at the time of the Minster blaze, said the scale of the fire may have differed but the TV pictures reminded him of the night he was called to the centre of York. He said: ""It certainly brought back very, very vivid memories of the 9 July 1984 with the sky lit by the flames leaping from the structure of that building. ""A building that, like York Minster, that's so loved, so important, so well known internationally and containing so many valuable artefacts."" Millions pledged to rebuild Notre-Dame The night York Minster was on fire Latest news and stories from Yorkshire Mr Stowe added: ""The picture that I saw was very similar to the one that confronted me as I approached the blaze at York Minster where there were so many things to be considered including difficulty of access. ""Dealing with the fire was a tremendous responsibility, a tremendous challenge, not only in minimising the damage caused by the fire.""

"Pennan and its phone box starred in Local Hero The village made famous in the film Local Hero could soon get full mobile phone coverage - but the mast required to provide it has caused controversy. Pennan in Banffshire and its iconic red phone box featured in the 1983 film. On Tuesday, Aberdeenshire councillors deferred an application on the eight-metre tall mast to get more details. A report says the mast would provide improved phone coverage, including for emergency services, but critics say it would affect the village's charm. The village is on the Banffshire coast The Bill Forsyth film, starring Burt Lancaster, saw representatives of a US petro-chemical giant, who were seeking to build a refinery in a coastal village, won over by the gentler rhythms of the local life. Back then, mobile phone technology was in its infancy; the village's traditional red painted phone box featured prominently in the plot. Today the village still has limited phone coverage, but that would be boosted if the phone mast was built, near the community hall. Local businessman and community council chairman Bill Pitt hopes a different location for the mast itself can be found. Bill Pitt told BBC Scotland that Pennan was a conservation village The mast would be erected next to the community hall The phone box which featured in the film is a tourist attraction He said: ""This is a conservation village. [The plans are] hard to understand. ""We have phone coverage already. That provides fine phone coverage. Why do we need a phone mast right in the village? ""This is a place people come to to relax. People like to get away from mobile signals, and enjoy things outside of that. ""We are hoping the area committee will take into account these objections."" Holidaymaker Fiona MacKinnon told BBC Scotland: ""I have never been to this part of the world before, my father was from Aberdeen. Local Hero was a much-loved film. ""It's been absolutely fine, but it's a strange thing to have no phone signal, you just take it for granted nowadays. It's quite odd. ""The nice thing about it is the solitude, the fact that nobody can get hold of you."" Fiona MacKinnon was visiting Pennan on holiday Asked about the possibility of a phone mast, she said: ""I'm sure the people who live here all year round would absolutely love it. ""I think it would probably be a benefit as long as you don't mind the intrusion of the mast, but like anything else you get used to it. ""I'm sure it's a good thing for the area and to have that kind of connection."" The next area committee meeting is due to take place on 28 May.

"Notre-Dame draws an estimated 13 million visitors a year Paris's beloved Notre-Dame cathedral has been one of the French capital's most famous landmarks since it was built 850 years ago. Notre-Dame, which translates in English as ""Our Lady"", has played a role in key moments of history and captured the imagination of people around the world, drawing an estimated 13 million visitors a year. A plaque outside Notre-Dame marks ""Point Zero"" - the official centre of the capital and the marker in France from which all distances to Paris are measured. A major symbol of the Catholic faith, the cathedral contains revered relics, including the crown of thorns said to have been worn by Jesus before the Crucifixion. On Monday,the main spire and roof of the building collapsed in a huge fire. People across the globe are now mourning the damage. What Notre-Dame means to the French In pictures: Notre-Dame fire aftermath Notre-Dame fire: Macron pledges to reconstruct cathedral Construction of the Notre-Dame in Paris's Ãle de la CitÃ© began under the reign of Louis VII in 1163. The first stone of the gothic building was laid in the presence of Pope Alexander III. But construction wasn't completed until 1345. Since its completion, the building has been the scene of numerous historic events. In 1431, England's Henry VI was crowned king of France inside the cathedral. It was also the scene of Napoleon Bonaparte's coronation as emperor in 1804. Joan of Arc was beatified in the cathedral and world leaders attended memorial services for former French presidents Charles de Gaulle and FranÃ§ois Mitterrand there. Joan of Arc was beatified in Notre-Dame cathedral The building was damaged during the French Revolution in the 1790s, when mobs and revolutionaries looted the interior and declared the building a ""Temple of Reason"". During this time, statues of biblical figures there were beheaded. Historian Robert Tombs told the BBC that during the Paris Commune revolution in 1871 some ""radical anti-clericals"" tried to set the building on fire but were stopped by local people. ""As there would have been no effective firefighting had the building caught fire, we might expect it to have been damaged even worse than now,"" he said. The cathedral alsosurvived the two world wars largely unscathedand famously rang its tenor bell to mark the end of Nazi occupation in 1944. Victor Hugo's 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame cemented the cathedral's place in popular culture. The book, which has since been turned into a Disney film, highlighted the poor condition the cathedral was in. This helped to prompt major restoration works in the mid-19th Century. Mr Tombs said the novel ""made the cathedral itself a character, and made it internationally famous"". Notre-Dame's school of composers has played a notable role in the birth of modern Western music. During the 12th and 13th centuries, they are credited with leading the development of polyphonic, or multi-part, compositions.

"A US local newspaper has won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of a mass shooting in its own newsroom. But there was no celebration as the Capital Gazette in Maryland learned on Monday it had won the most prestigious prize in American journalism. Staff quietly hugged in memory of five colleagues killed by a gunman who burst into their office in June 2018. Pulitzers also went to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal for investigations into President Trump. Two journalists jailed in Myanmarfor reporting a massacre of Rohingya Muslims were part of a team from Reuters news agency that also won an award. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced last year to seven years in prison for breaking the Official Secrets Act, despite an international outcry over what was widely seen as an attack on media freedom. Reuters has said it will not be celebrating the prize until their two colleagues are released. Aretha Franklin earns posthumous Pulitzer Newspaper staff defiant after shooting Remembering the victims of the Capital Gazette shooting Why the attack on BBC cameraman was no surprise The Capital Gazette in Annapolis won a special Pulitzer Prize citation for its coverage and courage in the face of one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in American history. The Pulitzer board awarded the citation with a $100,000 (Â£76,400) grant to further the newspaper's journalism. Employees John McNamara, Wendi Winters, Rebecca Smith, Gerald Fischman and Rob Hiaasen died in last summer's attack. But the staff still managed to publish a newspaper on schedule the next day. A man with a longstanding grudge against the Capital Gazette is charged with the attack. He pleaded not guilty last year. Coverage of mass shootings netted Pulitzers for two other local newspapers. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette received a breaking news award for its ""immersive, compassionate"" reporting of last October's attack at a Pennsylvania synagogue that left 11 people dead. And the South Florida Sun Sentinel won a Pulitzer for its reporting on the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead. It received the public service award for ""exposing failings by school and law enforcement officials before and after the deadly shooting rampage"". The New York Times won a prize for explanatory reporting of Mr Trump's finances and tax avoidance and another for editorial writing. The Wall Street Journal won the national reporting prize for uncovering the president's secret payoffs to two alleged former mistresses during his campaign. The Washington Post also won two Pulitzers for photojournalism in Yemen and for criticism, covering book reviews and essays.

"Bill Weld was running mate on the Libertarian ticket during the 2016 presidential election US President Donald Trump is facing a longshot challenge from within his own party ahead of next year's White House election. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld has become the first Republican to challenge Mr Trump in 2020. Mr Weld, 73, has released a campaign video contrasting his style with the current president's. But he faces an uphill battle to take over a Republican party that has been refashioned in Mr Trump's image. Mr Weld was governor of Massachusetts from 1991-97 after serving in the justice department under President Ronald Reagan. He was running mate on the Libertarian ticket during the 2016 presidential election. Which Democrat will take on Trump in 2020? How a young, gay mayor became a Democratic star Anthony Zurcher casts his eye over the Democrats ""I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we've had out of the White House the last two years that would be a political tragedy,"" he said on CNN. ""So I would be ashamed of myself if I didn't raise my hand and run."" Mr Weld's campaign video,externaltouts his cross-party credentials as a Republican who was elected in the Democratic stronghold of Massachusetts. The three-minute production contrasts his record with clips of provocative statements by Mr Trump. The video finishes with the slogan: ""A Better America Starts Here."" But underscoring the long odds for him, party leaders promptly rejected his campaign. ""Any effort to challenge the president's nomination is bound to go absolutely nowhere,"" the Republican National Committee said in statement. According to the most recent Gallup poll, 89% of Republican voters approve of the president. Mr Trump's campaign said on Sunday it had raised more than $30m in the first quarter of this year, far outpacing the political war chests of individual Democratic candidates. Ex-Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was bested by Mr Trump during the 2016 election, has recently been calling for a Republican to oust the president next year. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan have also been mentioned in recent months as potential party challengers to Mr Trump. Next year Republican and Democratic voters will hold elections known as primaries to pick their respective party's standard bearer for the November 2020 presidential election. Sitting presidents do not usually face internal challengers, and only a few have ever been denied renomination by their party. Pete Buttigieg has joined the race to stop Donald Trump from being re-elected. But who else has a shot at becoming the next president? Find out who is already running and who might join them.

"This video can not be played Risedale Sports and Community College hasn't excluded any pupils for more than six months A secondary school head teacher has stopped exclusions saying he does not want to give up on pupils, despite its performance falling as a result. Risedale Sports and Community College, in Catterick, North Yorkshire, gave out 85 fixed-term exclusions in 2015-16 but none so far this academic year. Head Colin Scott, who took up the role in 2017, said he wanted to increase attendance and ""work on the kids"". But he admitted keeping some pupils had caused performance figures to ""drop"". ""It is our view that if we are going to help support these kids, we can't give up on them,"" Mr Scott said. ""They might give up on themselves but we don't give up on them."" Mr Scott said he would prefer to keep pupils in school and work on their behaviour than expel them In 2016-17 there were 7,720 permanent exclusions at schools in England, a rise of 67% since 2012-13. In 2016-17 there were 381,865 fixed-term exclusions at schools in England, a rise of 43% since 2012-13. A fixed-term exclusion can be anything from part of a day to a maximum of 45 days within a single academic year. The increase in exclusions has promptedOfsted to write to head teachersurging them to do more for troubled students. Risedale Sports and Community College, in Catterick, has 512 pupils aged 11-16 years The school is in a military town three miles south of Richmond and has one of the largest proportions of service children (50%) of any secondary school in the UK. It currently has 512 students aged 11-16 years. A school's performance is measured through pupils' progress, called Progress 8, via a scoring system of between -1 and 1, with the average being 0. A score lower than 0 is recognised as not achieving the minimum standard expected by the government, with -1 being well below average. Mr Scott, himself an Ofsted inspector and former police special constable, said keeping some children in school, who otherwise would have been excluded, had ""caused a 0.2 drop in our P8 figure"" despite some pupils ""only being with us a matter of months"". ""What we have been able to do is to support the management of behaviour better, keep kids in school more, and work on the kids while we've got them in school to help support their behaviours,"" A ""new system of behaviour management"" has been instigated by Mr Scott At Risedale, pupils who may previously have been excluded can be moved from their usual class to another for a day, or go to a room to work on their own. Are school exclusions causing knife crime? Excluded pupils 'abandoned by schools' Pupil exclusion rate rise 'concerning' Gary Morley, attendance and family support officer at the school, said teachers, students and parents all seemed to be happy with the way behaviour was now dealt with. ""Over the past two years it has been a lot calmer - the head teacher and the school have a new system of behaviour management that has made things very calm throughout the school. ""It works well. Everybody seems to know where they're going and what they're doing."" The school has not excluded any pupils yet in this academic year Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield said there were some schools that were ""keener on excluding children"" to attain better performance levels. ""Recent figures we've produced show 88% of exclusions take part in just 10% of schools"". ""Those schools that are chasing the academic grades are much more likely to want to have those children off site and off their books."" She said she wanted schools to provide more support to children at risk of exclusion and to ""keep them in school"". Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Climate change protesters explain why they glued themselves to a lorry Nearly 300 climate change activists have been arrested after roads were blocked in central London, amid protests aimed at shutting the capital. A second day of disruption took place after Extinction Rebellion campaigners camped overnight at Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus. Up to 500,000 people were affected by the diversion of 55 bus routes. The Met said 290 people had been arrested.During protests in Edinburgh, 29 arrests were made. Organisers said protests had been held in more than 80 cities across 33 countries. In London, motorists face gridlocked traffic on a number of alternative routes, such as Westminster Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge. Transport for London warned bus users that routes would remain on diversion or terminate early. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said although he ""shared the passion"" of the activists, he was ""extremely concerned"" about plans some had to disrupt the Tube on Wednesday. ""Ongoing demonstrations are causing serious disruption to public transport, local businesses and Londoners who wish to go about their daily business,"" Ch Supt Colin Wingrove, of the Met, said. Police have arrested people on Waterloo Bridge Campaigners have been ordered to restrict their protests to Marble Arch after they causedwidespread disruption on Monday. That order will continue until 21:10 on Friday. Three men and two women, in their 40s and 50s, arrested on suspicion of criminal damage at Shell's headquarters in London on Monday, have since been released while inquiries continue. The majority of the other protesters detained have been held on suspicion of public order offences. Protesters formed a human blockade and resisted requests for them to disperse, police said Mr Khan said it was ""absolutely crucial"" to get more people to use public transport to tackle climate change, and urged the protesters not to disrupt the Tube. ""Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change, as well as risking Londoners' safety, and I'd implore anyone considering doing so to think again,"" he said. Climate protesters block roads What is climate change? The protesters who want to get arrested But Extinction Rebellion has said it wanted to ""shut down London"" until 29 April. Itcalled for ""reinforcements"",externalto help maintain the roadblock at Waterloo Bridge. Demonstrators performed on Waterloo Bridge despite police warning that anyone refusing to move on would be arrested Hundreds of protesters tried to hinder the police effort to move them on, including four who glued and chained themselves under a lorry parked on the bridge. Ben Moss, 42, from Islington, north London, said he had glued himself to the bars of the lorry as ""personal action to the moral issue of the climate crisis and ecological collapse"". ""I'm doing this because I want the government to do something. I've got a week off work - if more is necessary I can make my excuses,"" he added. Four people glued and chained themselves to a lorry on Waterloo Bridge An order has restricted protesters to gathering in the area around Marble Arch On Monday, a pink boat was parked in the centre of Oxford Circus where some activists locked their arms together with makeshift devices, while oil company Shell's headquarters on Belvedere Road were vandalised. Since its launch last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change"", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. One of the group's founders, Roger Hallam, believes that mass participation and civil disobedience maximise the chances of social change. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched. The second day of action included speeches at Parliament Square about how to tackle climate change. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Shamaan Freeman-Powell, BBC News Oxford Street has been empty of traffic since activists parked a pink boat in Oxford Circus on Monday Oxford Circus is usually one of the busiest crossroads in London, but only scores of protesters and bemused onlookers can be found in the middle of the road today. Food stalls offering free porridge, and clothing lines for dirty laundry have been erected. Children as young as six are making use of the freshly-drawn hopscotch, running around the tents and flying colourful banners. One campaigner, who attended the protest with her two children, says she was protesting for the people who are ""the most vulnerable, and least responsible for climate change"". Her nine-year-old daughter says she wishes her school taught her more on the issue. Most protesters say the police have been encouraging - despite the number of arrests - although taxi drivers and shoppers complained of the disruption. The government said it shared ""people's passion"" to combat climate change and ""protect our planet for future generations"". The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said the UK had cut its emissions by 44% since 1990. A spokesman said: ""We've asked our independent climate experts for advice on a net zero emissions target and set out plans to transition to low emission vehicles and significantly reduce pollution through ourClean Air Strategy,external.""

"Debbie Headspeath bought codeine from online pharmacies New rules to keep people safe when buying medications from online pharmacies have been described as a ""big step forward"" by Britain's pharmacy regulator. It comes after patients and relatives raised concerns,as well as an investigation by BBC Panorama. The General Pharmaceutical Council has issued guidance for providers. It will help regulate access to addictive medication, such as strong painkillers. Duncan Rudkin, the General Pharmaceutical Council's chief executive, told the BBC that he hoped the new rules would ""make an important difference to improving standards of safety and care for patients"". The way some online pharmacy websites operate will change, and more checks will be done on medications. Extra safety measures include: Sites cannot be set up in a way that allows patients to choose a prescription-only medication before an online consultation with a healthcare professional More safeguards will be introduced for certain medications, including antibiotics and medicines that need ongoing monitoring or management For medications that are liable to abuse, overuse or misuse, or when there is a risk of addiction, the prescriber needs to contact the GP in advance of issuing the prescription (and they have confirmed it is appropriate for the patient and the appropriate monitoring is in place) Online pharmacy websites should be clear about the identity and/or location of the pharmacies issuing prescriptions Mr Rudkin said the Panorama programme ""was really helpful in shining a light on a really important area of public safety"". It revealed how easy it was for patients to buy drugs online that their own GPs would be highly unlikely to prescribe. Buying medications online 'can put health at risk' Patients contacted Panorama after the programme. Kevin Duggan said his sister had been exploited Debbie Headspeath, 41, died in 2017 in Ipswich. Her brother, Kevin Duggan told the BBC that after her death, they found on bank statements that she had bought codeine from 18 online UK pharmacies. Debbie had started a new job with war veterans and, despite waking up with stomach pains, she did not want to miss work. ""She put her jacket and bag on and then collapsed by the front door. She wasn't found until several hours later when her partner came home from work and it was too late and she had gone. She died."" Debbie had been prescribed the opiate-based painkiller dihydrocodeine by her family doctor in 2008 after developing back pain. After several years, it was recognised she was addicted. The family doctor tried to wean her off, but she was able to secretly buy medication, prescribed by doctors and dispensed by UK pharmacies, without her GP being informed by the companies. Kevin said: ""There's no justification for what they do, which is exploiting people with an addiction. I would like to invite the companies to try and justify their actions to my mum. ""To look my mum in the eyes and explain why they allowed this to happen."" The inquest, which will decide the cause of death, is next month, but her brother told the BBC he felt the codeine had contributed to her death. Another relative of a patient contacted the BBC. His wife had developed back pain after the birth of their first child in 2014. In 2016, he realised she was addicted to dihydrocodeine - the same drug prescribed to Debbie - and asked her GP to help her get off them. In 2017, she found out she was pregnant again. ""I think when she fell pregnant she was taking 20 pills a day secretly. ""Then I think she realised, and then the midwife weaned her down to eight to 10 pills a day. And as a consequence of that, you know, my son was born addicted to opiates. ""To see your child in such distress, to see jerky movements; the shaking. It's something that I wouldn't want anybody to ever go through."" His wife managed to come off the pills, but she has recently relapsed. He says that, so far, the medications have cost them nearly Â£25,000. Mr Rudkin told the BBC: ""I really want to acknowledge the pain that some families have experienced that's been associated in some cases with online pharmacies. ""It's really important that the stories help to change regulations. We've taken steps to address the risk."" You can watchPanorama: Online Doctors Uncoveredon BBC iPlayer.

"Bill Weld was running mate on the Libertarian ticket during the 2016 presidential election US President Donald Trump is facing a longshot challenge from within his own party ahead of next year's White House election. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld has become the first Republican to challenge Mr Trump in 2020. Mr Weld, 73, has released a campaign video contrasting his style with the current president's. But he faces an uphill battle to take over a Republican party that has been refashioned in Mr Trump's image. Mr Weld was governor of Massachusetts from 1991-97 after serving in the justice department under President Ronald Reagan. He was running mate on the Libertarian ticket during the 2016 presidential election. Which Democrat will take on Trump in 2020? How a young, gay mayor became a Democratic star Anthony Zurcher casts his eye over the Democrats ""I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we've had out of the White House the last two years that would be a political tragedy,"" he said on CNN. ""So I would be ashamed of myself if I didn't raise my hand and run."" Mr Weld's campaign video,externaltouts his cross-party credentials as a Republican who was elected in the Democratic stronghold of Massachusetts. The three-minute production contrasts his record with clips of provocative statements by Mr Trump. The video finishes with the slogan: ""A Better America Starts Here."" But underscoring the long odds for him, party leaders promptly rejected his campaign. ""Any effort to challenge the president's nomination is bound to go absolutely nowhere,"" the Republican National Committee said in statement. According to the most recent Gallup poll, 89% of Republican voters approve of the president. Mr Trump's campaign said on Sunday it had raised more than $30m in the first quarter of this year, far outpacing the political war chests of individual Democratic candidates. Ex-Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was bested by Mr Trump during the 2016 election, has recently been calling for a Republican to oust the president next year. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan have also been mentioned in recent months as potential party challengers to Mr Trump. Next year Republican and Democratic voters will hold elections known as primaries to pick their respective party's standard bearer for the November 2020 presidential election. Sitting presidents do not usually face internal challengers, and only a few have ever been denied renomination by their party. Pete Buttigieg has joined the race to stop Donald Trump from being re-elected. But who else has a shot at becoming the next president? Find out who is already running and who might join them.

"Families in England will find out on Tuesday whether their children have got into their preferred primary schools. Last year about one in 10 families missed out on their first choice - but 98% got one of their top three places. Primary schools have added 636,000 extra places since 2010 to meet rising numbers - but that demographic bulge is now moving on to secondary. Head teachers' leader Paul Whiteman said securing a place can ""feel like a battle for parents"". More than 600,000 families will find out where they have been offered a school place for the autumn. The national picture on applications will not be known until June, but the chances of getting a first-choice place have been improving in recent years - up from 88% in 2014 to 91% in 2018. But last year, about 2% did not get an offer on their three top preferences or any of the schools they named. Top tips on choosing a primary school Wealthier families do better out of school appeal system Population boom moves from primary to secondary There are big regional variations each year - with authorities such as the East Riding of Yorkshire, Northumberland and Rutland having more than 97% of families getting their first preferences. But the lowest success rates tend to be in London, with only 68% of families in Kensington and Chelsea and 77% in Camden getting their first choice last year. A population boom had put pressure on places - but that has peaked and this year's application numbers could show a downward trend. For the past decade, primary schools have been building extra classrooms as pupil numbers rose by about 15% between 2009 and 2018, up to 4.7 million. The size of the average primary school grew by an extra 42 places, but this has not been spread evenly, with some expanding very significantly and with some areas still struggling to meet demand. Mr Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called for a more joined-up ""national strategy"" to ensure enough places. Otherwise, he said, ""the annual anxious wait for families will continue"". Mr Whiteman warned of a ""haphazard"" approach to expansion, so that ""new school places are not always being commissioned in the areas they are most needed"". School standards minister Nick Gibb said standards had risen and the primary school sector was ""unrecognisable from a generation ago"". He said 87% of primary schools were now judged good or outstanding, and the use of phonics lessons had improved children's reading. ""What this means in practice is that even in instances where parents aren't getting the news they hoped for today, the likelihood is that their child will be attending a school which will provide a first-class education,"" said Mr Gibb. But the New Schools Network, which promotes free schools, said too many children would still be heading for schools which were below the rating of ""good"". ""Finding out which primary school your child is going to should be a time of excitement, but today nearly 100,000 families will find out their child is being sent to a school that isn't good enough,"" said the group's director, Luke Tryl.

"Pennan and its phone box starred in Local Hero The village made famous in the film Local Hero could soon get full mobile phone coverage - but the mast required to provide it has caused controversy. Pennan in Banffshire and its iconic red phone box featured in the 1983 film. On Tuesday, Aberdeenshire councillors deferred an application on the eight-metre tall mast to get more details. A report says the mast would provide improved phone coverage, including for emergency services, but critics say it would affect the village's charm. The village is on the Banffshire coast The Bill Forsyth film, starring Burt Lancaster, saw representatives of a US petro-chemical giant, who were seeking to build a refinery in a coastal village, won over by the gentler rhythms of the local life. Back then, mobile phone technology was in its infancy; the village's traditional red painted phone box featured prominently in the plot. Today the village still has limited phone coverage, but that would be boosted if the phone mast was built, near the community hall. Local businessman and community council chairman Bill Pitt hopes a different location for the mast itself can be found. Bill Pitt told BBC Scotland that Pennan was a conservation village The mast would be erected next to the community hall The phone box which featured in the film is a tourist attraction He said: ""This is a conservation village. [The plans are] hard to understand. ""We have phone coverage already. That provides fine phone coverage. Why do we need a phone mast right in the village? ""This is a place people come to to relax. People like to get away from mobile signals, and enjoy things outside of that. ""We are hoping the area committee will take into account these objections."" Holidaymaker Fiona MacKinnon told BBC Scotland: ""I have never been to this part of the world before, my father was from Aberdeen. Local Hero was a much-loved film. ""It's been absolutely fine, but it's a strange thing to have no phone signal, you just take it for granted nowadays. It's quite odd. ""The nice thing about it is the solitude, the fact that nobody can get hold of you."" Fiona MacKinnon was visiting Pennan on holiday Asked about the possibility of a phone mast, she said: ""I'm sure the people who live here all year round would absolutely love it. ""I think it would probably be a benefit as long as you don't mind the intrusion of the mast, but like anything else you get used to it. ""I'm sure it's a good thing for the area and to have that kind of connection."" The next area committee meeting is due to take place on 28 May.

"Delayed discharges take up much needed hospital beds More than 200 people died in Northern Ireland's hospitals in 2018 while waiting to be discharged. A report bythe charity Marie Curie,externalalso showed delayed discharges resulted in patients spending thousands of extra days in hospital. This was despite the patients being declared ready to go home. The Health and Social Care Board said ensuring all patients were able to either return home or to a community setting was a key priority. Some of the patients had a terminal illness, such as cancer or a respiratory condition. Others may have been approaching the natural end of their lives. In Northern Ireland in 2018 204Total deaths 56Northern Trust 52Belfast Trust 48Southern Trust 34South Eastern Trust 14Western Trust Instead of being cared for at home or in the community, the report says 204 people were stuck in hospital and eventually died there. Freedom of Information requests were sent to all of the five local health trusts. While there is no breakdown of types of illness and patient, the data may also include those who at the last minute decided not to go home. Head of policy and public affairs for Marie Curie Northern Ireland, Joan McEwan, expressed disappointment at the findings. ""The local population is getting older and we are seeing more and more people living with terminal illnesses and complex needs,"" she said. ""Not only is this resulting in greater numbers of hospital admissions, it is also putting massive additional pressure on community care, which is vital in helping the safe and prompt discharge of patients back home."" This video can not be played 'Delays unacceptable for terminally ill' Delayed discharges clog up the system and take up much-needed hospital beds. The report, Every Minute Matters, highlighted that more than 46,000 bed days were lost across the system. This dramatically impacts on the day-to-day running of a hospital. On a more personal note, delayed hospital discharge has a significant impact on terminally ill people, causing distress and frustration, affecting their quality of life and preventing men and women from spending as much time as possible in their own home or community, surrounded by family. The statistics should not come as a surprise. An older population means more people are being admitted to hospital with multiple chronic illnesses. Not enough health care workers or home care packages means people cannot leave hospital. Louise Marshall said it was important for the family that her mother was able to die at home Louise Marshall's mother, Maureen Patrick, died from cancer in February 2018. The 59-year-old was cared for at home during her final days. Ms Marshall said it was very important for the whole family that her mother was able to die at home. ""She always said before she went into hospital that she wanted to make sure she was home, to have her family around her in her last days,"" she said. The County Down woman said it also enabled them to say goodbye in familiar surroundings. ""It definitely is a help - we know we fulfilled my mum's last wishes, she died not afraid and we all got to kiss her and say goodbye,"" she said. Joan McEwan saidthe lack of an assembly and executivehad ""stymied"" HSC transformation. According to Marie Curie, both the departments of health and finance should work with stakeholders to scope out potential funding measures for adult social care including long-term strategic funding for health trusts. Population growth in Northern Ireland has not been matched by increased funding, especially around social care. Between 2007 and 2017, the number of local people older than 65 grew by more than 25%, while the number of those older than 85 grew by more than 30%. In a statement on behalf of the health and social care system, a spokesperson said: ""Growing numbers of people are living longer with complex needs and this is why the reform of adult care and support project has been tasked with identifying and implementing necessary reforms to enhance the support available in communities. ""There is also a very strong commitment to ensuring that any patient in the end stages of life is treated with absolute care and compassion. ""Trusts do their utmost to support and prioritise the wishes of patients at the end of life and their families, including facilitating their return to a home or a community setting where it is appropriate to do so. ""The Palliative Care in Partnership initiative in Northern Ireland brings together statutory and community and voluntary sector providers, including Mare Curie, and also service users and carers to improve how patients with palliative care needs are identified and supported, and also seeks to enhance the range of services available.""

"This video can not be played Climate change protesters explain why they glued themselves to a lorry Nearly 300 climate change activists have been arrested after roads were blocked in central London, amid protests aimed at shutting the capital. A second day of disruption took place after Extinction Rebellion campaigners camped overnight at Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus. Up to 500,000 people were affected by the diversion of 55 bus routes. The Met said 290 people had been arrested.During protests in Edinburgh, 29 arrests were made. Organisers said protests had been held in more than 80 cities across 33 countries. In London, motorists face gridlocked traffic on a number of alternative routes, such as Westminster Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge. Transport for London warned bus users that routes would remain on diversion or terminate early. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said although he ""shared the passion"" of the activists, he was ""extremely concerned"" about plans some had to disrupt the Tube on Wednesday. ""Ongoing demonstrations are causing serious disruption to public transport, local businesses and Londoners who wish to go about their daily business,"" Ch Supt Colin Wingrove, of the Met, said. Police have arrested people on Waterloo Bridge Campaigners have been ordered to restrict their protests to Marble Arch after they causedwidespread disruption on Monday. That order will continue until 21:10 on Friday. Three men and two women, in their 40s and 50s, arrested on suspicion of criminal damage at Shell's headquarters in London on Monday, have since been released while inquiries continue. The majority of the other protesters detained have been held on suspicion of public order offences. Protesters formed a human blockade and resisted requests for them to disperse, police said Mr Khan said it was ""absolutely crucial"" to get more people to use public transport to tackle climate change, and urged the protesters not to disrupt the Tube. ""Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change, as well as risking Londoners' safety, and I'd implore anyone considering doing so to think again,"" he said.

"Construction on Stonehenge probably began about 3,000BC The ancestors of the people who built Stonehenge travelled west across the Mediterranean before reaching Britain, a study has shown. Researchers compared DNA extracted from Neolithic human remains found across Britain with that of people alive at the same time in Europe. The Neolithic inhabitants were descended from populations originating in Anatolia (modern Turkey) that moved to Iberia before heading north. They reached Britain in about 4,000BC. Details have beenpublished in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.,external The migration to Britain was just one part of a general, massive expansion of people out of Anatolia in 6,000BC that introduced farming to Europe. Before that, Europe was populated by small, travelling groups which hunted animals and gathered wild plants and shellfish. One group of early farmers followed the river Danube up into Central Europe, but another group travelled west across the Mediterranean. DNA reveals that Neolithic Britons were largely descended from groups who took the Mediterranean route, either hugging the coast or hopping from island-to-island on boats. Some British groups had a minor amount of ancestry from groups that followed the Danube route. A facial reconstruction of Whitehawk Woman, a 5,600-year-old Neolithic woman from Sussex. The reconstruction is on show at the Royal Pavilion & Museum in Brighton When the researchers analysed the DNA of early British farmers, they found they most closely resembled Neolithic people from Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal). These Iberian farmers were descended from people who had journeyed across the Mediterranean. From Iberia, or somewhere close, the Mediterranean farmers travelled north through France. They might have entered Britain from the west, through Wales or south-west England. Indeed, radiocarbon dates suggest that Neolithic people arrived marginally earlier in the west, but this remains a topic for future work. In addition to farming, the Neolithic migrants to Britain appear to have introduced the tradition of building monuments using large stones known as megaliths. Stonehenge in Wiltshire was part of this tradition. Although Britain was inhabited by groups of ""western hunter-gatherers"" when the farmers arrived in about 4,000BC, DNA shows that the two groups did not mix very much at all. The British hunter-gatherers were almost completely replaced by the Neolithic farmers, apart from one group in western Scotland, where the Neolithic inhabitants had elevated local ancestry. This could have come down to the farmer groups simply having greater numbers. ""We don't find any detectable evidence at all for the local British western hunter-gatherer ancestry in the Neolithic farmers after they arrive,"" said co-author Dr Tom Booth, a specialist in ancient DNA from the Natural History Museum in London. ""That doesn't mean they don't mix at all, it just means that maybe their population sizes were too small to have left any kind of genetic legacy."" Co-author Professor Mark Thomas, from UCL, said he also favoured ""a numbers game explanation"". A reconstruction of Cheddar Man. As with other Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, DNA results suggest he had dark skin and blue or green eyes Professor Thomas said the Neolithic farmers had probably had to adapt their practices to different climatic conditions as they moved across Europe. But by the time they reached Britain they were already ""tooled up"" and well-prepared for growing crops in a north-west European climate. The study also analysed DNA from these British hunter-gatherers. One of the skeletons analysed was that of Cheddar Man, whose skeletal remains have been dated to 7,100BC. He was the subject of a reconstruction unveiled at the Natural History Museum last year. DNA suggests that, like most other European hunter-gatherers of the time, he had dark skin combined with blue eyes. Genetic analysis shows that the Neolithic farmers, by contrast, were paler-skinned with brown eyes and black or dark-brown hair. Towards the end of the Neolithic, in about 2,450BC, the descendants of the first farmers were themselves almost entirely replaced when a new population - called the Bell Beaker people - migrated from mainland Europe. So Britain saw two extreme genetic shifts in the space of a few thousand years. Prof Thomas said that this later event happened after the Neolithic population had been in decline for some time, both in Britain and across Europe. He cautioned against simplistic explanations invoking conflict, and said the shifts ultimately came down to ""economic"" factors, about which lifestyles were best suited to exploit the landscape. Dr Booth explained: ""It's difficult to see whether the two [genetic shifts] could have anything in common - they're two very different kinds of change. There's speculation that they're to some extent population collapses. But the reasons suggested for those two collapses are different, so it could just be coincidence.""

"Extinction Rebellion blocked Waterloo Bridge on Monday Thousands of people joined protests across central London as climate change activists blocked roads and vandalised Shell's headquarters. Extinction Rebellion campaigners parked a pink boat at Oxford Circus and blocked Marble Arch, Piccadilly Circus and roads around Parliament Square. Protester Yen Chit Chong said: ""This is our last best shot at survival."" Among a total of 52 arrests, five people were detained on suspicion of criminal damage at Shell's HQ. The three men and two women were taken to a police station in central London after a glass door was smashed at the offices near Waterloo. The majority of those arrested were detained on suspicion of public order offences. Just after midnight on Monday, Transport for London (TfL) confirmed it had suspended bus services on the N18 route because Great Portland Street was blocked by protesters. Earlier, police had ordered the protesters to restrict their actions to the Marble Arch area to prevent further disruption. Protesters parked a boat at Oxford Circus to represent the threat posed by rising sea levels Organisers claim protests have been held in more than 80 cities across 33 countries. Protester Olivia Evershed, 23, said: ""I hope that it's really going to bring awareness about the emergency crisis that we are in, and encourage the government to act. ""We've got 12 years to act before there is irreversible damage to the environment and we start to see catastrophic changes. If we don't do anything to change this, our children will die.""

"This video can not be played Risedale Sports and Community College hasn't excluded any pupils for more than six months A secondary school head teacher has stopped exclusions saying he does not want to give up on pupils, despite its performance falling as a result. Risedale Sports and Community College, in Catterick, North Yorkshire, gave out 85 fixed-term exclusions in 2015-16 but none so far this academic year. Head Colin Scott, who took up the role in 2017, said he wanted to increase attendance and ""work on the kids"". But he admitted keeping some pupils had caused performance figures to ""drop"". ""It is our view that if we are going to help support these kids, we can't give up on them,"" Mr Scott said. ""They might give up on themselves but we don't give up on them."" Mr Scott said he would prefer to keep pupils in school and work on their behaviour than expel them In 2016-17 there were 7,720 permanent exclusions at schools in England, a rise of 67% since 2012-13. In 2016-17 there were 381,865 fixed-term exclusions at schools in England, a rise of 43% since 2012-13. A fixed-term exclusion can be anything from part of a day to a maximum of 45 days within a single academic year. The increase in exclusions has promptedOfsted to write to head teachersurging them to do more for troubled students. Risedale Sports and Community College, in Catterick, has 512 pupils aged 11-16 years The school is in a military town three miles south of Richmond and has one of the largest proportions of service children (50%) of any secondary school in the UK. It currently has 512 students aged 11-16 years. A school's performance is measured through pupils' progress, called Progress 8, via a scoring system of between -1 and 1, with the average being 0. A score lower than 0 is recognised as not achieving the minimum standard expected by the government, with -1 being well below average. Mr Scott, himself an Ofsted inspector and former police special constable, said keeping some children in school, who otherwise would have been excluded, had ""caused a 0.2 drop in our P8 figure"" despite some pupils ""only being with us a matter of months"". ""What we have been able to do is to support the management of behaviour better, keep kids in school more, and work on the kids while we've got them in school to help support their behaviours,"" A ""new system of behaviour management"" has been instigated by Mr Scott At Risedale, pupils who may previously have been excluded can be moved from their usual class to another for a day, or go to a room to work on their own. Are school exclusions causing knife crime? Excluded pupils 'abandoned by schools' Pupil exclusion rate rise 'concerning' Gary Morley, attendance and family support officer at the school, said teachers, students and parents all seemed to be happy with the way behaviour was now dealt with. ""Over the past two years it has been a lot calmer - the head teacher and the school have a new system of behaviour management that has made things very calm throughout the school. ""It works well. Everybody seems to know where they're going and what they're doing."" The school has not excluded any pupils yet in this academic year Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield said there were some schools that were ""keener on excluding children"" to attain better performance levels. ""Recent figures we've produced show 88% of exclusions take part in just 10% of schools"".

"This video can not be played Risedale Sports and Community College hasn't excluded any pupils for more than six months A secondary school head teacher has stopped exclusions saying he does not want to give up on pupils, despite its performance falling as a result. Risedale Sports and Community College, in Catterick, North Yorkshire, gave out 85 fixed-term exclusions in 2015-16 but none so far this academic year. Head Colin Scott, who took up the role in 2017, said he wanted to increase attendance and ""work on the kids"". But he admitted keeping some pupils had caused performance figures to ""drop"". ""It is our view that if we are going to help support these kids, we can't give up on them,"" Mr Scott said. ""They might give up on themselves but we don't give up on them."" Mr Scott said he would prefer to keep pupils in school and work on their behaviour than expel them In 2016-17 there were 7,720 permanent exclusions at schools in England, a rise of 67% since 2012-13. In 2016-17 there were 381,865 fixed-term exclusions at schools in England, a rise of 43% since 2012-13. A fixed-term exclusion can be anything from part of a day to a maximum of 45 days within a single academic year. The increase in exclusions has promptedOfsted to write to head teachersurging them to do more for troubled students. Risedale Sports and Community College, in Catterick, has 512 pupils aged 11-16 years The school is in a military town three miles south of Richmond and has one of the largest proportions of service children (50%) of any secondary school in the UK. It currently has 512 students aged 11-16 years. A school's performance is measured through pupils' progress, called Progress 8, via a scoring system of between -1 and 1, with the average being 0. A score lower than 0 is recognised as not achieving the minimum standard expected by the government, with -1 being well below average. Mr Scott, himself an Ofsted inspector and former police special constable, said keeping some children in school, who otherwise would have been excluded, had ""caused a 0.2 drop in our P8 figure"" despite some pupils ""only being with us a matter of months"". ""What we have been able to do is to support the management of behaviour better, keep kids in school more, and work on the kids while we've got them in school to help support their behaviours,"" A ""new system of behaviour management"" has been instigated by Mr Scott At Risedale, pupils who may previously have been excluded can be moved from their usual class to another for a day, or go to a room to work on their own. Are school exclusions causing knife crime? Excluded pupils 'abandoned by schools' Pupil exclusion rate rise 'concerning' Gary Morley, attendance and family support officer at the school, said teachers, students and parents all seemed to be happy with the way behaviour was now dealt with. ""Over the past two years it has been a lot calmer - the head teacher and the school have a new system of behaviour management that has made things very calm throughout the school. ""It works well. Everybody seems to know where they're going and what they're doing."" The school has not excluded any pupils yet in this academic year Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield said there were some schools that were ""keener on excluding children"" to attain better performance levels. ""Recent figures we've produced show 88% of exclusions take part in just 10% of schools"". ""Those schools that are chasing the academic grades are much more likely to want to have those children off site and off their books."" She said she wanted schools to provide more support to children at risk of exclusion and to ""keep them in school"". Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Extinction Rebellion blocked Waterloo Bridge on Monday Thousands of people joined protests across central London as climate change activists blocked roads and vandalised Shell's headquarters. Extinction Rebellion campaigners parked a pink boat at Oxford Circus and blocked Marble Arch, Piccadilly Circus and roads around Parliament Square. Protester Yen Chit Chong said: ""This is our last best shot at survival."" Among a total of 52 arrests, five people were detained on suspicion of criminal damage at Shell's HQ. The three men and two women were taken to a police station in central London after a glass door was smashed at the offices near Waterloo. The majority of those arrested were detained on suspicion of public order offences. Just after midnight on Monday, Transport for London (TfL) confirmed it had suspended bus services on the N18 route because Great Portland Street was blocked by protesters. Earlier, police had ordered the protesters to restrict their actions to the Marble Arch area to prevent further disruption. Protesters parked a boat at Oxford Circus to represent the threat posed by rising sea levels Organisers claim protests have been held in more than 80 cities across 33 countries. Protester Olivia Evershed, 23, said: ""I hope that it's really going to bring awareness about the emergency crisis that we are in, and encourage the government to act. ""We've got 12 years to act before there is irreversible damage to the environment and we start to see catastrophic changes. If we don't do anything to change this, our children will die."" A truck was used to block off a road in Marble Arch, with members locking themselves under the vehicle Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Extinction Rebellion said protests would continue throughout the week ""escalating the creative disruption across the capital day by day"". The group said it planned to ""bring London to a standstill for up to two weeks"", and wanted the government to take urgent action to tackle climate change. In Parliament Square, protesters unfurled banners, held up placards and waved flags as speakers took to the stage. Since its launch last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change"", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. One of the group's founders, Roger Hallam, believes that mass participation and civil disobedience maximise the chances of social change. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched. Protesters caused more than Â£6,000 damage at the Shell headquarters in Belvedere Road Oil company Shell had its London headquarters targeted By intentionally causing more than Â£6,000 damage at the Shell headquarters activists aim to get the case into crown court to put their case to a jury, the campaign said. A Shell spokesman said: ""We respect the right of everyone to express their point of view. We only ask that they do so with their safety and the safety of others in mind."" Allow Twitter content?

In November, activists blockaded the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy bychaining themselves together on the pavement, leading to 85 arrests. By Matthew Cannon, BBC News The unusual sight of a pink yacht stands in the centre of Oxford Circus, surrounded by protesters holding aloft a sea of coloured flags. The focus here is on the future of the planet - and there is a sense of urgency. Some are wearing red to symbolise ""the blood of dying species"", one group wants to ""save the bees"", while a man dressed as a centaur holds a placard which says ""climate change is not a myth... unlike centaurs"". Two young women tell me they are not willing to have children due to their fears for the world they will be bringing them into. Another man, who plans to protest through the night, says the protests will be peaceful but he is willing to be arrested. ""The more the authorities will get fed up with us the more it brings us to their attention,"" he said. Organisers have encouraged people to set up camp in Hyde Park overnight into Tuesday - an offence under Royal Parks legislation. A spokeswoman for The Royal Parks said Extinction Rebellion had not asked for permission to begin the protest in the park and that camping was not allowed.

"This video can not be played The Edinburgh couple who are part of a kidney transplant chain When Mandy Murray found out she needed a new kidney her husband Graham volunteered to be a donor but was told he was not a match. Instead the couple became part of a kidney swap chain, which is allowing more people to find live donors. Mandy first needed a kidney transplant about 19 years ago. Because her husband was not compatible, Mandy had to wait until a suitable donation became available from a deceased donor. She considers herself lucky to have got a phone call in the middle of the night and been rushed to hospital to receive the donor kidney. Many people are not so fortunate. Last year, 26 people in Scotland died while waiting for a kidney transplant. Mandy Graham had a kidney transplant from a deceased donor 19 years ago When a person needs a new kidney they first turn to family and friends to find a living donor. Doctors says patients who have a living kidney transplant tend to live longer and feel better than those who receive kidneys from a deceased donor. Mandy's new kidney allowed her to function for 18 years but it has recently started to decline and she was told she would need another transplant. Her husband Graham was tested again but was still not a match. Mandy's husband Graham was not a potential donor match for his wife However, Mandy's consultant told her about theUK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme,,externalwhich has been running for more than a decade. ""It is where couples like us can be paired up and help each other out,"" says Mandy. ""My brilliant husband didn't hesitate for a moment. ""I tried desperately to talk him out of it but he was having none of it."" The kidney sharing scheme uses an algorithm designed at Glasgow University. It goes through everyone who has volunteered and tries to find better matches and maximise the number of possible transplants. The computer programme is run four times a year and the transplants are then scheduled by a dedicated coordinator. Sarah Lundie is one of the donor scheme coordinators It is a logistical challenge, according to Sarah Lundie, the coordinator at Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary. In order for even the simplest kidney swap to go ahead you need two healthy donors and two recipients who are also not suffering from any illnesses. If any one of them gets so much as a cold, the whole carefully arranged schedule must be cancelled. Ms Lundie must also make sure that there are operating theatres booked at both locations and four surgeons must be available to carry out the procedures, not to mention their extensive back-up teams. There is also a great deal of liaison going on to ensure that the organs are transported from the donors to the recipients at the same time. Graham and Mandy said it was a relief to get to the day of the operation As he sat in Edinburgh waiting to donate his kidney, Graham Murray, 53, was aware that there was someone in Belfast, who must remain anonymous, waiting to give up a kidney so that it could be donated to Mandy. Graham says: ""Getting to this morning with everyone fit and healthy and ready to go is a great relief."" His wife Mandy, 57, says they have felt the ""responsibility"" of keeping well in the weeks before the operations so that the donor sharing chain would not be broken. She says: ""Graham and I decided to sequester ourselves in our house, get our shopping delivered and really try not to catch anything so we could make sure that bond could be maintained."" Graham and his counterpart in Belfast are the first part of the surgical equation. Both donor kidneys are removed simultaneously in the two locations. In Edinburgh, consultant transplant surgeon John Terrace scrubs up for an operation he says usually takes about three hours. Mr John Terrace, consultant transplant surgeon, RIE ""I'm thinking about the donor rather than the recipient,"" he says. ""The focus with donors is operating safely and meticulously. The risk to donors is actually very small."" Mr Terrace says he uses a modified form of keyhole surgery to remove the kidney. Mr Terrace uses a modified form of keyhole surgery He uses laparoscopy to see but also has his hand inside the patient. ""That offers an extra element of control and safety,"" Mr Terrace says. ""The first 80% is moving things out of the way, moving the liver and the bowel and identifying the kidney and the structures that go into it and come out - the vein, the artery and ureter."" He says these are then prepared so the kidney can be removed quickly but still be suitable for ""reimplantation"" into the recipient. Once the kidney is removed it is quickly on its way. In this case, the organs leave Edinburgh and Belfast on chartered flights, arriving in time for the donation surgery to happen in the afternoon. Consultant transplant surgeon Sorina Cornateanu performed Mandy's operation Mandy's kidney surgery is performed by consultant Sorina Cornateanu. She uses blood vessels going to the leg to help attach the new kidney. Then the blood supply is returned and the kidney turns pink and perfused. Often the kidney passes urine on the operating table. Ms Cornateanu said the shared donor scheme had been a big success The surgery takes about three hours and the patient is immediately started on anti-rejection drugs and goes into a high-dependency unit. After successfully operating on Mandy, Ms Cornateanu describes her team as the ""vehicles"" between the donor and the recipient. ""That's our role. It is fulfilling, rewarding, humbling and it is a big relief at this stage."" Ms Cornateanu said the shared donor scheme had been a big success and even in the past year the number of live donor transplants had risen in Edinburgh by half to 14. ""It has been a big team effort from all of us and we need to sustain that. That's the challenge."" Across Scotland, 50 kidney sharing scheme transplants have taken place in the past five years. It is more common for living donor transplants to involve a relative or friend who is a close match but this is not always possible. Another form of living donation is ""altruistic"". Over the past 10 years, 78 people in Scotland have donated a kidney to a stranger. The day after their operations, Mandy and Graham were told the other donor and recipient in the chain were doing well. Graham said: ""That's fantastic. We never expected to know."" ""I'm so pleased,"" said Mandy. The pair hope they will soon be recovered enough to fulfil all the plans they have had to put on hold until now.

Mr John Terrace, consultant transplant surgeon, RIE ""I'm thinking about the donor rather than the recipient,"" he says. ""The focus with donors is operating safely and meticulously. The risk to donors is actually very small."" Mr Terrace says he uses a modified form of keyhole surgery to remove the kidney. Mr Terrace uses a modified form of keyhole surgery He uses laparoscopy to see but also has his hand inside the patient. ""That offers an extra element of control and safety,"" Mr Terrace says. ""The first 80% is moving things out of the way, moving the liver and the bowel and identifying the kidney and the structures that go into it and come out - the vein, the artery and ureter."" He says these are then prepared so the kidney can be removed quickly but still be suitable for ""reimplantation"" into the recipient. Once the kidney is removed it is quickly on its way. In this case, the organs leave Edinburgh and Belfast on chartered flights, arriving in time for the donation surgery to happen in the afternoon. Consultant transplant surgeon Sorina Cornateanu performed Mandy's operation Mandy's kidney surgery is performed by consultant Sorina Cornateanu. She uses blood vessels going to the leg to help attach the new kidney. Then the blood supply is returned and the kidney turns pink and perfused. Often the kidney passes urine on the operating table. Ms Cornateanu said the shared donor scheme had been a big success The surgery takes about three hours and the patient is immediately started on anti-rejection drugs and goes into a high-dependency unit. After successfully operating on Mandy, Ms Cornateanu describes her team as the ""vehicles"" between the donor and the recipient. ""That's our role. It is fulfilling, rewarding, humbling and it is a big relief at this stage."" Ms Cornateanu said the shared donor scheme had been a big success and even in the past year the number of live donor transplants had risen in Edinburgh by half to 14. ""It has been a big team effort from all of us and we need to sustain that. That's the challenge."" Across Scotland, 50 kidney sharing scheme transplants have taken place in the past five years. It is more common for living donor transplants to involve a relative or friend who is a close match but this is not always possible. Another form of living donation is ""altruistic"". Over the past 10 years, 78 people in Scotland have donated a kidney to a stranger. The day after their operations, Mandy and Graham were told the other donor and recipient in the chain were doing well. Graham said: ""That's fantastic. We never expected to know."" ""I'm so pleased,"" said Mandy. The pair hope they will soon be recovered enough to fulfil all the plans they have had to put on hold until now.

"A US local newspaper has won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of a mass shooting in its own newsroom. But there was no celebration as the Capital Gazette in Maryland learned on Monday it had won the most prestigious prize in American journalism. Staff quietly hugged in memory of five colleagues killed by a gunman who burst into their office in June 2018. Pulitzers also went to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal for investigations into President Trump. Two journalists jailed in Myanmarfor reporting a massacre of Rohingya Muslims were part of a team from Reuters news agency that also won an award. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced last year to seven years in prison for breaking the Official Secrets Act, despite an international outcry over what was widely seen as an attack on media freedom. Reuters has said it will not be celebrating the prize until their two colleagues are released. Aretha Franklin earns posthumous Pulitzer Newspaper staff defiant after shooting Remembering the victims of the Capital Gazette shooting Why the attack on BBC cameraman was no surprise The Capital Gazette in Annapolis won a special Pulitzer Prize citation for its coverage and courage in the face of one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in American history. The Pulitzer board awarded the citation with a $100,000 (Â£76,400) grant to further the newspaper's journalism. Employees John McNamara, Wendi Winters, Rebecca Smith, Gerald Fischman and Rob Hiaasen died in last summer's attack. But the staff still managed to publish a newspaper on schedule the next day. A man with a longstanding grudge against the Capital Gazette is charged with the attack. He pleaded not guilty last year. Coverage of mass shootings netted Pulitzers for two other local newspapers. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette received a breaking news award for its ""immersive, compassionate"" reporting of last October's attack at a Pennsylvania synagogue that left 11 people dead. And the South Florida Sun Sentinel won a Pulitzer for its reporting on the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead. It received the public service award for ""exposing failings by school and law enforcement officials before and after the deadly shooting rampage"". The New York Times won a prize for explanatory reporting of Mr Trump's finances and tax avoidance and another for editorial writing. The Wall Street Journal won the national reporting prize for uncovering the president's secret payoffs to two alleged former mistresses during his campaign. The Washington Post also won two Pulitzers for photojournalism in Yemen and for criticism, covering book reviews and essays.

"Widely held myths about sleep are damaging our health and our mood, as well as shortening our lives, say researchers. A team at New York University trawled the internet to find the most common claims about a good night's kip. Then, in a study published in the journal Sleep Health, they matched the claims to the best scientific evidence. They hope that dispelling sleep myths will improve people's physical and mental health and well-being. So, how many are you guilty of? This is the myth that just won't go away. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously had a brief four hours a night. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has madesimilar claims, and swapping hours in bed for extra time in the office is not uncommon in tales of business or entrepreneurial success. Yet the researchers said the belief that less than five hours' shut-eye was healthy, was one of the most damaging myths to health. ""We have extensive evidence to show sleeping five hours or less consistently, increases your risk greatly for adverse health consequences,"" said researcher Dr Rebecca Robbins. These included cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, and shorter life expectancy. Instead, she recommends everyone should aim for a consistent seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Thatcher: Can people get by on four hours' sleep? The relaxing nightcap is a myth, says the team, whether it's a glass of wine, a dram of whisky or a bottle of beer. ""It may help you fall asleep, but it dramatically reduces the quality of your rest that night,"" said Dr Robbins. It particularly disrupts your REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, which is important for memory and learning. So yes, you will have slept and may have nodded off more easily, but some of the benefits of sleep are lost. Alcohol is also a diuretic, so you may find yourself having to deal with a full bladder in the middle of the night too. Have you ever thought ""I need to wind down before bed, I'm going to watch some TV""? Well, the latest Brexit twists and turns on the BBC News at Ten might be bad for sleep. Dr Robbins argues: ""Often if we're watching the television it's the nightly newsâ¦ it's something that's going to cause you insomnia or stress right before bed when we're trying to power down and relax."" And as for Game of Thrones, it's hard to argue the Red Wedding was relaxing. The other issue with TV - along with smartphones and tablets - is they produce blue light, which can delay the body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Will the light from your phone kill you? You've spent so long trying to nod off you've managed to count all the sheep in New Zealand (that's about 28 million,external). So what should you do next? The answer is not to keep trying. ""We start to associate our bed with insomnia,"" said Dr Robbins. ""It does take the healthy sleeper about 15 minutes to fall asleep, but much longer than thatâ¦ make sure to get out of bed, change the environment and do something that's mindless."" Her tip - go fold some socks. Who isn't guilty of reaching for the snooze button on their phone, thinking that extra six minutes in bed is going to make all the difference? But the research team says that when the alarm goes off, we should just get up. Dr Robbins said: ""Realise you will be a bit groggy - all of us are - but resist the temptation to snooze. ""Your body will go back to sleep, but it will be very light, low-quality sleep."" Instead the advice is to throw open the curtains and expose yourself to as much bright light as possible. Snoring can be harmless, but it can also be a sign of the disorder sleep apnoea. This causes the walls of the throat to relax and narrow during sleep, and can briefly stop people breathing. People with the condition are more likely to develop high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat and have a heart attack or a stroke. One of the warning signs is loud snoring. NHS: Obstructive sleep apnoea,external Dr Robbins concludes: ""Sleep is one of the most important things we can all do tonight to improve our health, our mood, our wellbeing and our longevity.""

"Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, east London, in 2015 to join the Islamic State group in Syria Shamima Begum - who joined the Islamic State group aged 15 - is set to be granted legal aid to fight the decision to revoke her UK citizenship. The 19-year-old, who left east London in 2015, was stripped of her citizenship in February, after she was found in a Syrian refugee camp. Her family has previously said it planned to challenge the decision. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the idea of the provision of legal aid to Ms Begum made him ""very uncomfortable"". Mr Hunt added, however, that the UK was ""a country that believes that people with limited means should have access to the resources of the state if they want to challenge the decisions the state has made about them"". Legal aid is financial assistance provided by the taxpayer to those unable to afford legal representation themselves, whether they are accused of a crime or a victim who seeks the help of a lawyer through the court process. It is means-tested and availability has been cut back significantly in recent years in England and Wales. Civil servants at the Legal Aid Agency, which is part of the Ministry of Justice, are responsible for making decisions about who receives legal aid. Earlier, the BBC reported Ms Begum's case had been approved - but sources now say it will be formally signed off in the coming days. What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Legal aid: Who is entitled to it? 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' The women and children no-one wants The legal aid that is expected to be granted covers a case before the semi-secret Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac), which adjudicates on cases where the home secretary has stripped someone of their nationality on grounds of national security. Cases before Siac are among the most complicated legal challenges that the government can face. This is because they typically involve a complex combination of MI5 intelligence reports, which cannot be disclosed to the complainant, and long-standing law on achieving a fair hearing. It is not yet clear when the expected case will be heard but the Siac process can take years to complete - and granting of legal aid in these circumstances is not unusual. Over the last decade or so there have been many other people stripped of nationality on the basis they are linked to terrorism who have been legally-aided during the Siac process. Ms Begum left the UK in February 2015 alongside fellow Bethnal Green Academy pupils 15-year-old Amira Abase and 16-year-old Kadiza Sultana. Ms Begum was found in a Syrian refugee camp in February 2019 and said she wanted to return home. Soon afterwards, she gave birth to a boy called Jarrah. He died of pneumonia in March at less than three weeks of age. She had two other children who also died. In the wake of the boy's death, Home Secretary Sajid Javid was criticised over the decision to strip Ms Begum of her British citizenship. Three weeks prior to the death, Ms Begum's sister, Renu Begum, had written to Mr Javid asking him to help her bring the baby to the UK. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We should not judge outside of a court"" On Monday,the Daily Mail first reported that legal aid had been granted,externalin response to an application made on 19 March. Mr Javid said the granting of legal aid was a decision for legal aid organisations and it was ""not for ministers to comment"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn argued Ms Begum had the right to apply for legal aid. ""She is a British citizen,"" he said. ""She's therefore entitled to apply for legal aid if she has a legal problem just like anybody else is."" He added: ""The whole point of legal aid is that if you're facing a prosecution then you're entitled to be represented and that's a fundamental rule of law, a fundamental point in any democratic society."" Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent in the Metropolitan Police and a friend of the family, said Ms Begum should have legal aid to make sure the correct process is followed. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think legal aid is a principle of the British legal justice system."" Under the1981 British Nationality Act,external, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be ""conducive to the public good"" and they would not become stateless as a result. It was thought Ms Begum had Bangladeshi citizenship through her mother - although Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs said she had been""erroneously identified"" as a Bangladeshi national. Human rights group Liberty said granting legal aid in this case was ""not just appropriate but absolutely necessary to ensure that the government's decisions are properly scrutinised"".

"This video can not be played There were gasps from the crowd at the moment Notre-Dameâs spire fell A major fire has engulfed the medieval cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, one of France's most famous landmarks. The 850-year-old Gothic building's spire and roof have collapsed but the main structure, including the two bell towers, has been saved, officials say. Firefighters are still working to contain the blaze as teams try to salvage the artwork stored inside. President Emmanuel Macron called it a ""terrible tragedy"". The cause of the fire is not yet clear. Officials say it could be linked to the renovation work that began after cracks appeared in the stone,sparking fears the structure could become unstable. Paris prosecutor's office said it had opened an inquiry into ""accidental destruction by fire"". A firefighter was seriously injured while tackling the blaze. In pictures: Blaze at Notre-Dame Visibly emotional, Mr Macron said the ""worst had been avoided"" and vowed to launch an international fundraising scheme to rebuild the cathedral. The fire began at around 18:30 (16:30 GMT) and quickly reached the roof of the cathedral, destroying its stained-glass windows and the wooden interior before toppling the spire. Some 500 firefighters worked to prevent one of the bell towers from collapsing. More than four hours later, fire chief Jean-Claude Gallet said the main structure had been ""saved and preserved"" from total destruction. The massive cost of restoring Notre-Dame Sections of the cathedral were under scaffolding as part of the extensive renovations and 16 copper statues had been removed last week. Deputy Paris Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire said the building had suffered ""colossal damages"", and teams were working to save the cathedral's remaining artwork. This video can not be played The fire department said a major operation was under way Historian Camille Pascal told French broadcaster BFMTV that ""invaluable heritage"" had been destroyed, adding: ""Happy and unfortunate events for centuries have been marked by the bells of Notre-Dame. We can be only horrified by what we see"". Thousands of people gathered in the streets around the cathedral, observing the flames in silence. Some could be seen openly weeping, while others sang hymns or said prayers. Several churches around Paris rang their bells in response to the blaze, which happened as Catholics celebrate Holy Week. Because of the fire, Mr Macron cancelled a speech on TV in which he was due to address the street protests that have rocked France for months. Visiting the scene, the president said the cathedral was a building ""for all French people"", including those who had never been there. ""We'll rebuild Notre-Dame together"", he said as he praised the ""extreme courage"" and ""professionalism"" of the firefighters. Analysisby Henri Astier, BBCWorld Online No other site represents France quite like Notre-Dame. Its main rival as a national symbol, the Eiffel Tower, is little more than a century old. Notre-Dame has stood tall above Paris since the 1200s. It has given its name to one of the country's literary masterpieces. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is known to the French simply as Notre-Dame de Paris. The last time the cathedral suffered major damage was during the French Revolution. It survived two world wars largely unscathed. Watching such an embodiment of the permanence of a nation burn and its spire collapse is profoundly shocking to any French person.

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has offered her support to the people of France, calling Notre-Dame a ""symbol of French and European culture"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May said in a tweet,external: ""My thoughts are with the people of France tonight and with the emergency services who are fighting the terrible blaze at Notre-Dame cathedral"". Also on Twitter,US President Donald Trump said it was ""horrible to watch"",externalthe fire and suggested that ""flying water tankers"" could be used to extinguish the blaze.

"This video can not be played A look inside fire-ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral Hundreds of millions of euros have been pledged to help rebuild Notre-Dame after a devastating fire partially destroyed the French cathedral. The fire, declared fully extinguished some 15 hours after it began, ravaged the 850-year-old building's roof and caused its spire to collapse. But firefighters who worked through the night managed to save the Paris landmark's main stone structure, including its two towers. The cause of the fire is not yet clear. Paris public prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz said his office was ""favouring the theory of an accident"", but had assigned 50 people to work on what he believed would be a ""long"" and ""complex"" investigation. Other officials have suggested it could be linked to extensive renovation works taking place at the cathedral. The cathedral's spire, before, during the fire and after Thoughts are now turning to how Notre-Dame will be rebuilt. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to reconstruct the historic building even as the fire still burned, while a number of companies and business tycoons have so far pledged about â¬600m ($677m; Â£519m) between them. Offers of help with the reconstruction have also poured in from around the globe, with European Council President Donald Tusk calling on EU member states to rally round. The blaze was discovered at 18:43 (16:43 GMT), and firefighters were called. The flames quickly reached the roof of the cathedral, destroying the wooden interior before toppling the spire. Fears grew that the cathedral's famous towers would also be destroyed. The whole of the roof was ""devastated"", according to the fire service But while a number of fires did begin in the towers, French Deputy Interior Minister Laurent NuÃ±ez said they were successfully stopped before they could spread. By the early hours of Tuesday, the fire was declared under control, with the Paris fire service saying it was fully extinguished by 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT). By Patrick Jackson, BBC News, Paris The pavements here on the Left Bank across the Seine are packed with people shuffling along, stopping to take photos or pose for selfies, staring over at the huge, grey bulk of the cathedral. Police stop the crowds getting any closer, as firefighters use a tapering crane to inspect the facade by the cold light of day. The shrill whistles of traffic police cut the air as the sirens of emergency vehicles pass  through the hum of the traffic. But every so often, the birdsong reminds you it's spring in the City of Light. In the little square, the charred odour is unmistakable, mingling with the scent of food from cafÃ©s. A group of excited Dutch 14-year-olds has come back to see the ruin after the drama of the blaze they witnessed last night, on their first trip to Paris. They have a packed agenda but they are solemn and respectful when they talk about the disaster. It's a sad moment for Dutch people too, they say. Everyone knows Notre-Dame. Search teams had already begun assessing the extent of the damage when dawn broke over the French capital. The cathedral's blackened stone and charred scaffolding were revealed to onlookers for the first time. More on the Notre Dame fire: A French view: The horror of watching our country's embodiment burn The images which captured a tragedy as it unfolded Notre-Dame: A history of Paris's beloved cathedral Gargoyles and relics: The treasures which make Notre Dame so special Fire brigade spokesman Lt-Col Gabriel Plus said: ""The whole of the roof has been devastated... a part of the vault has collapsed, the spire is no more."" However, it could have been much worse. Mr NuÃ±ez said that, had fire crews not entered the building, ""without doubt it would have collapsed"", French newspaper Le Monde reported. Photos appear to show that at least one of the cathedral's famed rose windows has survived, although there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows. Franck Riester, France's culture minister, warned that while the principal structure had been saved, the building was still unstable. Mr NuÃ±ez said that ""overall"", the structure was in good condition, but that ""some vulnerabilities"" had been identified in the stone vaults and the remainder of the building's ceiling. Experts have not yet been allowed on site to assess the damage, due to the dangers. Individuals and groups are mobilising to help rebuild Notre-Dame. Hundreds of millions of euros have already been pledged. Air France said in a statement that the company would offer free flights to anyone involved in the reconstruction. The images and graphics that explain the fire Billionaire FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of the Kering group that owns the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion brands, pledged â¬100m (Â£86m; $113m) towards rebuilding Notre-Dame, AFP news agency reports. Another â¬200m was pledged by Bernard Arnault's family and their company LVMH - a business empire which includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora - on Tuesday morning, according to Reuters news agency. French cosmetics giant L'Oreal and its founding Bettencourt family have promised to give a further â¬200m to the reconstruction effort. Total, the French oil giant, has also pledged â¬100m. The French charity Fondation du Patrimoine is launching an international appeal for funds for the cathedral, a Unesco World Heritage site.

"Former politician Sergiy Tigipko is one of the most influential men in Ukraine One of Ukraine's richest men is being investigated by Scotland Yard over the abduction of his two British grandchildren from the UK to Ukraine. Banker and industrialist Sergiy Tigipko helped his daughter Ganna defy High Court orders to bring her children back to the UK from Kiev, a judge has ruled. The court had ordered Ms Tigipko back to London, where the children's British father lives, so they could see him. Sergiy and Ganna can be named after an exceptional decision by a judge. The children were ""suffering harm"" by being separated from their father, the court heard. The judge heard that publicity could make their mother and grandfather return them. Ms Tigipko said everything she had done since her husband left her in 2015 had been ""for the welfare of my children and nobody else"". She added the children were ""happy and settled in Ukraine now"" and that their father was ""welcome to visit them"". It is believed to be the first time a judge has allowed abductors to be named in this way - usually it only happens when children's whereabouts are unknown. Ms Tigipko met the children's father in 2010 and married in 2012. They settled in north London, and had two daughters. But, in late 2015, the father announced the marriage was over. Funny business at the Ukrainian polls Ukraine bans its Eurovision entrant over Russia row The life of a 17-year-old in Kiev Initially, Ms Tigipko was happy to stay in London. She had founded a clinic in Harley Street. With help from her mother, she bought a Â£9m home in Hampstead, which is one of London's most expensive districts and popular with Russian speakers. The children's father lived nearby with his new wife. But then Ms Tigipko met a new partner too, and married him in 2017 in Ukraine. In November 2017, she took the girls for a visit to Kiev - and stayed there, violating an informal agreement with the father to remain living in the UK. She sold her house in Hampstead and gave up her Harley Street business. In April 2018, the High Court ruled she must return to London to live - but she ignored repeated court orders. Mr Justice Mostyn found that her father, Sergiy, had helped her. He was fully satisfied ""of his deep complicity"", he said in his judgment. As no progress was being made, the girls' father took the exceptional step of asking for the grandfather and mother to be named, hoping that would encourage them to return the children. Mr Tigipko is being investigated by Scotland Yard Mr Tigipko is one of the richest and most powerful men in Ukraine. The billionaire was an ally of Ukraine's former president, Viktor Yanukovych - serving as a vice prime minister in his administration - and twice stood as a presidential candidate himself. In recent years, he has concentrated on his business interests, and told the court he had no further interest in politics. The court heard that before the children were taken to Kiev, they had had a close relationship with their father. But now they have been turned against him. In December, the older girl told a court appointed expert: ""Papa is bad."" He has three children from a previous marriage while his new wife has a son from an earlier relationship. It is believed to be the first time a judge has named abductors in such a case. In family courts, protecting the children's identity is paramount and they are only named when their whereabouts is unknown, as inthe case of Olly Sheridan. Mr Justice Mostyn said that he placed ""great weight"" on the submissions made by the barrister for the children's court-appointed guardian, who had supported publication. He said that child abduction was a ""heinous practice"" and yet ""public awareness is curiously very limited"". Orysia Lutsevych, from the think tank Chatham House, said many in Ukraine would be unsympathetic to the Tigipkos. She said there was a sense that the very rich behave differently, that the rules do not apply to them, that they're ""untouchable"". ""I'm sure lots of Ukrainians will be watching the case,"" she added.
