"This video can not be played ""I am kicking myself very hard"" - Nicola Sturgeon apologises for mask rule breach Scotland's first minister has apologised for breaching Covid rules by taking her face mask off at a wake. TheScottish Sun has published a photograph,externalof Nicola Sturgeon standing talking to three people at a social distance, but with her face uncovered. She was attending a wake after the funeral of a Scottish government civil servant who died with Covid. Ms Sturgeon had been wearing a tartan mask and is said to have taken it off briefly as she was leaving the venue. The Scottish government's Covid regulations say that customers in hospitality venues must wear a face covering except when seated - including when they are entering, exiting and moving around. Anyone who breaches the face covering rules can be punished by a fixed penalty notice of Â£60. However Police Scotland said they would not be taking any action, saying the first minister had apologised and ""acknowledged this inadvertent breach"" of the regulations. What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Scottish level four rules 'may be strengthened' In a statement, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""briefly"" removed her face mask while attending a wake, calling it a ""stupid mistake"". Addressing MSPs at Holyrood, the first minister said she wanted to express ""how sorry I am for my breach of rules that I ask all of us to follow"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""I want to be clear that regardless of the circumstances, I was in the wrong. There are no excuses. ""These rules do apply to me, just as they do to everyone else, and the rules really matter. ""I am kicking myself very hard - possibly harder than my worst critic ever could - but more importantly I'll be making sure I don't drop my guard again."" Ms Sturgeon is understood to have been at the wake in the Stable Bar and Restaurant in Edinburgh after attending a service at nearby Mortonhall Crematorium. The first minister regularly uses her daily coronavirus briefings to remind people to cover their faces to limit the risk of spreading the virus. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch toldGood Morning Scotlandhe had spoken to Ms Sturgeon last night and she was ""furious with herself"". ""She is absolutely mad at this little lapse in concentration - it's so easily done,"" he said. ""We live in a completely different world from a year ago. ""She was leaving a funeral of a colleague of ours - a wonderful, wonderful individual who did a huge amount of work during the pandemic. It was an awfully sad day for many of us in the government who knew him and his family well. ""It just reinforces again to all of us, the nature of these instructions and this virus."" When you make and promote coronavirus rules, it is not a good idea to break them. No-one understands that better than Nicola Sturgeon, who has already parted company with an MP and a medical adviser for past breaches. The first minister has not taken a train journey having tested positive for the virus as MP Margaret Ferrier did. She had not made unnecessary trips to a holiday home during lockdown as her former chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, did. Nor has she taken a drive to Barnard Castle as the prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings did. Nicola Sturgeon's breach - removing her face mask briefly to talk to people at a funeral wake - is relatively minor. But it is a breach. That's why the first minister has put her hands up and apologised for what she calls a ""stupid mistake"". It is a mistake that anyone could make but when you're fronting the campaign to get the public to obey coronavirus rules, it does not make that job any easier. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ""The first minister should know better. By forgetting the rules and failing to set a proper example, she's undermining essential public health messaging. ""It's a blunder that an ordinary member of the public wouldn't get away with. There cannot be one rule for Nicola Sturgeon and another for everyone else."" Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said in a tweet that Ms Sturgeon had been ""upfront"" from the very beginning of the pandemic. ""She has apologised for [the] accidental lapse (which I suspect most of us have had one over last 9 months),""he wrote,external. He said the FM was her own harshest critic and that ""most people"" would accept her apology and move on. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said high-profile breaches of Covid rules ""matter a lot"" to the public. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""There are clear breaches and then there are indiscretions. ""I'm not passing comment on anyone in particular, but some of us are prone to lapses now and again. ""The main thing is how honest and trustworthy our leaders are. I don't doubt anyone in Scotland's dedication to the cause but it really does matter, because everybody must follow the rules at all times as much as they possibly can.""

"A new variant of the virus causing Covid-19, first spotted in Kent, could already be circulating - or have originated from - outside the UK. But it was spotted here because of the strength of the UK's surveillance system, scientists have said. The Covid-19 Genomics Consortium (Cog-UK) has tracked the genetic history of more than 150,000 samples of Sars-Cov-2 virus. That equates to about half the world's genetic sequencing of coronavirus. Prof Sharon Peacock, head of Cog-UK, said the UK's high level of genomic surveillance meant ""if you're going to find something anywhere, you're going to find it probably here first"". The virus's genetic code is its instruction manual telling it how to operate. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? As it replicates, small mistakes or changes get introduced. The useful ones are likely to help the virus spread more quickly from person to person, and so become more common. Sequencing the virus's genome allows scientists to see how it is changing as it subtly mutates over time, and to uncover how outbreaks spread, by looking at clusters of a particular variant of the virus. This kind of genetic detective work allowed scientists to work out that the UK's early outbreak in the spring was coming mainly from Europe rather than China, based on the variants that were circulating. At the moment, we don't know who the ""index case"" was - the person from which the mutated version of the virus first emerged. As a result, we don't know whether the mutation began in Kent or whether it was introduced from elsewhere, Prof Peacock said. And we don't know whether it has already spread onwards from the UK to other countries. Prof Tom Connor, who was involved in setting up Covid sequencing in Wales, believes it is ""probable"" that similar variants are emerging around the world, but they may not have been detected yet. ""We are sequencing in the UK at a disproportionate rate,"" he said, insisting the UK has a better surveillance system than other countries. In order to know how far the variant has travelled or where it came from, you would need to compare notes with other countries - but comparable data very often does not exist, Prof Connor said. For example, Public Health Wales sequenced about 4,000 genomes in the past week, more than the whole of France since the beginning of the pandemic. This point was emphasised by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge, who pointed out it was ""no coincidence"" that an ""interesting"" multiple mutation had also been seen in South Africa, another country which does a lot of genomic sequencing. Other European countries which were very quick to pick up notable mutations, Denmark and the Netherlands, also have strong surveillance systems. The new variant caused alarm because it involved 23 separate mutations, 17 of which were linked to the building blocks of proteins that form the virus. It's unusual for so many mutations to appear all at once. That makes it less likely they have happened by chance and more likely they give the virus some kind of evolutionary advantage. ""The signal is extremely stark,"" according to Prof Connor. ""We have a large number of lineages or variants that circulate in the UK and to see one single variant increase in the way it has, with the speed it has, is extremely unusual,"" he said. Questions have been asked over whether more relaxed restrictions in London and the South East caused the rapid spread of the new variant, or whether it was down to human behaviour. But scientists now have ""high confidence"" the mutation itself has made the virus more transmissible - though not more deadly. Prof Judith Breuer, professor of virology and co-director of the division of infection and immunity at University College London, said it could have been down to changes in behaviour alone, but ""all of that has now been accounted for"". Instead, she said, increased transmissibility of the new variant was likely to be down to ""biological changes to the virus"". That's not to say behaviour doesn't matter though - it continues to be a virus that thrives on human contact and social distancing remains the main - though blunt - tool for managing its spread.

"The number of excess deaths - those above expected levels - since the start of the pandemic has passed 81,000. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows the UK saw nearly 14,000 deaths in the week of 11 December. This was 13% above the expected levels for this time of year, down from 15% the week before. Of these deaths, 3,062 involved Covid-19, also slightly lower than the preceding week. Excess deaths are the difference between the total number of deaths registered (the height of the shaded area in the chart below) and the average over the previous five years for the same weeks (shown by the dashed line). This average level rises each week in a normal winter as cold weather, flu and other factors lead to more deaths. In recent weeks, the total number of deaths in the UK has been largely steady. The rises seen throughout October and early November stalled, largely due to the falls in coronavirus infections, hospitalisations and deaths seen during November and early December. As a result, the gap between the total number of deaths seen and the expected levels has narrowed. But the gap has not disappeared and in the week of 11 December, the total excess deaths seen since the pandemic started in March passed 81,300. Nearly 524,000 deaths have been registered in total compared to just over 442,000 seen in the same weeks, on average, in the last five years. This total is larger than that recorded in the daily figures because it includes people whose Covid-19 was not confirmed by a positive test and people who died because of the strain the pandemic has put on the NHS and society.

"The group travelled to Bute in contravention of Covid rules The Marquess of Bute has been charged with allegedly breaking coronavirus laws after reportedly travelling to Scotland from London. Police Scotland launched an investigation following reports on Monday that he and six others travelled to the Isle of Bute. The marquess has a home in London as well as his ancestral home of Mount Stuart on Bute. Scotland's cross border travel curbs have been in place since November. Border police patrols to double after travel ban Scotland tightens Covid rules at Christmas Also known as John Colum Bute, the 62-year-old marquess is a former F1 driver who raced under the name Johnny Dumfries. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said the force received reports of a group of people travelling to the Isle of Bute in contravention of the coronavirus legislation. She added: ""Inquiries were carried out and three men, aged 32, 62 and 69 years, and four women, aged 21, 29, 60 and 90, have been charged and will be subject of a report to the procurator fiscal.""

"Posh cars on the driveway of his suburban house gave clues to Maher's lifestyle A UK-based haulier shipped drugs for gangs across Europe from his Warrington living room in lockdown. Thomas Maher, originally from Ireland, has been sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court to more than 14 years in jail after pleading guilty to drugs and money-laundering charges. He made thousands of pounds a week, using an encrypted Encrochat phone to fix the movement of drugs and money. He is the first major crime boss jailed using messages obtained when French police cracked the Encrochat network. The phones were considered mandatory for high-end organised crime, and more than a thousand suspects have been arrested on the strength of the evidence their messages contain. Hundreds arrested as crime chat network cracked Encrypted mobile cracked to convict drug dealer Maher, 39, used the Encrochat handles ""Satirical"" and ""Snacker"" as he did deals with organised crime networks in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and Bulgaria. The National Crime Agency says he was ""hugely influential"" among Europe's drug cartels. Sentencing him, Judge Aubrey QC said Maher was ""a high-ranking facilitator... a go-between for criminal networks needing to transport their drugs between Holland and Ireland"". Passing a sentence of 14 years and eight months, the judge told Maher: ""You were an extremely important cog in the wheel of a sophisticated network."" Maher would arrange for lorries to move massive loads of drugs hidden alongside legitimate cargoes such as fruit or wine in one direction and then to bring cash in the other direction. The NCA kept Maher under surveillance after French police passed on details of his activities Police found out about his operation after he was arrested in connection with the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants while they were being transported to the UK in October 2019. He had previously owned the trailer in which they were found. The NCA put him under surveillance in an attempt to identify the scale of his criminal activities. However, the cracking of the Encrochat network by French intelligence and the Gendarmerie provided the National Crime Agency with thousands of his encrypted messages. They were able to watch, almost in real time, as he did deals with crime bosses around Europe. Martin Clark, from the NCA, said he posed as an ""honest haulier"", but was in fact ""very much a professional facilitator and he's done it all remotely sitting in his living room"". ""He's never personally been anywhere near any of it."" In fact, the NCA said he had been scrupulous about social distancing during the pandemic while communicating via Encrochat with dozens of criminals. The evidence the agency has uncovered shines a new light on the way in which a smuggling network operates. Maher would be contacted by clients wanting to move hundreds of kilos of drugs. The messages were written in criminal slang. He would discuss deals involving shipments of ""tops"" (top shelf drugs such as cocaine), or ""Colo"" (the purest form from Colombia). Heroin, which he deemed a more downmarket drug, was known as ""bottoms"". Shipments might come from ""The Flat"" (The Netherlands) and the lorry returned with ""paper"" (cash). Officers working on Encrochat cases are having to develop skills in understanding the slang suspects are using in their messages.  In this message Thomas Maher (Satirical) is telling an alleged co-conspirator that they're not doing too badly despite the lockdown. Helpfully for police he sets out the network of drug transportation routes he is currently operating: ""Taxi ways are working out OK at the minute with this fella from flat to ours and Belgium to ours am other that's two - and plus a driver with [redacted] for Poly's sun to flat and we still have [redacted] turk to flat and and his men [redacted] to here where I am. Once we get this travel ban lifted m8 we be on the pigs bk that alone is a lot of taxi plus we have the receiver here from Asia so m8 we have a lot more than others... that's why I'm not stressing yet The police translation reads:""Our HGV drug courier business is working out OK at the moment. Someone is bringing shipments from Holland and Belgium to the UK. There's a driver for ecstasy from Spain to Holland, and we still have Turkey to Holland, and [redacted] is bringing shipments to the UK. Once the travel ban is lifted we will be doing rather well. That alone is a lot of shipments plus we have someone bringing drugs in from Asia.  So, we have a lot more than other gangs... that's why I'm not stressing yet. However, like many users of the Encrochat network, Maher believed his messages could not be read, so he didn't bother trying to communicate in code. Crucial evidence was obtained from pictures on his phone. His drivers would photograph the shipments to prove they had been picked up. They would sometimes use a ""token"" during the handover. This involved showing a particular Euro bank note, with digits previously agreed as evidence of identity. When Maher was moving drugs he would earn around Â£3,500 each time. For money, transported for laundering in consignments of 300,000 euros at a time, he would ""skim"" 1% of the total as his payment He was ""always showing Â£50 notes in the pub"", Martin Clark said, and people were suspicious that he was a criminal. Maher lived in a ""fairly modest"" Cheshire home, but police surveillance spotted luxury cars including a Range Rover, Porsche Cayenne, Mercedes GLS and Corvette parked on the drive. When they raided his house they found evidence he had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on Rolex and Hublot watches. He had taken holidays in Dubai, Mexico and New York where he liked to buy pricey modern art, including a map of the world created from bullets.

"This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed The EU's executive branch, the European Commission, has called on member states to lift travel bans imposed against the UK amid fears of a new Covid strain. The non-binding recommendation was put forward ahead of a meeting of ambassadors from the 27-member bloc. But with EU countries free to set their own rules on border controls they may continue with their own policies. France and the UK meanwhile said they had reached an agreement to ease restrictions. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? How a dramatic week in the UK unfolded Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? At the weekend, France closed its borders to passengers and freight from the UK, causing disruption at the southern British port of Dover, an important gateway for goods entering and leaving the UK. Thousands of lorries have become stuck, prompting warnings of shortages over Christmas. Almost all the EU's 27 member states are currently blocking travellers from the UK. Keen to develop a common policy, after earlier in the year seeing members close shared borders, the EU has been holding emergency meetings. In a statement, the commission recommended its members allow people to travel to their country of residence providing they take a Covid-19 test or self-isolate. But it said non-essential travel should be discouraged. It also said transport staff in the EU, such as lorry drivers, should be exempt from travel restrictions and mandatory testing. This video can not be played 'Operation Brock' in place for lorry drivers On the UK, it said that should lorry drivers require Covid-19 tests to leave the UK for France and other EU countries, it ""should not lead to transport disruptions"". But as Tuesday came to a close there was little sign that the recommendation would be taken up. Some flights will resume on Wednesday for Belgian nationals returning home but Germany extended its ban. One diplomat told the AFP news agency that the ambassadors had simply ""taken note"" of the recommendation. The deal will allow the resumption of freight and some passenger services through the UK-French border. Lorry drivers and EU nationals will be able to travel but must show proof of a negative coronavirus test. Plane, boat and Eurostar train connections will resume on Wednesday. Since the border closure began nearly 3,000 lorries have been stuck in southern England and it is likely to take until Christmas for the situation to be resolved. The French restrictions have led to long queues forming in southern England The UK government is advising lorry drivers against travelling to the area until mass testing gets under way. Meanwhile, Japanese car giant Toyota said it had suspended production in two factories in the UK and one in France. It blamed ""shortages of parts due to transport delays and the uncertain nature of the duration of the border closures"". UK travellers don't just face restrictions in Europe - more than 50 countries around the world fromIndia, toIran, toCanadahave suspended flights from the UK. The USalready has restrictions in place that prevent most non-US citizens who have been in the UK and some other countries for the last 14 days from entering. It is yet to follow suit with a ban on all travellers from the UK, but two airlines - British Airways and Delta - will only allow passengers who test negative for the coronavirus to fly to New York's John F Kennedy airport. Saudi Arabia,KuwaitandOmanhave shut their borders completely to international passengers. Swedenbanned foreign travellers fromDenmarkovernight into Tuesday after cases were discovered there. The decision alarmed Danes - especially those on the island of Bornholm, which relies on a fast ferry link with Ystad in Sweden. There are fears that many will struggle to get to or from Bornholm in time for Christmas, Danish media report. Along with Denmark, the new strain has also been detected in Australia, Italy and the Netherlands. This video can not be played Mr Johnson said he understood the concerns of ""our international friends"" As the list of countries imposing travel restrictions on the UK grew, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Europe director, Hans Kluge, said member states would convene to discuss strategies and limit travel, while maintaining trade. The new strain is more transmissible but is not more deadly or resistant to vaccines, experts say. Some experts believe the new strain has already spread beyond where it has been reported, crediting the UK's use of genomic surveillance for detecting it. ""I think we will find in the coming days that a lot of other countries will find it,"" Marc Van Ranst, a virologist from the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Belgium, told broadcaster VRT. In another development, travellers from South Africa are also facing bars from some countries after another new variant of the virus was discovered that is unrelated to the one found in the UK.

"This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed France is starting to let traffic from the UK back in after the nations reached agreement over their shared border, closed amid concerns over a new coronavirus variant. Freight drivers and some passengers, including EU citizens, will be among those allowed to return - if they have a recent negative test for the virus. Some 2,850 lorries have been stuck in Kent since the border shut on Sunday. NHS Test and Trace staff and the military will be deployed for testing. Planes, boats and Eurostar trains are due to resume on Wednesday morning. Under the agreement between the two countries, admittance to France will be granted to those travelling for urgent reasons, including hauliers, French citizens, and British citizens with French residency. But in order to travel, they will need to have received a negative test result less than 72 hours before departure. 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK Rapid lateral flow tests, which can detect the new strain and give a result in about 30 minutes, will be used rather than the 24 hours required for so-called PCR tests. The drivers will receive the result by text message, and this message would give them the right to cross the Channel. A ""protocol is still being finalised"" to work out what to do with those drivers who test positive, a government source told the BBC. In an interview with broadcasters, Mr Shapps said enough tests had been sent to Kent to test all those who wanted to return by Christmas, but suggested it could take until Christmas for congestion to be relieved near ports. Mr Shapps warned hauliers against travelling to Kent until further notice to alleviate congestion at ports. He said: ""I am pleased that we have made this important progress with our French counterparts this evening. This protocol will see the French border reopen to those travelling for urgent reasons, provided they have a certified negative Covid test. ""We continue to urge hauliers not to travel to Kent until further notice as we work to alleviate congestion at ports."" The arrangement agreed with the French government will be reviewed on the 31 December, but could run until 6 January, the Department for Transport said. The French government will also carry out sample testing on incoming freight to the UK. A Romanian driver rests inside his lorry at Ashford International railway station truck stop The announcement comes after the EU Commissionurged member states to drop their travel bansto avoid supply chain disruption. More than 50 countries have banned UK arrivals following widespread concern about the spread of the new variant. No lorries have been leaving the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel to France. Kent County Council leader Roger Gough told the BBC on Tuesday afternoon that 2,220 vehicles were at the temporary lorry park at Manston, while 632 were still being held on the M20. It comes as Tesco said it would bereintroducing temporary purchasing limits on some essential products, including toilet rolls, eggs, rice and hand wash. The British Retail Consortium warned that trucks needed to be able to start travelling again in the next 24 hours to ""avoid seeing problems on our shelves"". Andrew Opie, its director of food and sustainability, told the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee: ""What we've been told by members is that unless those trucks can start travelling again and go back to Spain and Portugal and other parts of Europe, we will have problems with fresh produce from 27 December."" The Channel is a vital trade route, with about 10,000 lorries a day travelling between Dover and Calais at Christmas, largely bringing in the freshest produce. A further 36,804 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus and there were 691 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to Tuesday's government figures,external. It is the largest daily number of cases recorded yet, though it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring when testing was much more limited. Meanwhile, truck drivers stranded in Kent have called for immediate help from the government, with hundreds facing a third night sleeping in their cabs. Truck driver Laszlo Baliga, 51, from London, spent Tuesday delivering food and water to those lined up at Manston Airport, a disused airfield. He began taking supplies after Hungarian drivers stranded in the lorry park posted on Facebook asking for help, with one telling him the only toilet on the site had been blocked. He said he and friends had so far spent more than Â£500 on food and water for drivers at the site. Mr Baliga said: ""We have got ready-to-eat sausages, bread, tomatoes, lettuce, coffee. Basic foods for now for the drivers. ""We like to help because this is a difficult time."" Ronald Schroeder, 52, from Hamburg in Germany, said: ""I am now staying in a hotel, but in front of the hotel there are thousands of people without any rooms waiting to come over the Channel crossing. ""I feel a little bit like Robinson Crusoe on an island."" The government defended the facilities for stranded drivers, saying there were ""more than adequate health and welfare provisions available"".

"It's a sentiment shared by many... One year ago, it would have been unlikely even in your wildest, most surreal dreams for a headline to appear reading: ""Europe moves to isolate UK as mutant virus spoils Christmas."" But here we are. It's fair to say an escalating pandemic, a looming Brexit deadline and the mass cancellation of flights has made for a somewhat chaotic end to the year. This is how it all unfolded. What felt like a sudden flurry of difficult news began when Health Secretary Matt Hancock held a press conference and announced a new variant of the coronavirus had been found. It's thought the mutation is able to spread more easily. It is still being analysed by scientists, but the government has warned it could be up to 70% more transmissible. ""Mutant"" isn't a word people like to see in headlines, and the announcement quickly sowed uncertainty. Many were left with questions about what this could mean for the pandemic as a whole. Existing vaccines will almost certainly work against the new coronavirus variant If the new virus is more able to transmit then it could mean hospitals reach their capacity sooner as more people become infected, scientists warned. But existing vaccines will almost certainly work against this new variant, and there is as yet no evidence to suggest it is more deadly. Plus,as our health correspondent James Gallagher writes, viruses mutate all the time and this has happened before even with the coronavirus. When the new variant was announced, the relaxation of coronavirus rules around the UK for five days over Christmas had already been in place for weeks, and plans had been made. Millions of people had booked transport and ordered food ahead of the big day. ""This one day was going to be a day to forget about everything,"" one Londoner, Ceyda Oz, told the BBC. But then, on Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a dramatic and unexpected tightening of restrictions. With many people likely to spend Christmas apart, post offices have seen long queues A matter of days after saying it would be ""inhuman"" to change the rules at that late stage, the planned relaxation of measures for London and much of south-east England was scrapped due to the alarming rates of infection there. For the rest of the country, the relaxation of rules for meeting family and friends indoors was limited to just one day - Christmas Day. It meant millions had to scrap plans at short notice, and in those areas with the tightest restrictions, people faced the sudden prospect of spending Christmas alone. In London, the announcement prompted a rush for the railway stations as people sought to leave the capital before the rules came into force on Sunday. By 19:00 GMT, there were no tickets available online from several stations in the city. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

For those who stayed, and for those around the UK who were affected by the restrictions, Christmas suddenly looked very different. The strangeness of the situation was summed up by the newspapers the following day. ""Christmas is cancelled by surging mutant virus"", read The Sunday Times. It began with the Netherlands, but on Sunday many European nations woke up to the implications of a variant of the virus that spreads with greater ease. The new strain of coronavirus triggered a wave of countries to ban UK arrivals. Belgium, Canada, Germany, Ireland and Italy, all announced the move as did India and Hong Kong. This only compounded the confusion over Christmas, with British people in Europe and Europeans in the UK left stranded and unsure about whether they would be able to make it home in time. By Monday, France had also closed its border for 48 hours, meaning lorries and cars were turned away from the port of Dover. The rest of the world then also began to socially distance from the UK. In fact, ""Plague Island"" was soon trending on Twitter. A host of European countries issued travel restrictions There were very real concerns about the impact of these border closures in the UK. The supermarket chain Sainsbury's said that if the travel restrictions continued there could be some food shortages, including of salad leaves and citrus fruit. Unlike the first lockdown in the spring, there have been no signs of panic buying - lettuce might be the first to go in the event of any shortages, but that is clearly not alarming the British public. Officials from the food sector, as well as the UK government, have also said there is no need to rush to the shops. Even without a virus mutation, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit had already raised questions about import supplies to the UK. So here's where we are with that: the European Union and the UK are still negotiating over a trade deal that would set out the terms for their future relationship. These talks have been going on for a while and even extended on a few occasions, but now a hard deadline is looming. Time runs out on 31 December, and if a deal is not agreed by then the UK-EU relationship will likely change significantly. There could be higher prices in shops, as well as delays as lorries bringing products in would need further checks. How many trade deals has the UK done so far? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Ever get that feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu? There is still time, however, for both sides to agree a deal. And there's room for optimism, too. Many people have pointed to the fact that, despite everything, the UK has at least passed the shortest day of the year. So, whatever happens next, the days should at least be longer and (hopefully) a little brighter. Fingers crossed.

"No lorries are leaving the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel for France Chaos at ports caused by EU border closures has set back the UK's efforts to reassure foreign customers post-Brexit, the food industry has said. Food and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright said UK exporters wanted to make sure foreign firms could rely on their supply chains after 1 January. But the current crisis had harmed their cause, he told MPs. ""We've just proved... that you can't trust British products,"" he said. ""And that's really unhelpful."" Mr Wright was giving evidence to an emergency hearing of the Commons business committee, called to examine the impact of the border delays on UK business and security of supply. France shut its UK border for 48 hours on Sunday amid fears of a new coronavirus variant in the UK. More than 50 countries have now banned UK arrivals. At the same time, UK-EU talks on a post-Brexit trade deal are continuing, with nine days left to reach and ratify any agreement. 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as UK talks to France PM resists calls to extend Brexit deadline Mr Wright said the current scenes at Dover, where the number of lorries stranded and unable to cross to France has continued to rise, could be ""replicated at any point"". ""I think we will see this happen particularly if we get a no-deal Brexit,"" he added. Mr Wright said there were thought to be 4,000 trucks on their way to Dover at various points. He warned that the number could grow by the end of the day to possibly as high as 6,000 or 7,000. He also criticised the government's handling of the announcement at the weekend and urged it to compensate those who had lost out. The committee also heard that there were concerns over the welfare of lorry and van drivers caught up in the disruption, as the facilities provided for them are considered inadequate. ""We have no confidence, we have never had any confidence drivers will be looked after,"" said Duncan Buchanan of the Road Haulage Association. ""This is a very serious problem - whether you have moved trucks from one place to another, it is irrelevant."" Mr Buchanan said it was the start of supply chain disruption ""of the like we have probably never experienced"". ""Many of the retailers are saying that we are up until Christmas, we will be fine until Christmas at least, but we must recover very fast to keep the shops fully stocked after Christmas. It's a big worry,"" he added. Andrew Opie, of the British Retail Consortium, agreed, saying that if lorries were not moving within 24 hours, there could be problems with the availability of fresh food products from 27 December.

"This video can not be played The day the US began Covid vaccinations As health workers begin receiving Covid-19 vaccinations across the US, many Americans are asking when they will be able to get their shots. It's complicated, but this is what we know. Americans who are under 65 and healthy may be able to get their vaccinations as early as April, says Dr Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The Trump administration's health secretary, Alex Azar, predicts that by ""late February, into March,"" Americans will be able to get vaccinated at pharmacy and grocery chains like CVS and Walmart. But cases in the US are continuing to spike as winter sends people indoors and the holidays bring families together. More than 300,000 Americans have died and 16.5 million have been infected since January 2020, and the US faces an uphill battle the curb the virus. Here's what you need to know about getting vaccinated in the US. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines submitted to US states say that the nation's 21 million healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care homes. Approximately 87 million essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientist of federal vaccine distribution programme Operation Warp Speed, says the young and healthy should be last in the line. At least 70% or 80% of the US population of 330 million have to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity,he warned on Monday,external. Officials say vaccinations for groups that are not at a high risk are expected to take place in the spring of 2021. One of the main challenges with vaccinating the US population is producing and distributing the shots. Vaccinations in the US began on 14 December, with a critical care nurse in New York City receiving the first injection of a drug developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Pfizer, based in New York, and German company BioNTech received emergency authorisation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after data found their vaccine 95% effective in preventing infections. On Tuesday, the FDA reported that Moderna, a US company seeking approval for its vaccine, produced a drug that is 94% effective in warding off the virus. The rollout of this drug could begin early next week. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? How do the Covid vaccines compare? What you need to know about vaccine safety The FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) allows a drug to be used as a treatment while studies are still being carried out to determine safety and effectiveness. Critics say the process is less rigorous and more likely to lead to health complications. Johnson & Johnson, another US drug company, is currently testing a vaccine and could have enough data to submit an EUA request by January. This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world. Pfizer's first shipment of vaccine to the US saw 2.9 million doses sent to multiple locations around the country. The company says they hope to have enough vaccine for 25 million Americans produced by the end of the year, and enough for 50 million by March. The US has agreed to buy 200 million doses of vaccine from Moderna, a company that has never previously had a product approved by the FDA. If approved, US officials say the Massachusetts-based company will immediately ship around six million doses to 3,285 sites across the US - far more locations than Pfizer's initial rollout. Both vaccines require a second round of injections. Some pharmacies have been tapped to use their electronic networks to alert patients when it is time to receive their second shot. For Pfizer, the second jab comes three weeks after the first. For Moderna it is four weeks after the first shot. Johnson & Johnson's experimental vaccine is the only one being developed that relies on a single jab. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Even as distribution begins, the drug manufacturers must continue to seek full - rather than emergency - approval, as the FDA continues to monitor the vaccines for any side-effects. Health experts say the vaccine's arrival does not mean life will immediately return to normal. ""A vaccine will complement the other tools we have, not replace them,"" said Tedros Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). ""A vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic."" Hand-washing, social distancing and mask-wearing will remain the norm until enough of the population has been vaccinated. Dr Fauci says Americans may be able to roll back those necessary precautions by the autumn of 2021 if 70% of the US population has been vaccinated by then. There are ongoing concerns regarding how many Americans are willing to get vaccinated. Arecent Gallup poll,externalfound that 58% say they would be willing to get the jab, up from a low of 50% in September. How do we know the vaccine is safe? It also remains to be seen how racial minorities - who are at a higher risk of catching the virus and dying from it - will be prioritised and what level of trust they will have in the government-issued vaccine. Former US presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton havevowed to be vaccinated on camera, in an effort to encourage others to get the jab. President Donald Trump says officials at the White House - which has seen several outbreaks -""should receive the vaccine somewhat later... unless specifically necessary"". According to a 1905 landmark Supreme Court case, states do have it in their power to require the vaccination of their residents. The case, Jacobson v Massachusetts, arose during a smallpox epidemic in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1902 when one resident refused the vaccine. At the time, Cambridge said all residents must get vaccinated or re-vaccinated, otherwise pay a $5 fine (which would be about $150 in 2020). In its ruling, the Supreme Court said that the rights of the individual do not trump the need to ensure public safety. However, the high court of Massachusetts later ruled that states lacked the authority to administer the injection, and could only issue fines. Pennsylvania's health secretary has said they will not issue any mandate, but Virginia's top health official has said they will consider issuing one once the vaccines are ready. Private companies in the US have the right to force their employees to get certain vaccines, experts say, but are unlikely to immediately do so once the vaccine is approved. This is because the vaccines are both seeking approval under an emergency process that critics say could lead to health complications. ""Companies could theoretically issue a mandate, but in the current political climate it is very unlikely they will do so,"" George Washington University Law professor Peter Meyers told Reuters. ""Americans tend to shy away from mandates."" Ford Motor Co and Kellogg Co have both said they will make the vaccine available to their employees on a voluntary basis. Many hospitals and health clinics require annual flu shots, and all 50 states have vaccination requirements in place for school children. Workers can be excused from a vaccine if they have health issues that forbid receiving a vaccine, or - in some states - if they have religious objections. The CDC says that vaccines purchased with taxpayer money will free, but providers may still charge for administering the jab. That fee may be reimbursed by health insurance companies or the Medicaid and Medicare programmes - social safety nets for low income and elderly Americans. In July, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced a $1.95bn (Â£1.45bn) deal to secure 100 million vaccine doses from Pfizer. The agreement also allows the US government to purchase an additional 500 million doses. Moderna received nearly $1bn from the US government for coronavirus research. The company is set to receive an additional $1.5bn for 100 million doses, according to a deal signed in August. Billions of dollars have also been promised to other drug companies in the event that they are able to bring additional vaccines to market. States are also racing to acquire ultra-cold refrigerators that are capable of storing the Pfizer vaccine, which must be kept at temperatures of -70C (-94 F) and is being shipped in packages of dry ice.

"Greg Mazurek was making the delivery with a second Polish driver Stranded lorry drivers have spoken of their fears of being stuck in Kent over Christmas after France shut its border with the UK. More than 1,500 lorries are waiting to leave the UKwhile the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel remain closed to traffic leaving the country. Some have found places to stay, while others have spent two nights in their vehicles, waiting for information on how and when they will get home. Polish lorry driver Greg Mazurek, 36, said he was in the UK with another driver to deliver a respirator to a medical centre on Sunday. ""I came on Sunday morning and in the evening we were told the border was closed, France was closed and [there was] no option to leave the UK. ""We were not prepared for such a long trip. It was supposed to be a fast delivery, two or three days, then go back home for Christmas with our families. ""Now we don't know if we will get home in time. We know nothing. ""It is no problem getting food. We are in Dover town centre. We can go to the supermarket. ""All we are doing is waiting, waiting, waiting. Waiting for information. Watching the port. Waiting to get back home to our families. ""They miss us, we miss them.  We don't know when we will be able to get home."" Florian Catana said he was desperate to get home to his wife and seven-year-old daughter Romanian lorry driver Florian Catana said he was desperate to get back home to his family. He told the BBC: ""We are tired, we are disappointed and we are scared. ""We will miss our Christmas with families and we don't know what to do. ""I have called everywhere to ask if they can help us and no answer, nobody knows, we just have to wait. ""I found a place by a gas station to park, no toilet of course, only some water that we buy. ""We tried to find some place to sleep. It was so difficult.  They don't want us. Our customers, they found a room and we slept. ""Last night we took a shower, we ate some warm food. Tonight we will sleep in the car. It will be difficult to find a place to stay as there are so many lorries now. ""My small daughter is seven years old. She is waiting for me. ""I tell her I am stuck here because the border is closed but she doesn't understand what the border is. ""She says 'you have to come, we have to make the tree for Christmas'. My wife was crying yesterday."" Russell Elphick said he worries about the drivers from Eastern Europe Russell Elphick, a 54-year-old lorry driver from the West Midlands, set off for Belgium on Sunday night and has been stuck in Kent ever since. He is now waiting for his unaccompanied trailers to return from France, after which point, he will return home. ""There were five or six of us heading down Sunday night and we all decided to get off the motorway and head for Ashford truck stop which I think saved our Christmas. ""There is everything you need at the truck stops, toilets, hot food if you need it. But they filled up really quickly. ""There are just miles and miles of trucks marooned on the motorway and they've got no facilities or nothing, I really feel for them. ""I've had company from the other truckers. We've been drinking beer, I've had a whale of a time. It's the others I worry about. ""They won't be home for Christmas now."" German lorry driver Ronald Schroeder said he has given up hope of getting home for Christmas Ronald Schroeder, 52, from Hamburg, Germany, was turned back from Dover on Sunday night. He said the situation for drivers is worsening due to a lack of toilets and washing facilities. He explained: ""I am now staying in a hotel, but in front of the hotel there are thousands of people without any rooms. ""The public toilets should be open, there should be someone to hand tea or coffee to the drivers, there should be more help for all the people who have been stranded. ""I am in a warm hotel, I have enough food for the next two weeks, but other people are already staying a second night in their car. ""I ask the British government to please help, and help immediately. ""I already know that for me, Christmas is gone. I have lost the hope this Christmas to be at home with my children and my wife.""

"Nicola Smith with her husband Steve who died in July this year After a particularly tough year, Nicola Smith was planning to spend Christmas abroad with her daughter and granddaughter to create ""new memories"". Her husband, Steve, died in a motorbike accident in July - and the toy shop she owns had to shut for huge parts of 2020 due to the Covid-19 lockdowns. Nicola, 60, from Morecambe, was due to fly to Canada on Monday to visit her daughter Philippa, and three-year-old granddaughter Martha. It would have been the first time she had seen Philippa since she suffered her own trauma: Philippa's partner, Tom, died in a white-water-rafting accident last year. But her hopes of seeing her family were dashed on Monday morning when Canada brought in a 72-hour ban on flights from the UK. ""I just wanted to go away where we could make new memories,"" said Nicola. ""I haven't seen Philippa since Tom drowned, and she's having such a hard time so far away from her family with a lockdown. ""She was trying to work from home with a three-year-old, with no family within thousands of miles. ""She was so looking forward to just having her mum there."" Numerous countries have introduced travel bans amid concerns over the new coronavirus variant Canada is one of several countries to havebanned arrivals from the UKbecause of concerns about the spread of a new variant of coronavirus. Nicola said this year had been ""horrendous"", and when she woke up to the news of the travel ban she was in ""disbelief"". Christmas Day will be exactly five months after Steve's death, so she was looking forward to getting away to somewhere she hadn't spent the festive season before. Nicola also hasn't seen her granddaughter since she was a baby - so the Christmas trip was going to be an extra special time for the family. ""I speak on Facebook Messenger to her but it's not the same,"" Nicola said. ""She doesn't really know who I am, but she's been getting excited for grandma coming."" It's not yet clear when the UK travel ban to Canada will be lifted - or whether Nicola will be able to rebook her flight. ""You come so far and then it's taken away again,"" she said. ""If there's a flight on Christmas Eve I'll go. But nobody knows what's going to happen"". Nick Kennedy and his family were looking forward to hosting his parents in France this Christmas Nicola is one of many people who have had their plans to go abroad for Christmas disrupted at the last minute. Canada, India, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, Italy and Austria aresome of the more than 40 countriesthat have blocked UK arrivals. British man Nick Kennedy, who lives in France, was looking forward to sharing Christmas with his parents who were due to travel there from Swindon on Tuesday. ""We don't get enough time together as a family, so we wanted to make the most of it."" he said. ""We want our son to spend as much time as possible with his English grandparents. ""It's a big disappointment as a family. All I can hope for is that the borders reopen very, very quickly. We've got to wait until Tuesday to see if there's any possibility of movement before Christmas. ""Many people, including my family, don't believe the borders will be open."" Les hasn't seen his family since August Les Banks Irvine was due to fly back to the UK from Monrovia in Liberia - where he works - to spend three weeks with his family this Christmas. But when he turned up at the airport on Sunday he was told at the check in-desk: ""Sorry, because you're going to the UK, you can't go."" ""I was hoping to be spending some time with my two children and three grandchildren in mid-Wales, but it now looks like I am stranded here in Monrovia,"" he said. ""I've been here for about nine months this year. I last saw my family at the end of August. ""I know its difficult times for everyone, but I do wish national air carriers would keep us informed."" Flights from the UK are being suspended to countries across the world including Italy, Slovakia and India Maria Kovacsova, who is from Slovakia but lives in London, is due to fly home to see her family on Christmas Eve - but her trip is looking unlikely now. ""I have spent so much money on a private Covid test in order to go home,"" she said. ""I haven't seen my family for a year. My heart is broken. ""I was last at home a year ago. I couldn't go after that because the big lockdown started in March. I had to work as well. ""I'm going to do nothing for Christmas. You can't do anything basically, you can't see your friends or family. ""I live in shared accommodation with five people in Tooting. We are basically five strangers living together; five professionals in one house and we're not able to leave the house."" Gary and Abigail own a pet transport company Gary Fearon and his partner Abigail Brown, who have lived in Spain since January, are facing the prospect of Christmas in a Northampton hotel. The couple own a pet transport company and had arrived in the UK on Friday to deliver pets from Spain. They were due to pick up other customers' pets from the UK and travel back with them to Spain on Tuesday. But their plans are now up in the air. ""We have no information as to when and how we will get to Spain,"" said Gary. ""Customers who are ready to fly to Spain are now having to decide what to do with their pets as we cannot guarantee when we can leave."" The couple are unable to stay with family as Gary's relatives live in Ireland and Abigail's family are in Covid high-risk groups. ""The hotel we're in at the minute doesn't know for definite if they're open on Christmas Day,"" said Gary. ""We have our own pets in Spain that are being minded by a neighbour. ""We've been lucky to get a hotel room. I feel sorry for the lorry drivers in Dover.""

"This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed More than 2,850 lorries are stuck in Kent waiting to leave the UK, the county council has said, as politicians thrash out a plan to reopen France's border to trade and travel. France shut its UK border for 48 hours on Sunday amid fears of a new coronavirus variant. Any solution would probably include testing for lorry drivers, BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said. Meanwhile, the EU Commission hasurged countries to drop their travel bans. More than 50 countries have banned UK arrivals following widespread concern about the spread of the new variant. Ina recommendation to all member states,,externalthe commission said flight and train bans should be discontinued to avoid supply chain disruption. People should be allowed to travel to their country of residence, provided they take a Covid-19 test or self-isolate, it said. But the commission added that non-essential travel should still be discouraged. 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK Currently, no lorries are leaving the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel to France. The leader of Kent County Council, Roger Gough, told the BBC that 2,220 vehicles were at the temporary lorry park at Manston, while 632 were still being held on the M20. It comes as Tesco said it would bereintroducing temporary purchasing limits on some essential products, including toilet rolls, eggs, rice and hand wash. A further 36,804 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus and there were 691 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to Tuesday's government figures,external. It is the largest daily number of cases recorded yet, though it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring when testing was much more limited. Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast discussions were under way between the UK and France ""to find a resolution"" to the Channel disruption, with an update on the situation expected later. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke on Monday and, according to the BBC's Hugh Schofield, a solution to the blockage will probably include compulsory negative Covid tests for lorry drivers coming into France from the UK. Any plans agreed between the leaders would come into effect on Wednesday, France's Europe minister, ClÃ©ment Beaune, said. Ms Patel said potentially testing lorry drivers at ports was ""part of the discussions"", adding that setting up testing for this could ""happen relatively quickly"". This video can not be played 'Operation Brock' in place for lorry drivers EU member states are understood to be pressing for UK arrivals to be tested for the virus before entering their countries. Bosses at Eurotunnel estimate that up to 2,500 freight vehicles are expected to arrive in the UK on Tuesday, and the same again on Wednesday. The port of Harwich in Essex - which is about 130 miles from Dover by road - is also seeing a build up of lorries as drivers divert from Dover, a spokesman for the port said. The port of Felixstowe in Suffolk is also busy but there are no queues. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Ports chaos 'bad for trust and post-Brexit trade' How could mass testing be used? The British Retail Consortium said trucks needed to be able to start travelling again in the next 24 hours to ""avoid seeing problems on our shelves"". Andrew Opie, its director of food and sustainability, told the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee: ""What we've been told by members is that unless those trucks can start travelling again and go back to Spain and Portugal and other parts of Europe, we will have problems with fresh produce from 27 December."" Labour's Rachel Reeves told BBC Breakfast the government had ""wasted the last 24 hours"" and called for ""testing in place so we can reopen the border"". In other developments: The company behind the Covid-19 vaccine being given to people in the UK says it is ""highly likely"" it willprotect people against the new variantof the virus Northern Ireland's Executivevotes against introducing a travel ban between Northern Irelandand England, Scotland and Wales Royal Mail said it had temporarily suspended all mail services to Europe, with the exception of the Republic of Ireland, due to travel restrictions Thenumber of excess deaths in the UKsince the start of the pandemic has passed 81,000 Army soldiershave been drafted into drive ambulances in Wales The border disruption has also affected passenger services - with many air, rail and sea services cancelled between the UK and France, as well as other countries. Eurotunnel said it hoped passengers would be able to travel between the UK and France from Wednesday or Thursday, if a solution was agreed. British Airways said it would operate ""a reduced and dynamic schedule"" amid the uncertainty. Live updates from Kent Impact of new variant on children investigated The Channel is a vital trade route, with about 10,000 lorries a day travelling between Dover and Calais at Christmas, largely bringing in the freshest produce. Shane Brennan, the head of the Cold Chain Federation which represents the UK's temperature-controlled transport industry, said the number of vehicles stuck was worse than the government figures suggested, as lorries were ""dispersed around southern England"". Ms Patel said the numbers do ""fluctuate"", and added there were welfare facilities and support available for hauliers at Manston Airport. Queues on the M20 in Kent aren't exactly unheard of, but the French decision to close the border is dramatic and has caused a lot of disruption. Politicians on both sides of the Channel are hopeful they might be able to agree a way of getting things moving again before the end of the year. But if that requires a massive expansion of testing for coronavirus at the border, that's easy to say, far harder to do.

Some parts of England, as well as Wales,have asked people who travelfrom tier four areas to self-isolate.

"Tesco has introduced purchasing limits on some products including eggs, rice, soap and toilet roll. The move is to make sure everyone has access to the products, it said in an email to customers. Customers are allowed to buy up to three of each item. The move comes as almost 3,000 lorries remain stranded in Kent after restrictions on travel and freight between the UK and France were introduced. The supermarket giant also encouraged customers to shop alone to ensure social distancing in stores. 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as UK and France aim to restart freight Tesco said it has ""good stock levels"" and customers should ""shop as you normally would"". Tesco introduced limits on some products in September in a bid to prevent a repeat of the panic-buying that led to shortages in March. France shut its UK border for 48 hours on Sunday amid fears of a new coronavirus variant. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has since announcedthat some travel can resume, although lorry drivers are still advised not to travel to Kent after days of disruption. Dozens of other countries have banned UK arrivals, including India, Iran and Canada. Any solution would probably include testing for lorry drivers, BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said. French authorities say some journeys will be allowed for residents and nationals with a recent negative test. Hauliers are expected to be updated later on Tuesday. Meanwhile,the EU Commission has urged other countries to drop their travel bans. In a recommendation to all member states, it said flight and train bans should be discontinued to avoid supply chain disruption.

This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed On Monday, Tesco and Sainsbury's warned that some fresh items could run short if no way is found to get freight moving again. Much of the UK's fresh vegetable stock comes from continental Europe in the winter, including tomatoes and cabbages. Tesco anticipated that produce such as lettuces and citrus fruit could be hit. Sainsbury's told the BBC that it did not currently have any product caps in place, and said it had ""good availability"". Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, pointed out that retailers have stocked up on goods ahead of Christmas, which should prevent immediate problems. However, he said that if testing is required to reopen borders ""we need to ensure it is quick to avoid adding friction to the supply chain. ""We have stressed to government there is no alternative to reopening the channel ports, given that it is a key supply route for fresh produce at this time of year.""

"Royal Mail has agreed what unions have called a ""landmark"" deal to settle a long-running dispute over pay and conditions. Union members will vote on a 2.7% pay increase for this year, a 1% increase next year and a shorter working week. The Communication Workers Union called it an ""excellent"" deal, marking the end of an ""adversarial"" two-year dispute. Under the agreement, Royal Mail will be able to prioritise investment in its fast-growing parcels division. It will also allow Royal Mail to modernise the business with investment in more automation. This will include replacing the handwritten signing-in sheets at sorting sites with swipe-and-scan technology. DHL and Royal Mail warn on parcel disruption Online shopping surge blamed for Royal Mail delays Royal Mail's interim executive chairman Keith Williams said: ""We have a window of opportunity to focus Royal Mail on what our customers want today - an ever-growing need for more parcels, whilst providing a sustainable letters service. ""This agreement provides a framework to do just that, but the proof will be in the pudding. We have been far too slow to adapt in the past and now need to deliver change much more quickly."" The restructuring plan was proposed by Royal Mail's former chief executive, Rico Black. Union resistance to the overhaul contributed to Mr Black's resignation in May. ""This agreement marks the end of our two year dispute with Royal Mail Group and brings closure to one of the most adversarial periods of our history,"" CWU said. The union added that the circumstances brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have ""massively advanced the change anticipated in our previous agreements in parcel growth"". Royal Mail's revenue in the eight months to November was Â£380m higher, thanks to growth in parcel demand. On Monday, Royal Mail suspended mail services to mainland Europe. Deliveries to Ireland are unaffected it said. Parcels it already has will be ""held securely"" until it can transport them it said.

"Posh cars on the driveway of his suburban house gave clues to Maher's lifestyle A UK-based haulier shipped drugs for gangs across Europe from his Warrington living room in lockdown. Thomas Maher, originally from Ireland, has been sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court to more than 14 years in jail after pleading guilty to drugs and money-laundering charges. He made thousands of pounds a week, using an encrypted Encrochat phone to fix the movement of drugs and money. He is the first major crime boss jailed using messages obtained when French police cracked the Encrochat network. The phones were considered mandatory for high-end organised crime, and more than a thousand suspects have been arrested on the strength of the evidence their messages contain. Hundreds arrested as crime chat network cracked Encrypted mobile cracked to convict drug dealer Maher, 39, used the Encrochat handles ""Satirical"" and ""Snacker"" as he did deals with organised crime networks in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and Bulgaria. The National Crime Agency says he was ""hugely influential"" among Europe's drug cartels. Sentencing him, Judge Aubrey QC said Maher was ""a high-ranking facilitator... a go-between for criminal networks needing to transport their drugs between Holland and Ireland"". Passing a sentence of 14 years and eight months, the judge told Maher: ""You were an extremely important cog in the wheel of a sophisticated network."" Maher would arrange for lorries to move massive loads of drugs hidden alongside legitimate cargoes such as fruit or wine in one direction and then to bring cash in the other direction. The NCA kept Maher under surveillance after French police passed on details of his activities Police found out about his operation after he was arrested in connection with the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants while they were being transported to the UK in October 2019. He had previously owned the trailer in which they were found. The NCA put him under surveillance in an attempt to identify the scale of his criminal activities. However, the cracking of the Encrochat network by French intelligence and the Gendarmerie provided the National Crime Agency with thousands of his encrypted messages. They were able to watch, almost in real time, as he did deals with crime bosses around Europe. Martin Clark, from the NCA, said he posed as an ""honest haulier"", but was in fact ""very much a professional facilitator and he's done it all remotely sitting in his living room"". ""He's never personally been anywhere near any of it."" In fact, the NCA said he had been scrupulous about social distancing during the pandemic while communicating via Encrochat with dozens of criminals. The evidence the agency has uncovered shines a new light on the way in which a smuggling network operates. Maher would be contacted by clients wanting to move hundreds of kilos of drugs. The messages were written in criminal slang. He would discuss deals involving shipments of ""tops"" (top shelf drugs such as cocaine), or ""Colo"" (the purest form from Colombia). Heroin, which he deemed a more downmarket drug, was known as ""bottoms"". Shipments might come from ""The Flat"" (The Netherlands) and the lorry returned with ""paper"" (cash). Officers working on Encrochat cases are having to develop skills in understanding the slang suspects are using in their messages.  In this message Thomas Maher (Satirical) is telling an alleged co-conspirator that they're not doing too badly despite the lockdown. Helpfully for police he sets out the network of drug transportation routes he is currently operating: ""Taxi ways are working out OK at the minute with this fella from flat to ours and Belgium to ours am other that's two - and plus a driver with [redacted] for Poly's sun to flat and we still have [redacted] turk to flat and and his men [redacted] to here where I am. Once we get this travel ban lifted m8 we be on the pigs bk that alone is a lot of taxi plus we have the receiver here from Asia so m8 we have a lot more than others... that's why I'm not stressing yet The police translation reads:""Our HGV drug courier business is working out OK at the moment. Someone is bringing shipments from Holland and Belgium to the UK. There's a driver for ecstasy from Spain to Holland, and we still have Turkey to Holland, and [redacted] is bringing shipments to the UK. Once the travel ban is lifted we will be doing rather well. That alone is a lot of shipments plus we have someone bringing drugs in from Asia.  So, we have a lot more than other gangs... that's why I'm not stressing yet. However, like many users of the Encrochat network, Maher believed his messages could not be read, so he didn't bother trying to communicate in code. Crucial evidence was obtained from pictures on his phone. His drivers would photograph the shipments to prove they had been picked up. They would sometimes use a ""token"" during the handover. This involved showing a particular Euro bank note, with digits previously agreed as evidence of identity. When Maher was moving drugs he would earn around Â£3,500 each time. For money, transported for laundering in consignments of 300,000 euros at a time, he would ""skim"" 1% of the total as his payment He was ""always showing Â£50 notes in the pub"", Martin Clark said, and people were suspicious that he was a criminal. Maher lived in a ""fairly modest"" Cheshire home, but police surveillance spotted luxury cars including a Range Rover, Porsche Cayenne, Mercedes GLS and Corvette parked on the drive. When they raided his house they found evidence he had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on Rolex and Hublot watches. He had taken holidays in Dubai, Mexico and New York where he liked to buy pricey modern art, including a map of the world created from bullets.

"A68a: The section that looks like a ""finger"" has snapped The giant iceberg that's been drifting through the South Atlantic looks to have experienced a major break-up. Tuesday's latest satellite imagery reveals major fissures in the tabular berg known as A68a, with huge blocks of ice starting to separate and move away from each other. A68a, which calved from Antarctica in 2017, has been floating off the coast of South Georgia island. Experts have been watching to see if it might ground in shallow water. Were that to happen - and parts of the berg still could - it might cause problems for the British Overseas Territory's penguins and seals as they go about foraging for fish and krill. Giant iceberg A68a prangs seabed and loses corner Mission to investigate gigantic iceberg A68a RAF cameras capture world's biggest iceberg World's biggest iceberg is fraying at its edges The image at the top of this page comes from the EU's Sentinel-1 radar spacecraft. It was acquired at 07:17 GMT on Tuesday. Although cracks were very pronounced on Monday, they hadn't by that stage cut right through A68a. ""Nearly three-and-a-half years since it calved away from Larsen C Ice Shelf, Iceberg A68a - the fourth largest on record - is finally beginning to disintegrate,"" observed Adrian Luckman from Swansea University, UK.

""As well as being one of the largest icebergs ever recorded, A68 must also be one of the most watched. ""With such a massive recent growth in the volume of satellite data and a huge improvement in the speed at which it can be made available, this capability has been put to good use in monitoring this huge iceberg on its journey from birth to destruction,"" he told BBC News. The US National Ice Center operates the naming system for icebergs. How the berg looked on Monday. Deep cracks but not yet fully fragmented The bergs get given a prefix letter depending on which quadrant of the Antarctic they calve from, plus a number to designate their position in the sequence of big breakaways. Fragmentations then earn a suffix letter. Just last week, a big piece broke from A68a and this was called A68d. You can see ""d"" trailing behind the main berg in another Sentinel-1 image from Monday processed byPierre Markuse,external. Two of the largest fragments identified by Sentinel-1 on Tuesday have already been named A68e and A68f. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

GIS and mapping specialist at the British Antarctic Survey Laura Gerrish calculates the areas of the various fragments to be roughly: A68a - 2,600 sq km A68d - 144 sq km A68e - 655 sq km A68f - 225 sq km (Fragments A68b and A68c broke away a long time ago and are not in the immediate vicinity) Laura Gerrish is tracking the berg around South Georgia Although now much reduced in size, A68a is still imposing and could yet present a sizeable obstacle to South Georgia's foraging marine predators. At the moment, all the berg fragments are entrained in a fast-moving stream of water known as the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. This is likely to sweep the chunks around the island and then throw them north. Satellites will monitor their progress as they skirt the shallow continental shelf. There are a number of places where the fragments could get caught and anchor in place. When A68 first calved from Antarctica, it measured almost 6,000 sq km - about a quarter of the size of the Wales. To put Tuesday's remnant A68a in some context - 2,600 sq km still bigger than Greater London, which covers about 1,500 sq km of land. This video can not be played Watch: The RAF flies over iceberg A68a The iceberg came from a part of the Antarctic where it is still very cold - the Larsen C Ice Shelf. This is a mass of floating ice formed by glaciers that have flowed down off the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula into the ocean. On entering the water, the glaciers' buoyant fronts lift up and join together to make a single protrusion. The calving of bergs at the forward edge of this shelf is a very natural behaviour.

"Peter Cruddas won a libel case against the Sunday Times in 2013 Boris Johnson has nominated businessman Peter Cruddas for a peerage, despite his rejection by the honours watchdog. The Lords Appointments Commission did not support ennobling the businessman, who quit as Tory co-treasurer in 2012 following cash-for-access allegations. Mr Cruddas later won a libel case against a newspaper over its claims. Mr Johnson rejected the commission's recommendation, becoming the first PM to ignore its advice on a nomination since it was set up in 2000. Labour accused Mr Johnson -who received Â£50,000 from Mr Cruddas,externalfor his campaign to become Conservative leader in 2019 - of ""cronyism"". Former Archbishop of York John Sentamu and ex-MI5 boss Sir Andrew Parker are also among those given peerages in the political honours list. Mr Cruddas, who has donated more than Â£3m to the Conservatives since 2007, resigned as party co-treasurer in 2012 after a newspaper story suggested he was offering access to then Prime Minister David Cameron for a donation of Â£250,000 a year. But the following year he won Â£180,000 in damages in a libel victory against the Sunday Times, which had published the claims. The damages were later reduced to Â£50,000 on appeal. In a letter to the Lords appointment commission,,externalMr Johnson said its rejection of Mr Cruddas's nomination for a peerage related ""to historic concerns in respect of allegations"" made during his time as co-treasurer. But he added that these had been found to be ""untrue and libellous"" and that an internal Conservative Party investigation had discovered ""no intentional wrongdoing"" on Mr Cruddas's part. Mr Johnson also said the committee had found ""no suggestion of any matters of concern"" before or since the 2012 allegations. Former Archbishop of York John Sentamu is among those honoured Mr Cruddas, the founder of financial services company CMC Markets and a prominent Brexit supporter, had a ""long track record of committed political service"" and was one of the UK's ""most successful business figures"", the prime minister argued. The commission provides advice but appointments to the Lords are ultimately a decision for the prime minister. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""After months of revelations about the cronyism at the heart of this government, it's somehow appropriate the prime minister has chosen to end the year with a peerage to Peter Cruddas."" She added that there was ""one rule for the Conservatives and their chums, another for the rest of the country"". Former environment minister Sir Richard Benyon; former MEPs Dame Jacqueline Foster, Syed Kamall and Daniel Hannan; Cerebral Palsy Scotland chief executive Stephanie Fraser; and Dean Godson, director of the Policy Exchange think tank, have also been nominated for Conservative seats in the Lords. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer chose Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake; former MPs Vernon Coaker and Jennifer Chapman, who chaired his Labour leadership campaign; former MEP Wajid Khan; and Gillian Merron, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and a former Labour MP. As well as Mr Sentamu and Sir Andrew, the nominations for crossbench - non-party - peerages are former judge Sir Terence Etherton and Sir Simon McDonald, former permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office. The Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, criticised the number of new peers, which will bring the total membership of the House of Lords to more than 830, accusing Mr Johnson of a ""massive U-turn"" on his predecessor Theresa May's policy of reducing it in size. It added ""insult to injury"" that the appointments had been announced while Parliament was in recess, he said. ""It may also now be the time to review the role and the powers of the House of Lords Appointments Commission,"" Lord Fowler added.

"The number of excess deaths - those above expected levels - since the start of the pandemic has passed 81,000. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows the UK saw nearly 14,000 deaths in the week of 11 December. This was 13% above the expected levels for this time of year, down from 15% the week before. Of these deaths, 3,062 involved Covid-19, also slightly lower than the preceding week. Excess deaths are the difference between the total number of deaths registered (the height of the shaded area in the chart below) and the average over the previous five years for the same weeks (shown by the dashed line). This average level rises each week in a normal winter as cold weather, flu and other factors lead to more deaths. In recent weeks, the total number of deaths in the UK has been largely steady. The rises seen throughout October and early November stalled, largely due to the falls in coronavirus infections, hospitalisations and deaths seen during November and early December. As a result, the gap between the total number of deaths seen and the expected levels has narrowed. But the gap has not disappeared and in the week of 11 December, the total excess deaths seen since the pandemic started in March passed 81,300. Nearly 524,000 deaths have been registered in total compared to just over 442,000 seen in the same weeks, on average, in the last five years. This total is larger than that recorded in the daily figures because it includes people whose Covid-19 was not confirmed by a positive test and people who died because of the strain the pandemic has put on the NHS and society.

"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

In an email to customers the supermarket giant said stock levels were good and reminded them to shop normally so that everyone was able to get what they need. Tesco said it had temporary purchasing limits in place on certain essential items to help all customers have access to these products. These are understood to include toilet roll, eggs, rice, soap and hand wash. Earlier, an executive at (another) supermarket told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack that they did not feel the need to introduce caps on any items shoppers could buy at their stores. Police have released bodycam footage of the moment a party of more than 60 people was discovered in Leicester. Two Â£10,000 fines were issued for holding the gathering at a private residence, which broke coronavirus rules on 12 December, Leicestershire Police said.

Skylar Mack, an 18-year-old from Georgia, broke the 14-day quarantine last month after two days by removing a government geo-tracking bracelet and attending a jet ski event where her Caymanian boyfriend was competing. According to the judge in the case, Mack had swapped out her bracelet for one that was more loose one day before her violation, so that she would be able to slip out of it more easily. ""Sheâs terrified. She called me last night, she couldnât sleep,"" her grandmother Jeanne Mack told Fox News on Monday. ""She knows she did wrong,"" she said, calling the incident ""a total lapse in judgement of an otherwise brilliant young lady."" According to the Cayman Compass newspaper, Mack did not wear a mask or socially distance while watching the jet ski event for approximately seven hours.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The daily government figures on coronavirus are very sobering. Deaths linked to the virus are beginning to climb, with another 691 deaths reported on Tuesday. But deaths happening now are people who would have been infected at the start of the month. Since then we know cases have risen rapidly. The 36,804 new confirmed infections reported today are a daily record since mass testing began in the early summer â although it is likely there were more cases in the spring peak but a lack of testing meant we were not spotting them. The jump means we are now seeing twice the number of daily cases than we were at the start of the month on average. That means deaths will, sadly, continue to climb in the coming weeks. As will hospital admissions. The figures show there are nearly 19,000 patients in hospital, bring the NHS ever closer to the spring peak when just over 21,000 were being treated for Covid at one point. Hospital bosses are warning the next 10 to 15 days are going to be crucial. The situation is ""serious"" at Manston in Kent where hundreds of lorry drivers are stranded due to the closure of the border. The Road Haulage Association's policy and public affairs managing director Rod McKenzie tweeted that ""drivers have few toilets and little food to eat"". The trade body is calling on the government to act quickly to tackle the situation. Manston Airport is being used as a temporary lorry park. Allow Twitter content?

Lauren MossPolitical editor, BBC South East Today There are now almost 3,000 lorries being held in Kent as they wait to cross to the continent, the leader of Kent County Council has said. Roger Gough told the BBC that 2,220 vehicles are now at the airport in Manston. A further 632 are still being held on the M20 motorway. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter A new variant of the virus causing Covid-19, first spotted in Kent, could already be circulating - or have originated from - outside the UK. But it was spotted here because of the strength of the UK's surveillance system, scientists have said. The Covid-19 Genomics Consortium (Cog-UK) has tracked the genetic history of more than 150,000 samples of Sars-Cov-2 virus. That equates to about half the world's genetic sequencing of coronavirus.

According to the New York Times, at least 14 of the approximately 50 death row inmates at the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, have been infected. Among the infected are two men scheduled to die next month. Federal executions had been on hold for 17 years before President Trump ordered them to be resumed earlier this year. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes over the White House on 20 January, has said he would seek to halt federal executions. Lawyers for the two condemned men have already asked the courts to delay their sentences. Another inmate scheduled to die before Biden takes office - Lisa Montgomery - has already had her sentenced postponed after her two lawyers tested positive for the virus. According to a survey last month from The Marshall Project and The Associated Press,external, approximately one in five US prisoners is infected with Covid-19. Simon JackBBC Business Editor A senior supermarket
executive has told the BBC that while some shelves are empty there is plenty of
stock to replenish them overnight. The company said they felt no need to
introduce caps on the number of items shoppers can buy as although customers were
spending heavily they were doing so ârationallyâ. The executive added that much
of the buying was down to a change of Christmas plans, saying âthere are a lot more
Christmases than people were expecting due to the new restrictions on
households mingling and shoppers are buying accordingly â but hoping to do it
onceâ. The company said that if the problems at the border did not start to
improve within the next 48 hours then shortages of fresh food would begin to bite
from 27 December. China has suspended
its visa application service in London. In a statement, the
Chinese embassy did not reveal how long the suspension would last. âIn accordance
with the relevant pandemic prevention advice, the Chinese Visa Application
Service Centre in London will suspend its operation from December 22nd,
2020 until further notice,âthe
statement said,external. The announcement
came after a new strain of Covid-19 was revealed in the UK. More than 50 countries
have banned travel from the UK so far. Last month, the
Chinese embassy announced the temporary suspension of entry into China by
non-Chinese nationals in the UK holding Chinese visas or residence permits. Olympic Village in Tokyo Organisers of the delayed Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will spend $900m (Â£670m) on measures to stop the spread of coronavirus at next year's events. The final budget means the Games will cost $15.9bn (Â£11.8bn) - up $2.8bn (Â£2.1bn) from figures last year. It could make the Tokyo Games the most expensive summer Olympics in history. A poll last week by national broadcaster NHK showed that the majority of the Japanese general public oppose holding the Games next year, favouring a further delay or outright cancellation of the event. But organisers insist the Games can be held, and have ruled out another delay. Virus measures being planned include the creation of a infection control centre in the Olympic and Paralympic Village, as well as plans to regularly test athletes, and a ban on cheering.

There were 215 deaths reported on Monday. It takes the total deaths by this measure since the start of the pandemic to 68,307. A further 36,804 people have tested positive for Covid-19 across the country, up from a rise of 33,364 on Monday. While some of those hoping to cross the Channel to mainland Europe are queuing on the M20, others have been diverted around eastern Kent, via Manston. The Marquess of Bute has been charged withallegedly breaking coronavirus laws after reportedly travelling to Scotland from London. Police Scotland launched an investigation following reports on Monday that he and six others travelled to the Isle of Bute. The marquess has a home in London as well as his ancestral home of Mount Stuart on Bute, an island in the Firth of Clyde. Scotland's cross border travel curbs have been in place since November. Also known as John Colum Bute, the 62-year-old marquess is a former F1 driver who raced under the name Johnny Dumfries. The Bute family has been contacted for comment. Public health experts in the US have been weighing in on the UK's discovery of a new mutant variant of Covid-19, with many saying that there is a solid likelihood that the virus is already present in the US. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US disease researcher, told ABC News this morning that it is ""certainly possible"" that the mutant strain is already present in the US. ""I mean, when you have this amount of spread within a place like the UK that you really need to assume that it's here already,"" he said. ""It may not - and certainly it's not the dominant strain, but I would not be surprised at all if it was already here."" The former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the regulator tasked with approving vaccines and medicines, said the new strain âis already in the US.â âI donât think a travel ban [on the UK], at this point, is going to prevent this mutated strain from coming into the United States,â Scott Gottlieb told CNBC. Greg Mazurek was making a delivery to the UK with another driver More than 1,500 lorries are waiting to leave the UK while the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel remain closed to traffic leaving the country. Polish lorry driver Greg Mazurek, 36, said he arrived in the UK with another driver to deliver a respirator to a medical centre on Sunday. ""We were not prepared for such a long trip.

"The vaccine made by Pfizer-BioNTech is currently being given to the most vulnerable in the UK The company behind the Covid-19 vaccine being given to people in the UK says it is ""highly likely"" the vaccine will protect people against the new variant of the virus. But if necessary, the vaccine could be re-engineered in a matter of weeks, BioNTech's boss said. UK scientists discovered the variant after analysing a sharp rise in cases in the south-east of England. They say it could spread up to 70% more quickly than other forms of the virus. The new variant is thought to be present in many parts of the UK but is particularly concentrated in cases in Kent, Essex and London. This is where the fastest rise in cases is being detected, with some areas seeing cases double in the past week. The daily figures released by the government showed 36,804 cases reported in the UK - a record since mass testing began in the summer. Some 691 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. The new variant has also been found in Denmark, the Netherlands and South Africa - countries which,like the UK, are experienced at carrying out genome sequencing- and is likely to be present in many more. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? More than 40 countries ban UK arrivals over Covid Impact of new variant on children investigated Called VOC-202012/01, the variant contains 23 mutations - an unusually large number all at once - which can cause it to behave differently, although it's unclear yet exactly how. There are no signs the new variant causes a more severe form of Covid-19 and no evidence it spreads more easily in children, although this is something being investigated. BioNTech, in partnership with drug firm Pfizer, developed the first vaccine against Covid-19 to be approved by an internationally recognised regulatory body - the UK's, in early December. More than 500,000 people in the UK have now been given their first dose of the vaccine. The vaccine has also been approved by the US regulator, the FDA, and the European Medicines Agency for use in the EU. Covid vaccine approved for use in EU's 27 states US Pfizer Covid vaccine approved for emergency use Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week At a news conference in Germany, Ugur Sahin, chief executive of BioNTech, said ""scientifically, it is highly likely that [the] immune response by this vaccine also can deal with the new virus variant"". And he added that the company had the technology to refine its vaccine very quickly if it needed to. ""The beauty of the Messenger RNA technology is that we can directly start to engineer a vaccine which completely mimics this new mutation - we could be able to provide a new vaccine technically within six weeks, so that means a vaccine which contains this information,"" Mr Sahin said. He confirmed that he didn't know ""at the moment"" if their vaccine was able to provide protection against this new variant. Genomics experts from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK) which discovered the new variant after examining a cluster of cases in Kent, also say it should not affect how well the Covid vaccine works. They believe that antibodies, which build up in the body to defend it against future infections, will still target the virus despite some mutations affecting its infamous spike protein. But they warned the virus may develop more mutations in the future. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now?

"Tesco has introduced purchasing limits on some products including eggs, rice, soap and toilet roll. The move is to make sure everyone has access to the products, it said in an email to customers. Customers are allowed to buy up to three of each item. The move comes as almost 3,000 lorries remain stranded in Kent after restrictions on travel and freight between the UK and France were introduced. The supermarket giant also encouraged customers to shop alone to ensure social distancing in stores. 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as UK and France aim to restart freight Tesco said it has ""good stock levels"" and customers should ""shop as you normally would"". Tesco introduced limits on some products in September in a bid to prevent a repeat of the panic-buying that led to shortages in March. France shut its UK border for 48 hours on Sunday amid fears of a new coronavirus variant. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has since announcedthat some travel can resume, although lorry drivers are still advised not to travel to Kent after days of disruption. Dozens of other countries have banned UK arrivals, including India, Iran and Canada. Any solution would probably include testing for lorry drivers, BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said. French authorities say some journeys will be allowed for residents and nationals with a recent negative test. Hauliers are expected to be updated later on Tuesday. Meanwhile,the EU Commission has urged other countries to drop their travel bans. In a recommendation to all member states, it said flight and train bans should be discontinued to avoid supply chain disruption. People should be allowed to travel to their country of residence, provided they take a Covid-19 test or self-isolate, it said. But the commission added that non-essential travel should still be discouraged. This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed On Monday, Tesco and Sainsbury's warned that some fresh items could run short if no way is found to get freight moving again. Much of the UK's fresh vegetable stock comes from continental Europe in the winter, including tomatoes and cabbages. Tesco anticipated that produce such as lettuces and citrus fruit could be hit. Sainsbury's told the BBC that it did not currently have any product caps in place, and said it had ""good availability"". Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, pointed out that retailers have stocked up on goods ahead of Christmas, which should prevent immediate problems. However, he said that if testing is required to reopen borders ""we need to ensure it is quick to avoid adding friction to the supply chain. ""We have stressed to government there is no alternative to reopening the channel ports, given that it is a key supply route for fresh produce at this time of year."" The Channel is a vital trade route, with about 10,000 lorries a day travelling between Dover and Calais at Christmas, often bringing in the freshest produce.

"Peter Cruddas won a libel case against the Sunday Times in 2013 Boris Johnson has nominated businessman Peter Cruddas for a peerage, despite his rejection by the honours watchdog. The Lords Appointments Commission did not support ennobling the businessman, who quit as Tory co-treasurer in 2012 following cash-for-access allegations. Mr Cruddas later won a libel case against a newspaper over its claims. Mr Johnson rejected the commission's recommendation, becoming the first PM to ignore its advice on a nomination since it was set up in 2000. Labour accused Mr Johnson -who received Â£50,000 from Mr Cruddas,externalfor his campaign to become Conservative leader in 2019 - of ""cronyism"". Former Archbishop of York John Sentamu and ex-MI5 boss Sir Andrew Parker are also among those given peerages in the political honours list. Mr Cruddas, who has donated more than Â£3m to the Conservatives since 2007, resigned as party co-treasurer in 2012 after a newspaper story suggested he was offering access to then Prime Minister David Cameron for a donation of Â£250,000 a year. But the following year he won Â£180,000 in damages in a libel victory against the Sunday Times, which had published the claims. The damages were later reduced to Â£50,000 on appeal. In a letter to the Lords appointment commission,,externalMr Johnson said its rejection of Mr Cruddas's nomination for a peerage related ""to historic concerns in respect of allegations"" made during his time as co-treasurer. But he added that these had been found to be ""untrue and libellous"" and that an internal Conservative Party investigation had discovered ""no intentional wrongdoing"" on Mr Cruddas's part. Mr Johnson also said the committee had found ""no suggestion of any matters of concern"" before or since the 2012 allegations. Former Archbishop of York John Sentamu is among those honoured Mr Cruddas, the founder of financial services company CMC Markets and a prominent Brexit supporter, had a ""long track record of committed political service"" and was one of the UK's ""most successful business figures"", the prime minister argued. The commission provides advice but appointments to the Lords are ultimately a decision for the prime minister. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""After months of revelations about the cronyism at the heart of this government, it's somehow appropriate the prime minister has chosen to end the year with a peerage to Peter Cruddas."" She added that there was ""one rule for the Conservatives and their chums, another for the rest of the country"". Former environment minister Sir Richard Benyon; former MEPs Dame Jacqueline Foster, Syed Kamall and Daniel Hannan; Cerebral Palsy Scotland chief executive Stephanie Fraser; and Dean Godson, director of the Policy Exchange think tank, have also been nominated for Conservative seats in the Lords. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer chose Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake; former MPs Vernon Coaker and Jennifer Chapman, who chaired his Labour leadership campaign; former MEP Wajid Khan; and Gillian Merron, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and a former Labour MP. As well as Mr Sentamu and Sir Andrew, the nominations for crossbench - non-party - peerages are former judge Sir Terence Etherton and Sir Simon McDonald, former permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office. The Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, criticised the number of new peers, which will bring the total membership of the House of Lords to more than 830, accusing Mr Johnson of a ""massive U-turn"" on his predecessor Theresa May's policy of reducing it in size. It added ""insult to injury"" that the appointments had been announced while Parliament was in recess, he said. ""It may also now be the time to review the role and the powers of the House of Lords Appointments Commission,"" Lord Fowler added.

"The group travelled to Bute in contravention of Covid rules The Marquess of Bute has been charged with allegedly breaking coronavirus laws after reportedly travelling to Scotland from London. Police Scotland launched an investigation following reports on Monday that he and six others travelled to the Isle of Bute. The marquess has a home in London as well as his ancestral home of Mount Stuart on Bute. Scotland's cross border travel curbs have been in place since November. Border police patrols to double after travel ban Scotland tightens Covid rules at Christmas Also known as John Colum Bute, the 62-year-old marquess is a former F1 driver who raced under the name Johnny Dumfries.

"The EU and UK are making a ""final push"" for a post-Brexit trade deal, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. But he told diplomats from the bloc's 27 member states there was little time left to reach agreement before the 31 December deadline. The UK will leave the EU trading rules at that point. Talks have been taking place round the clock to try to settle differences over fishing, competition rules and how future disputes will be resolved. If there is no trade deal by 31 December, both sides could place import taxes on each other's goods, potentially affecting prices. PM resists calls to extend Brexit deadline Brexit: Can the talks be extended? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Speaking in Brussels, where the talks are happening, Mr Barnier said: ""We are really in a crucial moment and we are giving it a final push. In 10 days, the UK will leave the single market."" One EU diplomat told the BBC Mr Barnier had said that, while most issues had been agreed or were close to being settled, differences on fishing access and quotas ""remain difficult to bridge"". He said the EU thought the UK was ""not moving enough yet to clinch a fair deal on fisheries"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? While progress on other issues has been made in recent days, there has been little sign of a breakthrough on fish. The UK insists that, as a sovereign state, it must have control of its waters from 1 January and retain a larger share of the catch from them than it does under the current quota system. The EU wants to phase in a new system over a much longer period and retain significant access to UK waters for boats from France, Spain and other countries with large fleets. Downing Street sources said Boris Johnson was in ""close contact"" with European President Commission Ursula von der Leyen and the pair were ""speaking from time to time"". But, on Monday, the prime minister said the state of the talks remained ""unchanged"" and there were still ""problems"". EU diplomats have suggested the bloc would be willing to continue negotiations beyond 1 January if necessary. Mr Johnson suggested the UK would ""prosper mightily"", whatever the outcome of the talks.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Advice moving to 'stay local, stay at home' The top level of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland may need to be strengthened further to contain the new strain of the virus, Nicola Sturgeon has warned. The whole Scottish mainland is to move into level four from Boxing Day due to concerns about the new Covid variant. The first minister said this was ""essential"" to protect the NHS and contain the faster-spreading virus. And she said consideration must be given to whether the current level four rules were sufficient to do the job. The government is to narrow the definition of ""essential retail"" - forcing homeware shops and garden centres to close - while guidance urging people to stay at home as much as possible may be put down in law. What Covid level are you in from Boxing Day? Fears of level 1 businesses heading for lockdown Live: Latest on Covid-19 in Scotland Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the current rate of new cases in Scotland was currently ""significantly lower"" than in other parts of the UK, but said the new variant of Covid-19 necessitated ""real action"" and ""significant countermeasures"". The move to level four will see blanket travel restrictions in place between every council area in Scotland, with people barred from leaving their local area other than for essential reasons. Hospitality venues will have to close, as will ""non-essential"" shops - with this definition being expanded to include even more premises. Schools are to stay closed until 11 January, and most pupils will learn from home until at least 18 January - a situation Ms Sturgeon said would remain ""under review"". The government is also examining whether the current level four measures will be enough to contain the new strain of the virus, which studies suggest can spread up to 70% faster than previous variants. Ms Sturgeon said a decision on whether this was necessary would be taken as more evidence about the new variant became available. She said: ""The current level four restrictions are not as stringent as the March lockdown, and up to now that has been a good thing. ""However it seems we may be facing a virus that spreads much faster now than in March, so we must consider whether the current level four restrictions are sufficient to suppress it in the weeks ahead."" The first minister said failing to take strong action quickly would see ""another period of exponential growth"" of the virus in the new year. She said: ""This is preventative action, because we see a train coming rapidly down the track at us and we're trying to get out of its way."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said ""most people understand"" the need for tighter curbs, but said ""in return they are demanding as much clarity from government as conceivably possible"". She said people were tired of ""supposedly time-limited firebreaks stretching into months"", asking whether parents should start ""preparing now for a long haul of blended learning at home"". Ms Sturgeon hinted that tighter measures might be introduced in a bid to see schools open again full time, saying that ""continues to be a priority"" for the government. She said the intention was to reopen schools fully on 18 January ""if it is at all possible"", adding: ""If that means the rest of us living under more severe restrictions we will not shy away from that."" Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie also asked about schools, calling for ""widespread routine testing"" for teachers and expanded use of remote learning. Meanwhile Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the government had ""abandoned"" the levels system for a blanket lockdown, saying that ""three weeks does not sound like three weeks, but considerably longer"". He said if the new strain of the virus was 70% more transmissible, the government should commit to a 70% increase in business support and virus testing and a similar acceleration of the vaccination programme. Ms Sturgeon said she would seek to get back to the local levels system ""as quickly as possible"", adding that the vaccine was being rolled out as quickly as possible and there were no ""simple equations"" around boosting support. Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie voiced concerns about NHS boards cancelling ""ever greater numbers"" of non-urgent procedures, with the first minister saying the return of elective treatment relied on suppressing the virus as far as possible.

"No lorries are leaving the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel for France Chaos at ports caused by EU border closures has set back the UK's efforts to reassure foreign customers post-Brexit, the food industry has said. Food and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright said UK exporters wanted to make sure foreign firms could rely on their supply chains after 1 January. But the current crisis had harmed their cause, he told MPs. ""We've just proved... that you can't trust British products,"" he said. ""And that's really unhelpful."" Mr Wright was giving evidence to an emergency hearing of the Commons business committee, called to examine the impact of the border delays on UK business and security of supply. France shut its UK border for 48 hours on Sunday amid fears of a new coronavirus variant in the UK. More than 50 countries have now banned UK arrivals. At the same time, UK-EU talks on a post-Brexit trade deal are continuing, with nine days left to reach and ratify any agreement. 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as UK talks to France PM resists calls to extend Brexit deadline Mr Wright said the current scenes at Dover, where the number of lorries stranded and unable to cross to France has continued to rise, could be ""replicated at any point"". ""I think we will see this happen particularly if we get a no-deal Brexit,"" he added. Mr Wright said there were thought to be 4,000 trucks on their way to Dover at various points. He warned that the number could grow by the end of the day to possibly as high as 6,000 or 7,000. He also criticised the government's handling of the announcement at the weekend and urged it to compensate those who had lost out. The committee also heard that there were concerns over the welfare of lorry and van drivers caught up in the disruption, as the facilities provided for them are considered inadequate. ""We have no confidence, we have never had any confidence drivers will be looked after,"" said Duncan Buchanan of the Road Haulage Association. ""This is a very serious problem - whether you have moved trucks from one place to another, it is irrelevant."" Mr Buchanan said it was the start of supply chain disruption ""of the like we have probably never experienced"". ""Many of the retailers are saying that we are up until Christmas, we will be fine until Christmas at least, but we must recover very fast to keep the shops fully stocked after Christmas. It's a big worry,"" he added. Andrew Opie, of the British Retail Consortium, agreed, saying that if lorries were not moving within 24 hours, there could be problems with the availability of fresh food products from 27 December.

France shut its UK border for 48 hours on Sunday amid fears of a new coronavirus variant. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has since announcedthat some travel can resume, although lorry drivers are still advised not to travel to Kent after days of disruption. Dozens of other countries have banned UK arrivals, including India, Iran and Canada. Any solution would probably include testing for lorry drivers, BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said. French authorities say some journeys will be allowed for residents and nationals with a recent negative test. Hauliers are expected to be updated later on Tuesday. Meanwhile,the EU Commission has urged other countries to drop their travel bans. In a recommendation to all member states, it said flight and train bans should be discontinued to avoid supply chain disruption. People should be allowed to travel to their country of residence, provided they take a Covid-19 test or self-isolate, it said. But the commission added that non-essential travel should still be discouraged. This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed On Monday, Tesco and Sainsbury's warned that some fresh items could run short if no way is found to get freight moving again. Much of the UK's fresh vegetable stock comes from continental Europe in the winter, including tomatoes and cabbages. Tesco anticipated that produce such as lettuces and citrus fruit could be hit. Sainsbury's told the BBC that it did not currently have any product caps in place, and said it had ""good availability"". Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, pointed out that retailers have stocked up on goods ahead of Christmas, which should prevent immediate problems. However, he said that if testing is required to reopen borders ""we need to ensure it is quick to avoid adding friction to the supply chain. ""We have stressed to government there is no alternative to reopening the channel ports, given that it is a key supply route for fresh produce at this time of year."" The Channel is a vital trade route, with about 10,000 lorries a day travelling between Dover and Calais at Christmas, often bringing in the freshest produce.

"This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed More than 2,850 lorries are stuck in Kent waiting to leave the UK, the county council has said, as politicians thrash out a plan to reopen France's border to trade and travel. France shut its UK border for 48 hours on Sunday amid fears of a new coronavirus variant. Any solution would probably include testing for lorry drivers, BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said. Meanwhile, the EU Commission hasurged countries to drop their travel bans. More than 50 countries have banned UK arrivals following widespread concern about the spread of the new variant. Ina recommendation to all member states,,externalthe commission said flight and train bans should be discontinued to avoid supply chain disruption. People should be allowed to travel to their country of residence, provided they take a Covid-19 test or self-isolate, it said. But the commission added that non-essential travel should still be discouraged. 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK Currently, no lorries are leaving the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel to France. The leader of Kent County Council, Roger Gough, told the BBC that 2,220 vehicles were at the temporary lorry park at Manston, while 632 were still being held on the M20. It comes as Tesco said it would bereintroducing temporary purchasing limits on some essential products, including toilet rolls, eggs, rice and hand wash. A further 36,804 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus and there were 691 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to Tuesday's government figures,external. It is the largest daily number of cases recorded yet, though it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring when testing was much more limited. Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast discussions were under way between the UK and France ""to find a resolution"" to the Channel disruption, with an update on the situation expected later. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke on Monday and, according to the BBC's Hugh Schofield, a solution to the blockage will probably include compulsory negative Covid tests for lorry drivers coming into France from the UK. Any plans agreed between the leaders would come into effect on Wednesday, France's Europe minister, ClÃ©ment Beaune, said. Ms Patel said potentially testing lorry drivers at ports was ""part of the discussions"", adding that setting up testing for this could ""happen relatively quickly"". This video can not be played 'Operation Brock' in place for lorry drivers EU member states are understood to be pressing for UK arrivals to be tested for the virus before entering their countries. Bosses at Eurotunnel estimate that up to 2,500 freight vehicles are expected to arrive in the UK on Tuesday, and the same again on Wednesday. The port of Harwich in Essex - which is about 130 miles from Dover by road - is also seeing a build up of lorries as drivers divert from Dover, a spokesman for the port said. The port of Felixstowe in Suffolk is also busy but there are no queues. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Ports chaos 'bad for trust and post-Brexit trade' How could mass testing be used? The British Retail Consortium said trucks needed to be able to start travelling again in the next 24 hours to ""avoid seeing problems on our shelves"". Andrew Opie, its director of food and sustainability, told the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee: ""What we've been told by members is that unless those trucks can start travelling again and go back to Spain and Portugal and other parts of Europe, we will have problems with fresh produce from 27 December."" Labour's Rachel Reeves told BBC Breakfast the government had ""wasted the last 24 hours"" and called for ""testing in place so we can reopen the border"". In other developments: The company behind the Covid-19 vaccine being given to people in the UK says it is ""highly likely"" it willprotect people against the new variantof the virus Northern Ireland's Executivevotes against introducing a travel ban between Northern Irelandand England, Scotland and Wales Royal Mail said it had temporarily suspended all mail services to Europe, with the exception of the Republic of Ireland, due to travel restrictions Thenumber of excess deaths in the UKsince the start of the pandemic has passed 81,000 Army soldiershave been drafted into drive ambulances in Wales The border disruption has also affected passenger services - with many air, rail and sea services cancelled between the UK and France, as well as other countries. Eurotunnel said it hoped passengers would be able to travel between the UK and France from Wednesday or Thursday, if a solution was agreed. British Airways said it would operate ""a reduced and dynamic schedule"" amid the uncertainty. Live updates from Kent Impact of new variant on children investigated The Channel is a vital trade route, with about 10,000 lorries a day travelling between Dover and Calais at Christmas, largely bringing in the freshest produce. Shane Brennan, the head of the Cold Chain Federation which represents the UK's temperature-controlled transport industry, said the number of vehicles stuck was worse than the government figures suggested, as lorries were ""dispersed around southern England"". Ms Patel said the numbers do ""fluctuate"", and added there were welfare facilities and support available for hauliers at Manston Airport. Queues on the M20 in Kent aren't exactly unheard of, but the French decision to close the border is dramatic and has caused a lot of disruption. Politicians on both sides of the Channel are hopeful they might be able to agree a way of getting things moving again before the end of the year. But if that requires a massive expansion of testing for coronavirus at the border, that's easy to say, far harder to do.

"The EU and UK are making a ""final push"" for a post-Brexit trade deal, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. But he told diplomats from the bloc's 27 member states there was little time left to reach agreement before the 31 December deadline. The UK will leave the EU trading rules at that point. Talks have been taking place round the clock to try to settle differences over fishing, competition rules and how future disputes will be resolved. If there is no trade deal by 31 December, both sides could place import taxes on each other's goods, potentially affecting prices. PM resists calls to extend Brexit deadline Brexit: Can the talks be extended? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Speaking in Brussels, where the talks are happening, Mr Barnier said: ""We are really in a crucial moment and we are giving it a final push. In 10 days, the UK will leave the single market."" One EU diplomat told the BBC Mr Barnier had said that, while most issues had been agreed or were close to being settled, differences on fishing access and quotas ""remain difficult to bridge"". He said the EU thought the UK was ""not moving enough yet to clinch a fair deal on fisheries"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? While progress on other issues has been made in recent days, there has been little sign of a breakthrough on fish. The UK insists that, as a sovereign state, it must have control of its waters from 1 January and retain a larger share of the catch from them than it does under the current quota system. The EU wants to phase in a new system over a much longer period and retain significant access to UK waters for boats from France, Spain and other countries with large fleets. Downing Street sources said Boris Johnson was in ""close contact"" with European President Commission Ursula von der Leyen and the pair were ""speaking from time to time"". But, on Monday, the prime minister said the state of the talks remained ""unchanged"" and there were still ""problems"". EU diplomats have suggested the bloc would be willing to continue negotiations beyond 1 January if necessary. Mr Johnson suggested the UK would ""prosper mightily"", whatever the outcome of the talks.

"Economic fallout from the pandemic has left many Americans reliant on food aid The US Congress has passed a long-awaited $900bn (Â£660bn) package of coronavirus pandemic aid after months of political wrangling. Senators approved the bill late on Monday, hours after it was passed by the House of Representatives. The aid includes direct payments for many Americans and support for businesses and unemployment programmes. The money is to accompany a bigger, $1.4tn spending bill to fund government operations over the next nine months. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the package into law quickly. President-elect Joe Biden welcomed the relief package but said Congress needed to get to work to support his Covid-19 relief plan in the new year. Allow Twitter content?

In the House, the bill passed by a vote of 359 to 53 and in the Senate it passed by 92-6. Many Covid-19 relief programmes were set to expire at the end of the month and about 12 million Americans were at risk of losing access to unemployment benefits. But some lawmakers said they felt blind-sided by being asked to vote on a mammoth bill without even having a chance to read it. At nearly 5,600 pages, the legislation was described by the Associated Press news agency as ""the longest bill in memory and probably ever"". The stimulus includes one-off $600 payments to most Americans, and will boost unemployment payments by $300 per week, extending expiration dates for the jobless programmes until the spring. It also contains more than $300bn in support for businesses, and money for vaccine distribution, schools and tenants facing eviction. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home The package includes an extension of an eviction moratorium that was due to expire at the end of this month, leaving tens of millions of Americans at risk of being thrown out of their homes. It contains $25bn in rental aid. The bill also has a provision to end surprise medical billing - where hospital patients get slapped with fees because they were treated by a doctor who was not covered by their health insurer. President Trump has championed calls to end these stealth fees, which are one of the most unpopular pitfalls of the US healthcare system. The deal was announced on Sunday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican. Speaking on Monday ahead of the vote, he said: ""None of us think this legislation is perfect, but a big bipartisan majority of us recognise the incredible amount of good it will do when we send it to the president's desk. The American people have waited long enough."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, both Democrats, said the package delivered ""urgently needed funds to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people as the virus accelerates"". This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' Lawmakers said the bill would send $600 per adult or child for individuals earning up to $75,000 or married couples earning up to $150,000, with families earning more receiving less. The first cheques could arrive as soon as next week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. The payment is half the amount that Congress approved for direct payments during the first round of pandemic relief last spring. The bill does not include substantial aid to local governments, which had been a top priority for many Democrats. In exchange, Republicans agreed to accept a deal without legal protections for businesses from Covid-related lawsuits. Mr Schumer said the package would ""establish a floor, not a ceiling, for coronavirus relief in 2021"", and that Democrats would push for more aid after President-elect Joe Biden took office on 20 January. Congress had been expected to pass the bill by Friday, but negotiations continued through the weekend. The delays led to concerns over whether the government would shut down without a spending bill. Washington has been operating on temporary funding since October, the start of the federal government's financial year. Economic analysts welcomed the deal, but have warned that it is probably too small and arrives too late to avert a slowdown in the recovery. They have also expressed concerns that money devoted to the stimulus cheques - which some families are likely to save - takes away from other, more targeted programmes that might provide a more effective boost to the economy. ""Any Covid relief bill is better than no Covid relief bill, but the measures set to be passed by Congress... do not represent the most efficient use of the $900bn total cost,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. However, on social media, many said the cheque should have been larger, saying $600 per person wasn't large enough to help meaningfully. ""$600 will hopefully save some lives but we all know it's just barely scraping by,"" wrote one social media user in California. Allow Twitter content?

Some also noted that many pandemic relief schemes have been plagued by fraud or delays in spending the money. In March the US approved more than $2.4tn in economic relief, including one-off $1,200 stimulus payments, funds for businesses and money to boost weekly unemployment payments by $600. The package was credited with cushioning the economic hit of the pandemic, which cast more than 20 million Americans out of work this spring and drove the unemployment rate up to 14.7% in April. The US has regained about half of the jobs lost, but economists and businesses have been pushing Congress to approve further economic relief, as programmes expired and money ran out, prompting recovery to slow. Nearly eight million more Americans are now living in poverty. This year has seen the biggest single year increase since poverty tracking began 60 years ago.

"Lady Margaret Tebbit, a former nurse and wife of ex-Conservative minister Norman Tebbit, has died, aged 86. She was paralysed by the IRA's October 1984 bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, during the Conservative Party conference. Lady Tebbit is understood to have died at the couple's home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in the early hours of Saturday morning. She had been suffering from Lewy Body Dementia. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Lady Tebbit as ""a brave woman who showed enormous fortitude in her suffering after the 1984 Brighton bombing"". ""My thoughts are with Norman and their family at this difficult time,"" he added in a Twitter message. 'No forgiveness' over bomb - Tebbit Bomber 'friend' of victim's daughter The Irish Republican Army (IRA) was a paramilitary organisation fighting for Northern Ireland to be a part of the Republic of Ireland, rather than the United Kingdom. The target of the IRA's Brighton bomb was Margaret Thatcher, who was prime minister at the time. She survived the blast but five people were killed and many more injured, including the then Trade Secretary Lord Tebbit and his wife. The couple were lying in bed when their ceiling collapsed, leaving Lady Tebbit with spinal injuries. The explosion ripped through several floors of the Grand Hotel in Brighton. In 1995, Lady Tebbitappeared on Desert Island Discsand spoke about the bombing. She said: ""I don't blame people, I don't completely forget or forgive, but one has to completely look forward."" Lord Tebbit, 89, previously said there was ""no possibility of any forgiveness"" for the people behind the bombing. He added: ""One can hope that there's a particularly hot corner of hell reserved for them and they can repent in their own time there."" The bomb had been planted in the hotel by Patrick Magee. He received eight life sentences but was later released under the Good Friday peace agreement in 1999. He now regularly appears alongside Jo Berry - a daughter of one of the victims - discussing peace and reconciliation. Lady Tebbit was born in the Fens in 1934 as one of nine children. She was training to be a nurse when she met her future husband, then a pilot in the RAF. She described him as ""great company - life was never dull"". For 20 years, Lady Tebbit was vice president of the spinal cord injury charity Aspire. The organisation's chief executive Brian Carlin said she would be ""deeply missed,"" describing her as ""an incredible ambassador and role model for people with spinal cord injuries"". Chair of the Association of Conservative Peers, Lord Hunt of Wirral, said Lady Tebbit was ""a courageous and brave woman,"" adding ""our thoughts are with Norman at this difficult time"".

"Scientists are urgently investigating hints the new variant of coronavirus spreads more easily in children. If proven, this could account for ""a significant proportion"" of the increase in transmission, they say. The claim comes from members of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats advisory group (Nervtag). On Monday, Boris Johnson said he wanted to open schools in January ""if we possibly can"". There are no suggestions the new form of the virus is a greater threat to children's health. What do we know? How worried should we be? The Oxford vaccine story Children almost universally shrug off the virus, but the variant could alter the role they, and schools, play in spreading the virus. Earlier strains of coronavirus found it harder to infect children than adults. One explanation is children have fewer of the doorways (the ACE2 receptor) the virus uses to enter our body's cells. A recent study of infections in schools in Englandfound that levels of the virus in school-age children reflected levels in the local community, suggesting that closing schools would only have a temporary effect. Prof Wendy Barclay, from Nervtag and Imperial College London, said the mutations to the virus appeared to be making it easier to walk through the doorways that were there. She said this could be putting children on a ""more level playing field"" with adults as the virus was ""less inhibited"" in children. Prof Barclay said: ""Therefore children are equally susceptible, perhaps, to this virus as adults, and therefore given their mixing patterns, you would expect to see more children being infected."" Work to understand the new variant is taking place at lightning speed and there is still much uncertainty. It is now thought the new variant spreads 50% to 70% faster than other forms of the virus. Early analysis of how and where it is spreading have also given ""hints that it has a higher propensity to infect children"", according to Prof Neil Ferguson from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, who also sits on Nervtag. He stressed the link was still being investigated and was not yet proven. ""If it were true, then this might explain a significant proportion, maybe even the majority, of the transmission increase seen,"" he added. But Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health, from the University of Liverpool, told the BBC there wasn't any evidence ""at the moment"" that the new variant is able to infect children more efficiently. He said this would be looked at closely by scientists over Christmas. Scientists involved in COG-UK, the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, which detected the rapid increase in the variant, said they were not aware of any increased incidence in children. The data are continuing to be analysed, but it is thought the variant continued spreading even during the lockdown in November. The R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - for this variant during the tight restrictions has been estimated at 1.2, which meant cases were increasing. At the same time the R number was 0.8 for the other forms of the virus during lockdown and they were in decline. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Prof Ferguson said he expected the number of infections to fall as schools closed and people hunkered down for Christmas. He added: ""The real question then is - how much are we able to relax measures in the new year, and still retain control?"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We want, if we possibly can, to get schools back in a staggered way at the beginning of January, in the way that we have set out. ""But obviously the common sensical thing to do is to follow the path of the epidemic and, as we showed last Saturday, to keep things under constant review.""

"Donald Begg said there is understanding but also frustration about the move to tighter restrictions Businesses in parts of the north and south of Scotland face moving into the country's toughest Covid restrictions on Boxing Day - despite currently operating under level one rules. They say they are frustrated by the decision to put the whole of mainland Scotland into level four restrictions. It includes Highland, Moray, Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders which have been in level one for several weeks. Pubs, cafes and non-essential shops close from Saturday for three weeks. Nicola Sturgeon announced the introduction of the toughest level four rules at the weekend, saying ""firm preventative action"" was needed following the emergence of a faster-spreading strain of coronavirus. Scotland tightens Covid rules at Christmas What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Donald Begg, managing director of family-owned Begg Shoes, said there was an ""element of understanding"" but also of ""an element of frustration"" about the development. The firm has shops in Inverness in the Highlands and Elgin in Moray. Mr Begg said: ""The phones have been going mad with everybody wondering 'what do we do?' Staff have been wondering and suppliers panicking about what they do with deliveries."" He added: ""I think it is just about us all working together right now."" Allow Twitter content?

The Highlands and Moray have been in level one of Scotland's coronavirus tiered system of restrictions since it was introduced at the end of October. Restrictions eased in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders earlier this month. It meant limits on hospitality, some spectator sports and soft play were relaxed. The number of positive cases in the regions have been relatively low although there has beenconcern recently about rising infection rates in the Borders. Inverness beautician Zoe Kinnear-McIntyre said efforts to control the spread of Covid were needed, but had hoped areas with low transmission rates could remain at level one. She fears months-long restrictions similar to the lockdown earlier this year. ""From a self employed perspective it's devastating,"" she said. Beautician Zoe Kinnear-McIntyre worries about how long Scotland's toughest restrictions will remain in place ""The last time we were told it would be for three weeks it went on for three months. ""We don't really know when it is ending. It is really unnerving."" In her announcement on Saturday, the first minister also confirmed that the relaxation of rules for Christmas would last only one day. Emmanuel Moine, who runs the Glen Mhor Hotel in Inverness and is chairman of the Inverness Hotel Association, said the short notice of the move to level four had added to the stress for business owners and staff. He said: ""Everybody was ready to celebrate Christmas - buying food, preparing menus and making dinners. ""We have had hundreds of cancellations. People are upset. It means a loss of money and jobs."" Hotelier Emmanuel Moine said the latest developments had caused added stress for businesses and staff Lee-Anne Gillie, who chairs the Borders Chamber of Commerce, said it was a tough setback for the region. ""I think it is a body blow for the Borders, for these rural locations,"" she said. ""We had just seen that glimmer of light, that light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine and going into tier one. ""It does feel tough right now thinking that here we go again."" However, she said the region had got through similar circumstances before and it was ""hopefully"" only for three weeks this time. ""I think as a community we can all rally, look after each other, support each other and we will get through this."" On Monday, the first minister has said she understood ""how upsetting Saturday's announcements were in particular for so many of you"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""None of the actions I announced on Saturday were taken lightly."" She said the analysis of the new variant of Covid-19 gave ""real cause for concern"".

"Many of us have had to rip up our Christmas plans this year - and for some that means spending the festive period alone. We spoke to a couple of experts, a mental health charity and someone who spends Christmas on her own every year - and loves it - to find out what tips they would offer someone preparing to be on their own this Christmas Day. If you're really cross about your ruined plans, that's OK. ""We are in extraordinary circumstances and I think people have every right to be angry and disappointed and sad,"" says Helen Russell, journalist and author of the book How to be Sad. ""We have to acknowledge and give space and sit with that sadness,"" she says. ""Suppressing the negative thoughts doesn't work - they come back with a vengeance."" She says many people find change difficult, so don't worry if you feel unsettled. ""You may have been expecting a lovely big family Christmas, the picture-perfect Christmas, but unfortunately that's not going to happen,"" says Martha Mills, who spends Christmas on her own every year. She used to hate Christmas, but now can't wait to have the day to herself. She wrote a helpful thread of tips on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Accepting that this year's festive period will be different is key, she says. She suggests changing the way you look at the day: ""You can now rewrite the rules and plan something different."" Martha says she treats it as a ""decadent"" day of self-indulgence and self-care. So do what you like. And if there are events or traditions that you can't do this Christmas, it may help to think of them as paused rather than cancelled. Mind, the mental health charity, says ""postpone them until next year, even if they happen in the summer"". Don't wake up on Christmas Day not knowing what you are going to do. ""I have to hold myself back from planning too soon,"" Martha says. Planning the day out allows her to break it into bit-sized chunks. So plan what you are having for breakfast, set some time aside for reading, or a walk, or an afternoon film, or ringing relatives. ""Make sure you have some nice food in, have some people you know you can video call or just text, and make sure you have some sort of agenda for the day."" Mind also recommends taking some time to make your home feel nicer. ""This could be putting up Christmas decorations, or extra photographs."" It could be as simple as tidying up. And try to plan something nice to do after Christmas. ""Having something to look forward to next year could make a real difference,"" the charity says. 'I got dressed up even though I had nowhere to go' What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? Can I meet family on Boxing Day? And other questions How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Spend the day doing the things you enjoy. ""This could be taking a morning jog, playing video games or doing puzzles,"" the charity says. Equally it could be having a hot bath with a good book, or a lie-in wearing your favourite pyjamas. If you haven't got the pressures of travel or fitting in with other people, then you can simply focus on doing what makes you happy. Buy yourself a present or get something you've always wanted. And wrap it up to then unwrap later! ""Do what will make you feel good in terms of sensory things. I like to make sure I have a nice Christmas scented candle in. It is just being kind to yourself and being gentle with yourself,"" Martha says. If there are people you'd like to speak to, you could arrange to talk over the phone or via video call. Or you could watch a film together, or do a quiz. British comedian Sarah Millican hosts a Christmas day chat on Twitter each year, which anyone can join, Mind says. And if you are feeling isolated or down, try getting outside. Sophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London, says getting outside, even if to only walk around the block, is ""one of the best things you can do for your brain and your mood"". Martha agrees. She says cheery cries of ""merry Christmas"" exchanged with strangers and dog walkers will help. If you love turkey - and can still get one from your local shop - then do it. If you hate the stuff, buy something else. There are no rules about what you should and shouldn't eat, so get in some food you can look forward to eating. ""Plan to enjoy your favourite food or drink,"" Mind says. It doesn't even have to be dinner. ""It could be a special breakfast or some interesting soft drinks. It could be a good excuse not to eat traditional Christmas food."" ""If you want to just have salad for lunch, or eat peanut butter out of the jar for breakfast, then do it,"" adds Martha. Of course, you may decide not to mark Christmas at all this year. You could treat it as if it's any other day. ""This may feel easier than trying to celebrate alone,"" Mind says. ""It's completely understandable if you feel this way"". If you decide to skip it, the charity says you could let others know your plan. Say you're happy to hear from them on Christmas Day but tell them ""they can also support you by treating it like any other day and not mentioning Christmas"". If you are planning to give gifts, exchange them in advance. And the charity advises staying off social media to avoid Christmassy posts, and trying to avoid adverts on TV or online. ""A lot of people get bogged down in thinking they are not going to enjoy it,"" Martha says. ""And that's OK."" It's important to realise Christmas Day is only one day - and it will quickly be over, she says. ""It is only 24 hours and it won't last forever. If you are having the worst day ever, you will go to bed that night and when you wake up Christmas Day will be over.""

"This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed More than 2,850 lorries are stuck in Kent waiting to leave the UK, the county council has said, as politicians thrash out a plan to reopen France's border to trade and travel. France shut its UK border for 48 hours on Sunday amid fears of a new coronavirus variant. Any solution would probably include testing for lorry drivers, BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said. Meanwhile, the EU Commission hasurged countries to drop their travel bans. More than 50 countries have banned UK arrivals following widespread concern about the spread of the new variant. Ina recommendation to all member states,,externalthe commission said flight and train bans should be discontinued to avoid supply chain disruption. People should be allowed to travel to their country of residence, provided they take a Covid-19 test or self-isolate, it said. But the commission added that non-essential travel should still be discouraged. 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK Currently, no lorries are leaving the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel to France. The leader of Kent County Council, Roger Gough, told the BBC that 2,220 vehicles were at the temporary lorry park at Manston, while 632 were still being held on the M20. It comes as Tesco said it would bereintroducing temporary purchasing limits on some essential products, including toilet rolls, eggs, rice and hand wash. A further 36,804 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus and there were 691 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to Tuesday's government figures,external. It is the largest daily number of cases recorded yet, though it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring when testing was much more limited. Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast discussions were under way between the UK and France ""to find a resolution"" to the Channel disruption, with an update on the situation expected later. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke on Monday and, according to the BBC's Hugh Schofield, a solution to the blockage will probably include compulsory negative Covid tests for lorry drivers coming into France from the UK. Any plans agreed between the leaders would come into effect on Wednesday, France's Europe minister, ClÃ©ment Beaune, said. Ms Patel said potentially testing lorry drivers at ports was ""part of the discussions"", adding that setting up testing for this could ""happen relatively quickly"". This video can not be played 'Operation Brock' in place for lorry drivers EU member states are understood to be pressing for UK arrivals to be tested for the virus before entering their countries. Bosses at Eurotunnel estimate that up to 2,500 freight vehicles are expected to arrive in the UK on Tuesday, and the same again on Wednesday. The port of Harwich in Essex - which is about 130 miles from Dover by road - is also seeing a build up of lorries as drivers divert from Dover, a spokesman for the port said. The port of Felixstowe in Suffolk is also busy but there are no queues. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Ports chaos 'bad for trust and post-Brexit trade' How could mass testing be used? The British Retail Consortium said trucks needed to be able to start travelling again in the next 24 hours to ""avoid seeing problems on our shelves"". Andrew Opie, its director of food and sustainability, told the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee: ""What we've been told by members is that unless those trucks can start travelling again and go back to Spain and Portugal and other parts of Europe, we will have problems with fresh produce from 27 December."" Labour's Rachel Reeves told BBC Breakfast the government had ""wasted the last 24 hours"" and called for ""testing in place so we can reopen the border"". In other developments: The company behind the Covid-19 vaccine being given to people in the UK says it is ""highly likely"" it willprotect people against the new variantof the virus Northern Ireland's Executivevotes against introducing a travel ban between Northern Irelandand England, Scotland and Wales Royal Mail said it had temporarily suspended all mail services to Europe, with the exception of the Republic of Ireland, due to travel restrictions Thenumber of excess deaths in the UKsince the start of the pandemic has passed 81,000 Army soldiershave been drafted into drive ambulances in Wales The border disruption has also affected passenger services - with many air, rail and sea services cancelled between the UK and France, as well as other countries. Eurotunnel said it hoped passengers would be able to travel between the UK and France from Wednesday or Thursday, if a solution was agreed. British Airways said it would operate ""a reduced and dynamic schedule"" amid the uncertainty. Live updates from Kent Impact of new variant on children investigated The Channel is a vital trade route, with about 10,000 lorries a day travelling between Dover and Calais at Christmas, largely bringing in the freshest produce. Shane Brennan, the head of the Cold Chain Federation which represents the UK's temperature-controlled transport industry, said the number of vehicles stuck was worse than the government figures suggested, as lorries were ""dispersed around southern England"". Ms Patel said the numbers do ""fluctuate"", and added there were welfare facilities and support available for hauliers at Manston Airport. Queues on the M20 in Kent aren't exactly unheard of, but the French decision to close the border is dramatic and has caused a lot of disruption. Politicians on both sides of the Channel are hopeful they might be able to agree a way of getting things moving again before the end of the year. But if that requires a massive expansion of testing for coronavirus at the border, that's easy to say, far harder to do.

Some parts of England, as well as Wales,have asked people who travelfrom tier four areas to self-isolate.

"This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed The EU's executive branch, the European Commission, has called on member states to lift travel bans imposed against the UK amid fears of a new Covid strain. The non-binding recommendation was put forward ahead of a meeting of ambassadors from the 27-member bloc. But with EU countries free to set their own rules on border controls they may continue with their own policies. France and the UK meanwhile said they had reached an agreement to ease restrictions. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? How a dramatic week in the UK unfolded Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? At the weekend, France closed its borders to passengers and freight from the UK, causing disruption at the southern British port of Dover, an important gateway for goods entering and leaving the UK. Thousands of lorries have become stuck, prompting warnings of shortages over Christmas. Almost all the EU's 27 member states are currently blocking travellers from the UK. Keen to develop a common policy, after earlier in the year seeing members close shared borders, the EU has been holding emergency meetings. In a statement, the commission recommended its members allow people to travel to their country of residence providing they take a Covid-19 test or self-isolate. But it said non-essential travel should be discouraged. It also said transport staff in the EU, such as lorry drivers, should be exempt from travel restrictions and mandatory testing. This video can not be played 'Operation Brock' in place for lorry drivers On the UK, it said that should lorry drivers require Covid-19 tests to leave the UK for France and other EU countries, it ""should not lead to transport disruptions"". But as Tuesday came to a close there was little sign that the recommendation would be taken up. Some flights will resume on Wednesday for Belgian nationals returning home but Germany extended its ban. One diplomat told the AFP news agency that the ambassadors had simply ""taken note"" of the recommendation. The deal will allow the resumption of freight and some passenger services through the UK-French border. Lorry drivers and EU nationals will be able to travel but must show proof of a negative coronavirus test. Plane, boat and Eurostar train connections will resume on Wednesday. Since the border closure began nearly 3,000 lorries have been stuck in southern England and it is likely to take until Christmas for the situation to be resolved. The French restrictions have led to long queues forming in southern England The UK government is advising lorry drivers against travelling to the area until mass testing gets under way. Meanwhile, Japanese car giant Toyota said it had suspended production in two factories in the UK and one in France. It blamed ""shortages of parts due to transport delays and the uncertain nature of the duration of the border closures"". UK travellers don't just face restrictions in Europe - more than 50 countries around the world fromIndia, toIran, toCanadahave suspended flights from the UK. The USalready has restrictions in place that prevent most non-US citizens who have been in the UK and some other countries for the last 14 days from entering. It is yet to follow suit with a ban on all travellers from the UK, but two airlines - British Airways and Delta - will only allow passengers who test negative for the coronavirus to fly to New York's John F Kennedy airport. Saudi Arabia,KuwaitandOmanhave shut their borders completely to international passengers. Swedenbanned foreign travellers fromDenmarkovernight into Tuesday after cases were discovered there. The decision alarmed Danes - especially those on the island of Bornholm, which relies on a fast ferry link with Ystad in Sweden. There are fears that many will struggle to get to or from Bornholm in time for Christmas, Danish media report. Along with Denmark, the new strain has also been detected in Australia, Italy and the Netherlands. This video can not be played Mr Johnson said he understood the concerns of ""our international friends"" As the list of countries imposing travel restrictions on the UK grew, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Europe director, Hans Kluge, said member states would convene to discuss strategies and limit travel, while maintaining trade. The new strain is more transmissible but is not more deadly or resistant to vaccines, experts say. Some experts believe the new strain has already spread beyond where it has been reported, crediting the UK's use of genomic surveillance for detecting it. ""I think we will find in the coming days that a lot of other countries will find it,"" Marc Van Ranst, a virologist from the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Belgium, told broadcaster VRT. In another development, travellers from South Africa are also facing bars from some countries after another new variant of the virus was discovered that is unrelated to the one found in the UK.

"Restaurants and gastro pubs to close at 15:00 GMT on Christmas Eve Restaurants, hairdressers and gastro pubs in the Republic of Ireland will close on Christmas Eve when new restrictions are introduced. People in Ireland may travel beyond their own county until the end of Stephen's Day, the Irish Cabinet has announced. There will be no new inter-county travel allowed after 26 December. Household visits will be reduced to one other household from 27 December. However, three households will still be allowed to mix on Christmas Day. Travel restrictions from Britain will remain until 31 December under the new rules, and the number of wedding guests in Ireland will be reduced to six, from 2 January, RTÃ reports. The new restrictions will be reviewed on 12 January, however TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar has warned those businesses affected that they should operate on the assumption they will be closed until the end of February or early March, when a critical mass of the population should be vaccinated. The Irish Foreign Ministry has set up a GB emergency travel helpline for Irish people who are finding it difficult to get home for Christmas. Allow Twitter content?

Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin said coronavirus in Ireland may be increasing at a rate of 10% per day, but added that the most vulnerable Irish citizens will begin receiving the vaccine next week. Mr Martin said he is certain the Irish vaccination programme will allow the virus to be managed in the new year. ""The way to show love and respect for others is to comply with guidelines,"" he added. Irish schools will remain open under the new measures Mr Martin said the measures equated to Level 5 on Ireland's Covid-19 response plan with a few adjustments, including non-essential retail remaining open, with guidance that shops do not run January sales. He said gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools could remain open for individual exercise. Schools will also stay open but no sports matches can take place apart from those at elite level. His deputy prime minister, Mr Varadkar added: ""One of the real concerns that we have is that unlike the second wave, the virus seems to be affecting older people in quite high numbers and that is causing us enormous concern. ""Because what is very likely to happen over the next couple of days is that younger people who have been out socialising, perhaps carrying the virus, will then mix with older people over Christmas and that is a recipe for disaster."" Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan earlier said there will be a series of ""staggered dates"" regarding changes to restrictions over the holiday period. Mr Ryan said the cabinet sub-committee had been briefed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Monday evening on the latest situation with coronavirus. Meanwhile in the Republic of Ireland on Monday, there were no new coronavirus-linked deaths reported. There have been a total of 2,158 coronavirus-related deaths in Ireland and a total of 80,267 confirmed cases since the outbreak began.

"People were warned earlier this month not to travel unnecessarily by North Yorkshire Police A ""shocking"" number of fines have been handed out to people moving from tier three to tier two areas to drink in pubs and bars, a police force said. North Yorkshire Police said of more than 160 fines handed out in tier-two York over the weekend, most went to people living in tier three areas. York is near areas under stricter Covid rules like West and South Yorkshire. The force said it would continue to patrol the city for anyone drinking illegally. Officers visited pubs in the city from Friday and found large numbers in breach of the regulations. Some of the drinkers dispersed and left when spoken to by officers but action was taken against others who stayed, the force said. More stories from Yorkshire What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? North Yorkshire Policewarned people not to travel unnecessarilyto or from areas affected by stricter coronavirus restrictions earlier this month. Some of the visitors left when spoken to by officers, North Yorkshire Police said Supt Mike Walker, head of the North Yorkshire Police response to Covid-19, said the ""vast majority"" of fines went to people from tier three who visited the tier two city to mix and socialise indoors in breach of regulations. He said: ""Where we encounter people who refuse to adhere to the regulations and believe their pint is more important than someone's life, we will use our enforcement powers ""If you choose to visit the city of York from tier three areas without a justifiable reason... chances are you will encounter one of our officers and you'll be asked about the reason for your visit."" Councillor Denise Craghill said: ""No-one in the city wants to put loved ones at risk for the sake of a night out and undo the city's hard work and sacrifice.""

"Government borrowing soared in November as the UK continued to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic. The Office for National Statistics said,externalborrowing hit Â£31.6bn last month, the highest November figure on record. It was also the third-highest figure in any month since records began in 1993. The figures highlight the government's spending-revenue gap, and underline Chancellor Rishi Sunak's problems as he weighs up bolstering Treasury coffers. Since the beginning of the financial year in April, borrowing has reached Â£240.9bn, Â£188.6bn more than a year ago, the ONS said. A Budget had been expected to take place in autumn this year, but it was delayed because of the pandemic and will now take place on 3 March 2021. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated that borrowing could reach Â£372.2bn by the end of the financial year in March. However, Mr Sunak made clear on Tuesday that he would not be taking any hasty action. ""When our economy recovers, it's right that we take the necessary steps to put the public finances on a more sustainable footing so we are able to respond to future crises in the way we have done this year,"" he said. Mr Sunak has already imposed a pay freezeon at least 1.3 million public sector workers as part of efforts to contain government spending. The increase in borrowing has led to a steep increase in the national debt, which now stands at just under Â£2.1 trillion. The UK's overall debt has now reached 99.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. The government borrows in the financial markets, by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect, the repayment. The buyers of these bonds, or ""gilts"", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. Private savers also buy some. You canread more hereabout how countries borrow money. ""We are looking at the highest peacetime deficit and if we look at where the country's debt is, then we are at the highest levels since the 1960s,"" said Sarah Hewin, chief economist at Standard Chartered. ""In November alone, borrowing was about six times what it was in November last year, so these are some absolutely record numbers that we are seeing. ""Also, of course, the furlough scheme has been extended, so that will increase government spending. We could well see the deficit for the financial year all the way up to 20% of GDP, so around Â£400bn."" Separately,the ONS has also revised its figures for the UK's economic growth,externalthis year. The economy shrank a little less in the April-to-June period than previously indicated, by 18.8% instead of 19.8%. And the rebound from July to September was a little bigger, with growth of 16% instead of 15.5%. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said a double-dip recession was a clear possibility if the tier four Covid-19 restrictions were extended into 2021. However, she said there was optimism that as long as vaccines were effective and widespread, GDP would ""stage a strong rebound"" in the second half of next year. The extraordinary pandemic shutdown borrowing numbers had begun to recover. But last month, as some restrictions were reapplied across the UK, the government borrowed Â£31.6bn, the third-highest month on record. This was Â£26bn higher than last November, driven mainly by a Â£23bn increase in government spending on a year ago, including the reapplication of the full jobs wage subsidy furlough scheme. Borrowing so far this financial year since April is already at a record Â£240bn and set to hit about Â£400bn over the full year. Growth in the economy in the third quarter was a little higher than first calculated, at a record 16%, but that now is firmly old news. The likely spread of new restrictions on retail and hospitality and multiple forms of chaos at ports mean forecasters fear the UK may already be back in a double-dip recession.

"This video can not be played A BBC team came across roadblocks as they tried to report on research into viruses that bats carry A Chinese scientist at the centre of unsubstantiated claims that the coronavirus leaked from her laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan has told the BBC she is open to ""any kind of visit"" to rule it out. The surprise statement from Prof Shi Zhengli comes as a World Health Organization team prepares to travel to Wuhan next month to begin its investigation into the origins of Covid-19. The remote district of Tongguan, in China's south-western province of Yunnan, is hard to reach at the best of times. But when a BBC team tried to visit recently, it was impossible. Plain-clothes police officers and other officials in unmarked cars followed us for miles along the narrow, bumpy roads, stopping when we did, backtracking with us when we were forced to turn around. We found obstacles in our way, including a ""broken-down"" lorry, which locals confirmed had been placed across the road a few minutes before we arrived. And we ran into checkpoints at which unidentified men told us their job was to keep us out. At first sight, all of this might seem like a disproportionate effort given our intended destination, a nondescript, abandoned copper mine in which, back in 2012, six workers succumbed to a mystery illness that eventually claimed the lives of three of them. But their tragedy, which would otherwise almost certainly have been largely forgotten, has been given new meaning by the Covid-19 pandemic. Those three deaths are now at the centre of a major scientific controversy about the origins of the virus and the question of whether it came from nature, or from a laboratory. And the attempts of Chinese authorities to stop us reaching the site are a sign of how hard they're working to control the narrative. WHO to investigate Covid origins in China's Wuhan China and the virus that threatens everything Wuhan city of silence For more than a decade, the rolling, jungle-covered hills in Yunnan - and the cave systems within - have been the focus of a giant scientific field study. Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli is seen here inside the laboratory in Wuhan It has been led by Prof Shi Zhengli from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). Prof Shi won international acclaim for her discovery that the illness known as Sars, which killed more than 700 people in 2003, was caused by a virus that probably came from a species of bat in a Yunnan cave. Ever since, Prof Shi - often referred to as ""China's Batwoman"" - has been in the vanguard of a project to try to predict and prevent further such outbreaks. By trapping bats, taking faecal samples from them, and then carrying those samples back to the lab in Wuhan, 1,600km (1,000 miles) away, the team behind the project has identified hundreds of new bat coronaviruses. But the fact that Wuhan is now home to the world's leading coronavirus research facility, as well as the first city to be ravaged by a pandemic outbreak of a deadly new one, has fuelled suspicion that the two things are connected. The Chinese government, the WIV, and Prof Shi have all angrily dismissed the allegation of a virus leak from the Wuhan lab. But with scientists appointed by the World Health Organization (WHO) scheduled to visit Wuhan in January for an inquiry into the origin of the pandemic, Prof Shi - who has given few interviews since the pandemic began - answered a number of BBC questions by email. ""I have communicated with the WHO experts twice,"" she wrote, when asked if an investigation might help rule out a lab leak and end the speculation. ""I have personally and clearly expressed that I would welcome them to visit the WIV,"" she said. To a follow-up question about whether that would include a formal investigation with access to the WIV's experimental data and laboratory records, Prof Shi said: ""I would personally welcome any form of visit based on an open, transparent, trusting, reliable and reasonable dialogue. But the specific plan is not decided by me."" The BBC subsequently received a call from the WIV's press office, saying that Prof Shi was speaking in a personal capacity and her answers had not been approved by the WIV. The BBC denied a request to send the press office a copy of this article in advance. Dr Peter Daszak: ""I've yet to see any evidence at all of a lab leak or a lab involvement in this outbreak"" Many scientists believe that by far the most likely scenario is that Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, jumped naturally from bats to humans, possibly via an intermediary species. And despite Prof Shi's offer, for now there appears to be little chance of the WHO inquiry looking into the lab-leak theory. The terms of reference for the WHO inquiry,externalmake no mention of the theory, and some members of the 10-person team have all but ruled it out. Peter Daszak, a British zoologist, has been chosen as part of the teambecause of his leading role in a multimillion dollar, international project to sample wild viruses,external. It has involved close collaboration with Prof Shi Zhengli in her mass sampling of bats in China, andDr Daszak previously called the lab-leak theory a ""conspiracy theory"" and ""pure baloney"",external. ""I've yet to see any evidence at all of a lab leak or a lab involvement in this outbreak,"" he said. ""I have seen substantial evidence that these are naturally occurring phenomena driven by human encroachment into wildlife habitat, which is clearly on display across south-east Asia."" Asked about seeking access to the Wuhan lab to rule the lab-leak theory out, he said: ""That's not my job to do that. ""The WHO negotiated the terms of reference, and they say we're going to follow the evidence, and that's what we've got to do,"" he added. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was linked to early cases of the new coronavirus One focus of the inquiry will be a market in Wuhan,externalwhich was known to be trading in wildlife and was linked to a number of early cases, though the Chinese authorities appear to have already discounted it as a source of the virus. Dr Daszak said the WHO team would ""look at those clusters of cases, look at the contacts, look at where the animals in the market have come from and see where that takes us"". The deaths of the three Tongguan workers following exposure to a mineshaft full of bats raised suspicions that they'd succumbed to a bat coronavirus. It was exactly the kind of animal-to-human ""spillover"" that was driving the WIV to sample and test bats in Yunnan. It is no surprise then that, following those deaths, the WIV scientists began sampling bats in the Tongguan mineshaft in earnest, making multiple visits over the next three years and detecting 293 coronaviruses. But apart from one brief paper,external, very little was published about the viruses they collected on those trips. In January this year,Prof Shi Zhengli became one of the first people in the world to sequence Sars-Cov-2,external, which was already spreading rapidly through the streets and homes of her city. She then compared the long string of letters representing the virus's unique genetic code with the extensive library of other viruses collected and stored over the years. And she discovered that her database contained the closest known relative of Sars-Cov-2. RaTG13 is a virus whose name has been derived from the bat it was extracted from (Rhinolophus affinis, Ra), the place it was found (Tongguan, TG), and the year it was identified, 2013. Seven years after it was found in that mineshaft, RaTG13 was about to become one of the most hotly contested scientific subjects of our time. China imposed tough restrictions on Wuhan to stop the spread of the virus There have been many well-documented cases of viruses leaking from labs.The first Sars virus, for example, leaked twice from the National Institute of Virology in Beijing in 2004,external, long after the outbreak had been brought under control. The practice of genetically manipulating viruses is also not new, allowing scientists to make them more infectious or more deadly, so they can assess the threat and, perhaps, develop treatments or vaccines. And from the moment it was isolated and sequenced, scientists have been struck by the remarkable ability of Sars-Cov-2 to infect humans. The possibility that it acquired that ability as a result of manipulation in a laboratory was taken seriously enough for an influential group of international scientists to address it head on. In what has become the definitive paper ruling out the possibility of a lab leak, RaTG13 has a starring role. Published in March in the magazine Nature Medicine,external, it suggests that if there had been a leak, Prof Shi Zhengli would have found a much closer match in her database than RaTG13. While RaTG13 is the closest known relative - at 96.2% similarity - it is still too distant to have been manipulated and changed into Sars-Cov-2. Sars-Cov-2, the authors concluded, was likely to have gained its unique efficiency through a long, undetected period of circulation in humans or animals of a natural and milder precursor virus that eventually evolved into the potent, deadly form first detected in Wuhan in 2019. Medics and scientists in Wuhan battled to control the early stages of the pandemic Where though,some scientists are beginning to wonder,external, are those reservoirs of earlier natural infection? Dr Daniel Lucey is a physician and infectious disease professor at the Georgetown Medical Centre in Washington DC and a veteran of many pandemics - Sars in China, Ebola in Africa, Zika in Brazil. He is certain that China has already conducted thorough searches for evidence of precursor viruses in stored human samples in hospitals and in animal populations. ""They have the capability, they have the resources and they have the motivation, so of course they've done the studies in animals and in humans,"" he said. Finding the origin of an outbreak was vital, he said, not just for wider scientific understanding, but also to stop it emerging again. ""We should search until we find it. I think it's findable and I think it's quite possible it's already been found,"" he said.  ""But then the question arises, why hasn't it been disclosed?"" This video can not be played Covid-19: How everyday life has changed in Wuhan Dr Lucey still believes that Sars-Cov-2 is most likely to have a natural origin, but he does not want the alternatives to be so readily ruled out. ""So here we are, 12, 13 months out since the first recognised case of Covid-19 and we haven't found the animal source,"" he said. ""So, to me, it's all the more reason to investigate alternative explanations."" Might a Chinese laboratory have had a virus they were working on that was genetically closer to Sars-Cov-2, and would they tell us now if they did? ""Not everything that's done is published,"" Dr Lucey said. It's a point I put to Peter Daszak, the member of the WHO origins study team. ""You know, I've worked with the WIV for a good decade or more,"" he said. ""I know some of the people there pretty well and I have visited the labs frequently, I've met and had dinner with them over 15 years. ""I'm working in China with eyes wide open, and I'm racking my brain back in time for the slightest hint of something untoward. And I've never seen that."" Asked if those friendships and funding relationships with the WIV presented a conflict of interest with his role on the inquiry, he said: ""We file our papers; it's all there for everyone to see."" And his collaboration with the WIV, he said, ""makes me one of the people on the planet who knows the most about the origins of these bat coronaviruses in China"". China may have provided only limited data about its hunt for the origin of Sars-Cov-2, but it has begun to promote a theory of its own. Based on a few inconclusive studies conducted by scientists in Europe that suggest Covid-19 may have been circulating earlier than previously thought,state propaganda is full of stories suggesting the virus didn't start in China at all,external. In the absence of proper data, speculation is only likely to grow, much of it focused on RaTG13 and its origins in a Tongguan mineshaft. Old academic papers have been dug up online that appear to differ from the WIV's statements about the sick mine workers - among them a thesis by a student at the Kunming Hospital University. ""I've just downloaded the Kunming Hospital University student's masters thesis and read it,"" Prof Shi told the BBC. ""The narrative doesn't make sense,"" she said. ""The conclusion is neither based on evidence nor logic. But it's used by conspiracy theorists to doubt me. If you were me, what you would do?"" Prof Shi has also faced questions about whythe WIV's online public database of viruses,externalwas suddenly taken offline. She told the BBC that the WIV's website and the staff's work emails and personal emails had been attacked, and the database taken offline for security reasons. ""All our research results are published in English journals in the form of papers,"" she said.  ""Virus sequences are saved in the [US-run] GenBank database too. It's completely transparent. We have nothing to hide."" This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? There are important questions to be asked in the Yunnan countryside, not just by scientists, but by journalists too. After a decade of sampling and experimenting on viruses collected from bats, we now know that back in 2013 the closest known ancestor was discovered of a future threat that would claim well over a million lives and devastate the global economy. Yet the WIV, according to the published information, did nothing with it, except sequence it and enter it into a database. Ought that to call into question the very premise on which the expensive, and some would say risky, mass sampling of wild viruses is based? ""To say that we didn't do enough is absolutely correct,"" Peter Daszak told the BBC. ""To say that we failed is not fair at all. What we should have been doing is 10 times the amount of work on these viruses."" Both Dr Daszak and Prof Shi are adamant that pandemic prevention research is vital, urgent work. ""Our research is forward-looking, and it's difficult for non-professionals to understand,"" Prof Shi wrote by email. ""In the face of countless micro-organisms that exist in nature, we humans are very small."" New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? The WHO is promising an ""open-minded"" inquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus, but the Chinese government is not keen on questions, at least not from journalists. After leaving Tongguan, the BBC team tried to drive a few hours north to the cave where Prof Shi carried out her ground-breaking research on Sars almost a decade ago. Still being followed by several unmarked cars, we hit another roadblock, and were told there was no way through. A few hours later, we discovered that local traffic had been diverted onto a dirt track that skirted the obstruction, but as we attempted to use the same route, we met yet another ""broken down"" car in our path. We were trapped in a field for over an hour, before finally being forced to head for the airport. UK LOOK-UP:How many cases in your area? TESTING:What tests are available?

"This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed The EU's executive branch, the European Commission, has called on member states to lift travel bans imposed against the UK amid fears of a new Covid strain. The non-binding recommendation was put forward ahead of a meeting of ambassadors from the 27-member bloc. But with EU countries free to set their own rules on border controls they may continue with their own policies. France and the UK meanwhile said they had reached an agreement to ease restrictions. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? How a dramatic week in the UK unfolded Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? At the weekend, France closed its borders to passengers and freight from the UK, causing disruption at the southern British port of Dover, an important gateway for goods entering and leaving the UK. Thousands of lorries have become stuck, prompting warnings of shortages over Christmas. Almost all the EU's 27 member states are currently blocking travellers from the UK. Keen to develop a common policy, after earlier in the year seeing members close shared borders, the EU has been holding emergency meetings. In a statement, the commission recommended its members allow people to travel to their country of residence providing they take a Covid-19 test or self-isolate. But it said non-essential travel should be discouraged. It also said transport staff in the EU, such as lorry drivers, should be exempt from travel restrictions and mandatory testing. This video can not be played 'Operation Brock' in place for lorry drivers On the UK, it said that should lorry drivers require Covid-19 tests to leave the UK for France and other EU countries, it ""should not lead to transport disruptions"". But as Tuesday came to a close there was little sign that the recommendation would be taken up. Some flights will resume on Wednesday for Belgian nationals returning home but Germany extended its ban. One diplomat told the AFP news agency that the ambassadors had simply ""taken note"" of the recommendation. The deal will allow the resumption of freight and some passenger services through the UK-French border. Lorry drivers and EU nationals will be able to travel but must show proof of a negative coronavirus test. Plane, boat and Eurostar train connections will resume on Wednesday. Since the border closure began nearly 3,000 lorries have been stuck in southern England and it is likely to take until Christmas for the situation to be resolved. The French restrictions have led to long queues forming in southern England The UK government is advising lorry drivers against travelling to the area until mass testing gets under way. Meanwhile, Japanese car giant Toyota said it had suspended production in two factories in the UK and one in France. It blamed ""shortages of parts due to transport delays and the uncertain nature of the duration of the border closures"". UK travellers don't just face restrictions in Europe - more than 50 countries around the world fromIndia, toIran, toCanadahave suspended flights from the UK. The USalready has restrictions in place that prevent most non-US citizens who have been in the UK and some other countries for the last 14 days from entering. It is yet to follow suit with a ban on all travellers from the UK, but two airlines - British Airways and Delta - will only allow passengers who test negative for the coronavirus to fly to New York's John F Kennedy airport. Saudi Arabia,KuwaitandOmanhave shut their borders completely to international passengers. Swedenbanned foreign travellers fromDenmarkovernight into Tuesday after cases were discovered there. The decision alarmed Danes - especially those on the island of Bornholm, which relies on a fast ferry link with Ystad in Sweden. There are fears that many will struggle to get to or from Bornholm in time for Christmas, Danish media report. Along with Denmark, the new strain has also been detected in Australia, Italy and the Netherlands. This video can not be played Mr Johnson said he understood the concerns of ""our international friends"" As the list of countries imposing travel restrictions on the UK grew, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Europe director, Hans Kluge, said member states would convene to discuss strategies and limit travel, while maintaining trade. The new strain is more transmissible but is not more deadly or resistant to vaccines, experts say. Some experts believe the new strain has already spread beyond where it has been reported, crediting the UK's use of genomic surveillance for detecting it. ""I think we will find in the coming days that a lot of other countries will find it,"" Marc Van Ranst, a virologist from the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Belgium, told broadcaster VRT. In another development, travellers from South Africa are also facing bars from some countries after another new variant of the virus was discovered that is unrelated to the one found in the UK.

"Tashaun Aird was stabbed nine times during a planned attack The family of a murdered teenager say the system of school exclusion has to change, or more children will be lost like their son. Tashaun Aird, 15, was killed in Hackney, east London, in May 2019 after being permanently excluded in 2017 and sent to an Alternative Provision. A Serious Case Review said his exclusion ""was a catalyst to the deterioration in his behaviour"". Hackney Council accepted ""opportunities were missed"" to help Tashaun. The 15-year-old, who wanted to be a professional musician and producer, was stabbed nine times during a planned attack and died in an alleyway. The stabbing came three months after an earlier one, which left Tashaun in hospital for weeks. In December last year, a 16-year-old boy was found guilty of his murder and two other teenagers were convicted of manslaughter. Tashaun was ""like a giant walking teddy bear"", his mother Michelle said The Old Bailey heard the killers believed Tashaun was a member of the Red Pitch gang, but he denied he was. Police endorsed this, adding he was not a gang member or associate. His sister Tashoya said: ""He associated with friends who were from a specific area, just down the road from his own house. ""Tashaun's not a fighter, he's not one to carry a weapon, Tashaun's not one to have issues with anybody."" The family believe Tashaun's behaviour worsened due to his exclusion. Tashaun was ""a peacemaker"" and had no links to gangs, his family said Tashaun had been a pupil at Hackney New School, a free school, but at the end of the 2017 summer term he was permanently excluded after a prank involving a teacher's coat. His mother Michelle Tan-Ming appealed against the decision, and months later that exclusion was quashed by an Independent Review Panel. However, the school refused to reinstate him. The Serious Case Review, published this month, criticised this decision, saying: ""It appeared that the school was determined to PEX (permanently exclude), without consideration of the wider implications to his safety, well-being or his education."" The family say when Tashaun was moved to the Alternative Provision - called Inspire! - he began smoking cannabis and his behaviour changed. ""It wasn't instant,"" said his sister. ""It was learned behaviour. If there are few rules, if you can walk out of school, you'll do it. He became a product of his environment."" Three teenagers guilty of killing boy, 15 The faces of 2019's 100 knife crime victims Boy killed after 'denying being in a gang' Tashaun's mother works in the education sector and said Inspire! did not share her ethos or educational values. ""Pupils were allowed to smoke with teachers,"" she told the BBC. ""They were allowed to leave the classroom unattended. ""There was nothing the children could get recognised for. It was like they were just there doing nothing. ""I felt this was no place for my son. This was the next step to prison."" A post-mortem examination revealed Tashaun suffered nine wounds, including a fatal 11cm-deep wound to the chest The Serious Case Review noted that Inspire! had a ""chaotic environment"" that made it ""impossible to deliver intervention"". In the months before his murder, Tashaun's family were already very worried about his safety. In January 2019 a pupil from another school walked in, armed with a screwdriver, and tried to attack a pupil. Then in early February, Tashaun was attacked for the first time when he was stabbed as he left Hackney Youth Hub, where the school had taken boys for recreation. Tashaun took weeks to recover in hospital and his family refused to let him return to Inspire! and he was tutored at home instead. But he missed his friends, and on 1 May he spent some time ""chilling"" with a small group in local parks. He promised his mother he'd be home by 21:00, but instead, she had a call, saying he'd been attacked at Somerford Grove. Tashaun ""was that piece that held the family together"", his sister says The Serious Case Review into Tashaun's death has made 15 recommendations for improvement, raising particular concern about Tashaun's exclusion and how it put him at risk. It criticised the current government guidance, saying ""despite the clear imperative for safeguarding risk to be an active component of decision-making, the statutory guidance falls short in emphasising this with sufficient clarity"" and said the Department for Education (DfE) should review this. The DfE said it was currently revising this guidance and added that ""no child should face the kind of violence Tashaun Aird experienced"". His family insist Tashaun's exclusion was the crucial issue. ""That's the genesis,"" his stepfather Kevin said. ""You tell a child he's going to amount to nothing, you keep telling him. You're going to break him down. ""That's what they're telling these young men and women: 'You're nothing'."" Tashaun was found injured in the Somerford Grove area of Hackney Hackney Council is still sending excluded pupils to Inspire!, which it said was under new leadership and had strengthened its safeguarding procedures. Anne Canning, the council's group director for Children and Education, said Tashaun's case was ""tragic and complex"". She added: ""We are sorry for the missed opportunities that could have helped make a difference at an earlier stage. ""We fully accept the findings of this review and will work with all agencies involved to implement its recommendations in full."" Hackney New School is now run by the Community Schools Trust, which took over after poor Ofsted reports. The prosecution said the gang which attacked Tashaun were ""intent on serious, if not fatal violence"" Despite not being at the school when Tashaun was kicked out, the new head teacher Charlotte Whelan said she wanted to work with Tashaun's family to answer their outstanding questions surrounding his exclusion. But for Tashaun's family the abiding trauma continues, 19 months after he was murdered. Tashaun's mother Michelle said: ""It just gets harder. We're forever grieving and I think we'll do that for the rest of our lives."" His sister Tashoya added: ""Since he's been gone, it hasn't been the same. ""I think Tashaun was that piece that held the family together. You know when something's missing, and we feel it every day.""

"Theo, a trans boy, tried to take his life last year while waiting for an NHS referral The NHS gender identity service is seeking leave to appeal against a High Court ruling that restricts children under 16 from accessing ""puberty-blocking"" drugs. The NHS service says the move harms young people with gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is when a mismatch between a person's sex assigned at birth and their gender identity causes them distress. Accessing puberty blockers is currently one of the first steps in treatment for young people wishing to transition. Earlier this month, three High Court judges ruled that children under 16 with gender dysphoria are ""unlikely to be able to give informed consent to undergo treatment with puberty-blocking drugs"". Dame Victoria Sharp, sitting with Lord Justice Lewis and Mrs Justice Lieven, said: ""It is highly unlikely that a child aged 13 or under would be competent to give consent to the administration of puberty blockers. ""It is doubtful that a child aged 14 or 15 could understand and weigh the long-term risks and consequences of the administration of puberty blockers,"" she added. As a result, trans children under the age of 16 will now need a clinician to apply to the High Court to be able to access puberty blockers, and all current referrals and appointments have been paused. The BBC understands that clinicians may also seek guidance from the High Court for all trans young people under 18. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, which runs England and Wales' only children's gender identity service, is now seeking leave to appeal the High Court decision, along with University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust. Some trans young people have been giving their reaction to the ruling, with one calling it ""honestly terrifying"". What are puberty blockers? High Court rules on puberty blockers for under-16s Theo, a 14-year-old trans boy who suffers from extreme gender dysphoria, came out as trans when he was 11. He is still waiting to see a gender specialist, and last year he tried to take his own life. He wanted to ""disappear"", he said, after being left to go through female puberty while stuck on a ""never-ending"" NHS waiting list. ""I felt like I wanted to be dead rather than waiting. I spend a lot of time wishing I could be a normal boy and there is no help for me. ""I have support around me, but my gender dysphoria feels like I'm not me in my own body,"" he says. ""It can make me really depressed. I hate seeing my body, so I can barely have a shower or a bath."" Theo's mum, Loreto, says that even when Theo was lying in intensive care ""connected to pumps and with tubes through his nose"", she could not secure him any gender identity support from the NHS. ""I still have a child who can't go outside. I have to constantly check how he's dealing with life, and tell him to focus on the positives."" The NHS Gender Identity Development Service is based at the Tavistock and Portman Trust Dr Adrian Harrop, a GP from Liverpool who has defended the right of children to begin transitioning, says trans young people have now had ""the rug pulled from underneath them"". ""It makes me terribly worried that there is now nothing there for those children, and nothing that can be done to help them. But one claimant in the High Court case, the mother of a 15-year-old girl who is awaiting treatment, said before the outcome that ""It is distressing to have to wait and to try and convince someone that your identity warrants medical intervention. ""However, I think the downside of getting it wrong, the outcomes of getting it wrong, are also catastrophic."" The NHS Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) website states: ""This judgment and the revised NHS England service specifications for GIDS raise a lot of questions and may be the cause of anxiety and distress for our patients and their families/guardians. ""We also appreciate that this comes at a time when our waiting times have never been longer, and amidst a pandemic."" While the NHS gender identity service says that access to any medication will not be ""automatically withdrawn"" as a result of the ruling, they confirmed that no new referrals are being accepted. A spokesperson for the NHS Trusts involved told the BBC this is a ""temporary pause"". Emma (left) supports her trans daughter Emily (right) at LGBT Pride events Emily, a 12-year-old trans girl from Liverpool, was first referred to the Tavistock by her GP in May 2017. After being assessed over 12 appointments, across two years, involving Emily and her parents, she had just been recommended for puberty blockers by the service. Emily's mother, Emma, fears her daughter ""will not make it through"" male puberty. ""Emily is running out of time. We will have to figure something out, and fast,"" she says. ""She's already so uncomfortable in the body she's got, and if it becomes more male, she won't be able to tolerate it."" In October 2020, Emily's NHS psychotherapist wrote: ""I am satisfied that Emily, with the ongoing support and guidance of her parents, has a good understanding about the potential side-effects of this treatment."" But Keira Bell, who at 20 had a double mastectomy, has begun de-transitioning and now reflects ""It was heartbreaking to realise I'd gone down the wrong path.""

"School attendance has declined since the November firebreak ""Deeply worrying"" school attendance figures due to Covid will lead to more inequality, a think tank has warned. Latest Welsh Government figures showed attendance at 70% in the week beginning 7 December, falling to just 50% for Year 11 pupils. Emily, 15, from Llanelli, said she stopped going to school as she was scared of passing coronavirus to vulnerable family members. The Welsh Government said it would keep working with councils and schools. Most absence was due to Covid-19 cases and, between 7 and 11 December, more than 110,000 pupils on average were not in school. Attendance ranged from 90% in Gwynedd and 86% in Conwy -areas with comparatively low case rates- to 43% in Blaenau Gwent, 52% in Neath Port Talbot and 54% in Swansea - some of the hardest-hit areas in Wales. Children 'isolating three times in three months' Ministers 'intimidating schools with legal threats' 'Huge expansion' of secondary school Covid tests The provisional data follows a pattern of declining attendance since the week after theNovember firebreak, when attendance was the highest it had been all term at 90%. Luke Sibieta, from the Education Policy Institute think tank, said: ""Unfortunately, the long-term impacts are undoubtedly going to be quite severe ""Pupils missing out on almost half the year of schooling last year and then a patchwork of inequalities of missed schooling this term will take their toll on children's education. ""There'll be a widening of existing inequalities - particularly as it's tended to be quite disadvantaged council areas where pupils have missed out on most schooling."" Though most absence during the term was due to disruption as a result of positive Covid cases, some families have been anxious about children going to school. Emily's mother Toni agreed she could stay home due to their health conditions Emily stopped going to school a few weeks after they reopened in September. ""I was scared to go to school because I was catching the train every day,"" she said. ""Even though I had my mask I thought I was still going to catch it. I said to mam that I didn't want to go to school. I had anxiety and I was too scared."" Emily's mother Toni initially agreed she could stay at home, adding: ""I've got type 2 diabetes and my partner hasCOPD,external. ""Emily suffers with anxiety for various reasons - so she got a little bit anxious about coming to school. ""We both discussed it and thought the infection rate is rising so we wouldn't risk her coming back and forth to school every day."" After support from teachers and a welfare officer, they agreed Emily would go to school in the mornings but leave at lunchtime to avoid crowded trains. Toni said: ""Covid has got a lot of children and adults anxious. I know a few people who have kept their kids home."" The family was supported by Carmarthenshire council's schools safeguarding and attendance scheme, with team manager Rhona Evans saying they approach each case individually. ""We've been working towards keeping children engaged in education, even when they physically can't attend,"" she said. ""So we've supported by taking out hard copies of work, ensuring the families have got access to the digital equity scheme."" Rhona Evans says children have needed more support than usual Ms Evans said children were also finding school to be a different place after lockdown, and many needed support with that too. ""They return, and if their year group has to self-isolate again, it sort of knocks them back a bit so they need a bit more support than normal. ""The school environment is very different as well so we've provided a lot of emotional support - far more than we would normally do - because the issues we're facing are far more complex."" Hywel Price, head teacher of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro Morgannwg in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said pupils having to self-isolate created ""insecurity and inconsistency in attendance"". ""We have cases in certain schools where pupils have lost up to six, maybe eight weeks, of education due to being in contact with positive cases. ""That's a desperate story. Once you lose that routine and normality it can be difficult to return. ""Pupils, we know, come to schools not just for education, but to see their friends and socialise for a few hours a day. That's a very, very important aspect of education. This kind of insecurity will hit any pupil."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""Schools in Wales have provided a safe, secure and welcoming environment for pupils and staff. ""We recognise that because of local school decisions and factors the attendance rate for pupils have been lower near the end of term. ""However, we'll continue to work with local authorities and schools to ensure education continues for all children and young people with as little disruption as possible.""

"Swansea saw the most deaths of local authority areas in Wales in the most recent week - 31 The total numbers of deaths from Covid-19 in Wales has passed 4,000, according to official figures. There were 223 deaths registered involving coronavirus in the week ending 11 December. This was 16 more deaths than the week before and Wales' figures went against the trend in England, which saw a fall in deaths. Covid represented 27.4% of all deaths in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The total number of Covid deaths in Wales up to and registered by 11 December was 4,115 deaths, but when deaths registered over the following few days are counted, it takes the total to 4,200. Rhondda Cynon Taff, with 575 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales, followed by Cardiff with 493, up to the latest week. Aneurin Bevan health board saw the highest numbers of weekly deaths since the end of April, at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. There were 57 deaths - including 36 in hospitals and 17 in care homes. There were 52 deaths involving Covid in the Swansea Bay health board area, including 38 in hospital and 12 in care homes. These included 22 hospital deaths of Swansea residents, the 11th highest total across England and Wales, and 16 involving patients from Neath Port Talbot. It comes asSwansea's biggest hospital warned of a sudden increase in Covid patients. Cwm Taf Morgannwg area saw deaths fall for a second successive week to 36, although the health board later on Tuesday reported another 25 deaths linked to hospital infections. This takes the total deaths linked to these outbreaks so far to 261 since October. There were 13 more deaths in the Royal Glamorgan hospital, nine in the Princess of Wales in Bridgend  and three in Prince Charles hospital in Merthyr, in the week up to Monday. The ONS figures reported 29 deaths in the Hywel Dda health board area - 20 involving hospital patients from Carmarthenshire. There were 23 deaths in Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales, 20 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in Cardiff and Vale, and six deaths in Powys. NHS in Wales 'stretched to limit' by Covid Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Only Gwynedd and Anglesey saw no deaths at all, for the third week in a row. The 15 deaths in RCT this week took the total mortality rate involving Covid in the area to 239 deaths per 100,000 - now the highest rate in England and Wales - unadjusted for age differences. So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are above the five-year average. Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. In Wales, the number of deaths fell from 836 to 814 in the latest week, which was 121 deaths (17.5%) higher than the five-year average for that week. There were 44 deaths registered in care homes involving Covid-19 in the past week. The ONS reports deaths,externalwhen Covid-19 is both suspected by doctors, or confirmed by a test, and takes place in care homes, people's homes and hospices, as well as hospitals. It is estimated that in about 90% of deaths where Covid is mentioned on the death certificate, it is the underlying cause, so death can be described as ""due to"" Covid. This takes longer to process than the daily snapshot of deaths reported by Public Health Wales but it is considered as giving a fuller picture. The number of deaths involving Covid-19 in England fell for the second consecutive week, to 2,530, and numbers fell in all its regions apart from the East Midlands, the east and south-east England.

"There are still places throughout the UK without adequate coverage The UK will fail to achieve a target of offering gigabit-capable broadband to 85% of the UK by 2025, MPs have warned. Initially, the government had aimed for nationwide coverage within five years. But targets were scaled back when it emerged that only 25% of the promised Â£5bn funding would be available. The Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the cuts, paired with a ""lack of effective planning"" meant the UK could end up playing catch-up to other countries. The report said there was ""no genuine belief"" from within the sector that the government's current goals were possible within its current timeframe. âThe governmentâs decision to abandon its 2025 gigabit-capable broadband target within weeks of ministers reassuring us of their commitment to it was a belated recognition that it was unrealistic and unachievable, underlining concerns weâd heard from industry,"" said committee chairman Julian Knight. 5G and The Battle of Bath Watered-down broadband plans a 'kick in the teeth' One in four UK homes 'can access 1Gbps broadband' On the same day as the committee's scathing report, the government also laid out the next steps in its plan. It said homes and businesses that did not yet have access to gigabit-capable broadband would be prioritised in the ongoing roll-out. Lloyd Felton, of County Broadband, said this would be crucial in making sure the UK's broadband was fit for future generations. âContinued growth in the rollout of full-fibre broadband is much-needed, as a recent Ofcom report revealed only 18% of the UK can access full-fibre services. ""It is vital that we take the opportunities to invest in full-fibre infrastructure now, to ensure Britainâs broadband is accessible to all UK properties,"" he added. The committee also echoed concerns from within the telecoms industry that the government would fall short of its 5G coverage target, leaving some areas without connectivity. The government had previously announced its target for majority 5G coverage in the UK by 2027 as part of its Â£5bn plan. However, the DCMS said the plans in their current state failed to address problems with coverage in hard-to-reach rural areas. About 9% of the UK has little or no access to 4G networks from any provider. âThe governmentâs target to deliver to the majority of the population, rather than the majority of the country, risks repeating the same errors that led to mobile ânot-spotsâ,"" said Mr Knight. ""If investors cherry-pick areas of high population, it leaves people in remote rural areas without a hope."" Mr Knight added that current plans risked ""embedding digital inequality rather than solving it"". Honest Mobile founder Andy Aitken urged the government to put addressing the UK's current coverage issues ahead of its 5G plans. ""Even people in central London - where coverage is best - still find themselves in not-spots and without a connection during rush hour,"" said Mr Aitken. He added: ""Lockdown has only highlighted the importance of giving high-quality internet access to everyone wherever they live in the UK."" Following a ruling in July, the UK's mobile providers are banned from using Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December. They must also remove all the Chinese firm's 5G kit from their networks by 2027. The legislation is expected to result in a delay of at least two years to 5G roll-out, with additional costs of up to Â£2bn. 5G and the Battle of Bath Watered-down broadband plans a 'kick in the teeth' One in four UK homes 'can access 1Gbps broadband' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"PSNI officers issued 68 fines under Covid-19 regulations at Black Lives Protests in June Chief Constable Simon Byrne has apologised after the Police Ombudsman found justification in claims the handling of the Black Lives Matter protests was unfair and discriminatory. A report by Police Ombudsman Marie Anderson stated it was ""not intentional and not based on race or ethnicity"". However, confidence in policing among some in minority communities has been ""severely damaged"". Mr Byrne said: ""The time is right to show some humility and say sorry."" Mrs Anderson launched an investigation after complaints aboutpolice actions on 6 June, when about 70 fines were handed out at demonstrations in Belfast and Londonderry. Chief constable Simon Byrne has apologised after the policing of the Black Lives Matter protests In contrast, no Â£60 fixed penalty notices were issued at a Protect our Monuments rally in Belfast on 13 June - those attending included loyalists and military veterans. Mrs Anderson said police had ""failed to fully understand"" the human rights of those at the Black Lives Matter (BLM) events to be able to protest peacefully. Her report found officers had not engaged in any harassment as some had claimed. ""The differential treatment by PSNI of protesters on 6 June when compared with those attending Protect Our Monuments on 13 June gave rise to claims of unfairness and discrimination against those persons who organised and attended the 'Black Lives Matters' protests,"" the report stated. ""These concerns are in my view cogent, have substance and are justified in the circumstances. ""I believe that this unfairness was not intentional.  Neither was it based on race or ethnicity of those who attended the event."" On the issue of fines and prosecutions, the ombudsman said they should be reviewed. ""A number of fines issued at the Guildhall Square and Custom House Square have now been paid by the recipients. ""My investigation has established that many of these contain inconsistencies and errors and therefore their validity is questionable."" Parts of her report echoed one from the Policing Boardpublished in November, which questioned whether the PSNI approach had been unlawful. The PSNI has already announced it is establishing a task force to help rebuild relations with black, Asian and ethnic minority groups. In a statement, Mr Byrne said: ""We tried our best to respect the public health requirements of the Northern Ireland Executive to save lives and at the same time deal with public outcry triggered by this awful death [of George Floyd]. ""We operated within the legal framework available to us at the time, but the ombudsman is clear that whilst unintentional, we got that balance procedurally wrong."" He added: ""It is clear to me that some members of the Black and Minority Ethnic Community have been frustrated, angry and upset by our policing response and our relationship with them has suffered. ""For that I am sorry, and I am determined in that regard to put things right."" Patrick Corrigan, from Amnesty International, said the report was ""deeply critical"". He called for a ""fundamental reassessment"" of how the PSNI approaches the right to protest and the police's relationship with black and minority ethnic communities.

"Scientists are urgently investigating hints the new variant of coronavirus spreads more easily in children. If proven, this could account for ""a significant proportion"" of the increase in transmission, they say. The claim comes from members of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats advisory group (Nervtag). On Monday, Boris Johnson said he wanted to open schools in January ""if we possibly can"". There are no suggestions the new form of the virus is a greater threat to children's health. What do we know? How worried should we be? The Oxford vaccine story Children almost universally shrug off the virus, but the variant could alter the role they, and schools, play in spreading the virus. Earlier strains of coronavirus found it harder to infect children than adults. One explanation is children have fewer of the doorways (the ACE2 receptor) the virus uses to enter our body's cells. A recent study of infections in schools in Englandfound that levels of the virus in school-age children reflected levels in the local community, suggesting that closing schools would only have a temporary effect. Prof Wendy Barclay, from Nervtag and Imperial College London, said the mutations to the virus appeared to be making it easier to walk through the doorways that were there. She said this could be putting children on a ""more level playing field"" with adults as the virus was ""less inhibited"" in children. Prof Barclay said: ""Therefore children are equally susceptible, perhaps, to this virus as adults, and therefore given their mixing patterns, you would expect to see more children being infected."" Work to understand the new variant is taking place at lightning speed and there is still much uncertainty. It is now thought the new variant spreads 50% to 70% faster than other forms of the virus. Early analysis of how and where it is spreading have also given ""hints that it has a higher propensity to infect children"", according to Prof Neil Ferguson from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, who also sits on Nervtag. He stressed the link was still being investigated and was not yet proven. ""If it were true, then this might explain a significant proportion, maybe even the majority, of the transmission increase seen,"" he added. But Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health, from the University of Liverpool, told the BBC there wasn't any evidence ""at the moment"" that the new variant is able to infect children more efficiently. He said this would be looked at closely by scientists over Christmas. Scientists involved in COG-UK, the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, which detected the rapid increase in the variant, said they were not aware of any increased incidence in children. The data are continuing to be analysed, but it is thought the variant continued spreading even during the lockdown in November. The R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - for this variant during the tight restrictions has been estimated at 1.2, which meant cases were increasing. At the same time the R number was 0.8 for the other forms of the virus during lockdown and they were in decline. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Prof Ferguson said he expected the number of infections to fall as schools closed and people hunkered down for Christmas. He added: ""The real question then is - how much are we able to relax measures in the new year, and still retain control?"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We want, if we possibly can, to get schools back in a staggered way at the beginning of January, in the way that we have set out.

"School attendance has declined since the November firebreak ""Deeply worrying"" school attendance figures due to Covid will lead to more inequality, a think tank has warned. Latest Welsh Government figures showed attendance at 70% in the week beginning 7 December, falling to just 50% for Year 11 pupils. Emily, 15, from Llanelli, said she stopped going to school as she was scared of passing coronavirus to vulnerable family members. The Welsh Government said it would keep working with councils and schools. Most absence was due to Covid-19 cases and, between 7 and 11 December, more than 110,000 pupils on average were not in school. Attendance ranged from 90% in Gwynedd and 86% in Conwy -areas with comparatively low case rates- to 43% in Blaenau Gwent, 52% in Neath Port Talbot and 54% in Swansea - some of the hardest-hit areas in Wales. Children 'isolating three times in three months' Ministers 'intimidating schools with legal threats' 'Huge expansion' of secondary school Covid tests The provisional data follows a pattern of declining attendance since the week after theNovember firebreak, when attendance was the highest it had been all term at 90%. Luke Sibieta, from the Education Policy Institute think tank, said: ""Unfortunately, the long-term impacts are undoubtedly going to be quite severe ""Pupils missing out on almost half the year of schooling last year and then a patchwork of inequalities of missed schooling this term will take their toll on children's education. ""There'll be a widening of existing inequalities - particularly as it's tended to be quite disadvantaged council areas where pupils have missed out on most schooling."" Though most absence during the term was due to disruption as a result of positive Covid cases, some families have been anxious about children going to school. Emily's mother Toni agreed she could stay home due to their health conditions Emily stopped going to school a few weeks after they reopened in September. ""I was scared to go to school because I was catching the train every day,"" she said. ""Even though I had my mask I thought I was still going to catch it. I said to mam that I didn't want to go to school. I had anxiety and I was too scared."" Emily's mother Toni initially agreed she could stay at home, adding: ""I've got type 2 diabetes and my partner hasCOPD,external.

"School attendance has declined since the November firebreak ""Deeply worrying"" school attendance figures due to Covid will lead to more inequality, a think tank has warned. Latest Welsh Government figures showed attendance at 70% in the week beginning 7 December, falling to just 50% for Year 11 pupils. Emily, 15, from Llanelli, said she stopped going to school as she was scared of passing coronavirus to vulnerable family members. The Welsh Government said it would keep working with councils and schools. Most absence was due to Covid-19 cases and, between 7 and 11 December, more than 110,000 pupils on average were not in school. Attendance ranged from 90% in Gwynedd and 86% in Conwy -areas with comparatively low case rates- to 43% in Blaenau Gwent, 52% in Neath Port Talbot and 54% in Swansea - some of the hardest-hit areas in Wales. Children 'isolating three times in three months' Ministers 'intimidating schools with legal threats' 'Huge expansion' of secondary school Covid tests The provisional data follows a pattern of declining attendance since the week after theNovember firebreak, when attendance was the highest it had been all term at 90%. Luke Sibieta, from the Education Policy Institute think tank, said: ""Unfortunately, the long-term impacts are undoubtedly going to be quite severe ""Pupils missing out on almost half the year of schooling last year and then a patchwork of inequalities of missed schooling this term will take their toll on children's education. ""There'll be a widening of existing inequalities - particularly as it's tended to be quite disadvantaged council areas where pupils have missed out on most schooling."" Though most absence during the term was due to disruption as a result of positive Covid cases, some families have been anxious about children going to school. Emily's mother Toni agreed she could stay home due to their health conditions Emily stopped going to school a few weeks after they reopened in September. ""I was scared to go to school because I was catching the train every day,"" she said. ""Even though I had my mask I thought I was still going to catch it. I said to mam that I didn't want to go to school. I had anxiety and I was too scared."" Emily's mother Toni initially agreed she could stay at home, adding: ""I've got type 2 diabetes and my partner hasCOPD,external. ""Emily suffers with anxiety for various reasons - so she got a little bit anxious about coming to school. ""We both discussed it and thought the infection rate is rising so we wouldn't risk her coming back and forth to school every day."" After support from teachers and a welfare officer, they agreed Emily would go to school in the mornings but leave at lunchtime to avoid crowded trains. Toni said: ""Covid has got a lot of children and adults anxious. I know a few people who have kept their kids home."" The family was supported by Carmarthenshire council's schools safeguarding and attendance scheme, with team manager Rhona Evans saying they approach each case individually. ""We've been working towards keeping children engaged in education, even when they physically can't attend,"" she said. ""So we've supported by taking out hard copies of work, ensuring the families have got access to the digital equity scheme."" Rhona Evans says children have needed more support than usual Ms Evans said children were also finding school to be a different place after lockdown, and many needed support with that too. ""They return, and if their year group has to self-isolate again, it sort of knocks them back a bit so they need a bit more support than normal. ""The school environment is very different as well so we've provided a lot of emotional support - far more than we would normally do - because the issues we're facing are far more complex."" Hywel Price, head teacher of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro Morgannwg in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said pupils having to self-isolate created ""insecurity and inconsistency in attendance"". ""We have cases in certain schools where pupils have lost up to six, maybe eight weeks, of education due to being in contact with positive cases. ""That's a desperate story. Once you lose that routine and normality it can be difficult to return. ""Pupils, we know, come to schools not just for education, but to see their friends and socialise for a few hours a day. That's a very, very important aspect of education. This kind of insecurity will hit any pupil."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""Schools in Wales have provided a safe, secure and welcoming environment for pupils and staff. ""We recognise that because of local school decisions and factors the attendance rate for pupils have been lower near the end of term. ""However, we'll continue to work with local authorities and schools to ensure education continues for all children and young people with as little disruption as possible.""

"Washington is a city of columns US President Donald Trump has issued an order that future federal buildings across the country must be ""beautiful"", and preferably built in a classical Greek, Roman, or similar style. The executive order,externalsays too many federal buildings reflect ""brutalist"" designs of the last century. It says new government buildings should look more like America's ""beloved"" landmarks such as the White House. Although traditionalists will welcome the move, many others are unhappy. The American Institute of Architects said it ""unequivocally opposes"" the initiative, while critics have called it ""undemocratic"" for the government to impose an official style on architects. The architect who inspired our love of columns Is the White House really a dump? The order - titled ""Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture"" - creates a new council to advise the president on future federal buildings. ""New federal building designs should, like America's beloved landmark buildings, uplift and beautify public spaces, inspire the human spirit, ennoble the United States, command respect from the general public, and, as appropriate, respect the architectural heritage of a region,"" the order reads. Classical buildings such as the White House are ""cherished landmarks"", the order says President Trump, a property developer, has only a few weeks left in office after losing November's election to Joe Biden. His executive order says that federal buildings built in Washington DC in recent times have created ""a discordant mixture of classical and modernist designs"". It said that with some exceptions, the government had ""largely stopped building beautiful buildings"". The use of classical and other traditional architecture ""should be encouraged instead of discouraged"", it adds. Paul Goldberger, a Pulitzer-prize winning architect said the government ""mandating of an official style isnot fully compatible with 21st-century liberal democracy"".,external A draft of the order was first made public in February, raising objections from the American Institute of Architects and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. On Monday, the institute said that communities should have ""the right and responsibility to decide for themselves what architectural design best fits their needs"". The head of the institute, Robert Ivy, said in a statement: ""Though we are appalled with the administration's decision to move forward with the design mandate, we are happy the order isn't as far reaching as previously thought."" Some architecture experts argued that, by pushing for classical architecture and excluding modern styles,the government was suggesting that white history and culture was superior,external. In February, Phineas Harper, former deputy director of the Architecture Association, said: ""Regardless of history, classical aesthetics have become adog whistle for a certain pocket of nationalists - a code for whiteness,external."" Howevera White House official told Bloomberg,externalthat polls on the issue had found that a vast majority of Americans preferred traditional designs. The National Civic Art Society,externalalso welcomed the move, saying: ""Americans have long understood that classical architecture is not only beautiful, it embodies the key values of our representative government."" It added that a majority of people it had polled preferred classical architecture, and that ""the design of federal buildings should reflect the aesthetic and symbolic preferences of the people they are built to serve.""

Morton, Mary OâConnor, Max Matza and Sophie Williams. Tesco has re-introduced a cap on the number of some items customers can buy. In an email to customers the supermarket giant said stock levels were good and reminded them to shop normally so that everyone was able to get what they need. Tesco said it had temporary purchasing limits in place on certain essential items to help all customers have access to these products. These are understood to include toilet roll, eggs, rice, soap and hand wash. Earlier, an executive at (another) supermarket told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack that they did not feel the need to introduce caps on any items shoppers could buy at their stores. Police have released bodycam footage of the moment a party of more than 60 people was discovered in Leicester. Two Â£10,000 fines were issued for holding the gathering at a private residence, which broke coronavirus rules on 12 December, Leicestershire Police said.

Skylar Mack, an 18-year-old from Georgia, broke the 14-day quarantine last month after two days by removing a government geo-tracking bracelet and attending a jet ski event where her Caymanian boyfriend was competing. According to the judge in the case, Mack had swapped out her bracelet for one that was more loose one day before her violation, so that she would be able to slip out of it more easily. ""Sheâs terrified. She called me last night, she couldnât sleep,"" her grandmother Jeanne Mack told Fox News on Monday. ""She knows she did wrong,"" she said, calling the incident ""a total lapse in judgement of an otherwise brilliant young lady."" According to the Cayman Compass newspaper, Mack did not wear a mask or socially distance while watching the jet ski event for approximately seven hours.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The daily government figures on coronavirus are very sobering. Deaths linked to the virus are beginning to climb, with another 691 deaths reported on Tuesday. But deaths happening now are people who would have been infected at the start of the month. Since then we know cases have risen rapidly. The 36,804 new confirmed infections reported today are a daily record since mass testing began in the early summer â although it is likely there were more cases in the spring peak but a lack of testing meant we were not spotting them. The jump means we are now seeing twice the number of daily cases than we were at the start of the month on average. That means deaths will, sadly, continue to climb in the coming weeks. As will hospital admissions. The figures show there are nearly 19,000 patients in hospital, bring the NHS ever closer to the spring peak when just over 21,000 were being treated for Covid at one point. Hospital bosses are warning the next 10 to 15 days are going to be crucial. The situation is ""serious"" at Manston in Kent where hundreds of lorry drivers are stranded due to the closure of the border. The Road Haulage Association's policy and public affairs managing director Rod McKenzie tweeted that ""drivers have few toilets and little food to eat"". The trade body is calling on the government to act quickly to tackle the situation. Manston Airport is being used as a temporary lorry park. Allow Twitter content?

Roger Gough told the BBC that 2,220 vehicles are now at the airport in Manston. A further 632 are still being held on the M20 motorway. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter A new variant of the virus causing Covid-19, first spotted in Kent, could already be circulating - or have originated from - outside the UK. But it was spotted here because of the strength of the UK's surveillance system, scientists have said. The Covid-19 Genomics Consortium (Cog-UK) has tracked the genetic history of more than 150,000 samples of Sars-Cov-2 virus. That equates to about half the world's genetic sequencing of coronavirus.

According to the New York Times, at least 14 of the approximately 50 death row inmates at the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, have been infected. Among the infected are two men scheduled to die next month. Federal executions had been on hold for 17 years before President Trump ordered them to be resumed earlier this year. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes over the White House on 20 January, has said he would seek to halt federal executions. Lawyers for the two condemned men have already asked the courts to delay their sentences. Another inmate scheduled to die before Biden takes office - Lisa Montgomery - has already had her sentenced postponed after her two lawyers tested positive for the virus. According to a survey last month from The Marshall Project and The Associated Press,external, approximately one in five US prisoners is infected with Covid-19. Simon JackBBC Business Editor A senior supermarket
executive has told the BBC that while some shelves are empty there is plenty of
stock to replenish them overnight. The company said they felt no need to
introduce caps on the number of items shoppers can buy as although customers were
spending heavily they were doing so ârationallyâ. The executive added that much
of the buying was down to a change of Christmas plans, saying âthere are a lot more
Christmases than people were expecting due to the new restrictions on
households mingling and shoppers are buying accordingly â but hoping to do it
onceâ. The company said that if the problems at the border did not start to
improve within the next 48 hours then shortages of fresh food would begin to bite
from 27 December. China has suspended
its visa application service in London. In a statement, the
Chinese embassy did not reveal how long the suspension would last. âIn accordance
with the relevant pandemic prevention advice, the Chinese Visa Application
Service Centre in London will suspend its operation from December 22nd,
2020 until further notice,âthe
statement said,external. The announcement
came after a new strain of Covid-19 was revealed in the UK. More than 50 countries
have banned travel from the UK so far. Last month, the
Chinese embassy announced the temporary suspension of entry into China by
non-Chinese nationals in the UK holding Chinese visas or residence permits. Olympic Village in Tokyo Organisers of the delayed Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will spend $900m (Â£670m) on measures to stop the spread of coronavirus at next year's events. The final budget means the Games will cost $15.9bn (Â£11.8bn) - up $2.8bn (Â£2.1bn) from figures last year. It could make the Tokyo Games the most expensive summer Olympics in history. A poll last week by national broadcaster NHK showed that the majority of the Japanese general public oppose holding the Games next year, favouring a further delay or outright cancellation of the event. But organisers insist the Games can be held, and have ruled out another delay. Virus measures being planned include the creation of a infection control centre in the Olympic and Paralympic Village, as well as plans to regularly test athletes, and a ban on cheering.

A further 36,804 people have tested positive for Covid-19 across the country, up from a rise of 33,364 on Monday. While some of those hoping to cross the Channel to mainland Europe are queuing on the M20, others have been diverted around eastern Kent, via Manston. The Marquess of Bute has been charged withallegedly breaking coronavirus laws after reportedly travelling to Scotland from London. Police Scotland launched an investigation following reports on Monday that he and six others travelled to the Isle of Bute. The marquess has a home in London as well as his ancestral home of Mount Stuart on Bute, an island in the Firth of Clyde. Scotland's cross border travel curbs have been in place since November. Also known as John Colum Bute, the 62-year-old marquess is a former F1 driver who raced under the name Johnny Dumfries. The Bute family has been contacted for comment. Public health experts in the US have been weighing in on the UK's discovery of a new mutant variant of Covid-19, with many saying that there is a solid likelihood that the virus is already present in the US. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US disease researcher, told ABC News this morning that it is ""certainly possible"" that the mutant strain is already present in the US. ""I mean, when you have this amount of spread within a place like the UK that you really need to assume that it's here already,"" he said. ""It may not - and certainly it's not the dominant strain, but I would not be surprised at all if it was already here."" The former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the regulator tasked with approving vaccines and medicines, said the new strain âis already in the US.â âI donât think a travel ban [on the UK], at this point, is going to prevent this mutated strain from coming into the United States,â Scott Gottlieb told CNBC. Greg Mazurek was making a delivery to the UK with another driver More than 1,500 lorries are waiting to leave the UK while the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel remain closed to traffic leaving the country. Polish lorry driver Greg Mazurek, 36, said he arrived in the UK with another driver to deliver a respirator to a medical centre on Sunday. ""We were not prepared for such a long trip. It was supposed to be a fast delivery, two or three days, then go back home for Christmas with our families,"" he said. ""Now we don't know if we will get home in time. We know nothing.

"The technique would see waste recycled in washing-machine style contraptions Single-use Covid facemasks, plastic aprons and visors could be recycled into green fuel via a new technique developed by scientists. The Swansea University-led team said it could help tackle a global problem of what to do with the pandemic's medical waste. Currently, old PPE is incinerated, which produces climate-warming carbon emissions. This new approach uses sunlight to break the items down into hydrogen. Researchers are also studying whether the process can kill off pathogens left on the PPE - including the Covid virus. They say it could potentially save a lot of money for the NHS - with an estimated Â£700m a year spent disposing of hazardous medical waste across the UK, even before the pandemic struck. Ways you can ditch single-use plastic 'Delay plastic ban so Covid lessons are learned' Does the NHS have enough protective gear for winter? Go-between paid Â£21m in taxpayer funds for NHS PPE Project lead Dr Moritz Kuehnel described facemasks littering roadsides as ""just the tip of the iceberg if you think of the NHS and all those disposable aprons and gloves which have increased a lot because of Covid. ""Applying our technology to reprocess just 1% of this waste would save millions and mitigate pollution at the same time."" Dr Kuehnel said finding a solution that was ""cheap and easy to implement is really important"", especially for developing countries which may lack a good recycling infrastructure and incineration facilities. Dr Moritz Kuehnel says discarded facemasks on the side of the road is ""the tip of the iceberg"" Although the research is at an early stage, he said the hope was eventually to develop a low-cost device people could use. ""So you would have a simple, washing-machine kind of thing - put all your waste in, turn it on, wait for the sun to shine and then all the waste is gone but you also get something out that has a value."" Lesley Jones, chief executive of Keep Wales Tidy, saiddiscarded single-use PPE was becoming a huge environmental problem. Data provided to BBC Wales by the charity suggested its volunteers had encountered PPE items on 45% of litter picks since September. ""That litter contains plastic which gets into our rivers and our marine environment, and the little strings that are on masks can cause real damage to birds and small wildlife like hedgehogs,"" Ms Jones said. ""There's also the danger to health for the people who are picking them up. ""Our message would be obviously please, please take your litter home with you or put it in a bin, but also to think really seriously about purchasing reusable masks as that is so much better for the environment."" The research builds on the team's previous work on generating hydrogen from waste plastics - a technique calledphotoreforming,external. It involves using a photocatalyst - a material which absorbs light and can covert it into energy to promote chemical reactions - in this instance the breakdown of plastic waste and the conversion of water into hydrogen. The research is at an early stage, but has received a Welsh Government grant It also generates what are known as reactive oxygen species which can kill off germs. The Swansea team, working with scientists in India, will help examine the photocatalysts' antiviral activity against different pathogens, including the virus that causes Covid-19. The Welsh Government has awarded Â£47,000 of grant funding to support the project.

The 36,804 new confirmed infections reported today are a daily record since mass testing began in the early summer â although it is likely there were more cases in the spring peak but a lack of testing meant we were not spotting them. The jump means we are now seeing twice the number of daily cases than we were at the start of the month on average. That means deaths will, sadly, continue to climb in the coming weeks. As will hospital admissions. The figures show there are nearly 19,000 patients in hospital, bring the NHS ever closer to the spring peak when just over 21,000 were being treated for Covid at one point. Hospital bosses are warning the next 10 to 15 days are going to be crucial. The situation is ""serious"" at Manston in Kent where hundreds of lorry drivers are stranded due to the closure of the border. The Road Haulage Association's policy and public affairs managing director Rod McKenzie tweeted that ""drivers have few toilets and little food to eat"". The trade body is calling on the government to act quickly to tackle the situation. Manston Airport is being used as a temporary lorry park. Allow Twitter content?

Lauren MossPolitical editor, BBC South East Today There are now almost 3,000 lorries being held in Kent as they wait to cross to the continent, the leader of Kent County Council has said. Roger Gough told the BBC that 2,220 vehicles are now at the airport in Manston. A further 632 are still being held on the M20 motorway. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter A new variant of the virus causing Covid-19, first spotted in Kent, could already be circulating - or have originated from - outside the UK. But it was spotted here because of the strength of the UK's surveillance system, scientists have said. The Covid-19 Genomics Consortium (Cog-UK) has tracked the genetic history of more than 150,000 samples of Sars-Cov-2 virus. That equates to about half the world's genetic sequencing of coronavirus.

According to the New York Times, at least 14 of the approximately 50 death row inmates at the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, have been infected. Among the infected are two men scheduled to die next month. Federal executions had been on hold for 17 years before President Trump ordered them to be resumed earlier this year. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes over the White House on 20 January, has said he would seek to halt federal executions. Lawyers for the two condemned men have already asked the courts to delay their sentences. Another inmate scheduled to die before Biden takes office - Lisa Montgomery - has already had her sentenced postponed after her two lawyers tested positive for the virus. According to a survey last month from The Marshall Project and The Associated Press,external, approximately one in five US prisoners is infected with Covid-19. Simon JackBBC Business Editor A senior supermarket
executive has told the BBC that while some shelves are empty there is plenty of
stock to replenish them overnight. The company said they felt no need to
introduce caps on the number of items shoppers can buy as although customers were
spending heavily they were doing so ârationallyâ. The executive added that much
of the buying was down to a change of Christmas plans, saying âthere are a lot more
Christmases than people were expecting due to the new restrictions on
households mingling and shoppers are buying accordingly â but hoping to do it
onceâ. The company said that if the problems at the border did not start to
improve within the next 48 hours then shortages of fresh food would begin to bite
from 27 December. China has suspended
its visa application service in London. In a statement, the
Chinese embassy did not reveal how long the suspension would last. âIn accordance
with the relevant pandemic prevention advice, the Chinese Visa Application
Service Centre in London will suspend its operation from December 22nd,
2020 until further notice,âthe
statement said,external. The announcement
came after a new strain of Covid-19 was revealed in the UK. More than 50 countries
have banned travel from the UK so far. Last month, the
Chinese embassy announced the temporary suspension of entry into China by
non-Chinese nationals in the UK holding Chinese visas or residence permits. Olympic Village in Tokyo Organisers of the delayed Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will spend $900m (Â£670m) on measures to stop the spread of coronavirus at next year's events. The final budget means the Games will cost $15.9bn (Â£11.8bn) - up $2.8bn (Â£2.1bn) from figures last year. It could make the Tokyo Games the most expensive summer Olympics in history. A poll last week by national broadcaster NHK showed that the majority of the Japanese general public oppose holding the Games next year, favouring a further delay or outright cancellation of the event. But organisers insist the Games can be held, and have ruled out another delay. Virus measures being planned include the creation of a infection control centre in the Olympic and Paralympic Village, as well as plans to regularly test athletes, and a ban on cheering.

The Marquess of Bute has been charged withallegedly breaking coronavirus laws after reportedly travelling to Scotland from London. Police Scotland launched an investigation following reports on Monday that he and six others travelled to the Isle of Bute. The marquess has a home in London as well as his ancestral home of Mount Stuart on Bute, an island in the Firth of Clyde. Scotland's cross border travel curbs have been in place since November. Also known as John Colum Bute, the 62-year-old marquess is a former F1 driver who raced under the name Johnny Dumfries. The Bute family has been contacted for comment. Public health experts in the US have been weighing in on the UK's discovery of a new mutant variant of Covid-19, with many saying that there is a solid likelihood that the virus is already present in the US. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US disease researcher, told ABC News this morning that it is ""certainly possible"" that the mutant strain is already present in the US. ""I mean, when you have this amount of spread within a place like the UK that you really need to assume that it's here already,"" he said. ""It may not - and certainly it's not the dominant strain, but I would not be surprised at all if it was already here."" The former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the regulator tasked with approving vaccines and medicines, said the new strain âis already in the US.â âI donât think a travel ban [on the UK], at this point, is going to prevent this mutated strain from coming into the United States,â Scott Gottlieb told CNBC.

"Government borrowing soared in November as the UK continued to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic. The Office for National Statistics said,externalborrowing hit Â£31.6bn last month, the highest November figure on record. It was also the third-highest figure in any month since records began in 1993. The figures highlight the government's spending-revenue gap, and underline Chancellor Rishi Sunak's problems as he weighs up bolstering Treasury coffers. Since the beginning of the financial year in April, borrowing has reached Â£240.9bn, Â£188.6bn more than a year ago, the ONS said. A Budget had been expected to take place in autumn this year, but it was delayed because of the pandemic and will now take place on 3 March 2021. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated that borrowing could reach Â£372.2bn by the end of the financial year in March. However, Mr Sunak made clear on Tuesday that he would not be taking any hasty action. ""When our economy recovers, it's right that we take the necessary steps to put the public finances on a more sustainable footing so we are able to respond to future crises in the way we have done this year,"" he said. Mr Sunak has already imposed a pay freezeon at least 1.3 million public sector workers as part of efforts to contain government spending. The increase in borrowing has led to a steep increase in the national debt, which now stands at just under Â£2.1 trillion. The UK's overall debt has now reached 99.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. The government borrows in the financial markets, by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect, the repayment. The buyers of these bonds, or ""gilts"", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. Private savers also buy some. You canread more hereabout how countries borrow money. ""We are looking at the highest peacetime deficit and if we look at where the country's debt is, then we are at the highest levels since the 1960s,"" said Sarah Hewin, chief economist at Standard Chartered. ""In November alone, borrowing was about six times what it was in November last year, so these are some absolutely record numbers that we are seeing. ""Also, of course, the furlough scheme has been extended, so that will increase government spending. We could well see the deficit for the financial year all the way up to 20% of GDP, so around Â£400bn."" Separately,the ONS has also revised its figures for the UK's economic growth,externalthis year. The economy shrank a little less in the April-to-June period than previously indicated, by 18.8% instead of 19.8%. And the rebound from July to September was a little bigger, with growth of 16% instead of 15.5%. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said a double-dip recession was a clear possibility if the tier four Covid-19 restrictions were extended into 2021. However, she said there was optimism that as long as vaccines were effective and widespread, GDP would ""stage a strong rebound"" in the second half of next year. The extraordinary pandemic shutdown borrowing numbers had begun to recover. But last month, as some restrictions were reapplied across the UK, the government borrowed Â£31.6bn, the third-highest month on record. This was Â£26bn higher than last November, driven mainly by a Â£23bn increase in government spending on a year ago, including the reapplication of the full jobs wage subsidy furlough scheme. Borrowing so far this financial year since April is already at a record Â£240bn and set to hit about Â£400bn over the full year. Growth in the economy in the third quarter was a little higher than first calculated, at a record 16%, but that now is firmly old news. The likely spread of new restrictions on retail and hospitality and multiple forms of chaos at ports mean forecasters fear the UK may already be back in a double-dip recession.

"Washington is a city of columns US President Donald Trump has issued an order that future federal buildings across the country must be ""beautiful"", and preferably built in a classical Greek, Roman, or similar style. The executive order,externalsays too many federal buildings reflect ""brutalist"" designs of the last century. It says new government buildings should look more like America's ""beloved"" landmarks such as the White House. Although traditionalists will welcome the move, many others are unhappy. The American Institute of Architects said it ""unequivocally opposes"" the initiative, while critics have called it ""undemocratic"" for the government to impose an official style on architects. The architect who inspired our love of columns Is the White House really a dump? The order - titled ""Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture"" - creates a new council to advise the president on future federal buildings. ""New federal building designs should, like America's beloved landmark buildings, uplift and beautify public spaces, inspire the human spirit, ennoble the United States, command respect from the general public, and, as appropriate, respect the architectural heritage of a region,"" the order reads. Classical buildings such as the White House are ""cherished landmarks"", the order says President Trump, a property developer, has only a few weeks left in office after losing November's election to Joe Biden. His executive order says that federal buildings built in Washington DC in recent times have created ""a discordant mixture of classical and modernist designs"". It said that with some exceptions, the government had ""largely stopped building beautiful buildings"". The use of classical and other traditional architecture ""should be encouraged instead of discouraged"", it adds. Paul Goldberger, a Pulitzer-prize winning architect said the government ""mandating of an official style isnot fully compatible with 21st-century liberal democracy"".,external A draft of the order was first made public in February, raising objections from the American Institute of Architects and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. On Monday, the institute said that communities should have ""the right and responsibility to decide for themselves what architectural design best fits their needs"". The head of the institute, Robert Ivy, said in a statement: ""Though we are appalled with the administration's decision to move forward with the design mandate, we are happy the order isn't as far reaching as previously thought."" Some architecture experts argued that, by pushing for classical architecture and excluding modern styles,the government was suggesting that white history and culture was superior,external. In February, Phineas Harper, former deputy director of the Architecture Association, said: ""Regardless of history, classical aesthetics have become adog whistle for a certain pocket of nationalists - a code for whiteness,external."" Howevera White House official told Bloomberg,externalthat polls on the issue had found that a vast majority of Americans preferred traditional designs. The National Civic Art Society,externalalso welcomed the move, saying: ""Americans have long understood that classical architecture is not only beautiful, it embodies the key values of our representative government."" It added that a majority of people it had polled preferred classical architecture, and that ""the design of federal buildings should reflect the aesthetic and symbolic preferences of the people they are built to serve.""

"The technique would see waste recycled in washing-machine style contraptions Single-use Covid facemasks, plastic aprons and visors could be recycled into green fuel via a new technique developed by scientists. The Swansea University-led team said it could help tackle a global problem of what to do with the pandemic's medical waste. Currently, old PPE is incinerated, which produces climate-warming carbon emissions. This new approach uses sunlight to break the items down into hydrogen. Researchers are also studying whether the process can kill off pathogens left on the PPE - including the Covid virus. They say it could potentially save a lot of money for the NHS - with an estimated Â£700m a year spent disposing of hazardous medical waste across the UK, even before the pandemic struck. Ways you can ditch single-use plastic 'Delay plastic ban so Covid lessons are learned' Does the NHS have enough protective gear for winter? Go-between paid Â£21m in taxpayer funds for NHS PPE Project lead Dr Moritz Kuehnel described facemasks littering roadsides as ""just the tip of the iceberg if you think of the NHS and all those disposable aprons and gloves which have increased a lot because of Covid. ""Applying our technology to reprocess just 1% of this waste would save millions and mitigate pollution at the same time."" Dr Kuehnel said finding a solution that was ""cheap and easy to implement is really important"", especially for developing countries which may lack a good recycling infrastructure and incineration facilities. Dr Moritz Kuehnel says discarded facemasks on the side of the road is ""the tip of the iceberg"" Although the research is at an early stage, he said the hope was eventually to develop a low-cost device people could use. ""So you would have a simple, washing-machine kind of thing - put all your waste in, turn it on, wait for the sun to shine and then all the waste is gone but you also get something out that has a value."" Lesley Jones, chief executive of Keep Wales Tidy, saiddiscarded single-use PPE was becoming a huge environmental problem. Data provided to BBC Wales by the charity suggested its volunteers had encountered PPE items on 45% of litter picks since September. ""That litter contains plastic which gets into our rivers and our marine environment, and the little strings that are on masks can cause real damage to birds and small wildlife like hedgehogs,"" Ms Jones said. ""There's also the danger to health for the people who are picking them up. ""Our message would be obviously please, please take your litter home with you or put it in a bin, but also to think really seriously about purchasing reusable masks as that is so much better for the environment."" The research builds on the team's previous work on generating hydrogen from waste plastics - a technique calledphotoreforming,external. It involves using a photocatalyst - a material which absorbs light and can covert it into energy to promote chemical reactions - in this instance the breakdown of plastic waste and the conversion of water into hydrogen. The research is at an early stage, but has received a Welsh Government grant It also generates what are known as reactive oxygen species which can kill off germs. The Swansea team, working with scientists in India, will help examine the photocatalysts' antiviral activity against different pathogens, including the virus that causes Covid-19. The Welsh Government has awarded Â£47,000 of grant funding to support the project.

"The planets often cross paths on their journey around the Sun, but this conjunction is unusual Jupiter and Saturn have crossed paths in the night sky, appearing to the naked eye as a ""double planet"". The timing of this conjunction, as the celestial event is known, has caused some to suggest it may have been the source of a bright light in the sky 2,000 years ago. That became known as the Star of Bethlehem. The planets have been moving closer together each night and reached their closest point on 21 December. Keen stargazers in the UK have been keeping a close eye on the weather to avoid an astronomical disappointment. ""Any evening it's clear, it's worth grabbing a chance, because the weather doesn't look great,"" Dr Carolin Crawford from the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy told the BBC. The spectacle was captured around the world on Monday, including this image in southern Spain The moon, Saturn and Jupiter formed a triangle over New York City There is a theory that the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn might be the ""Star of Wonder"" Given a gap in the winter gloom, both planets would have appeared in the southwest sky, just above the horizon, shortly after sunset. With binoculars, Jupiter's moons can also be seen; this image was captured in Nairobi by Lennox Fevre Some astronomers and theologians think so. As Prof Eric M Vanden Eykel, a professor of religion from Ferrum College in Virginia,pointed out in an online article,externalthe timing hasÂ led to a lot of speculation ""about whether this could be the same astronomical event that the Bible reports led the wise men to Joseph, Mary and the newly born Jesus"".

The theory that the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn might be the ""Star of Wonder"" was proposed in the early 17th Century byÂ Johannes Kepler, a German astronomer and mathematician. ""2,000 years ago, people were a lot more aware of what was happening in the night sky,"" said Dr Crawford, ""[so] it's not impossible that the Star of Bethlehem was a planetary alignment like this"".

The two planets - the largest in the Solar System and some of the brightest objects visible in the night sky - have not been this close to each other in a dark sky for 800 years. Because of the timing of the planets setting in the southwest, Prof O'Brien said it had been necessary for stargazers to get out and observe the event as soon as the sky went dark.

"Sinn FÃ©in has called for an all-Ireland-Great Britain travel ban to help stop the spread of Covid-19. In a late-night vote on Monday, the SDLP also backed the move but Alliance, the DUP and UUP voted against. The executive unanimously backed plans to issue new guidance against all but essential travel between Northern Ireland, GB and the Irish Republic. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was in a ""dangerous position"". Calling for all-island co-operation, she said: ""I encourage the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) to work with us and get to the point where the whole island is shut down to inbound travellers."" ""We are the outlier - over 40 countries have decided to bring in a travel ban and here one part of the island is shut down and one is not - we are in a dangerous position."" First Minister Arlene Foster did not support a full ban on travel, but urged people to show restraint in their travel, adding that a new more infectious variant of coronavirus ""necessitated changes to our approach"". ""Our science advisers believe that this variant is already in the Republic of Ireland, as well as London, the south east of England and across Europe,"" said the DUP leader. ""People should only travel outside Northern Ireland if essential."" How Northern Ireland's new restrictions affect you NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered Some 40 countries, including the Republic, havebanned UK arrivals due to concerns about the new variant. A further 16 coronavirus-related deaths were recorded in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, bringing the total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health to 1,219. There were also a further 439 cases of Covid-19 diagnosed. There are 447 people with Covid-19 in hospital. Thirty are in intensive care, with 23 on ventilators. On Sunday, the executive agreed so-calledChristmas bubbles should be limited to one day. The move followed action in England, Scotland and Wales on Saturday, cutting the previously agreed five days to just one. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Ministers argue for and against NI travel ban At Tuesday's health committee meeting, Health Minister Robin Swan told Stormont's health committee the onus to ensure safety fell on those organising and delivering tests such as the transfer test for school children. Responding to a question from People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll, Mr Swann said: ""If anybody is using a school facility or if a school is facilitating testing in regards to the transfer test it's up the school, the board of governors and those organising and delivering the test to make sure they meet all current regulations. ""The Minister of Education has the responsibility for schools and the delivery of the education programme - we can provide information and guidance and we do and how that is implemented is up through his department, the Education Authority and through schools."" A paper brought by Mr Swann to the executive said a travel ban could have ""serious adverse implications"" for the financial viability of aircraft and ferry routes. The document, seen by BBC News NI, also said that if the new variant of coronavirus was present in Northern Ireland, the benefit of restricting travel would be ""somewhat reduced"". Although it was believed to be present, this had not yet been confirmed, the paper added. However, Mrs O'Neill said this argument was ""like saying if the tap is running let it overflow and flood the bathroom"". Sinn FÃ©in proposed taking the matter to a vote late on Monday, but it fell by a simple majority. In Monday's emergency meeting, the executive supported advice from Mr Swann that people arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland should self-isolate for 10 days. The medical advice to the executive was that the ""relative risk"" for travellers from GB having Covid-19 is less than 1 in 100, and ""significantly less"" for the new variant. It says there would be ""merit in limiting travel"" if the variant was not present in NI, but in its absence a precautionary approach is advised including possible limiting of travel from the Republic of Ireland, given the ""current disease trajectory"" there. Mr Swann's paper also called for exploring the use of ""locator forms"" for travellers arriving in NI. After the meeting, the health minister tweeted that he was pleased the executive had agreed his paper. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There was so much division around the executive table on this issue that last night's decision didn't come until shortly before midnight. While Sinn FÃ©in wanted an immediate travel ban, what we got was a compromise - with ministers unanimously agreeing to terms on travel guidance. Robin Swann set out his view that it could have some serious implications for the financial viability of air and ferry routes and costs for supply chains that ministers did not have detail about last night. The point was also made that if this new variation is present that the benefit of restricting travel would be somewhat reduced. So it may not be as simple to just impose a ban in law. However, things have been left slightly ajar and the issue may well crop up today when Robin Swann appears before the health committee. When you listen to those who have chosen not to come home, you get the sense that people would like to hear more clearly and effectively from Stormont. While the guidance may be welcomed for some, for others it simply does not go far enough. Meanwhile, Brian Ambrose, chief executive of George Best Belfast City Airport told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster on Tuesday that the airport would normally handle about 10,000 passengers every day in the Christmas period. That number has fallen to between 1,000 and 2,000 passengers. Mr Ambrose said January would be a very quiet month for the airport It is too early to see the impact of the latest government decisions, he said, but pointed out that government guidance was clear on non-essential travel. ""It has been our experience for most of this year that the majority of our customers have not been travelling. I don't think we have spent a dollar this year to promote air travel. We have simply facilitated those who need to get from A to B,"" said Mr Ambrose. ""Our assumption before last night was that January is going to be a very very quiet month and that we will be facilitating essential travel only.""

"This video can not be played Covid patients speak of their frightening experiences at people not following lockdown rules Staff at one of Wales' biggest hospitals said the emergency department had at times not been a safe place due to a sudden increase in coronavirus patients. Andrew McNab, a consultant at Morriston Hospital's A&E, said staff were ""relieved"" new restrictions had come into force over Christmas. There has been an increase in younger patients spending ""months"" in hospital. This has caused bed shortages, Mr McNab said. ""We know just looking at the patients coming through the doors and the way the curve is going that actually we were going to be overwhelmed. ""We were having days here, maybe four out of the last 10, when we felt the department was no longer a safe place to be looking after people, but there was nowhere else to look after them."" NHS in Wales 'stretched to limit' by Covid New coronavirus variant 'in every part of Wales' Queues ahead of last-minute lockdown He warned that the standard of care would suffer should the pressure continue to mount. ""We don't like to drop the standard of care but ultimately when you're having to make decisions about who can fit in and who can't, people wait longer than they would do and sometimes the care they get isn't as good as you would like to give."" Mr McNab warned the impact of the virus on staff was also taking its toll. ""We've got colleagues who had Covid in the first wave who are still not back to normal, and people who've had it early in the second wave who still haven't come back to work because they can't walk more than 15 yards because they're short of breath."" Dr Keith Reid, the director of public health for the hospital's health board, warned: ""The virus is running rampant in all communities in the Swansea Bay region. ""That is why we welcomed the move to tier four restrictions on Saturday. ""It's that kind of population-level approach that is going to have the biggest impact, reducing it, getting people to keep themselves to themselves, and that is what will interrupt the transmission of the disease."" Margaret Powell, from Townhill, who is being treated on one of the hospital's Covid wards, said she had ""never been so ill"". ""I can't get any rest,"" she told BBC Wales between coughs. ""I just wish to God sometimes I was just dying, but no, I will fight it, I will. ""I just wish all these fools and idiots would stop going around, just wear their masks, cover themselves up, put visors on whatever they want, anything. ""Cover themselves from head to toe if they've got to."" Leighton Smith, 72, from Gorseinon, said he had been ill for a while before his family found him collapsed 10 days ago, shaking and aching. ""I was feeling very, very, very bad. Very scared. I've never been so scared in all my life. Leighton Smith says having Covid-19 has made him realise what is important ""Gradually now I've got stronger and stronger and I'm off oxygen, feeling stronger all the time. I'm still quite emotional. It's frightening to me. ""It's made me realise how important life is and how important your family is, and to be safe, and keep away and not to do anything stupid, it's just not worth it. There'll always be Christmas again next year."" Mr Smith was supportive of the government's change to the plans for Christmas mixing with other households. ""I wish they'd done it sooner to be honest, you can't mess around with things like this. ""You've got to give up a little bit now to have a longer and better future."" Eleri D'Arcy says even younger people are ""knocked for six"" by the virus Eleri D'Arcy, who works as an occupational therapist in the intensive care unit, said she was taken aback by how young some patients are. ""We're not talking about little, old, frail people here, we're talking about people in their 40s and 50s who were previously completely independent. Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, it's knocked them for six. ""Even for the fittest people that haven't had bouts of Covid strong enough to warrant an ICU stay, members of my team who have had Covid who didn't even have a hospital admission are still recovering weeks and months later, and that's affecting their work and obviously it's affecting the entire workforce then as well. ""The intensity of rehab required to get people back to some level of function has been really quite astounding."" Ms D'Arcy said the pandemic was having a significant effect on staff morale too. ""People are tired from a personal perspective and through work. It's relentless. ""There is only so far people can go and this has been a really long year, and when you see people just flouting the rules and having parties and seemingly not having any grip on the reality of the situation, it's upsetting, it's frustrating.""

"Scientists are urgently investigating hints the new variant of coronavirus spreads more easily in children. If proven, this could account for ""a significant proportion"" of the increase in transmission, they say. The claim comes from members of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats advisory group (Nervtag). On Monday, Boris Johnson said he wanted to open schools in January ""if we possibly can"". There are no suggestions the new form of the virus is a greater threat to children's health. What do we know? How worried should we be? The Oxford vaccine story Children almost universally shrug off the virus, but the variant could alter the role they, and schools, play in spreading the virus. Earlier strains of coronavirus found it harder to infect children than adults. One explanation is children have fewer of the doorways (the ACE2 receptor) the virus uses to enter our body's cells. A recent study of infections in schools in Englandfound that levels of the virus in school-age children reflected levels in the local community, suggesting that closing schools would only have a temporary effect. Prof Wendy Barclay, from Nervtag and Imperial College London, said the mutations to the virus appeared to be making it easier to walk through the doorways that were there. She said this could be putting children on a ""more level playing field"" with adults as the virus was ""less inhibited"" in children. Prof Barclay said: ""Therefore children are equally susceptible, perhaps, to this virus as adults, and therefore given their mixing patterns, you would expect to see more children being infected."" Work to understand the new variant is taking place at lightning speed and there is still much uncertainty. It is now thought the new variant spreads 50% to 70% faster than other forms of the virus. Early analysis of how and where it is spreading have also given ""hints that it has a higher propensity to infect children"", according to Prof Neil Ferguson from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, who also sits on Nervtag. He stressed the link was still being investigated and was not yet proven. ""If it were true, then this might explain a significant proportion, maybe even the majority, of the transmission increase seen,"" he added. But Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health, from the University of Liverpool, told the BBC there wasn't any evidence ""at the moment"" that the new variant is able to infect children more efficiently. He said this would be looked at closely by scientists over Christmas. Scientists involved in COG-UK, the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, which detected the rapid increase in the variant, said they were not aware of any increased incidence in children. The data are continuing to be analysed, but it is thought the variant continued spreading even during the lockdown in November. The R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - for this variant during the tight restrictions has been estimated at 1.2, which meant cases were increasing. At the same time the R number was 0.8 for the other forms of the virus during lockdown and they were in decline. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Prof Ferguson said he expected the number of infections to fall as schools closed and people hunkered down for Christmas. He added: ""The real question then is - how much are we able to relax measures in the new year, and still retain control?"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We want, if we possibly can, to get schools back in a staggered way at the beginning of January, in the way that we have set out. ""But obviously the common sensical thing to do is to follow the path of the epidemic and, as we showed last Saturday, to keep things under constant review.""

"Further restrictions are likely to be needed in more areas of England to control a new variant of Covid-19, the UK's chief scientific adviser has said. Sir Patrick Vallance said measures could ""need to be increased in some places, in due course, not reduced"". London and large swathes of south-east England wereplaced in the highest tier four restrictions over the weekend. Sir Patrick predicted there would be spike in cases after an ""inevitable period of mixing"" over Christmas. It comes as more than 40 countries including France, Spain, India and Hong Kong havebanned UK flights because of concernsabout the spread of the variant. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Sir Patrick said he believed the variant would help cases ""spread more"". Asked why tougher measures were not in place across the country following the introduction of the tier four level, Sir Patrick added: ""The evidence on this virus is that it spreads easily. It's more transmissible. We absolutely need to make sure we have the right level of restrictions in place."" But he said there was no reason to think the new variant is more dangerous than the existing strain. ""The transmission is increased. We can't say exactly by how much, but it is clearly substantially increased, so it is more transmissible. ""Which is why we see it growing so fast and spreading to so many areas."" What is tier four and who is in it? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live New coronavirus variant: What do we know? More than 40 countries ban UK arrivals over Covid The government scrapped plans to relax rules at Christmas in the areas put under tier four rules.  Some 17 million people in England and Wales affected are being told to stay at home, while non-essential shops and businesses have to close. But in other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas mixing is being allowed on 25 December. Sir Patrick said the tier four rules were ""important"" Sir Patrick Vallance said the variant of the virus had to be taken ""incredibly seriously"". He said: ""It's really important to follow the rules carefully and make an assumption that you could be infectious. ""You could be the person spreading it to somebody else, and [you should] behave accordingly."" He added: ""The doubling time of this infection with a new variant is quite fast, it is more transmissible, it does require more action in order to keep it down and that's why tier four is important."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The latest figures released on Monday reveal that another 33,364 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus. There were also a further 215 deaths within 28 days of testing positive, bringing the UK total to 67,616. France has also shut its border with the UK for 48 hours, causing delays to lorries carrying freight across the Channel, but Boris Johnson told the briefing both sides wanted to resolve ""these problems as fast as possible"". The prime minister said he had an ""excellent"" call with French President Emmanuel Macron and ""both understand each other's positions"". He added the delays only affected a very small percentage of food entering the UK and supermarket supply chains were ""strong and robust"". There is no evidence to suggest this new variant is causing more serious disease or will hamper the effectiveness of the vaccine. But there is now a high degree of confidence that it is leading to faster transmission. With hospitals already under huge pressure - the number of patients will soon pass the spring peak on the current trajectory - it seems only a matter of time before more areas will be placed into tier 4, which is essentially a lockdown. Questions are also being asked about schools. The prime minister could only say he wanted to keep them open ""if we possibly can"". The race to vaccinate the most vulnerable, which will have a huge impact on reducing deaths and relieving pressure on the NHS, just got more pressing. Around 500,000 people have got their first dose in the past two weeks. But there are 12 million over 65s. More vaccination centres and approval of the Oxford University vaccine, of which there are already millions of doses in the country ready to go, is essential.

"This video can not be played 1,500 lorries stuck in Kent as France remains closed More than 2,850 lorries are stuck in Kent waiting to leave the UK, the county council has said, as politicians thrash out a plan to reopen France's border to trade and travel. France shut its UK border for 48 hours on Sunday amid fears of a new coronavirus variant. Any solution would probably include testing for lorry drivers, BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said. Meanwhile, the EU Commission hasurged countries to drop their travel bans. More than 50 countries have banned UK arrivals following widespread concern about the spread of the new variant. Ina recommendation to all member states,,externalthe commission said flight and train bans should be discontinued to avoid supply chain disruption. People should be allowed to travel to their country of residence, provided they take a Covid-19 test or self-isolate, it said. But the commission added that non-essential travel should still be discouraged. 'We are tired, we are disappointed, we are scared' Life on the road for truckers amid ports chaos New variant could be circulating outside UK Currently, no lorries are leaving the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel to France. The leader of Kent County Council, Roger Gough, told the BBC that 2,220 vehicles were at the temporary lorry park at Manston, while 632 were still being held on the M20. It comes as Tesco said it would bereintroducing temporary purchasing limits on some essential products, including toilet rolls, eggs, rice and hand wash. A further 36,804 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus and there were 691 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to Tuesday's government figures,external. It is the largest daily number of cases recorded yet, though it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring when testing was much more limited. Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast discussions were under way between the UK and France ""to find a resolution"" to the Channel disruption, with an update on the situation expected later. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke on Monday and, according to the BBC's Hugh Schofield, a solution to the blockage will probably include compulsory negative Covid tests for lorry drivers coming into France from the UK. Any plans agreed between the leaders would come into effect on Wednesday, France's Europe minister, ClÃ©ment Beaune, said. Ms Patel said potentially testing lorry drivers at ports was ""part of the discussions"", adding that setting up testing for this could ""happen relatively quickly"". This video can not be played 'Operation Brock' in place for lorry drivers EU member states are understood to be pressing for UK arrivals to be tested for the virus before entering their countries. Bosses at Eurotunnel estimate that up to 2,500 freight vehicles are expected to arrive in the UK on Tuesday, and the same again on Wednesday. The port of Harwich in Essex - which is about 130 miles from Dover by road - is also seeing a build up of lorries as drivers divert from Dover, a spokesman for the port said. The port of Felixstowe in Suffolk is also busy but there are no queues. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Ports chaos 'bad for trust and post-Brexit trade' How could mass testing be used? The British Retail Consortium said trucks needed to be able to start travelling again in the next 24 hours to ""avoid seeing problems on our shelves"". Andrew Opie, its director of food and sustainability, told the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee: ""What we've been told by members is that unless those trucks can start travelling again and go back to Spain and Portugal and other parts of Europe, we will have problems with fresh produce from 27 December."" Labour's Rachel Reeves told BBC Breakfast the government had ""wasted the last 24 hours"" and called for ""testing in place so we can reopen the border"". In other developments: The company behind the Covid-19 vaccine being given to people in the UK says it is ""highly likely"" it willprotect people against the new variantof the virus Northern Ireland's Executivevotes against introducing a travel ban between Northern Irelandand England, Scotland and Wales Royal Mail said it had temporarily suspended all mail services to Europe, with the exception of the Republic of Ireland, due to travel restrictions Thenumber of excess deaths in the UKsince the start of the pandemic has passed 81,000 Army soldiershave been drafted into drive ambulances in Wales The border disruption has also affected passenger services - with many air, rail and sea services cancelled between the UK and France, as well as other countries. Eurotunnel said it hoped passengers would be able to travel between the UK and France from Wednesday or Thursday, if a solution was agreed. British Airways said it would operate ""a reduced and dynamic schedule"" amid the uncertainty. Live updates from Kent Impact of new variant on children investigated The Channel is a vital trade route, with about 10,000 lorries a day travelling between Dover and Calais at Christmas, largely bringing in the freshest produce. Shane Brennan, the head of the Cold Chain Federation which represents the UK's temperature-controlled transport industry, said the number of vehicles stuck was worse than the government figures suggested, as lorries were ""dispersed around southern England"". Ms Patel said the numbers do ""fluctuate"", and added there were welfare facilities and support available for hauliers at Manston Airport. Queues on the M20 in Kent aren't exactly unheard of, but the French decision to close the border is dramatic and has caused a lot of disruption. Politicians on both sides of the Channel are hopeful they might be able to agree a way of getting things moving again before the end of the year. But if that requires a massive expansion of testing for coronavirus at the border, that's easy to say, far harder to do.

Some parts of England, as well as Wales,have asked people who travelfrom tier four areas to self-isolate.

"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals.

"PSNI officers issued 68 fines under Covid-19 regulations at Black Lives Protests in June Chief Constable Simon Byrne has apologised after the Police Ombudsman found justification in claims the handling of the Black Lives Matter protests was unfair and discriminatory. A report by Police Ombudsman Marie Anderson stated it was ""not intentional and not based on race or ethnicity"". However, confidence in policing among some in minority communities has been ""severely damaged"". Mr Byrne said: ""The time is right to show some humility and say sorry."" Mrs Anderson launched an investigation after complaints aboutpolice actions on 6 June, when about 70 fines were handed out at demonstrations in Belfast and Londonderry. Chief constable Simon Byrne has apologised after the policing of the Black Lives Matter protests In contrast, no Â£60 fixed penalty notices were issued at a Protect our Monuments rally in Belfast on 13 June - those attending included loyalists and military veterans. Mrs Anderson said police had ""failed to fully understand"" the human rights of those at the Black Lives Matter (BLM) events to be able to protest peacefully. Her report found officers had not engaged in any harassment as some had claimed. ""The differential treatment by PSNI of protesters on 6 June when compared with those attending Protect Our Monuments on 13 June gave rise to claims of unfairness and discrimination against those persons who organised and attended the 'Black Lives Matters' protests,"" the report stated. ""These concerns are in my view cogent, have substance and are justified in the circumstances. ""I believe that this unfairness was not intentional.  Neither was it based on race or ethnicity of those who attended the event."" On the issue of fines and prosecutions, the ombudsman said they should be reviewed. ""A number of fines issued at the Guildhall Square and Custom House Square have now been paid by the recipients. ""My investigation has established that many of these contain inconsistencies and errors and therefore their validity is questionable."" Parts of her report echoed one from the Policing Boardpublished in November, which questioned whether the PSNI approach had been unlawful. The PSNI has already announced it is establishing a task force to help rebuild relations with black, Asian and ethnic minority groups. In a statement, Mr Byrne said: ""We tried our best to respect the public health requirements of the Northern Ireland Executive to save lives and at the same time deal with public outcry triggered by this awful death [of George Floyd]. ""We operated within the legal framework available to us at the time, but the ombudsman is clear that whilst unintentional, we got that balance procedurally wrong."" He added: ""It is clear to me that some members of the Black and Minority Ethnic Community have been frustrated, angry and upset by our policing response and our relationship with them has suffered. ""For that I am sorry, and I am determined in that regard to put things right."" Patrick Corrigan, from Amnesty International, said the report was ""deeply critical"". He called for a ""fundamental reassessment"" of how the PSNI approaches the right to protest and the police's relationship with black and minority ethnic communities.
