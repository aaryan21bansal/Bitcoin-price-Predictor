"Toni & Guy opened their first salon in Clapham during the 1960s The co-founder of the hairdresser chain Toni & Guy - Giuseppe ""Toni"" Mascolo - has died at the age of 75. Mr Mascolo and his brother, Gaetano 'Guy' Mascolo, opened their first  salon in south London in 1963. Offering an ""Italian style"" hairdressing service, the unisex salon grew into an international brand and staple of the British high street. Mr Mascolo, who was the chief executive of the firm, died on Sunday surrounded by his family. The Mascolo family were Italian immigrants who arrived in England in the 1950s They settled in Clapham, south London, where the brothers opened their first salon. Hairdressing ran in the family and Mr Mascolo senior - a celebrated hairdresser in his own right - taught all four of his sons to cut hair from a young age. Founded during the ""swinging sixties"", Toni and Guy offered a unisex service that appealed to both men and women, in contrast to traditional barber shops and woman-only hair salons. Celebrities such as composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, and singer Dusty Springfield were among the famous faces who frequented the salon. The firm opened its first central London salon in London's West End in 1973. Shortly afterwards two more Mascolo brothers, Bruno and Anthony, helped propel the family business into an international brand. Since then Toni & Guy has grown to comprise two global, franchised hair salon groups, with 475 shops in 48 countries. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Alana Spencer toasts her Apprentice victory with Lord Sugar in December last year Apprentice winner Alana Spencer's cake company has had to recall almost all of its range because of health risks. Food Standards Agency investigators said Ridiculously Rich by Alana inaccurately labelled its products. Some allergens were not listed and others were ""not correctly declared"", the agency said. A spokesman for the Aberystwyth company insisted only products sold online - less than 10% of its business - had been inaccurately labelled. But theFSA's advice to the public,externaldoes not distinguish between products the company sells online or through retail and wholesale outlets. It warned that people with an allergy to soya, egg, peanuts, wheat, barley, oats or sulphites were at risk. Alana Spencer on her Ceredigion roots How long can The Apprentice keep running? The apps which could help those with allergies The FSA identifies inaccurate labelling on seven of the eight cakes and bars currently advertised for sale on the Ridiculously Rich by Alana's website. The one product not highlighted as a risk by the FSA - spiced apple flapjack - is sold in mixed boxes with brandy butter brownies, which are on the list. The warning only applies to products made before 1 December this year. The company's spokesman said it had now corrected its labelling and contacted everyone who had bought its products to invite them to return their purchases free of charge for a replacement or refund. No-one has yet returned any products, the spokesman said. He declined to disclose the number of items sold with inaccurate labels. Coeliac UK put out an allergy warning on twitter On its website, the FSA listed the products with inaccurate labelling and advised customers: ""If you have bought any of the above products and have allergies to soya, peanuts, nuts, eggs and/or an allergy or intolerance to wheat, barley, oats (gluten), milk and/or a sensitivity to sulphites do not eat it. Instead return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund."" An FSA spokesman said it was working with the company and Ceredigion council ""to ensure that clear allergen information is available to consumers who may have purchased products with inaccurate or insufficient information."" Ms Spencer was unavailable for comment, her company's spokesman said, as she was ""filming"". The spokesman added: ""Lord Sugar was made aware of the situation immediately. ""He's spoken to Alana and is satisfied she has put the right measures in place to avoid a situation like this again."" Lord Sugar was made aware of the problem ""immediately"" Ms Spencer, 25, shot to fame last year when she won BBC television's The Apprentice. Her victory in the 12th series of the show secured her a Â£250,000 investment and a 50/50 business partnership with Lord Sugar.

"Artwork: Observations of 'Oumuamua noted its unusual elongated shape A project searching for intelligent life in the cosmos is going to check the first known interstellar asteroid for signs of alien technology. The odd-shaped object was detected as it sped towards the Sun on 19 October. Its properties suggested it originated around another star, making it the first such body to be spotted in our cosmic neighbourhood. An initiative backed by billionaire Yuri Milner will use a radio telescope to listen for signals from it. The team's efforts will begin on Wednesday, with astronomers observing the asteroid, which is currently speeding away from our Solar System, across four different radio frequency bands. The first set of observations at theRobert C Byrd Green Bank Telescope,externalin West Virginia is due to last for 10 hours. Interstellar visitor given a name Bizarre shape of interstellar asteroid Previous observations of the object, called 'Oumuamua, have noted its strange, elongated shape, making it look a bit like a cigar. The object's velocity and eccentric trajectory suggests it originated outside our Solar System Mr Milner'sBreakthrough Listen programme,externalreleased a statement which read: ""Researchers working on long-distance space transportation have previously suggested that a cigar or needle shape is the most likely architecture for an interstellar spacecraft, since this would minimise friction and damage from interstellar gas and dust."" Andrew Siemion, director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center, who is part of the initiative, said: ""'Oumuamua's presence within our Solar System affords Breakthrough Listen an opportunity to reach unprecedented sensitivities to possible artificial transmitters and demonstrate our ability to track nearby, fast-moving objects."" Daredevil climber dies in China fall Huntingtonâs breakthrough may stop disease American who defected to North Korea dies He added: ""Whether this object turns out to be artificial or natural, it's a great target for Listen."" Prof Andrew Coates, fromUCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory,externalin Dorking, who is not involved with Breakthrough Listen, told BBC Surrey radio: ""I believe there is an experiment being done to actually listen to this object to see if there are any potential signs of life on it. The observations will be carried out using the Robert C Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, US ""I think this is most unlikely because it's left over from the beginning of that planetary system elsewhere. Much better ways of looking for life are actually missions like our ExoMars project, which is going to be going to Mars in 2020, drilling underneath the surface to look for signs of life. We're building the camera system for that."" He added: ""But as this thing is passing through very quickly, why not have a listen just in case. But I think it's most unlikely."" Other researchers who have carried out observations of the asteroid with ground telescopes say that, apart from its shape, it closely resembles natural objects found in the outer parts of our Solar System. It has a reddish colour, which is often indicative of organic compounds that have been irradiated by cosmic rays. Measurements suggest it has a dense structure and is comprised of rock and metal, but with little - if any - water-ice. Although 'Oumuamua formed around another star, scientists think it could have been wandering through the Milky Way, unattached to any star system, for hundreds of millions of years before its chance encounter with our Solar System. The asteroid's name, 'Oumuamua, means ""a messenger from afar arriving first"" in Hawaiian.

"A row has broken out over advice given to police in England and Wales telling them not to stop and search people only because they smell of cannabis. It was first given to police last year and was reiterated by an Inspectorate of Constabulary report on Tuesday. The advice says officers should look at other factors like behaviour as well. But some officers, including the chief constable of Merseyside Police, said they disagreed. The College of Policing said it plans to review the guidance. Police officers can use stop-and-search powers if they have ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect someone is carrying items such as drugs, weapons or stolen property. Last year, they were given new guidance by the College of Policing that the smell of cannabis on its own would not normally justify stopping and searching someone or their vehicle. Stop-and-search ethnic disparity 'troubling' BBC reporter: 'Police used stop-and-search on me' Reality Check: Are fewer black people being stopped and searched? But the Inspectorate of Constabulary said many officers were unaware of the guidance and it is now urging forces to encourage officers to not rely on a smell alone. However, Chief Constable Andy Cooke, of Merseyside Police, said he would not be giving that advice to his teams. He tweeted:,external""I disagree. The guidance in my view is wrong and the law does not preclude it. ""Smell of cannabis is sufficient to stop search and I will continue to encourage my officers to use it particularly on those criminals who are engaged in serious and organised crime."" Matt Locke, of Northumbria Police, described the guidance as ""inconsistent"", adding that it was ""a bit of a dog's dinner"". Allow Twitter content?

Another police officer, from North Yorkshire Police,tweeted:,external""If I smell cannabis on someone or coming from a vehicle then I'll conduct a search.

Mike Cunningham, HM Inspector of Constabulary,responded to questions on social media about the guidance,externalby saying the smell of cannabis ""can be reasonable grounds"" to search but it will be ""for the officer to explain"". He added that the advice ""encourages multiple grounds"" to merit a stop and search. The row came after the Inspectorate of Constabulary analysed more than 8,500 stop and search records and found almost 600 were conducted solely because police could smell cannabis. Searches based on other grounds, such as the suspect's behaviour, result in more arrests, the report said. At the heart of this row is an important question: are too many people being needlessly stopped and searched for drugs? The Inspectorate report drops a heavy hint that they are. It says police carried out 3,698 searches, 43% of the sample, because officers believed a suspect had drugs on them for their own use, even though drug possession offences may not be ""priority crimes"". The watchdog is concerned about this, firstly, because drug possession searches are not necessarily the best use of police time; and secondly, because they appear to affect ethnic minority groups disproportionately. That's one of the key reasons why the Inspectorate has reinforced the College of Policing guidance on stop and searches, including the advice about smelling cannabis - even though it's caused a stink.

The report said it was ""troubling"" that black people were eight times more likely to be stopped than white people. At the same time, black people were less likely to have illegal substances found on them than white people. The National Police Chiefs' Council said it was looking at why young black men were disproportionately stopped. The NPCC said stop-and-search powers were important ""with rising knife and gun crime"", as well as being a deterrent for people considering carrying out acid attacks.

"Akayed Ullah emigrated to the US with his family in 2011 The man who faces terror charges over Monday's bus terminal bombing in New York posted a warning to President Donald Trump just before the attack. ""Trump you failed to protect your nation,"" it read. The post by Akayed Ullah was revealed in charges filed by federal prosecutors on Tuesday. They say the 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant carried out the bombing inspired by the Islamic State group. He wounded himself and three others in Monday morning's attack. Mr Ullah is accused of blowing up a crude device strapped to his body in an underpass at Manhattan's Port Authority Bus Terminal during the rush hour. The New York Police Department (NYPD) tweeted that he was facing state charges,externalincluding criminal possession of a weapon, supporting an act of terrorism and making a ""terroristic threat"". The federal charges, announced later on Tuesday, include providing material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, using a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a public place. Who is the attacker? According to the federal complaint filed by prosecutors, Mr Ullah said after his arrest: ""I did it for the Islamic State."" He also told investigators he had been motivated by American air strikes on IS target, the document says. This video can not be played Prosecutor Joon Kim: ""Ullah tried to maximise casualties"" The complaint says Mr Ullah used materials that included Christmas lights to make the device. It was affixed to his body with Velcro straps. A search of the suspect's home in the New York City borough of Brooklyn ""revealed metal pipes, pieces of wire and metal screws, which were consistent with the bomb materials recovered at the scene,"" prosecutor Joom Kim told reporters. He said the suspect ""admitted that he began researching how to build bombs about a year ago, and had been planning this particular attack for several weeks"". He selected the location and timing ""to maximise casualties"", Mr Kim added. This video can not be played The blast hit during New York's rush-hour - this is how events unfolded Mr Ullah emigrated to the US on a family visa in 2011 from the Chittagong area of Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi government says he had no criminal record in the country, which he last visited in September. The visit lasted about six weeks, his uncle told the Associated Press news agency. Mr Ullah's wife did not join him in the US. She and other family members are now being questioned to try to understand how he was radicalised. US President Donald Trump has said Monday's attack, which followeda terror attack in Manhattan in October that killed eight people, ""highlights the urgent need... to enact legislative reforms to protect the American people"". ""America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,"" Mr Trump added. How events unfolded.

"Campaigners are calling for a change in regulations after a Glasgow man was unable to become a commercial airline pilot because he is HIV positive. The man, who wants to remain anonymous, had been offered a place on an airline's training programme. But the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) refused him the medical certificate needed to gain a commercial licence. The CAA said European regulations prevented it granting the certificate to someone who was HIV positive. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it was considering a rule change. Anthony (not his real name) said it was ""utterly devastating"" to discover that he could not take up the position on the EasyJet pilot training scheme. He described the policy as ""outdated"" and ""inherently discriminatory"". HIV Scotland has called for a change in the rules. According to the CAA, which is responsible for aviation safety regulations in the UK, certain medical conditions prevent would-be pilots obtaining the necessary certificate. These include being HIV positive, organ transplantation or having type 1 diabetes. Pilots who already hold a commercial licence but later develop one of the conditions would still be able to operate. However, their licence would change and only allow them to fly with a co-pilot. This is known as an operational multi-crew limitation (OML) licence. Some flights are only possible with a pilot and a co-pilot, especially long haul and commercial flights. Under the current rules, student pilots have to perform solo flights during their training and are therefore not allowed to have a condition that qualifies them to only fly with a co-pilot. These rules are regulated by EASA and apply to Europe. The same restrictions do not apply in some countries, such as Canada. The CAA said the EASA had confirmed that people making an initial application for a commercial pilot licence must have an unrestricted medical certificate. A CAA spokesperson added: ""We support a rule change in this area, where it is safe to do so, and will continue to work with EASA and HIV experts to reassess this regulation, with a view to enabling applicants to obtain an initial Class 1 medical certificate."" The EASA said it was considering a change to the rules. In a statement, it said: ""A rule change takes time, it needs to be considered by experts, and we need to plan it and prioritized by performing impact assessment. ""However, EASA and the NAA (National Aviation Authority) medical experts agreed that a rule change should be considered due to the availability of new HIV medications. ""These medications could provide for a more flexible regulatory approach and allow the need for an OML restriction to be determined on a case-by-case basis, largely dependent on the stage of the HIV. ""In future, this would allow some prospective pilots having HIV to obtain a license without an OML restriction."" EasyJet said it was a matter for EASA and the CAA, but added: ""We welcome the CAA's support for a rule change where it is safe to do so."" Anthony's casewas first brought to light by Buzzfeed News,external. Anthony gained his private pilots licence aged 17, before he was able to drive. He has wanted to be a pilot since he was a child, and began flying when he was 15. He was diagnosed with HIV three years ago, and wrote to the CAA under a pseudonym to ask about the effect his diagnosis would have on his dream. Anthony said the CAA told him that he would be granted the medical certificate and could train, but that he would have to fly alongside a co-pilot. Earlier this year he passed all the assessments at EasyJet, and gained a place on their training programme. When Anthony was told his HIV would stop him becoming a pilot he was ""very confused"". He said the disappointment was worse because he believed there was ""no barrier if you're HIV positive to doing anything now that you wanted to do before"". ""I had started to accept the diagnosis because of that."" He said: ""In 2017, someone who is HIV positive and on successful treatment is medically no different to someone who isn't HIV positive.""

"Brandon and Lacie died in hospital A house fire which killed three children was a ""targeted attack"", police have said. Demi Pearson, 14, Brandon, eight, and Lacie, seven, died, while Lia, three, and mother Michelle, 35, remain in hospital. Ms Pearson's son, Kyle, and a friend both escaped from the home, in Salford, before fire crews arrived. Six people have now been arrested, after a 25-year-old man was held on suspicion of murder. This video can not be played ""Words cannot describe"" how a family feels after losing three children, police say. Michelle Pearson is in a serious condition in hospital Ch Supt Wayne Miller of Greater Manchester Police said detectives believe the attack was targeted after collecting CCTV from the area. ""We now have a much deeper understanding of the devastating events which lead to the tragic deaths,"" he said. Ch Supt Miller said relatives of the family have been left ""completely devastated"". ""The loss of a child in any circumstance is unthinkable, to lose three in such deplorable circumstances words cannot describe. ""My heart breaks for them, it really does. ""We're doing all that we can to get them the answers they quite rightly deserve.""

Officers visited the house in Jackson Street, Walkden, a few hours before the blaze, which happened at about 05:00 GMT on Monday. Police confirmed there had been previous incidents at the family's home.

"This video can not be played Against the odds: The story of baby Vanellope A baby born with her heart outside her body has survived after surgery at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester. Vanellope Hope Wilkins, who has no breastbone, was delivered three weeks ago by Caesarean section. She has had three operations to place her heart back in her chest. The condition, ectopia cordis, is extremely rare, with only a few cases per million births, of which most are stillborn. The hospital says it knows of no other case in the UK where the baby has survived. Huntington's breakthrough may stop disease Conjoined twins survive gruelling journey to separation Twins born at 23 weeks 'little miracles' Outlook for extremely premature babies 'improving' Her parents, Naomi Findlay, 31, and Dean Wilkins, 43, from Nottingham, say Vanellope is ""a real fighter"". Naomi said: ""It was a real shock when the ultrasound showed that her heart was outside her chest and scary because we didn't know what would happen."" The couple paid for a blood test which showed there were no chromosomal abnormalities and that made them determined to continue with the pregnancy. Dean added: ""We were advised to have a termination and that the chances of survival were next to none - no-one believed she was going to make it except us."" Naomi said having a termination was ""not something she could do"". ""To see, even at nine weeks, a heartbeat - no matter where it was. It was not something I was going to take away. ""In a way her strength gave me a strength to keep going,"" she added. Vanellope had been due on Christmas eve but was delivered by Caesarean section on 22 November in order to reduce the chances of infection and damage to the heart. There were around 50 medical staff present including obstetricians, heart surgeons, anaesthetists, neonatologists and midwives. Minutes after her birth, Vanellope's chest was covered with a sterile bag to keep her heart moist and reduce the risk of infection Within 50 minutes of birth, the baby was undergoing the first of three operations to put her heart back inside the body. In the most recent surgery, Vanellope's own skin was used to cover the hole in her chest. Naomi and Dean with Vanellope Frances Bu'Lock, consultant paediatric cardiologist, said: ""Before she was born things looked very bleak but now they are quite a lot better - Vanellope is doing really well and has proved very resilient. ""In the future we may be able to put in some internal bony protection for her heart - perhaps using 3D printing or something organic that would grow with her."" A handful of children in the United States have also survived this condition. Among them is Audrina Cardenas who was born in Texas in October 2012. She also had surgery to place her heart back inside her chest and was sent home after three months. Audrina was given a protective plastic shield to cover her chest. Glenfield Hospital says Vanellope still faces ""a long road ahead"" - the major risk being infection. This video can not be played Baby born with heart outside body goes home The next step is to take her off a ventilator, which is being used to aid her recovery from surgery. Dean Wilkins said: ""She defying everything - it's beyond a miracle."" The couple named Vanellope after a character in the Disney film ""Wreck-It Ralph"". Naomi said: ""Vanellope in the film is a real fighter and at the end turns into a princess so we thought it was fitting."" Rare heart defect baby goes home.

"Brandon and Lacie died in hospital A house fire which killed three children was a ""targeted attack"", police have said. Demi Pearson, 14, Brandon, eight, and Lacie, seven, died, while Lia, three, and mother Michelle, 35, remain in hospital. Ms Pearson's son, Kyle, and a friend both escaped from the home, in Salford, before fire crews arrived. Six people have now been arrested, after a 25-year-old man was held on suspicion of murder. This video can not be played ""Words cannot describe"" how a family feels after losing three children, police say. Michelle Pearson is in a serious condition in hospital Ch Supt Wayne Miller of Greater Manchester Police said detectives believe the attack was targeted after collecting CCTV from the area. ""We now have a much deeper understanding of the devastating events which lead to the tragic deaths,"" he said. Ch Supt Miller said relatives of the family have been left ""completely devastated"". ""The loss of a child in any circumstance is unthinkable, to lose three in such deplorable circumstances words cannot describe. ""My heart breaks for them, it really does. ""We're doing all that we can to get them the answers they quite rightly deserve."" Two men, aged 19 and 20, arrested on suspicion of murder have been released on bail, as has a 24-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Officers visited the house in Jackson Street, Walkden, a few hours before the blaze, which happened at about 05:00 GMT on Monday.

"The museum will show how fat is blocking London's Victorian infrastructure Part of one of the capital's biggest fatbergs is going to be put on display in the Museum of London next year. It is a slice of a monster fatberg, over 250m (820ft) long, which had been clogging up sewers below Whitechapel. The museum says it was a congealed concoction of ""fat, oil, grease, wet wipes and sanitary products"". The display will show how modern living and high levels of rubbish are putting pressure on the ""arteries"" of London's Victorian infrastructure. TheWhitechapel fatbergbecame something of a celebrity in its own right last autumn - with Thames Water fighting a nine-week battle against a ""rock hard"" blockage weighing 130 tonnes. This video can not be played Part of the fatberg was filmed by Thames Water engineers trying to remove the blockage The museum describes the fatberg's dimensions as being longer than Tower Bridge and as heavy as 11 double-decker buses. Curator Vyki Sparkes said it ""will be one of the most fascinating and disgusting objects we have ever had on display"". Why fatbergs matter? Victory declared over giant fatberg London fatberg fuelled by restaurants Thames Water's Stuart White says that part of its fascination is that it is the product of our own modern-day living, describing it as ""repulsively human"". There is an eco-friendly ending to what happened to the rest of the fatberg. It was chopped up and mostlyconverted into bio-diesel. Despite the name, fatbergs are actually mainly made up of wet wipes. They account for a startling 93% of the material blocking our sewers according to Water UK, the membership body for water providers. They collected samples to analyse from blockages in sewers, pumps and wastewater treatment works. Wet wipes - mostly baby wipes, but also those used to remove make up and clean surfaces - made up the vast majority of the material. Fat, oil and grease only made up 0.5%. The other 7% was made up of a range of other materials including feminine hygiene products, cotton pads and plastic wrappers. Toilet paper made up just 0.01% of the material blocking our pipes and sewers. Environmental charities including Greenpeace and the Marine Conservation Society say they are not surprised by this high number since wet wipes are often marketed as ""flushable"".

"Netflix has defended a tweet that revealed 53 people had watched its new Christmas film every day for 18 days in a row. ""Who hurt you?"" read the tweet, addressed to them. The tweet caused controversy, with some saying it was ""creepy"" of the platform to keep such close tabs on its audience, and mock their choices. However, others found it entertaining - and unsurprising that Netflix should know what its customers were viewing. In a statement, Netflix said the privacy of its members was important. ""This information represents overall viewing trends, not the personal viewing information of specific, identified individuals,"" said a representative. Allow Twitter content?

Netflix has been studying its user data closely for some time but doesn't often share it. When the platform first decided to start producing its own material,it mined its user data to see what the most popular content was among its existing customers. At that time it discovered that the most searched-for and viewed material included that which featured (now disgraced) actor Kevin Spacey, the director David Fincher and BBC political dramas - and that led to the re-make of the 1990 BBC political thriller House of Cards, involving the pair. ""Netflix, like any company these days, keeps a sharp eye on what its users like so that it can offer them more of what they like,"" said technology commentator Kate Bevan. ""What's a bit creepy, however, is extracting data points with no context and offering up data that should be anonymised in a way that could identify individuals."" Stranger Things gives Netflix its biggest day The visual effects secrets of The Crown Blue Planet II comes to iPlayer in 4K HDR Dr Bernie Hogan, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, accused Netflix of ""humblebragging"" by suggesting its Christmas movie was so compelling it was worth watching every day. ""It is in poor taste,"" he added. ""Some people have little children who love the comforting repetition of seeing the same movie every day. ""To wryly say 'who hurt you' as they did in the tweet shows not only that they are interested in making moral judgments for the sake of a laugh but also that they probably do not have much contact with young children. It sounds like a cheeky social media account operator who was too clever for their own good."" Music streaming service Spotify has been using data like this in its advertising since 2016.

"This video can not be played The latest BBC Weather forecast with Philip Avery Drivers and other travellers are facing difficult journeys as icy conditions persist across much of the UK. The Met Office has a yellow warning for ice,externaluntil Wednesday 11:00 GMT, with the worst affected areas likely to be Scotland and the north of England. A ""flash freeze"" caused disruption at Glasgow Airport, with some flights cancelled or diverted to other Scottish airports after the runway froze. Hundreds of schools were closed for a second day. Temperatures in central and southern England remained only a few degrees above freezing throughout Tuesday. The Met Office's warning covers Wales, parts of Scotland and much of England - including the Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, London, the South East, East, South West, the North East and North West. How cold is it where you are? Why does snow close so many schools? 'Flash freeze' hits Glasgow Airport flights Schools in Wales shut again as snow turns to ice It said the chance of ice was highest across parts of Scotland and northern England where rain might fall onto frozen surfaces. Those areas were also likely to see a few centimetres of fresh snow on high ground. ""There will probably be icy stretches on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths with some injuries possible from slips and falls,"" the Met Office added. At Glasgow Airport sub-zero temperatures and heavy rain caused a rapid formation of ice on the runway and taxiways as well as roads around the airport. As a result, seven flights were forced to land at Edinburgh and Prestwick airports and four flights to and from London City Airport were cancelled. Operations were suspended at Glasgow for 45 minutes. It is back in operation but travellers are being advised to contact their airline before leaving for the airport. Travel may be disrupted over coming days as rain meets freezing temperatures and turns to ice on roads and pavements, said BBC Weather's Darren Bett. There remains a risk of snow in Scotland overnight on Tuesday, with a risk of light showers over high ground in northern England. Winds will strengthen over the course of Wednesday and Thursday, but temperatures will be higher than in recent days. Edmund King, AA president, said the service had rescued more than 140 people from snow and ice by lunchtime. He urged other drivers to slow down and leave more space between vehicles, and warned that opportunist thieves were stealing cars left defrosting on driveways and by the roadside. ""Give yourself extra time and don't leave the car running unattended to warm up,"" he advised. More than 350 schools in the West Midlands, some 200 in Shropshire and more than 300 schools in Wales remained shut for a second day. On Monday, more than 1,000 schools were closed - about 600 of which were in Wales. More snow and ice is forecast for the north of England and Scotland Horses were put through their paces at Newmarket racecourse despite the low temperatures Boats on the frozen Shropshire Union Canal at Market Drayton were going nowhere An estimated 190 homes were still without a power supply supply in the West Midlands on Tuesday evening. Heathrow Airport in west London said the ""majority"" of departures and arrivals would run as scheduled but advised passengers to check before travelling because of bad weather in Europe. Train travellers faced delays on their homeward journeys, with Great Western Railway, Greater Anglia and London Northwestern Railway all reporting major delays into the evening rush hour. Some Arriva Trains Wales lines were not running on Tuesday evening and the company expects delays to last until the early hours of Wednesday. Allow Twitter content?

Eurotunnel also said services were running with delays, with four-hour waits for passengers departing from Calais and Folkestone. It recommended customers cancelled or changed their travel plans. P&O ferries across the Channel are delayed by up to three hours because of the weather. Travellers are being told to check in and will be put on the first available sailing.

"Alana Spencer toasts her Apprentice victory with Lord Sugar in December last year Apprentice winner Alana Spencer's cake company has had to recall almost all of its range because of health risks. Food Standards Agency investigators said Ridiculously Rich by Alana inaccurately labelled its products. Some allergens were not listed and others were ""not correctly declared"", the agency said. A spokesman for the Aberystwyth company insisted only products sold online - less than 10% of its business - had been inaccurately labelled. But theFSA's advice to the public,externaldoes not distinguish between products the company sells online or through retail and wholesale outlets. It warned that people with an allergy to soya, egg, peanuts, wheat, barley, oats or sulphites were at risk. Alana Spencer on her Ceredigion roots How long can The Apprentice keep running? The apps which could help those with allergies The FSA identifies inaccurate labelling on seven of the eight cakes and bars currently advertised for sale on the Ridiculously Rich by Alana's website. The one product not highlighted as a risk by the FSA - spiced apple flapjack - is sold in mixed boxes with brandy butter brownies, which are on the list. The warning only applies to products made before 1 December this year. The company's spokesman said it had now corrected its labelling and contacted everyone who had bought its products to invite them to return their purchases free of charge for a replacement or refund. No-one has yet returned any products, the spokesman said. He declined to disclose the number of items sold with inaccurate labels. Coeliac UK put out an allergy warning on twitter On its website, the FSA listed the products with inaccurate labelling and advised customers: ""If you have bought any of the above products and have allergies to soya, peanuts, nuts, eggs and/or an allergy or intolerance to wheat, barley, oats (gluten), milk and/or a sensitivity to sulphites do not eat it. Instead return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund."" An FSA spokesman said it was working with the company and Ceredigion council ""to ensure that clear allergen information is available to consumers who may have purchased products with inaccurate or insufficient information."" Ms Spencer was unavailable for comment, her company's spokesman said, as she was ""filming"". The spokesman added: ""Lord Sugar was made aware of the situation immediately.

"Donald Tusk said the EU needed to show ""unity"" in the next phase of talks The UK and the EU face a ""furious race against time"" to finalise Brexit talks before March 2019, the head of the European Council says. Donald Tusk urged EU leaders to show unity as they try to negotiate what the future relationship will look like and to set up transitional arrangements. The EU is set to agree this week that enough progress has been made so far to move on from the first phase of talks. The UK has been told not to ""backtrack"" on last week's divorce deal. The comment from EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier came after UK Brexit Secretary David Davis suggested the divorce agreement unveiled by Theresa May amounted to a ""statement of intent"" rather than a binding agreement. Mr Davis - the UK's Brexit secretary - said he was quoted out of context. But European Parliament negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said the ""unacceptable remarks"" would harm ""good faith"" in the process. Applying to stay in UK 'will take minutes' Gove: Brexit will work for animals Brexit: All you need to know The UK is set to leave the EU in March 2019, two years after Mrs May served formal notice of Brexit. Both sides hope to finalise a deal by October 2018 on the future relationship, including trade, so the UK and European Parliaments have time to vote on it before the UK leaves. In his formal letter on Tuesday inviting leaders to this week's EU summit, Mr Tusk told the 27 member states: ""This will be a furious race against time, where again our unity will be key."" On Sunday, Mr Davis said guarantees on the Northern Ireland border - included in a joint EU-UK report published on Friday - were not legally binding unless the two sides reached a final deal. But he told LBC Radio on Monday they would be honoured whatever happened. A European Commission spokesman said the first-phase deal on the Northern Ireland border, the divorce bill and citizens' rights did not strictly have the force of law. ""But we see the joint report of Michel Barnier and David Davis as a deal between gentlemen and it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government."" The Brexit secretary's comments at the weekend about the legality of what's been agreed so far between the UK and the EU have been widely noted in Brussels, and a handful of member states have brought them up with me. ""To say we are annoyed is putting it too strongly, though,"" said one diplomat. ""This is the sort of stuff we expected,"" said another. ""It's never good when someone questions an agreement 24 hours after it was done,"" a third official suggested. This forms the backdrop to the discussion taking place among EU ministers about the European Council's draft guidelines for Phase 2 of the Brexit talks. But it is not clear if it will lead to any changes to the draft text that will be discussed by leaders on Friday morning. The document already states in its first paragraph that progress in phase 2 of the talks is contingent on commitments from phase 1 being kept. Mr Verhofstadt has tabled two amendments for MEPs to debate on Wednesday, one of which says Mr Davis's comments risk undermining ""the good faith that has been built during the negotiations"". Another amendment calls on Britain to ""fully respect"" last week's Brexit deal and ensure it is ""fully translated"" into a draft Withdrawal Agreement.

And at a press conference in Brussels, he said the UK must ""stick to its commitments"" and put them into a draft Withdrawal Agreement ""as soon as possible"" if there is to be progress in the second phase of talks.

"This video can not be played The latest BBC Weather forecast with Philip Avery Drivers and other travellers are facing difficult journeys as icy conditions persist across much of the UK. The Met Office has a yellow warning for ice,externaluntil Wednesday 11:00 GMT, with the worst affected areas likely to be Scotland and the north of England. A ""flash freeze"" caused disruption at Glasgow Airport, with some flights cancelled or diverted to other Scottish airports after the runway froze. Hundreds of schools were closed for a second day. Temperatures in central and southern England remained only a few degrees above freezing throughout Tuesday. The Met Office's warning covers Wales, parts of Scotland and much of England - including the Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, London, the South East, East, South West, the North East and North West. How cold is it where you are? Why does snow close so many schools? 'Flash freeze' hits Glasgow Airport flights Schools in Wales shut again as snow turns to ice It said the chance of ice was highest across parts of Scotland and northern England where rain might fall onto frozen surfaces. Those areas were also likely to see a few centimetres of fresh snow on high ground. ""There will probably be icy stretches on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths with some injuries possible from slips and falls,"" the Met Office added. At Glasgow Airport sub-zero temperatures and heavy rain caused a rapid formation of ice on the runway and taxiways as well as roads around the airport. As a result, seven flights were forced to land at Edinburgh and Prestwick airports and four flights to and from London City Airport were cancelled. Operations were suspended at Glasgow for 45 minutes. It is back in operation but travellers are being advised to contact their airline before leaving for the airport. Travel may be disrupted over coming days as rain meets freezing temperatures and turns to ice on roads and pavements, said BBC Weather's Darren Bett. There remains a risk of snow in Scotland overnight on Tuesday, with a risk of light showers over high ground in northern England. Winds will strengthen over the course of Wednesday and Thursday, but temperatures will be higher than in recent days. Edmund King, AA president, said the service had rescued more than 140 people from snow and ice by lunchtime. He urged other drivers to slow down and leave more space between vehicles, and warned that opportunist thieves were stealing cars left defrosting on driveways and by the roadside. ""Give yourself extra time and don't leave the car running unattended to warm up,"" he advised. More than 350 schools in the West Midlands, some 200 in Shropshire and more than 300 schools in Wales remained shut for a second day. On Monday, more than 1,000 schools were closed - about 600 of which were in Wales. More snow and ice is forecast for the north of England and Scotland Horses were put through their paces at Newmarket racecourse despite the low temperatures Boats on the frozen Shropshire Union Canal at Market Drayton were going nowhere An estimated 190 homes were still without a power supply supply in the West Midlands on Tuesday evening. Heathrow Airport in west London said the ""majority"" of departures and arrivals would run as scheduled but advised passengers to check before travelling because of bad weather in Europe. Train travellers faced delays on their homeward journeys, with Great Western Railway, Greater Anglia and London Northwestern Railway all reporting major delays into the evening rush hour. Some Arriva Trains Wales lines were not running on Tuesday evening and the company expects delays to last until the early hours of Wednesday. Allow Twitter content?

Eurotunnel also said services were running with delays, with four-hour waits for passengers departing from Calais and Folkestone. It recommended customers cancelled or changed their travel plans. P&O ferries across the Channel are delayed by up to three hours because of the weather. Travellers are being told to check in and will be put on the first available sailing. The TUC called on employers not to force staff to make dangerous journeys ""for the sake of presenteeism"" and to give staff advice on what to do if the weather or lack of public transport kept them away.

"The museum will show how fat is blocking London's Victorian infrastructure Part of one of the capital's biggest fatbergs is going to be put on display in the Museum of London next year. It is a slice of a monster fatberg, over 250m (820ft) long, which had been clogging up sewers below Whitechapel. The museum says it was a congealed concoction of ""fat, oil, grease, wet wipes and sanitary products"". The display will show how modern living and high levels of rubbish are putting pressure on the ""arteries"" of London's Victorian infrastructure. TheWhitechapel fatbergbecame something of a celebrity in its own right last autumn - with Thames Water fighting a nine-week battle against a ""rock hard"" blockage weighing 130 tonnes. This video can not be played Part of the fatberg was filmed by Thames Water engineers trying to remove the blockage The museum describes the fatberg's dimensions as being longer than Tower Bridge and as heavy as 11 double-decker buses. Curator Vyki Sparkes said it ""will be one of the most fascinating and disgusting objects we have ever had on display"". Why fatbergs matter? Victory declared over giant fatberg London fatberg fuelled by restaurants Thames Water's Stuart White says that part of its fascination is that it is the product of our own modern-day living, describing it as ""repulsively human"". There is an eco-friendly ending to what happened to the rest of the fatberg. It was chopped up and mostlyconverted into bio-diesel. Despite the name, fatbergs are actually mainly made up of wet wipes. They account for a startling 93% of the material blocking our sewers according to Water UK, the membership body for water providers. They collected samples to analyse from blockages in sewers, pumps and wastewater treatment works. Wet wipes - mostly baby wipes, but also those used to remove make up and clean surfaces - made up the vast majority of the material. Fat, oil and grease only made up 0.5%. The other 7% was made up of a range of other materials including feminine hygiene products, cotton pads and plastic wrappers. Toilet paper made up just 0.01% of the material blocking our pipes and sewers. Environmental charities including Greenpeace and the Marine Conservation Society say they are not surprised by this high number since wet wipes are often marketed as ""flushable"".

"Inflation rose to 3.1% in November, the highest in nearly six years, as the squeeze on households continued. TheOffice for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalthat airfares and computer games contributed to the increase. The most recent data shows that average weekly wages are growing at just 2.2%. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, will now have to write a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond explaining how the Bank intends to bring inflation back to its 2% target. Mr Carney has to write a letter to the chancellor if the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate is above 3% or below 1%. Will you feel the pinch this Christmas? House prices rise fastest in East Midlands In November, the Bank of England raised its key interest rate for the first time in more than a decade from 0.25% to 0.5%. However, it is not expected to announce a further increase when it publishes the results of the Monetary Policy Committee's two-day meeting on Thursday. Mr Carney had said that he expected inflation to peak in October or November. The last timehe wrote to the chancellor was in December 2016,external, after inflation fell to 0.9% in October that year. Mr Carney's latest letter will be published in February, when the Bank of England will also release its quarterly Inflation Report. It may be the highest rate of inflation for nearly six years. But that tells you not so much how high it has got but how low it has been for so long. In the past 10 years, inflation's peak has been 5.2% (in 2011). Tell anyone over the age of 50 that inflation at 3.1% is out of control and you're likely to get a scoff, followed by memories of the 70s and 80s. What they may forget, though, is that for most of that time wages were also rising - and faster than prices. The tendency of wages to respond to higher prices and outpace them seemed to follow an iron logic back then. Bigger price rises led to bigger pay rises, forcing many employers to charge higher prices to cover higher labour costs: the so-called ""wage-price spiral"". But those rules don't seem to apply these days. The breakdown of that logic is why we have a squeeze on living standards. It is also why the Bank of England isn't that worried about above-target inflation getting higher or even staying above target. In the City, a second rise in interest rates isn't expected until August next year. Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: ""It's quite possible that inflation is now close to its peak. But some of the latest surveys suggest that service sector costs and prices are rising. Given how dominant services are in the economy, this could feed through to inflation overall. ""That means that further interest rate rises are definitely not off the table."" The ONS said that although airfares fell in November - down 10.4% - the decline was not as steep as last year when they tumbled 13.4%. Data also shows that food inflation has picked up, especially prices for fish, oil and fats, such as butter and chocolate. Figures from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel released on Tuesday indicated that food inflation hit 3.6% in the three months to 3 December, the highest rate since 2013. It also noted that prices for butter and fish had grown as well an increase in the cost of fresh pork. Kantar said only a few items were cheaper during the period, such as fresh chicken and crisps. Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics, said that the rise in inflation had come ""at precisely the wrong time for retailers"". ""In the run-up to Christmas, the cost of living, now rising at the fastest rate in five years, remains uncomfortably high for households."" He said that food inflation ""is one of the most transparent indicators of living costs and often the catalyst to cut back on spending elsewhere"". However, he expects the inflation rate to now fall and could reach 2.5% by Easter. The ONS will announce employment data for the August to October period on Wednesday, which will include figures for wage growth. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, forecasts that average weekly wages have risen by 2.5% during the period. He said: ""With wage growth picking up we should see an end to falling real pay in due course. ""That'll be of small comfort, however, to households facing a significant increase in the cost of Christmas this year.""

"Ryanair passengers face disruption to their Christmas travel plans after pilots and crew announced industrial action in a bid to win union recognition and better conditions. In Ireland, 79 pilots based in Dublin will strike for one day on 20 December. The airline, which does not recognise unions, said they represented about 28% of its Dublin-based captains. Meanwhile, Ryanair pilots and cabin crew in Italy plan to strike for four hours on 15 December. The airline said last week it would ""ignore"" the Italian move, claiming staff rarely heeded calls to walk out. Pilots based in Portugal and Germany also plan industrial action. Ryanair boss offers pilots better pay and conditions to stay Does Ryanair have a pilot shortage? Passengers 'furious' over cancellations Cockpit, the German pilots' union, said its Ryanair members would strike for better pay and conditions if the airline refused to begin talks, but vowed not to disrupt flights over Christmas. Ryanair said it would ""not deal with or recognise"" the German union ""regardless of what action - if any - takes place"". Unions have long argued that their airline fails to offer pilots the same pay and conditions as its rivals. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary Impact, the Irish pilots' union, said the dispute was ""solely about winning independent representation for pilots in the company"", said official Ashley Connolly. The union warned of further strikes if Ryanair failed to reach agreement with its members. ""Ryanair will deal with any such disruptions if, or when they arise, and we apologise sincerely to customers for any upset or worry this threatened action... may cause,"" the company said. It said the Dublin staff who planned to strike were a ""small group of pilots who are working their notice and will shortly leave Ryanair, so they don't care how much upset they cause colleagues or customers"". Analysts at Goodbody said although there were deep divisions between pilots and Ryanair management, the ""headlines are worse than the reality on the ground"" they wrote in a note. In September Ryanair said more than 2,000 flights would be cancelled this winter after it rearranged pilots' rosters to comply with new aviation rules. Later that month it announced 18,000 further flights would be cancelled over the winter season, affecting more than 700,000 passengers. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary wrote to its 4,200 pilotsto apologise for the changes to their rotas and urged them not to leave the airline. However, this week it warned Dublin pilots they would lose agreed benefits by striking. Many of the airline's pilots have joined unions following the cancellations, but Ryanair said it could legally decline to negotiate with them.

"The health risks are lower than smoking cigarettes ""Heat-not-burn"" tobacco products are harmful to health even though they are safer than regular cigarettes, say UK experts. The advisory panel to the government said the devices produce ""a number of compounds of concern"", including some that can cause cancer. Manufacturers say their products are aimed at smokers who want the ""taste of tobacco with no smoke and less smell"". The panel was concerned that young non-smokers might start using the products. There were also worries that the products could lead people to take up smoking cigarettes. Why young people are now less likely to smoke E-cigs 'definitely' less harmful than smoking Investors told to give up tobacco industry The Committee on Toxicity (Cot) looked at the available evidence about the risks of two heat-not-burn products that have recently gone on sale in the UK - IQOS and iFuse. The devices heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to create a vapour but not smoke. They are different to e-cigarettes, which vaporise a liquid containing nicotine - the highly addictive compound in tobacco smoke. The committee found that people using heat-not-burn products are exposed to between 50% to 90% fewer ""harmful and potentially harmful"" compounds compared with conventional cigarettes. But it was unable to quantify the exact health risk. Prof Alan Boobis, committee chairman, said: ""The evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products still pose a risk to users. There is likely to be a reduction in risk for cigarette smokers who switch to heat-not-burn products but quitting entirely would be more beneficial."" There was not enough evidence for the committee to compare heat-not-burn with e-cigarettes. But the committee noted: ""If people perceive e-cigarettes as safe this perception could transfer to heat-not-burn tobacco products, despite a lack of data on which to establish this."" Public Health England says there is a large amount of evidence that shows e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking - at least 95%. ""We encourage smokers to try e-cigarettes as a way of stopping smoking. People who combine e-cigarettes with support from their local stop-smoking service have some of the highest quit success rates."" Quitting tobacco-use completely is still the healthiest option, say health experts. A spokesman for Philip Morris Limited, which makes IQOS, said: ""We are encouraged by today's statement of the UK's Committee on Toxicity and will continue to share our scientific evidence. ""We believe that smoke-free alternatives, including heated tobacco products like IQOS and e-cigarettes, have significant potential to be less harmful than cigarettes and can play an important role for smokers and public health."" Simon Clark from the smokers' group Forest said: ""Electronic cigarettes are a step too far for many smokers so if the government wants smokers to quit there has to be a range of products that fills the gap between combustible tobacco and e-cigarettes.""

Janet Jasper was taken to hospital following the blast, which happened on Allington Drive, Birstall, at about 07:30 GMT on Monday. Two men were also injured - one is in a stable condition in hospital and the other has been discharged. One house was destroyed, another torn in half and 50 others were damaged. A ""handful"" of families spent Monday night in temporary accommodation. An investigation is under way. Updates on this story and more from across the East Midlands The two collapsed houses before and after The gas maintenance company Cadent, which supplied the collapsed house in Birstall, has confirmed it attended a call-out on Allington Drive on Sunday. Chris Rison, from Cadent, said: ""We were called and we attended to a job on this street. ""I can't go through the details of that attendance because that's all part of the investigation but it's true that we attended."" The blast destroyed two houses in Allington Drive, Birstall, and damaged several others Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service said two of the injured were rescued from the partially collapsed house and one from the fully collapsed property The three injured in the gas blast were taken to three different hospitals The Shah family, who live next door to the demolished house, cannot return home because it is not structurally safe. Local people have offered them shelter, food and hot drinks. Tina Shah said: ""We have had lots of phone calls and messages. The whole community has been fantastic."" Talking about the explosion, she said: ""My son was in bed with me and our roof came in. I didn't know what had happened to my daughter because she was in another room. ""I am just really grateful I have been able to walk out of my house with my two children."" An online fundraising page for those affected has already raised more than Â£2,800 Allington Drive remains closed and curtains and blinds can be seen hanging from properties Charnwood Borough Council said it was too early to tell if those left temporarily homeless would be able to return home before Christmas. Richard Smith, who lives three doors down from the blast site, has lost dozens of tiles and damaged windows but stayed at home on Monday night in freezing temperatures. ""It is a bad state, but we are lucky. A lot of people are even worse,"" he said. ""I can't imagine how those poor people feel.

One other person was taken to hospital, while two 16-year-olds - Ms Pearson's son, Kyle, and a friend - who were in the house, freed themselves before fire crews arrived. Michelle Pearson is in a serious condition in hospital Police confirmed there had been previous incidents at the family's home. The case has been referred by GMP to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). It is understood the voluntary referral was in response to police contact with the family less than 24 hours before the fire.

There is a metal police cordon on one side and officers standing on the other. Tributes to the three children who have died are growing on both sides of the barrier. A metal police cordon is in place Rev Gill Page, associate rector from St John the Baptist Church, told me more than 200 people - many of them youngsters - attended a ""very moving and emotional"" service last night. She said candles were lit and a book of condolence was opened in memory of the victims. Detectives are questioning three men, aged 18, 20 and 23, and a 20-year-old woman on suspicion of murder. A 24-year-old man is being held on suspicion of assisting an offender. Demi Pearson was a pupil at Harrop Fold School in Salford, which featured in the Channel 4 documentary Educating Greater Manchester. Head teacher Drew Povey said: ""We are devastated at the tragic loss of life today in our community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family involved."" Jackson Street was cordoned off between Algernon Road and Alexandra Road Ch Supt Wayne Miller said police were appealing for witnesses or those with information about the events leading up to the fire. ""In what is such a heartbreaking set of circumstances, we have been doing our very best to support the family in every way that we can and carry out our inquiries quickly and sensitively,"" he said. Damian O'Rourke, from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""Firefighters arrived within minutes and were faced with a very serious and well-developed fire involving the ground and first floor. ""Knowing there were people trapped inside, firefighters wearing breathing apparatus immediately went in and quickly rescued five people from the house but sadly three of those people died."" Salford City Mayor Paul Dennett said: ""Our thoughts are with the friends and family of those killed and seriously injured in this horrific incident in our city."" He urged anyone with information to contact the police, adding: ""We'll continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with our communities.""

"This video can not be played Roy Moore's skittish escape on horseback The polls have closed in Alabama, where a firebrand Republican conservative is battling for a Senate seat against a Democrat hoping for a huge upset. President Donald Trump's populist brand will be tested after he backed Roy Moore, who denies allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Much of the Republican establishment has distanced itself from the 70-year-old former Alabama judge. The race between Mr Moore and Democrat Doug Jones is too close to call. The Republican candidate has said homosexual activity should be illegal and argued against removing segregationist language from the state constitution. But it is sexual abuse claims against him by a number of women, some when they were teenagers, that have made Washington conservatives baulk. One accuser alleges Mr Moore molested her when she was 14. The scandal has put an Alabama Senate seat within reach of Democrats for the first time in more than two decades. The eyes of the world are on Alabama Ten things Roy Moore believes Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Montgomery Elections are rarely competitive in Alabama. It's the kind of place Republicans might as well weigh their votes rather than count them, such is the party's dominance here. This special election has upended all the normal expectations and still, at this late stage, remains too close to call. Democrat Doug Jones can win if he manages to galvanise the black vote in cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery. Roy Moore, his Republican rival, could easily lose if those rural, white, church-going conservatives stay at home amid the allegations against him. Whatever the outcome, the repercussions will be felt beyond Alabama. If the Republicans lose, their Senate advantage contracts to just one vote. If they win, their candidate is likely to face months of ethics inquiries, and an outside chance of being expelled from the Senate. For the Democrats, a win would bolster their bargaining power in Congress, and place control of the Senate within definite grasp at next year's mid-term elections.

"Artwork: Observations of 'Oumuamua noted its unusual elongated shape A project searching for intelligent life in the cosmos is going to check the first known interstellar asteroid for signs of alien technology. The odd-shaped object was detected as it sped towards the Sun on 19 October. Its properties suggested it originated around another star, making it the first such body to be spotted in our cosmic neighbourhood. An initiative backed by billionaire Yuri Milner will use a radio telescope to listen for signals from it. The team's efforts will begin on Wednesday, with astronomers observing the asteroid, which is currently speeding away from our Solar System, across four different radio frequency bands. The first set of observations at theRobert C Byrd Green Bank Telescope,externalin West Virginia is due to last for 10 hours. Interstellar visitor given a name Bizarre shape of interstellar asteroid Previous observations of the object, called 'Oumuamua, have noted its strange, elongated shape, making it look a bit like a cigar. The object's velocity and eccentric trajectory suggests it originated outside our Solar System Mr Milner'sBreakthrough Listen programme,externalreleased a statement which read: ""Researchers working on long-distance space transportation have previously suggested that a cigar or needle shape is the most likely architecture for an interstellar spacecraft, since this would minimise friction and damage from interstellar gas and dust."" Andrew Siemion, director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center, who is part of the initiative, said: ""'Oumuamua's presence within our Solar System affords Breakthrough Listen an opportunity to reach unprecedented sensitivities to possible artificial transmitters and demonstrate our ability to track nearby, fast-moving objects."" Daredevil climber dies in China fall Huntingtonâs breakthrough may stop disease American who defected to North Korea dies He added: ""Whether this object turns out to be artificial or natural, it's a great target for Listen."" Prof Andrew Coates, fromUCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory,externalin Dorking, who is not involved with Breakthrough Listen, told BBC Surrey radio: ""I believe there is an experiment being done to actually listen to this object to see if there are any potential signs of life on it. The observations will be carried out using the Robert C Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, US ""I think this is most unlikely because it's left over from the beginning of that planetary system elsewhere. Much better ways of looking for life are actually missions like our ExoMars project, which is going to be going to Mars in 2020, drilling underneath the surface to look for signs of life. We're building the camera system for that."" He added: ""But as this thing is passing through very quickly, why not have a listen just in case. But I think it's most unlikely."" Other researchers who have carried out observations of the asteroid with ground telescopes say that, apart from its shape, it closely resembles natural objects found in the outer parts of our Solar System. It has a reddish colour, which is often indicative of organic compounds that have been irradiated by cosmic rays. Measurements suggest it has a dense structure and is comprised of rock and metal, but with little - if any - water-ice. Although 'Oumuamua formed around another star, scientists think it could have been wandering through the Milky Way, unattached to any star system, for hundreds of millions of years before its chance encounter with our Solar System. The asteroid's name, 'Oumuamua, means ""a messenger from afar arriving first"" in Hawaiian.

"Anyone who arrives before Brexit day on 29 March 2019 will have the right to stay. It will only take a couple of minutes for EU citizens to register online to stay in the UK after Brexit, Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has said. There would, he said, be a ""presumption in favour"" of approving applications when the process begins late next year and people should hear in two weeks. Rather than having to wade through 85 pages as in the past, he said there would be just six to eight questions. Theresa May has urged all three million EU nationals to stay after March 2019. A reciprocal deal,externalon the rights of EU nationals in the UK and British expats on the continent is part of the stage-one agreement approved by the European Commission on Friday - which is expected to be rubber-stamped by all 28 EU members later this week. Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? Brexit: All you need to know Mr Lewis told the Lords EU Justice sub-committee that Friday's agreement meant EU nationals worried about their future ""can be confident they do not have to do anything immediately"". When the application process for what the government has described as ""settled status"" begins, he said the system would be far simpler than those applying for permanent residency in the past have had to deal with. This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points ""The way we are looking to develop this is using online processes where somebody spends literally a few minutes online and within a couple of weeks your settled status is dealt with and granted,"" Mr Lewis said. Unlike other applicants, existing permanent residents may not have to pay a fee to apply again nor have to supply evidence that they are living in the UK. For those who don't already have indefinite leave to remain in the UK, charges will be capped at about Â£72.50 - the cost that Britons pay to renew their passports. The immigration minister said the Home Office always had a duty to be rigorous when it came to considering applications for permanent residency - which people are eligible for after five continuous years in the UK. But he admitted the current system was ""overly complicated and bureaucratic"" and the authorities' approach would have to change when it came to Brexit because of the sheer numbers of people affected. ""There is a presumption that they will be granted,"" he said. ""The only circumstance I can see someone not being granted settled status is if the criminal records check show they are a criminal, or if someone was trying to claim to be an EU citizen in the UK and they were not - a fraudulent application."" Ministers hope the new system will be up and running in the second half of 2018 and have pledged that those given settled status would have ""broadly the same rights"" as British citizens. But during the session Labour peer Lord Cashman called for all EU citizens who already qualify for permanent residence to be registered immediately under a fast-track process. And Lib Dem peer Baroness Ludford said a lot of existing EU citizens were experiencing a ""great deal of hassle"" and she questioned how the system would produce the ""nirvana of simplicity"" expected by ministers. Citing cases where EU citizens who had lived in the UK for decades had received letters asking them to leave, she claimed ""there was an attempt by the Home Office to create a hostile environment"". Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said existing rights enjoyed by EU nationals should be guaranteed. ""The government needs to give clarity on what it has agreed, and to stick to its word,"" she said. Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK?

"The family of bullied Keaton Jones have faced a backlash online following allegations they've been asking for money and have racist views. A Facebook video of the US schoolboy talking about being bullied went viral earlier this week and celebritiesposted their support. But now they've faced online criticism after photos emerged allegedly showing the family with the Confederate flag. His mum Kimberly Jones has told ABC News: ""We're not racists."" This video can not be played The footage of Keaton Jones has more than 22m views The Confederate flag is controversial as it was first introduced in the US Civil War by the states fighting to keep slavery legal and some see it as a symbolof racial hatred. In an interview withABC News,external, Kimberly said the photo with the flag was meant to be ""ironic, funny, extreme"". ""I am genuinely, truly sorry. If I could take it back I would."" People have also been questioning Kimberly's motives for posting the original video. It's after someone using the Instagram account KimberlyJones_38 asked for donations for her son and linked to a PayPal account and GoFundMe page. It is not clear whether the real Kimberly Jones was behind that appeal. BBC Newsbeat has approached her for comment but she has not responded. It is not unusual for people to set up fake donation pages off the back of high-profile events. Social media users, believing the crowdfunding message to be from Keaton's mother, criticised her for trying to make money out of her son's situation. All content on the @KimberlyJones_38 account has now been deleted and a woman claiming to be Keaton's sister, Lakyn Jones, has insisted it is fake. On Twitter she said: ""We haven't received any money and don't plan on it. The gofundme's [sic] aren't by any of us."" She also denied allegations the family was racist, saying: ""Those who know me and my family know we aren't racist. ""My brother doesn't say the ""N"" word. Please leave it alone."" Rihanna and Chris Brown have deleted their original posts supporting Keaton. Rihanna put up a different anti-bullying message. Others have reinforced the need to support Keaton despite what his family's views may or may not be. Game of Thrones' Nathalie Emmanuel said: ""Learning that Keatonâs family are supportive of the confederate flag is disappointing for me as a person of colour but I still feel that this child, yes CHILD, deserves to be treated with respect & should not be bullied."",external This Twitter user said: ""It shouldn't reflect on Keaton, he's a kid.

"The victim was hit on a pedestrian crossing on the South Circular Road near Norwood Road A woman killed in a hit-and-run in south London was ""just left to die"". The 29-year-old from Wandsworth was hit by four vehicles on a pedestrian crossing on South Circular Road at 06:48 GMT on Monday. None of the drivers stopped, police said. Navin Bagan, 37, who works at the nearby Tulse Hill cafe, added the drivers were ""heartless"". One resident said the road layout ""encourages dangerous driving"" and has written to an MP to urge for change. The woman was hit by two lorries and two cars. Her next of kin have been informed. In the letter shared on social media to Chuka Umunna MP,external, Ross Runs wrote: ""As both a pedestrian and a driver, the junction at Tulse Hill encourages some of the most aggressive driving I have seen in London. ""If there is an opposite to 'traffic calming' then this is it."" He said the current design encouraged speeding and the road had become ""a racetrack of sorts"". ""I hope that nobody else has to needlessly lose their life due to poor urban planning on a road that encourages excessive speed and dangerous driving,"" he added. Mr Umunna is the local MP for Streatham, not Dulwich & West Norwood where the crash happened. However, he and Helen Hayes, who represents the neighbouring constituency, said in a joint statement their thoughts were with the victim's family and friends. ""Lambeth Council is working closely with Transport for London on urgently needed changes to the Tulse Hill gyratory which will make it safer for pedestrians and cyclists,"" the statement said. ""We are pushing for these works to be delivered as soon as possible, and for any lessons which emerge from the investigation into this appalling incident to be acted upon immediately.""

"Brandon and Lacie died in hospital A house fire which killed three children was a ""targeted attack"", police have said. Demi Pearson, 14, Brandon, eight, and Lacie, seven, died, while Lia, three, and mother Michelle, 35, remain in hospital. Ms Pearson's son, Kyle, and a friend both escaped from the home, in Salford, before fire crews arrived. Six people have now been arrested, after a 25-year-old man was held on suspicion of murder. This video can not be played ""Words cannot describe"" how a family feels after losing three children, police say. Michelle Pearson is in a serious condition in hospital Ch Supt Wayne Miller of Greater Manchester Police said detectives believe the attack was targeted after collecting CCTV from the area. ""We now have a much deeper understanding of the devastating events which lead to the tragic deaths,"" he said. Ch Supt Miller said relatives of the family have been left ""completely devastated"". ""The loss of a child in any circumstance is unthinkable, to lose three in such deplorable circumstances words cannot describe. ""My heart breaks for them, it really does. ""We're doing all that we can to get them the answers they quite rightly deserve."" Two men, aged 19 and 20, arrested on suspicion of murder have been released on bail, as has a 24-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Officers visited the house in Jackson Street, Walkden, a few hours before the blaze, which happened at about 05:00 GMT on Monday. Police confirmed there had been previous incidents at the family's home. The case has been referred by GMP to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which confirmed an investigation had started. It feels it is ""necessary to independently investigate the circumstances of this incident in relation to the force's actions"". Demi Pearson, 14, was a pupil at Harrop Fold School in Salford This video can not be played Police were filmed leading one of the suspects away after his arrest The children's schools have paid tribute to them. Demi Pearson was a pupil at Harrop Fold School in Salford, which featured in the Channel 4 documentary Educating Greater Manchester. Head teacher Drew Povey said everyone at the school was ""truly devastated"". ""Team Harrop mourns alongside the relatives and friends of those whose lives were needlessly and mercilessly taken from them. The spirit of Salford cannot and will not be crushed. We will work together to comfort and rebuild those lives that have been forever changed,"" he said. Emma Henderson, head teacher at Bridgewater Primary school, said the school is consoling pupils and their families.

"The cost of Christmas: Some seasonal favourites have gone up in price since last year From boxes of chocolates to mince pies and even Brussels sprouts, Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without a table piled high with food. But the price of the festive grocery shop has spiralled this year, thanks to growing food inflation. Food and soft drink pricesrose by 4.1% in the year to October- the biggest growth in four years and a move that's hit some perennial Christmas favourites particularly hard. 'I spend Â£400 on each of my five kids' Why is Christmas dinner more expensive this year? The average price of smoked salmon shot up by 22.9% between November 2015 and November 2016, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Brussels sprouts are up 8.4%, while Christmas puddings are 7.7% more expensive, according to the figures. In September and October, consumer price inflation hit 3% compared with a year earlier - the highest level in five years and 0.9% above the rate of wage growth. But some of the key components of Christmas - including popular presents such as smartphones and clothes - have seen average prices rise by far more than that. So what's behind the increases? And are we tightening our belts this Christmas as a result? The pound has fallen by as much as 20% relative to other currencies following the Brexit vote in 2016,  meaning that retailers who rely on imports have seen significant price rises. The UK brings in about 50% of the food we eat from overseas, so supermarkets have been under particular pressure. Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG, says that consumers are particularly sensitive to food price changes. ""Before 2017, grocery prices were falling off the back of the supermarket price war,"" he says. ""We have gone quickly from a position where people are used to their weekly shop getting cheaper to getting more expensive."" Mr Martin points out that the effect is psychological, with people paying more attention to rising prices than falling ones. ""Some sectors are hit particularly hard. For example, the price of smoked salmon has gone up markedly and that is an important part of Christmas for many people,"" he adds. Although some foods have become more expensive, we are buying it in increasing quantities. Over the three months to November, total food sales increased 4%, according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG. And it seems we are still keen to treat ourselves as Christmas approaches, but are being more innovative in how we shop. One in three shoppers say the cost of Christmas is a growing concern compared with last year, says grocery research firm IGD. About 45% of shoppers told the IGD they would start Christmas shopping early to spread the cost, compared with 35% who said the same last year. And 43% are planning to spread the bulk of their food shopping across a range of stores - twice as many as were planning to do a big Christmas shop in one place. The rising price of phones means users are holding on to their handsets for longer, according to some reports Many tech enthusiasts will be hoping for an iPhone X in their Christmas stocking. But they could be left disappointed if the price hikes seen on smartphones make them an unappealing purchase. The cost of premium smartphones has been rising steadily each year.  Average prices increased by 10.2% in 2015, 16.7% last year and 6.7% in 2017, according to technology analysts Gartner. PC price hikes have been even more pronounced, with the average selling price rising by 23% in 2016 and 14% in 2017 - after an average fall of 29% in 2014. Technology prices largely fell by 3-5% every year until 2012, but now things are different, says Ranjit Atwal, a research director at Gartner. ""On the PC side, a lot of people started to buy better models that were higher spec, so started to move up the price curve,"" he says. ""Then there are issues around exchange rates.  When the pound fell in 2016 we saw quite a big increase in pricing. The cost of the components has been increasing too."" Will this strike tech gifts off Christmas lists? Phone users are typically holding on to their handsets for four or five months longer, as prices have become more expensive, Dixons Carphone's chief executive Seb Jameswarned back in August. But Mr Atwal says shoppers aren't overly bothered by price hikes. ""Smartphones are much more pervasive - everybody has one,"" he says. ""People don't buy them all in one go, so they don't really realise. Groceries are a frequent purchase: if the price of milk goes up 5p, you notice that."" Average clothing prices have risen 11.5% since last year, after retailers timed the winter wather better Prices have gone up 11.5% in the UK online clothing, shoes and accessories market from November 2016 to November 2017 on a like-for-like retailer basis, says data analytics platform WGSN Instock. WGSN's Nivindya Sharma notes that retailers have had to grapple with increased sourcing costs as the pound lost value after the Brexit referendum. Incorporating this year's trends such as ruffles, embellishments and embroidery in designs has also pushed prices up, while the fashion for upmarket trainers has given retailers a boost. ""There is an increasing propensity among shoppers to buy less, buy better,"" she says. ""As a reaction to this, retailers have invested in expanding or introducing their premium collections and price points. There is also a greater volume of premium wool products such as merino and cashmere now available on the High Street. ""Shoppers are increasingly concerned about value for money, so retailers have had to really justify their price points through initiatives such as design innovation, quality, premium fabric or high-profile collaborations."" Shops have also learnt from last year's mistake of discounting clothing too early. The mild winter weather of last year meant shops had to slash the price of coats and jackets. This year, they waited until the temperature started to drop significantly, making shoppers more willing to pay full price. As a result, women's coat prices online have gone up 6.8% year on year, while women's jacket prices have gone up 9.9%.

"What is the point of capitalism? That might seem like a pretty big question, but one answer could be ""to provide people the opportunity through work to become richer"". What, though, if the economy fails in that endeavour? If the system leaves you - despite all your efforts - worse off in December than you were the previous January? Or worse off now than you were a decade ago? It was Lord Adair Turner, the former head of the Low Pay Commission, who put it succinctly. ""The UK over the last 10 years has created a lot of jobs, but today real wages are below where they were in 2007,""he told me earlier this year. ""That is not the capitalist system delivering its promise that over a decade or so it will raise all boats, and it is a very fundamental issue."" Fundamental indeed. Stagnant earnings forecast 'astonishing' UK 'faces longest fall in living standards' At a glance summary: Budget key points Yesterday the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) announced an aggressive downgrade of both its growth and productivity forecasts. Those big, macro-economic announcements have a significant effect on all of us as well as on the state of the public finances. It means the economy is forecast to be weaker at producing wealth for every hour that we work. Which makes the chances of a pay rise for everyone recede. Today, two pieces of chunky analysis of the OBR's judgements reveal why those downgrades are so important. The social justice think tank, the Resolution Foundation, said that ""lower productivity feeds directly through to pay, which is now forecast to be Â£1,000 a year lower on average than the OBR thought back in March"". The Foundation says that the fall in real incomes people are experiencing could now become the longest since records began. And that wages will not recover to their pre-financial crisis levels until 2025 - that's 17 years during which people have been experiencing an incomes squeeze. The tax and economy think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, agrees. ""Real earnings are falling this year as inflation has risen to 3%,"" Paul Johnson, the Institute's director, said. ""The nascent recovery in earnings, which were growing through 2014 to the first half of 2016, has been choked off. ""That they even might still be below their 2008 level in 2022 as the OBR forecasts is truly astonishing. Let's hope this forecast turns out to be too pessimistic."" Government ministers will be similarly keeping their fingers crossed. And hoping that with strong employment levels and plans to boost investment in the type of infrastructure that boosts productivity - transport, scientific and technology research - the real incomes squeeze can be alleviated. Because if a system does not deliver increasing wealth - even if it is a modest increase - then people, quite naturally, begin to wonder what is the point.

"Firms in the UK's key services sector raised prices at the fastest pace for nearly a decade last month as they faced higher costs for food, fuel and salaries, according to a survey. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) for services,externalalso said growth in the sector had slowed. Growth in new orders cooled as consumers were hit by a ""double whammy"" of higher prices and weak wage growth. The services sector accounts for nearly 80% of UK economic output. The closely-watched PMI reading fell to 53.8 for the services sector in November, down from 55.6 the previous month. However, this was still above the 50 threshold for growth, which the sector has achieved for 16 consecutive months. The report noted a ""sharp and accelerated rise in prices"" by firms. The fall in the value of the pound has pushed up the price of imported goods for companies, and the sector has also been hit by changes to business rates and higher salaries after the launch of the National Living Wage. Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: ""November's data painted a disappointing portrait of a sector struggling against Brexit-related uncertainty and a weaker economic outlook. ""Businesses could no longer fight against the tide of higher prices for food, fuel and salaries as input cost inflation remained close to its strongest for six years, and businesses passed these increases on to consumers at the fastest rate since February 2008. ""The level of new order growth lost some momentum, as inflation also ate away at household incomes for a double whammy effect on the UK population reluctant to spend,"" he added. However, while the PMI service sector survey was weaker than expected, similar studies of the manufacturing and construction sectors have indicated a better performance last month, with activity in the manufacturing sectorgrowing at the fastest pace for four years. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the surveys as a whole indicated the economy would see ""robust growth"" in the final three months of the year of about 0.45%. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, also said the figures ""suggest that the economy is maintaining a modestly improved performance in the fourth quarter"".

"Facebook is to overhaul its tax structure so that it pays tax in the country where profits are earned, instead of using an Irish subsidiary. The online advertising giant is to make the change in every country outside the US where it has an office. In 2016, Facebook said it would stop routing UK sales through Ireland for tax purposes. The change comes after pressure on large firms over their tax affairs from governments and the public. Facebook chief financial officer Dave Wehner said: ""We believe that moving to a local selling structure will provide more transparency to governments and policy makers around the world who have called for greater visibility over the revenue associated with locally-supported sales in their countries."" The move will affect how Facebook pays taxes in 30 countries including Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. In the UK, there was public outrage after it emerged that Facebook had paid just Â£4,327 in tax in 2014. In April 2016, the company began booking more advertising income through its UK office, instead of Ireland. That significantly boosted revenue and profits for its UK business, and has meant that so far it has paid higher taxes. Facebook paid Â£5.1m in tax in the UK last year, up from Â£4.2m in 2015, on revenues of Â£842m. However, that does not necessarily mean it will start paying more tax in other countries as a result of the overhaul, Professor Prem Sikka of the universities of Sheffield and Essex told the BBC. Taxes are paid on profits, and ""the huge difficulty with large companies is trying to determine exactly what the profit is,"" he said. There are a number of ways firms can muddy the waters, including charging intra-group management fees, royalty fees, and profit-sharing, he said. Professor Sikka added that the Facebook move ""may well be appeasing public opinion, while at the same time it takes a very small hit on its profits, if any."" EU authorities are pursuing big technology companiesover what they see as avoidance of tax by routing business through lower tax jurisdictions. In 2015, the UK government introduced a ""diverted profits"" tax, a higher rate of corporation tax aimed at companies that move profits out of the country.

"This video can not be played The latest BBC Weather forecast with Philip Avery Drivers and other travellers are facing difficult journeys as icy conditions persist across much of the UK. The Met Office has a yellow warning for ice,externaluntil Wednesday 11:00 GMT, with the worst affected areas likely to be Scotland and the north of England. A ""flash freeze"" caused disruption at Glasgow Airport, with some flights cancelled or diverted to other Scottish airports after the runway froze. Hundreds of schools were closed for a second day. Temperatures in central and southern England remained only a few degrees above freezing throughout Tuesday. The Met Office's warning covers Wales, parts of Scotland and much of England - including the Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, London, the South East, East, South West, the North East and North West. How cold is it where you are? Why does snow close so many schools? 'Flash freeze' hits Glasgow Airport flights Schools in Wales shut again as snow turns to ice It said the chance of ice was highest across parts of Scotland and northern England where rain might fall onto frozen surfaces. Those areas were also likely to see a few centimetres of fresh snow on high ground. ""There will probably be icy stretches on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths with some injuries possible from slips and falls,"" the Met Office added. At Glasgow Airport sub-zero temperatures and heavy rain caused a rapid formation of ice on the runway and taxiways as well as roads around the airport. As a result, seven flights were forced to land at Edinburgh and Prestwick airports and four flights to and from London City Airport were cancelled. Operations were suspended at Glasgow for 45 minutes. It is back in operation but travellers are being advised to contact their airline before leaving for the airport. Travel may be disrupted over coming days as rain meets freezing temperatures and turns to ice on roads and pavements, said BBC Weather's Darren Bett. There remains a risk of snow in Scotland overnight on Tuesday, with a risk of light showers over high ground in northern England. Winds will strengthen over the course of Wednesday and Thursday, but temperatures will be higher than in recent days. Edmund King, AA president, said the service had rescued more than 140 people from snow and ice by lunchtime. He urged other drivers to slow down and leave more space between vehicles, and warned that opportunist thieves were stealing cars left defrosting on driveways and by the roadside. ""Give yourself extra time and don't leave the car running unattended to warm up,"" he advised. More than 350 schools in the West Midlands, some 200 in Shropshire and more than 300 schools in Wales remained shut for a second day. On Monday, more than 1,000 schools were closed - about 600 of which were in Wales. More snow and ice is forecast for the north of England and Scotland Horses were put through their paces at Newmarket racecourse despite the low temperatures Boats on the frozen Shropshire Union Canal at Market Drayton were going nowhere An estimated 190 homes were still without a power supply supply in the West Midlands on Tuesday evening. Heathrow Airport in west London said the ""majority"" of departures and arrivals would run as scheduled but advised passengers to check before travelling because of bad weather in Europe. Train travellers faced delays on their homeward journeys, with Great Western Railway, Greater Anglia and London Northwestern Railway all reporting major delays into the evening rush hour. Some Arriva Trains Wales lines were not running on Tuesday evening and the company expects delays to last until the early hours of Wednesday. Allow Twitter content?

Eurotunnel also said services were running with delays, with four-hour waits for passengers departing from Calais and Folkestone. It recommended customers cancelled or changed their travel plans. P&O ferries across the Channel are delayed by up to three hours because of the weather. Travellers are being told to check in and will be put on the first available sailing. The TUC called on employers not to force staff to make dangerous journeys ""for the sake of presenteeism"" and to give staff advice on what to do if the weather or lack of public transport kept them away.

"Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has ordered an investigation after reports rail firms ""misled"" customers. The watchdog Transport Focus said companies were selling tickets for services over Christmas, despite knowing they will not run. Mr Grayling said was ""unacceptable"" for passengers to have to pay higher ""walk-up"" fares at Christmas. Industry body the Rail Delivery Group said its members would ""develop a plan"" to address the complaints. Mr Grayling said: ""It would be totally unacceptable if any passenger has to pay walk-up fares this Christmas because advance tickets were not available."" ""I expect passengers to be offered the highest standards of customer service and have ordered an immediate investigation into this report."" He also urged Network Rail and train companies to work closer together to minimise disruption and make sure the problem did not happen again. Transport Focus found more than 2,600 incorrect journeys - those already cancelled or scheduled to face disruption - were on offer during the Christmas week alone. The group also found that by 13 October - 11 weeks before Christmas - reservations had not opened on Great Western, London Midland, South Western Railway and Southern - despite regulations stating they should. Only 15% of services were open for reservation on Greater Anglia and 25% on Virgin Trains. Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ""Failure to release timetables 12 weeks ahead of travel can mean passengers buy tickets for trains that will not run. ""That can't be right. Train operators' advice is to book early at Christmas to get the best deal. ""But if the timetable has not been finalised only more expensive 'on the day' tickets can be bought.""

But she said she was unable to plan her Christmas journeys. ""It's unfair if someone's forked out a bunch of money, but don't know if their train will be delayed,"" she said. ""Companies should at least advise people so they have the option of knowing and planning other routes."" Paul Plummer, chief executive of Rail Delivery Group responded to the Transport Focus criticisms, saying the issue was ""important"" and he would reply more fully before Christmas. Transport Focus have called for a network-wide review to ensure train operators publish correct timetables 12 weeks in advance. They also want incorrect information to be removed from online timetables, and say passengers who have already bought tickets must be notified when there are changes to their journeys.

"The family of bullied Keaton Jones have faced a backlash online following allegations they've been asking for money and have racist views. A Facebook video of the US schoolboy talking about being bullied went viral earlier this week and celebritiesposted their support. But now they've faced online criticism after photos emerged allegedly showing the family with the Confederate flag. His mum Kimberly Jones has told ABC News: ""We're not racists."" This video can not be played The footage of Keaton Jones has more than 22m views The Confederate flag is controversial as it was first introduced in the US Civil War by the states fighting to keep slavery legal and some see it as a symbolof racial hatred. In an interview withABC News,external, Kimberly said the photo with the flag was meant to be ""ironic, funny, extreme"". ""I am genuinely, truly sorry. If I could take it back I would."" People have also been questioning Kimberly's motives for posting the original video. It's after someone using the Instagram account KimberlyJones_38 asked for donations for her son and linked to a PayPal account and GoFundMe page. It is not clear whether the real Kimberly Jones was behind that appeal. BBC Newsbeat has approached her for comment but she has not responded. It is not unusual for people to set up fake donation pages off the back of high-profile events. Social media users, believing the crowdfunding message to be from Keaton's mother, criticised her for trying to make money out of her son's situation. All content on the @KimberlyJones_38 account has now been deleted and a woman claiming to be Keaton's sister, Lakyn Jones, has insisted it is fake. On Twitter she said: ""We haven't received any money and don't plan on it. The gofundme's [sic] aren't by any of us."" She also denied allegations the family was racist, saying: ""Those who know me and my family know we aren't racist. ""My brother doesn't say the ""N"" word. Please leave it alone."" Rihanna and Chris Brown have deleted their original posts supporting Keaton. Rihanna put up a different anti-bullying message. Others have reinforced the need to support Keaton despite what his family's views may or may not be. Game of Thrones' Nathalie Emmanuel said: ""Learning that Keatonâs family are supportive of the confederate flag is disappointing for me as a person of colour but I still feel that this child, yes CHILD, deserves to be treated with respect & should not be bullied."",external This Twitter user said: ""It shouldn't reflect on Keaton, he's a kid.

"A fraudster who met her victim on a dating website for naturists scammed him out of Â£50,000. Moira Etchells, 45, met Ian Chatting-Tonks in 2013 and persuaded him to lend her the cash to start a business artificially inseminating cows. Swansea Crown Court heard she spent Â£35,000 on a new Land Rover and banked the rest. Etchells, of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, admitted fraud and got an 18-month sentence, suspended for two years. Widower Mr Chatting-Tonks, from Norfolk, went online to search for a new partner who was also interested in naturism, which is when he found Etchells' profile. He paid for her to fly to Alicante where she persuaded him to back a new cow insemination and hoof trimming business. Getting nude in a Paris park Nudists defying the law in Indonesia The restaurant where everyone is naked She said it would give her more time to visit him once a month in Spain, where he had retired to live. He sent her a total of Â£50,000, but became suspicious when she started taking longer to respond to his emails. When Mr Chatting-Tonks said he was going to visit Etchells in Wales, she claimed to have moved to Ireland. Dyfed-Powys Police began investigating and when caught, she repaid Â£50,000 in full after selling the Land Rover. The court was told Etchells had underlying bipolar effective disorder and her condition led to her making ""fanciful"" claims. ""I have found this case truly bizarre,"" said Judge Geraint Walters.

"Akayed Ullah emigrated to the US with his family in 2011 The man who faces terror charges over Monday's bus terminal bombing in New York posted a warning to President Donald Trump just before the attack. ""Trump you failed to protect your nation,"" it read. The post by Akayed Ullah was revealed in charges filed by federal prosecutors on Tuesday. They say the 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant carried out the bombing inspired by the Islamic State group. He wounded himself and three others in Monday morning's attack. Mr Ullah is accused of blowing up a crude device strapped to his body in an underpass at Manhattan's Port Authority Bus Terminal during the rush hour. The New York Police Department (NYPD) tweeted that he was facing state charges,externalincluding criminal possession of a weapon, supporting an act of terrorism and making a ""terroristic threat"". The federal charges, announced later on Tuesday, include providing material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, using a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a public place. Who is the attacker? According to the federal complaint filed by prosecutors, Mr Ullah said after his arrest: ""I did it for the Islamic State."" He also told investigators he had been motivated by American air strikes on IS target, the document says. This video can not be played Prosecutor Joon Kim: ""Ullah tried to maximise casualties"" The complaint says Mr Ullah used materials that included Christmas lights to make the device. It was affixed to his body with Velcro straps. A search of the suspect's home in the New York City borough of Brooklyn ""revealed metal pipes, pieces of wire and metal screws, which were consistent with the bomb materials recovered at the scene,"" prosecutor Joom Kim told reporters. He said the suspect ""admitted that he began researching how to build bombs about a year ago, and had been planning this particular attack for several weeks"". He selected the location and timing ""to maximise casualties"", Mr Kim added. This video can not be played The blast hit during New York's rush-hour - this is how events unfolded Mr Ullah emigrated to the US on a family visa in 2011 from the Chittagong area of Bangladesh.

Mr Ullah's wife did not join him in the US. She and other family members are now being questioned to try to understand how he was radicalised.

"Facebook is to overhaul its tax structure so that it pays tax in the country where profits are earned, instead of using an Irish subsidiary. The online advertising giant is to make the change in every country outside the US where it has an office. In 2016, Facebook said it would stop routing UK sales through Ireland for tax purposes. The change comes after pressure on large firms over their tax affairs from governments and the public. Facebook chief financial officer Dave Wehner said: ""We believe that moving to a local selling structure will provide more transparency to governments and policy makers around the world who have called for greater visibility over the revenue associated with locally-supported sales in their countries."" The move will affect how Facebook pays taxes in 30 countries including Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. In the UK, there was public outrage after it emerged that Facebook had paid just Â£4,327 in tax in 2014. In April 2016, the company began booking more advertising income through its UK office, instead of Ireland. That significantly boosted revenue and profits for its UK business, and has meant that so far it has paid higher taxes. Facebook paid Â£5.1m in tax in the UK last year, up from Â£4.2m in 2015, on revenues of Â£842m. However, that does not necessarily mean it will start paying more tax in other countries as a result of the overhaul, Professor Prem Sikka of the universities of Sheffield and Essex told the BBC. Taxes are paid on profits, and ""the huge difficulty with large companies is trying to determine exactly what the profit is,"" he said. There are a number of ways firms can muddy the waters, including charging intra-group management fees, royalty fees, and profit-sharing, he said. Professor Sikka added that the Facebook move ""may well be appeasing public opinion, while at the same time it takes a very small hit on its profits, if any."" EU authorities are pursuing big technology companiesover what they see as avoidance of tax by routing business through lower tax jurisdictions. In 2015, the UK government introduced a ""diverted profits"" tax, a higher rate of corporation tax aimed at companies that move profits out of the country.

"Anyone who arrives before Brexit day on 29 March 2019 will have the right to stay. It will only take a couple of minutes for EU citizens to register online to stay in the UK after Brexit, Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has said. There would, he said, be a ""presumption in favour"" of approving applications when the process begins late next year and people should hear in two weeks. Rather than having to wade through 85 pages as in the past, he said there would be just six to eight questions. Theresa May has urged all three million EU nationals to stay after March 2019. A reciprocal deal,externalon the rights of EU nationals in the UK and British expats on the continent is part of the stage-one agreement approved by the European Commission on Friday - which is expected to be rubber-stamped by all 28 EU members later this week. Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? Brexit: All you need to know Mr Lewis told the Lords EU Justice sub-committee that Friday's agreement meant EU nationals worried about their future ""can be confident they do not have to do anything immediately"". When the application process for what the government has described as ""settled status"" begins, he said the system would be far simpler than those applying for permanent residency in the past have had to deal with. This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points ""The way we are looking to develop this is using online processes where somebody spends literally a few minutes online and within a couple of weeks your settled status is dealt with and granted,"" Mr Lewis said. Unlike other applicants, existing permanent residents may not have to pay a fee to apply again nor have to supply evidence that they are living in the UK. For those who don't already have indefinite leave to remain in the UK, charges will be capped at about Â£72.50 - the cost that Britons pay to renew their passports. The immigration minister said the Home Office always had a duty to be rigorous when it came to considering applications for permanent residency - which people are eligible for after five continuous years in the UK. But he admitted the current system was ""overly complicated and bureaucratic"" and the authorities' approach would have to change when it came to Brexit because of the sheer numbers of people affected. ""There is a presumption that they will be granted,"" he said. ""The only circumstance I can see someone not being granted settled status is if the criminal records check show they are a criminal, or if someone was trying to claim to be an EU citizen in the UK and they were not - a fraudulent application."" Ministers hope the new system will be up and running in the second half of 2018 and have pledged that those given settled status would have ""broadly the same rights"" as British citizens. But during the session Labour peer Lord Cashman called for all EU citizens who already qualify for permanent residence to be registered immediately under a fast-track process. And Lib Dem peer Baroness Ludford said a lot of existing EU citizens were experiencing a ""great deal of hassle"" and she questioned how the system would produce the ""nirvana of simplicity"" expected by ministers. Citing cases where EU citizens who had lived in the UK for decades had received letters asking them to leave, she claimed ""there was an attempt by the Home Office to create a hostile environment"". Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said existing rights enjoyed by EU nationals should be guaranteed. ""The government needs to give clarity on what it has agreed, and to stick to its word,"" she said. Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK?

"Oscar Pistorius (left in 2016) was found guilty of his girlfriend's murder in 2015 Former South African athlete Oscar Pistorius has been hurt in a prison brawl, less than two weeks after his sentence for the killing of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was more than doubled. The disgraced Paralympian was allegedly involved in a fight over the use of a public phone, a prison department spokesman told the BBC. Pistorius, jailed for 13 years and five months, sustained a bruise, he added. No other serious injuries were reported, the spokesman said. The making and unmaking of Oscar Pistorius Reeva Steenkamp, my friend Africa Live: More on this and other stories ""It is alleged that he was involved in an altercation with another inmate over the use of a public phone in the special care unit where both offenders are detained at Attridgeville Correctional Centre,"" the spokesman, Singabakho Nxumalo, added. The department has launched an investigation, in terms of standard procedure, to ""establish the facts and to ensure that appropriate action is taken as incidents of assaults are not allowed"", he said. The brawl took place on 6 December, 10 days afterSouth African prosecutors successfully argued Pistorius' ""shockingly light"" six-year sentence should be increased. Pistorius shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013 In November, the Supreme Court of Appeal gave Pistorius the minimum 15 years prescribed for murder in South Africa, less time already served. Pistorius was initially found guilty of manslaughter after he claimed he shot Ms Steenkamp dead through a locked bathroom door having mistaken her for a burglar in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013. But the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned the ruling in 2015, and found him guilty of murder.

"The museum will show how fat is blocking London's Victorian infrastructure Part of one of the capital's biggest fatbergs is going to be put on display in the Museum of London next year. It is a slice of a monster fatberg, over 250m (820ft) long, which had been clogging up sewers below Whitechapel. The museum says it was a congealed concoction of ""fat, oil, grease, wet wipes and sanitary products"". The display will show how modern living and high levels of rubbish are putting pressure on the ""arteries"" of London's Victorian infrastructure. TheWhitechapel fatbergbecame something of a celebrity in its own right last autumn - with Thames Water fighting a nine-week battle against a ""rock hard"" blockage weighing 130 tonnes. This video can not be played Part of the fatberg was filmed by Thames Water engineers trying to remove the blockage The museum describes the fatberg's dimensions as being longer than Tower Bridge and as heavy as 11 double-decker buses. Curator Vyki Sparkes said it ""will be one of the most fascinating and disgusting objects we have ever had on display"". Why fatbergs matter? Victory declared over giant fatberg London fatberg fuelled by restaurants Thames Water's Stuart White says that part of its fascination is that it is the product of our own modern-day living, describing it as ""repulsively human"". There is an eco-friendly ending to what happened to the rest of the fatberg. It was chopped up and mostlyconverted into bio-diesel. Despite the name, fatbergs are actually mainly made up of wet wipes. They account for a startling 93% of the material blocking our sewers according to Water UK, the membership body for water providers. They collected samples to analyse from blockages in sewers, pumps and wastewater treatment works. Wet wipes - mostly baby wipes, but also those used to remove make up and clean surfaces - made up the vast majority of the material. Fat, oil and grease only made up 0.5%. The other 7% was made up of a range of other materials including feminine hygiene products, cotton pads and plastic wrappers. Toilet paper made up just 0.01% of the material blocking our pipes and sewers. Environmental charities including Greenpeace and the Marine Conservation Society say they are not surprised by this high number since wet wipes are often marketed as ""flushable"".

"The owner of Westfield shopping centres is being bought for $24.7bn (Â£18.5bn) in a deal that will see the malls launched in new markets. Australia's Westfield Corporation has agreed to be sold to French property group Unibail-Rodamco. There are 35 Westfield shopping centres in the UK and the US, while Unibail-Rodamco has 71 sites in Europe. Unibail-Rodamco said the takeover would result in a ""progressive roll-out of the world famous Westfield brand"". The takeover is the second major deal involving shopping centre owners to emerge in just over a week. On 6 December, Hammerson, which owns the Bullring in Birmingham, announced a Â£3.4bn bid for Intu, whose properties include the Arndale shopping centre in Manchester. Westfield owns 35 shopping centres in Britain and the US The deals come as owners of shopping centres face increasing competition from the shift to shopping online. UK shopping centres sold in Â£3.4bn deal Can US retailers keep their doors open? Retailers 'left behind' as consumers change habits Sir Frank Lowy, the billionaire property tycoon who co-founded Westfield in the 1950s, will retire as chairman of Westfield. His sons Peter and Steven will also step down as co-chief executives of the business. Kate Hardcastle  helped the Westfield Corporation with it future retail strategy in 2012, but has no continuing relationship with it: ""Customers like Westfield's shopping centres because they're not just places to buy things. They try to be aspirational destinations that seek to entertain and include everyone. In their luxury sections there is never an aloof atmosphere which makes people feel unwelcome. ""Importantly they have also invested in good quality, clean toilets and baby changing areas which are an on-going expense. It is all about keeping shoppers in a retail space because the longer they stay there the more they will spend. ""But Westfield will have to keep innovating to fend off competition from companies such as NewRiver. It owns nearly 30 shopping centres in the UK and is developing a community focused strategy, appealing to different demographics - for instance  by hosting coffee mornings for older people."" Speaking at a news conference in Sydney, Westfield chairman Sir Frank Lowy, the billionaire property tycoon who co-founded Westfield in the 1950s said the sale to Unibail-Rodamco would create ""the leading shopping centre company in the world"". ""It will have the highest quality assets in the best markets across Europe, the United Kingdom and United States. For the assets I've spent my life building I could not imagine a better home for them than in this new company."" Sir Frank will retire as chairman of Westfield following the sale. He is one of the richest people in Australia with a fortune of $5.9bn, according to Forbes magazine, and was knighted by the Queen last week. Sir Frank Lowy received a knighthood from the Queen Christophe Cuvillier, chief executive of Unibail-Rodamco, said the acquisition of Westfield ""adds a number of new attractive retail markets in London and the wealthiest catchment areas in the United States"". He added that the deal would allow it to cut advertising and marketing costs. At the moment, Unibail shopping centres advertise individually under different brands for big events, such Christmas. It intends to roll-out the recognisable Westfield brand across its flagship shopping centres in areas such as Paris, Barcelona, Vienna and Warsaw. Unibail and Westfield said they would make â¬100m (Â£88.2m) in savings a year following the tie-up. The group is expected to sell â¬3bn (Â£2.65bn) worth of assets over the next few years, which will involving shedding some of its smaller shopping centres.

"A traffic jam near MÃ¼lheim - one of many in snow-bound Germany Heavy snow blanketing northern Europe has caused many flight cancellations and delays at Schiphol airport in the Netherlands and Brussels airport. About 400 flights were cancelled at Schiphol - one of Europe's biggest airports - and about 200 in Brussels. Travellers have been advised to check flight updates at home, rather than set off for the airport in bad weather. In Germany the heavy snow has caused many car crashes and traffic jams, as well as train delays. More than 300 flights were cancelled on Sunday at Frankfurt airport, the busiest in Germany. The Dutch airport at Eindhoven was temporarily closed because of the snow, and many Dutch schools remained shut on Monday. Conditions improved later at Brussels airport, where planes were able to take off from one de-iced runway. But Brussels Airlines scrapped all its flights. In the UK, dozens of flights were cancelled at Heathrow and road conditions were described as treacherous in many areas. The heavy snow left thousands of British homes without electricity and hundreds of schools were shuton Monday. A storm surge at Marseille: high winds lashed many French coastal areas In France 32 regions were put on an emergency ""orange alert"" footing, as a storm nicknamed ""Ana"" battered the Atlantic coast, with winds gusting as high as 150km/h (93mph). Later the alert was reduced to eight regions in the north and far south. There were also avalanche warnings in some French Alpine ski resorts, after a metre (3.3ft) or more of fresh snow fell above 2,000 metres. Nationwide at least 120,000 homes had power cuts on Monday, most of them in the Loire Valley. The motorway section between Calais and Boulogne was closed after heavy snow in northeastern France. Not what you expect in Venice: snowflakes on the gondolas Snow also spread southwards to Italy, causing some travel disruption in northern regions. The snow caused the closure of schools in Liguria, Piedmont and Tuscany, Italy's La Stampa daily reported. Ferry services to the islands off Naples were suspended because of strong winds.

"Firms in the UK's key services sector raised prices at the fastest pace for nearly a decade last month as they faced higher costs for food, fuel and salaries, according to a survey. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) for services,externalalso said growth in the sector had slowed. Growth in new orders cooled as consumers were hit by a ""double whammy"" of higher prices and weak wage growth. The services sector accounts for nearly 80% of UK economic output. The closely-watched PMI reading fell to 53.8 for the services sector in November, down from 55.6 the previous month. However, this was still above the 50 threshold for growth, which the sector has achieved for 16 consecutive months. The report noted a ""sharp and accelerated rise in prices"" by firms. The fall in the value of the pound has pushed up the price of imported goods for companies, and the sector has also been hit by changes to business rates and higher salaries after the launch of the National Living Wage. Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: ""November's data painted a disappointing portrait of a sector struggling against Brexit-related uncertainty and a weaker economic outlook. ""Businesses could no longer fight against the tide of higher prices for food, fuel and salaries as input cost inflation remained close to its strongest for six years, and businesses passed these increases on to consumers at the fastest rate since February 2008. ""The level of new order growth lost some momentum, as inflation also ate away at household incomes for a double whammy effect on the UK population reluctant to spend,"" he added. However, while the PMI service sector survey was weaker than expected, similar studies of the manufacturing and construction sectors have indicated a better performance last month, with activity in the manufacturing sectorgrowing at the fastest pace for four years. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the surveys as a whole indicated the economy would see ""robust growth"" in the final three months of the year of about 0.45%. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, also said the figures ""suggest that the economy is maintaining a modestly improved performance in the fourth quarter"".

"Inflation rose to 3.1% in November, the highest in nearly six years, as the squeeze on households continued. TheOffice for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalthat airfares and computer games contributed to the increase. The most recent data shows that average weekly wages are growing at just 2.2%. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, will now have to write a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond explaining how the Bank intends to bring inflation back to its 2% target. Mr Carney has to write a letter to the chancellor if the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate is above 3% or below 1%. Will you feel the pinch this Christmas? House prices rise fastest in East Midlands In November, the Bank of England raised its key interest rate for the first time in more than a decade from 0.25% to 0.5%. However, it is not expected to announce a further increase when it publishes the results of the Monetary Policy Committee's two-day meeting on Thursday. Mr Carney had said that he expected inflation to peak in October or November. The last timehe wrote to the chancellor was in December 2016,external, after inflation fell to 0.9% in October that year. Mr Carney's latest letter will be published in February, when the Bank of England will also release its quarterly Inflation Report. It may be the highest rate of inflation for nearly six years. But that tells you not so much how high it has got but how low it has been for so long. In the past 10 years, inflation's peak has been 5.2% (in 2011). Tell anyone over the age of 50 that inflation at 3.1% is out of control and you're likely to get a scoff, followed by memories of the 70s and 80s. What they may forget, though, is that for most of that time wages were also rising - and faster than prices. The tendency of wages to respond to higher prices and outpace them seemed to follow an iron logic back then. Bigger price rises led to bigger pay rises, forcing many employers to charge higher prices to cover higher labour costs: the so-called ""wage-price spiral"". But those rules don't seem to apply these days. The breakdown of that logic is why we have a squeeze on living standards. It is also why the Bank of England isn't that worried about above-target inflation getting higher or even staying above target. In the City, a second rise in interest rates isn't expected until August next year. Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: ""It's quite possible that inflation is now close to its peak. But some of the latest surveys suggest that service sector costs and prices are rising. Given how dominant services are in the economy, this could feed through to inflation overall. ""That means that further interest rate rises are definitely not off the table."" The ONS said that although airfares fell in November - down 10.4% - the decline was not as steep as last year when they tumbled 13.4%. Data also shows that food inflation has picked up, especially prices for fish, oil and fats, such as butter and chocolate. Figures from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel released on Tuesday indicated that food inflation hit 3.6% in the three months to 3 December, the highest rate since 2013. It also noted that prices for butter and fish had grown as well an increase in the cost of fresh pork. Kantar said only a few items were cheaper during the period, such as fresh chicken and crisps. Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics, said that the rise in inflation had come ""at precisely the wrong time for retailers"". ""In the run-up to Christmas, the cost of living, now rising at the fastest rate in five years, remains uncomfortably high for households."" He said that food inflation ""is one of the most transparent indicators of living costs and often the catalyst to cut back on spending elsewhere"". However, he expects the inflation rate to now fall and could reach 2.5% by Easter. The ONS will announce employment data for the August to October period on Wednesday, which will include figures for wage growth. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, forecasts that average weekly wages have risen by 2.5% during the period. He said: ""With wage growth picking up we should see an end to falling real pay in due course. ""That'll be of small comfort, however, to households facing a significant increase in the cost of Christmas this year.""

"Akayed Ullah emigrated to the US with his family in 2011 The man who faces terror charges over Monday's bus terminal bombing in New York posted a warning to President Donald Trump just before the attack. ""Trump you failed to protect your nation,"" it read. The post by Akayed Ullah was revealed in charges filed by federal prosecutors on Tuesday. They say the 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant carried out the bombing inspired by the Islamic State group. He wounded himself and three others in Monday morning's attack. Mr Ullah is accused of blowing up a crude device strapped to his body in an underpass at Manhattan's Port Authority Bus Terminal during the rush hour. The New York Police Department (NYPD) tweeted that he was facing state charges,externalincluding criminal possession of a weapon, supporting an act of terrorism and making a ""terroristic threat"". The federal charges, announced later on Tuesday, include providing material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, using a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a public place. Who is the attacker? According to the federal complaint filed by prosecutors, Mr Ullah said after his arrest: ""I did it for the Islamic State."" He also told investigators he had been motivated by American air strikes on IS target, the document says. This video can not be played Prosecutor Joon Kim: ""Ullah tried to maximise casualties"" The complaint says Mr Ullah used materials that included Christmas lights to make the device. It was affixed to his body with Velcro straps. A search of the suspect's home in the New York City borough of Brooklyn ""revealed metal pipes, pieces of wire and metal screws, which were consistent with the bomb materials recovered at the scene,"" prosecutor Joom Kim told reporters. He said the suspect ""admitted that he began researching how to build bombs about a year ago, and had been planning this particular attack for several weeks"". He selected the location and timing ""to maximise casualties"", Mr Kim added. This video can not be played The blast hit during New York's rush-hour - this is how events unfolded Mr Ullah emigrated to the US on a family visa in 2011 from the Chittagong area of Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi government says he had no criminal record in the country, which he last visited in September. The visit lasted about six weeks, his uncle told the Associated Press news agency. Mr Ullah's wife did not join him in the US. She and other family members are now being questioned to try to understand how he was radicalised. US President Donald Trump has said Monday's attack, which followeda terror attack in Manhattan in October that killed eight people, ""highlights the urgent need... to enact legislative reforms to protect the American people"". ""America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,"" Mr Trump added. How events unfolded.

"The museum will show how fat is blocking London's Victorian infrastructure Part of one of the capital's biggest fatbergs is going to be put on display in the Museum of London next year. It is a slice of a monster fatberg, over 250m (820ft) long, which had been clogging up sewers below Whitechapel. The museum says it was a congealed concoction of ""fat, oil, grease, wet wipes and sanitary products"". The display will show how modern living and high levels of rubbish are putting pressure on the ""arteries"" of London's Victorian infrastructure. TheWhitechapel fatbergbecame something of a celebrity in its own right last autumn - with Thames Water fighting a nine-week battle against a ""rock hard"" blockage weighing 130 tonnes. This video can not be played Part of the fatberg was filmed by Thames Water engineers trying to remove the blockage The museum describes the fatberg's dimensions as being longer than Tower Bridge and as heavy as 11 double-decker buses. Curator Vyki Sparkes said it ""will be one of the most fascinating and disgusting objects we have ever had on display"". Why fatbergs matter? Victory declared over giant fatberg London fatberg fuelled by restaurants Thames Water's Stuart White says that part of its fascination is that it is the product of our own modern-day living, describing it as ""repulsively human"". There is an eco-friendly ending to what happened to the rest of the fatberg. It was chopped up and mostlyconverted into bio-diesel. Despite the name, fatbergs are actually mainly made up of wet wipes. They account for a startling 93% of the material blocking our sewers according to Water UK, the membership body for water providers. They collected samples to analyse from blockages in sewers, pumps and wastewater treatment works. Wet wipes - mostly baby wipes, but also those used to remove make up and clean surfaces - made up the vast majority of the material. Fat, oil and grease only made up 0.5%. The other 7% was made up of a range of other materials including feminine hygiene products, cotton pads and plastic wrappers. Toilet paper made up just 0.01% of the material blocking our pipes and sewers. Environmental charities including Greenpeace and the Marine Conservation Society say they are not surprised by this high number since wet wipes are often marketed as ""flushable"".

"This video can not be played University student Ryan Archer's love of gaming spiralled into gambling when he was 15 Thousands of children and young people are losing money on websites which allow them to trade virtual items, gambling experts have warned. The Gambling Commission's annual report,externalhas, for the first time, looked at the problem of so-called ""skin betting"". The items won - usually modified guns or knives within a video game known as a skin - can often be sold and turned back into real money. The commission says cracking down on the industry is now a top priority. The report found that: 45% of 11-16 year-olds were aware of ""skin betting"" 11% of 11-16 year-olds had placed bets using in-game items 59% of boys knew about the activity compared with 31% of girls Experts say third party websites enable children to gamble the virtual weapons - or skins - on casino or slot machine type games, offering them the chance to generate real money. Valve ordered to tackle 'skin betting' 'Remove gambling ads appealing to children' Some students 'have Â£10,000 gambling debt' Overall, the report shows that around 370,000 11-16 year-olds spent their own money on gambling in the past week, in England, Scotland and Wales. Most commonly, children were using fruit machines, National Lottery scratch cards or placing private bets. Bangor University student Ryan Archer's love of gaming spiralled into gambling when he was 15 and he became involved in skin betting. Four years later he has lost more than Â£2,000. ""I'd get my student loan, some people spend it on expensive clothes, I spend it on gambling virtual items,"" he said. ""There have been points where I could struggle to buy food, because this takes priority."" Ryan wanted to build an inventory of skins, but when he could not afford the price tag attached to some of them he began gambling on unlicensed websites to try to raise money. He said: ""It's hard to ask your parents for Â£1,000 to buy a knife on CSGO (the multiplayer first-person shooter game Counter Strike: Global Offensive), it's a lot easier to ask for a tenner and then try and turn that into Â£1,000."" In CSGO, players can exchange real money for the chance to obtain a modified weapon known as a skin and a number of gambling websites have been built around the game. ""You wouldn't see an 11-year-old go into a betting shop, but you can with this, there's nothing to stop you,"" Ryan said. Skins modify the look of a gun Skins are collectable, virtual items in video games that change the appearance of a weapon - for example, turning a pistol into a golden gun. Sometimes skins can be earned within a game, but they can also be bought with real money. Some games also let players trade and sell skins, with rarer examples attracting high prices. A number of websites let players gamble with their skins for the chance to win more valuable ones. Since skins won on such a website could theoretically be sold and turned back into real-world money, critics say betting with skins is unlicensed gambling. Sarah Harrison, chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said: ""Because of these unlicensed skin betting sites, the safeguards that exist are not being applied and we're seeing examples of really young people, 11 and 12-year-olds, who are getting involved in skin betting, not realising that it's gambling. ""At one level they are running up bills perhaps on their parents' Paypal account or credit card, but the wider effect is the introduction and normalisation of this kind of gambling among children and young people."" Earlier this year, the Gambling Commission for the first time prosecuted people for running an unlicensed gambling website connected to a video game. Craig Douglas, a prominent gamer known as Nepenthez, and his business partner Dylan Rigby, were fined Â£91,000 ($112,000) and Â£164,000 respectivelyafter admitting offences under the UK's Gambling Act. The men ran a website called FUT Galaxy that was connected to the Fifa video game and let gamers gamble virtual currency. Ms Harrison said the regulator was prepared to take criminal action, but said the ""huge issue"" also required help from parents, game platform providers and payment providers. Some games providers have put more safeguards in place, but many of the sites are based abroad. Vicky Shotbolt, from the group Parentzone said: ""It's a huge emerging issue that's getting bigger and bigger, but parents aren't even thinking about it. ""When we talk to people about skin gambling, we normally get a look of complete confusion."" She called on regulators to take more action over the issue.

"The museum will show how fat is blocking London's Victorian infrastructure Part of one of the capital's biggest fatbergs is going to be put on display in the Museum of London next year. It is a slice of a monster fatberg, over 250m (820ft) long, which had been clogging up sewers below Whitechapel. The museum says it was a congealed concoction of ""fat, oil, grease, wet wipes and sanitary products"". The display will show how modern living and high levels of rubbish are putting pressure on the ""arteries"" of London's Victorian infrastructure. TheWhitechapel fatbergbecame something of a celebrity in its own right last autumn - with Thames Water fighting a nine-week battle against a ""rock hard"" blockage weighing 130 tonnes. This video can not be played Part of the fatberg was filmed by Thames Water engineers trying to remove the blockage The museum describes the fatberg's dimensions as being longer than Tower Bridge and as heavy as 11 double-decker buses. Curator Vyki Sparkes said it ""will be one of the most fascinating and disgusting objects we have ever had on display"". Why fatbergs matter? Victory declared over giant fatberg London fatberg fuelled by restaurants Thames Water's Stuart White says that part of its fascination is that it is the product of our own modern-day living, describing it as ""repulsively human"". There is an eco-friendly ending to what happened to the rest of the fatberg. It was chopped up and mostlyconverted into bio-diesel. Despite the name, fatbergs are actually mainly made up of wet wipes. They account for a startling 93% of the material blocking our sewers according to Water UK, the membership body for water providers. They collected samples to analyse from blockages in sewers, pumps and wastewater treatment works. Wet wipes - mostly baby wipes, but also those used to remove make up and clean surfaces - made up the vast majority of the material. Fat, oil and grease only made up 0.5%. The other 7% was made up of a range of other materials including feminine hygiene products, cotton pads and plastic wrappers. Toilet paper made up just 0.01% of the material blocking our pipes and sewers. Environmental charities including Greenpeace and the Marine Conservation Society say they are not surprised by this high number since wet wipes are often marketed as ""flushable"".

Woody Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the disagreement was ""probably misinterpreted"". Mrs May had said Mr Trump was ""wrong"" to share videos posted by the far-right group Britain First, prompting an online backlash from the US president. Mr Johnson said Mr Trump's relationship with the UK was still ""very very good"".

"A fraudster who met her victim on a dating website for naturists scammed him out of Â£50,000. Moira Etchells, 45, met Ian Chatting-Tonks in 2013 and persuaded him to lend her the cash to start a business artificially inseminating cows. Swansea Crown Court heard she spent Â£35,000 on a new Land Rover and banked the rest. Etchells, of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, admitted fraud and got an 18-month sentence, suspended for two years. Widower Mr Chatting-Tonks, from Norfolk, went online to search for a new partner who was also interested in naturism, which is when he found Etchells' profile. He paid for her to fly to Alicante where she persuaded him to back a new cow insemination and hoof trimming business.

He sent her a total of Â£50,000, but became suspicious when she started taking longer to respond to his emails. When Mr Chatting-Tonks said he was going to visit Etchells in Wales, she claimed to have moved to Ireland. Dyfed-Powys Police began investigating and when caught, she repaid Â£50,000 in full after selling the Land Rover.

"Anyone who arrives before Brexit day on 29 March 2019 will have the right to stay. It will only take a couple of minutes for EU citizens to register online to stay in the UK after Brexit, Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has said. There would, he said, be a ""presumption in favour"" of approving applications when the process begins late next year and people should hear in two weeks. Rather than having to wade through 85 pages as in the past, he said there would be just six to eight questions. Theresa May has urged all three million EU nationals to stay after March 2019. A reciprocal deal,externalon the rights of EU nationals in the UK and British expats on the continent is part of the stage-one agreement approved by the European Commission on Friday - which is expected to be rubber-stamped by all 28 EU members later this week. Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? Brexit: All you need to know Mr Lewis told the Lords EU Justice sub-committee that Friday's agreement meant EU nationals worried about their future ""can be confident they do not have to do anything immediately"". When the application process for what the government has described as ""settled status"" begins, he said the system would be far simpler than those applying for permanent residency in the past have had to deal with. This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points ""The way we are looking to develop this is using online processes where somebody spends literally a few minutes online and within a couple of weeks your settled status is dealt with and granted,"" Mr Lewis said. Unlike other applicants, existing permanent residents may not have to pay a fee to apply again nor have to supply evidence that they are living in the UK. For those who don't already have indefinite leave to remain in the UK, charges will be capped at about Â£72.50 - the cost that Britons pay to renew their passports. The immigration minister said the Home Office always had a duty to be rigorous when it came to considering applications for permanent residency - which people are eligible for after five continuous years in the UK. But he admitted the current system was ""overly complicated and bureaucratic"" and the authorities' approach would have to change when it came to Brexit because of the sheer numbers of people affected. ""There is a presumption that they will be granted,"" he said. ""The only circumstance I can see someone not being granted settled status is if the criminal records check show they are a criminal, or if someone was trying to claim to be an EU citizen in the UK and they were not - a fraudulent application."" Ministers hope the new system will be up and running in the second half of 2018 and have pledged that those given settled status would have ""broadly the same rights"" as British citizens. But during the session Labour peer Lord Cashman called for all EU citizens who already qualify for permanent residence to be registered immediately under a fast-track process. And Lib Dem peer Baroness Ludford said a lot of existing EU citizens were experiencing a ""great deal of hassle"" and she questioned how the system would produce the ""nirvana of simplicity"" expected by ministers. Citing cases where EU citizens who had lived in the UK for decades had received letters asking them to leave, she claimed ""there was an attempt by the Home Office to create a hostile environment"". Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said existing rights enjoyed by EU nationals should be guaranteed. ""The government needs to give clarity on what it has agreed, and to stick to its word,"" she said. Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK?

"This video can not be played Odette has been waiting for a kidney and pancreas transplant for a year. In an attempt to make more organs available for transplant, ministers are proposing a radical change by moving to a system of ""presumed consent"". Current rules in England mean those willing to donate their organs, should they die, sign up to a donor register. A consultation,externalon the new system, which would see opting out of organ donation replacing opting in, starts on Tuesday. Wales has already adopted an approach of presumed consent. Scotland plans to introduce a similar scheme. Northern Ireland has also expressed an interest in doing likewise. About 6,500 people in the UK are waiting for an organ transplant. Every year, 450 of those on the waiting list die before the right donor is found. Emma was diagnosed with type-1 diabetes as a child. After nearly 30 years, the condition has wrecked her kidneys. Emma is on the waiting list for a transplant Every night Emma plugs herself in to a dialysis machine, and then nearly two litres (3.5 pints) of fluid is pumped in and out of her body, doing the job of her damaged organs. ""Everything I do is the dialysis and medical,"" she says. ""You get up, you come home and then you sit on a machine. ""That's all you do. ""I don't do anything else, I don't enjoy life, I don't have a hobby, nothing... so that's all I do."" With a young daughter, Emma relies a lot on her husband and family. And she still manages to hold down an office job. But, she says: ""You're tired all the time as it is, and it's like how much of this can I take, how much can you take being tired all the time? ""You want to do stuff - you need to do stuff - but where do you get the energy to do it? Where do I find that energy?"" It is still too early to say what impact the change in Wales has had, but so far about 205,000 people have signed the opt-out register, 6% of the population. The Health Secretary for England, Jeremy Hunt, says: ""The issue here is really we know the vast majority of people are willing for their organs to be used but the vast majority of people are not on the organ donor register. ""So it's about how we change that, and so the issue of presumed consent is one of the things we are looking at. ""But what we need really is to have much better communication inside families so people know what their family members actually want."" The percentage of all families who, if approached after their relative's death, consent to donation has remained stubbornly at 60-65%. It is rare for the family of a registered donor to object, but it is more common when people have not signed up or discussed it with their family. The donor system was radically overhauled in 2008, with the introduction of specialist nurses liaising closely with families. There were 793 deceased donors in 2007, and 10 years later that number had risen 78%, to 1,413. Meanwhile, the number of registered donors has risen 67%, from 14.1 million to 23.6 million. But the 2008 taskforce rejected the ides of presumed consent. Retired kidney transplant surgeon and former head of the UK's transplant services Prof Chris Rudge says: ""The key question is, 'Will it work? Will it make a difference?' ""And if the answer is yes, then that would be very good. But if the answer is no, then I question why we are going down this route. ""The only evidence I have seen is that it won't make any difference and it is not the answer to the problem, but there is a risk that it may make things worse. ""That is my starting point. I am not totally against it, but if I am right, it won't improve things. ""There is no good evidence it will increase the number of donors."" But Dr Afshin Tavakoli, a transplant surgeon at one of the UK's busiest units at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, says it's not the issue of presumed consent that matters most. ""It is very important that people talk about their wishes to members of their family, to their children, to their parents. ""The time can come at any time, for any one of us, and and at that moment our wishes need to be known. ""Members of the family have to respect that and they can only do so if they really know what we want."" Reality Check: Does organ donation without consent save lives?

"Nearly all the possible trading relationships between Britain and the European Union following Brexit would be less favourable than staying in the European Union, according to an influential US think tank. The Rand Corporation study said the worst option would be a ""no deal"". That would leave the UK economy 4.9% poorer by 2029. ""No deal"" would also have a negative effect on the EU economy, but it would be ""relatively minor"". The report said that even a ""soft Brexit"" involving staying in the free market would not be as positive economically as staying in the EU. Rand,externalplays a significant role in America, with half of its funding coming from the US government. In Europe it has advised the UK government on policy issues such as mental health, as well as the European Parliament and the European Commission. Did 'soft Brexit' just win? Failure to plan for post-Brexit borders 'reckless' UK warned on cost of 'hard Brexit' Its report argues that Brexit was likely to have a ""mostly negative effect"" on American interests in Europe, given the UK is a firm ally of the US in security matters and a supporter of free markets. ""An EU without the UK may be more willing to create barriers for non-EU companies, to the detriment of US companies and the American economy,"" the report says. ""In the development of EU defence policy, for example, the UK aim was often to ensure that EU measures did not undermine NATO and the strong transatlantic partnership."" That approach could change once Britain has left the EU. The Rand report said that there was only one option that would leave the UK better off outside the European Union: a comprehensive three-way free trade deal between Britain, the US and the EU. But the report admits that is an extremely unlikely scenario, given that the present trade negotiations between the US and the EU (the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) are not supported by President Donald Trump and are ""in a hiatus"". ""The analysis clearly shows that the UK will be economically worse-off outside of the EU under most trade scenarios - the key question for the UK is how much worse-off,"" said Charles Ries, a vice-president at Rand and the report's lead author. ""It is in the best interests of the UK, and to a lesser extent the EU, to achieve some sort of open trading and investment relationship post-Brexit."" Mr Ries is former US ambassador to Greece and was also principal deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs in the US between 2000 and 2004. Although the report says that a loss of growth caused by leaving the EU could in part be compensated for by free trade deals with other countries such as India and China, they would be difficult to execute. ""Since the EU has a political incentive to demonstrate that the UK is worse off as a result of leaving the EU (so as to discourage other departures), and some in the UK believe the costs of 'no deal' are low, there is a real risk that the parties - even while seeking to cooperate - will find themselves struggling to reach any agreement,"" the report says. ""Unfortunately for the UK, 'no deal' - or, indeed, any of the 'hard Brexit' scenarios - is the worst situation for the future, with significant losses in terms of economic growth."" The report says that many American companies invest in the UK because it offers open access to the EU. It argues that foreign direct investment (FDI) has been boosted by 28% because of the UK's membership of the EU. ""Our research indicates that a fall back to World Trade Organisation rules would reduce EU FDI inflow into the UK by about $7.8bn (Â£5.8bn). ""If the UK signs a comprehensive FTA [free trade agreement] with the EU, investment from the EU would fall by $3.4bn - a reduction of about 9% from EU membership investment levels. ""Signing an FTA with the United States would add about $3.2bn in FDI inflows for the UK from our baseline scenario, making up about one-third of investment lost due to termination of EU membership. The best option would be to conclude a three-way UK-EU-US trade agreement."" Rand says that once free trade negotiations start, ""several fault lines"" could emerge among the remaining 27 members of the EU, which may put the UK in a stronger position. ""These include the diverging interests of the countries that use the euro currency and those that do not, as well as the diverging interests of those countries that are net contributors to the EU budget and those that are net recipients,"" the report says. ""Interests could also diverge on regional bases. Northern European countries may seek the maximum possible free movement of goods while trying to lure the financial industry from London to their countries. ""Southern European countries may focus on securing a high financial settlement from the UK and preserving agricultural and fisheries policies. ""And eastern European countries may seek strong protections for their citizens currently in the UK. These differing priorities may come into play as trade-offs are made.""

"Oscar Pistorius (left in 2016) was found guilty of his girlfriend's murder in 2015 Former South African athlete Oscar Pistorius has been hurt in a prison brawl, less than two weeks after his sentence for the killing of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was more than doubled. The disgraced Paralympian was allegedly involved in a fight over the use of a public phone, a prison department spokesman told the BBC. Pistorius, jailed for 13 years and five months, sustained a bruise, he added. No other serious injuries were reported, the spokesman said. The making and unmaking of Oscar Pistorius Reeva Steenkamp, my friend Africa Live: More on this and other stories ""It is alleged that he was involved in an altercation with another inmate over the use of a public phone in the special care unit where both offenders are detained at Attridgeville Correctional Centre,"" the spokesman, Singabakho Nxumalo, added. The department has launched an investigation, in terms of standard procedure, to ""establish the facts and to ensure that appropriate action is taken as incidents of assaults are not allowed"", he said. The brawl took place on 6 December, 10 days afterSouth African prosecutors successfully argued Pistorius' ""shockingly light"" six-year sentence should be increased. Pistorius shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013 In November, the Supreme Court of Appeal gave Pistorius the minimum 15 years prescribed for murder in South Africa, less time already served. Pistorius was initially found guilty of manslaughter after he claimed he shot Ms Steenkamp dead through a locked bathroom door having mistaken her for a burglar in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013. But the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned the ruling in 2015, and found him guilty of murder.

"Brandon and Lacie died in hospital Five people are being questioned over the suspected murder of three children who died in a house fire in Salford. Fourteen-year-old Demi Pearson died at the scene of the blaze which broke out in Jackson Street, Walkden, at about 05:00 GMT on Monday. Eight-year-old Brandon and Lacie, aged seven, died in hospital, while three-year-old girl Lia is in a critical condition. Their mother, Michelle Pearson, 35, is in a serious condition. The blaze broke out at 05:00 GMT on Monday Demi Pearson, 14, was a pupil at Harrop Fold School in Salford Ms Pearson has been heavily sedated and has not yet been told her children are dead, a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) spokeswoman said. One other person was taken to hospital, while two 16-year-olds - Ms Pearson's son, Kyle, and a friend - who were in the house, freed themselves before fire crews arrived. Michelle Pearson is in a serious condition in hospital Police confirmed there had been previous incidents at the family's home. The case has been referred by GMP to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

"This video can not be played The blast hit during New York's rush-hour - this is how events unfolded The suspect being held after an attempted terror attack at New York City's main bus terminal has said it was in retaliation for US attacks on so-called Islamic State, US media say. Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant, was injured when a ""low-tech explosive device"" went off at the Port Authority terminal in Manhattan. Police say Mr Ullah chose the location because of its Christmas posters. Three other people suffered minor wounds in the explosion on Monday. Mr Ullah is reported to be in a serious condition in hospital after suffering burns when the device, which was strapped to his body, exploded in an underpass at the busy terminal. He told police investigators he had been inspired by Christmas terror attacks in Europe and selected the Port Authority bus terminal after seeing a number of festive posters on the subway walls, US media report. Mr Ullah said the planned attack had been motivated by US air strikes on IS targets in Syria and elsewhere, the New York Times reports. CNN separately reports that Mr Ullah also cited recentIsraeli action in Gaza after rockets were fired at Israel on Friday. Akayed Ullah is a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant A photo circulating on social media shows a man, said to be Mr Ullah, lying on the ground with his clothes ripped and lacerations on his upper body. Who is the attacker? The suspect's home in the New York City borough of Brooklyn is being searched. Neighbours tell the New York Times that they heard the sounds of ""big fighting"" coming from the home on Sunday night, the day before the attack. He may have been recently working at an electrical company, according to the New York Post. Mr Ullah emigrated to the US on a family visa in 2011 from the Chittagong area of Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi government says he had no criminal record in the country, which he last visited in September to see his wife whom he married two years ago. The visit lasted about six weeks, his uncle told the Associated Press, adding that Mr Ullah has a six-month old child with her. Mr Ullah's wife, who did not join him in the US, and other family members are now being questioned to try to understand how he was radicalised. This video can not be played NYC police commissioner: ""Suspect has burns and wounds to body"" Mr Ullah is believed to have acted alone in Monday's attack, Mayor De Blasio said. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said: ""This is New York. The reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom. ""We have the Statue of Liberty in our harbour and that makes us an international target."" US President Donald Trump has said Monday's attack, which followeda terror attack in Manhattan in October that killed eight people, ""highlights the urgent need... to enact legislative reforms to protect the American people"". ""America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,"" Mr Trump added. Earlier, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that if Mr Trump's proposed immigration crackdown had already been in place, ""the attacker would have never been allowed to come into the country"". The explosion occurred at about 07:30 (12:30 GMT). Andre Rodriguez, 62, told the New York Times: ""I was going through the turnstile. It sounded like an explosion, and everybody started running."" Another eyewitness, Alicja Wlodkowski, told Reuters news agency she had seen a group of about 60 people running: ""A woman fell. And nobody even went to stop and help her because the panic was so scary."" Nearby subway stations were evacuated, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal temporarily shut.

"Renters in Bradford get more floor space for their money than in many other major cities Spending Â£100 a month on rent in London secures floor space equivalent to a small garden shed, compared with nearly five times that in parts of northern England, new research shows. Data released to BBC News shows cheaper properties to rent in the capital ""simply don't exist"", letting agents said. Agents said people were compromising on where they live to make ends meet. The government said it was increasing spending on affordable housing. Data from 20 areas of England and Wales relating to two-bedroom houses and flatsadvertised on OpenRent,external, and shared with BBC News, reveals: Each Â£100 of rent for a two-bed home in central London gets about 3.91 sq m, smaller than the average three-person tent Bradford is the city where Â£100 rents the biggest floor area in a two-bed home - 14.83 sq m Outside London, Oxford (5.03 sq m per Â£100 a month) and Bristol (6.98 sq m per Â£100 a month) were the most expensive places in the sample The average two-bed home in rural Lincolnshire is Â£200 a month, compared with Â£1,691 a month in London Types of property for rent also vary in size. The average London one-bed flat for rent measures 51 sq m, according to the data. By contrast, in rural Shropshire and mid Wales, the average is 77 sq m. The amount of space you get for your rent is reflected in the space you get for your money when buying. TheOffice for National Statistics said 1 sq m of floor space,external- about the size of a red phone box - costs Â£19,439 in Kensington and Chelsea, while in Blaenau Gwent the same amount of space costs Â£777. Ed Stennett found renting with a friend was the only way to afford somewhere big enough For Ed Stennett Â£1,000 a month, almost twice the national average rent, should have been plenty. Yet when the app designer moved to central London from Winchester he struggled to find anywhere bigger than a one-room flat for his money. ""Winchester is an expensive place, but even there your money goes further,"" he said. ""When I was looking in London, Â£1,000 would get me a studio. ""For some of those it was little more than a room with a sink, a kettle and a microwave. ""Some of the nicer ones might have had space for a double bed, but nothing you'd call a living space. There wouldn't be room for a sofa or a TV."" The 22-year-old said a friend had got a job in London at the same time and the two were able to rent a two-bedroom flat in Bow. That costs Â£1,640 a month between them.The national average rent for a property in England and Wales is Â£926. Sam Hurst, spokesman for OpenRent, said: ""Despite cities like Oxford, Bristol and London being hugely expensive in terms of monthly rents, the properties afforded by those high rents are by no means luxury. ""Having enough room in our homes is very important to our wellbeing, but renters in the south of England are paying a huge premium for it. ""The result is that many in London are compromising on location or who they live with, just to make ends meet. ""Young families who can't afford to buy are in a tough position, since to find the space they need for their growing families, they are forced to move cities. ""Simply looking for smaller properties isn't a solution for renters in the South, either. Those properties simply don't exist."" Seb Klier, policy and campaigns manager for campaign group Generation Rent, said: ""The huge difference in rents around the country lays bare the failure to build enough homes in those areas that have the largest jobs markets. ""It may be much cheaper to rent in Shropshire or Northumberland than in London, Oxford and Bristol, but people are moving to these cities for work and need homes that are affordable. ""To fix this we need much greater ambition from politicians to build homes where they're needed, along with powers to control rents where demand is highest."" A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""We are fixing our broken housing market and making the rental sector fairer and more transparent. Overall rents are now increasing at a lower level than inflation. ""But we're determined to do more and that's why we have increased the affordable housing budget to more than Â£9bn and introduced measures to boost the delivery of properties. ""We're also delivering on our promise to ban tenant fees, alongside other measures to make renting fairer and increase protection for people.""

"Inflation rose to 3.1% in November, the highest in nearly six years, as the squeeze on households continued. TheOffice for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalthat airfares and computer games contributed to the increase. The most recent data shows that average weekly wages are growing at just 2.2%. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, will now have to write a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond explaining how the Bank intends to bring inflation back to its 2% target. Mr Carney has to write a letter to the chancellor if the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate is above 3% or below 1%. Will you feel the pinch this Christmas? House prices rise fastest in East Midlands In November, the Bank of England raised its key interest rate for the first time in more than a decade from 0.25% to 0.5%. However, it is not expected to announce a further increase when it publishes the results of the Monetary Policy Committee's two-day meeting on Thursday. Mr Carney had said that he expected inflation to peak in October or November. The last timehe wrote to the chancellor was in December 2016,external, after inflation fell to 0.9% in October that year. Mr Carney's latest letter will be published in February, when the Bank of England will also release its quarterly Inflation Report. It may be the highest rate of inflation for nearly six years. But that tells you not so much how high it has got but how low it has been for so long. In the past 10 years, inflation's peak has been 5.2% (in 2011). Tell anyone over the age of 50 that inflation at 3.1% is out of control and you're likely to get a scoff, followed by memories of the 70s and 80s. What they may forget, though, is that for most of that time wages were also rising - and faster than prices. The tendency of wages to respond to higher prices and outpace them seemed to follow an iron logic back then. Bigger price rises led to bigger pay rises, forcing many employers to charge higher prices to cover higher labour costs: the so-called ""wage-price spiral"". But those rules don't seem to apply these days. The breakdown of that logic is why we have a squeeze on living standards. It is also why the Bank of England isn't that worried about above-target inflation getting higher or even staying above target. In the City, a second rise in interest rates isn't expected until August next year. Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: ""It's quite possible that inflation is now close to its peak. But some of the latest surveys suggest that service sector costs and prices are rising. Given how dominant services are in the economy, this could feed through to inflation overall. ""That means that further interest rate rises are definitely not off the table."" The ONS said that although airfares fell in November - down 10.4% - the decline was not as steep as last year when they tumbled 13.4%. Data also shows that food inflation has picked up, especially prices for fish, oil and fats, such as butter and chocolate. Figures from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel released on Tuesday indicated that food inflation hit 3.6% in the three months to 3 December, the highest rate since 2013. It also noted that prices for butter and fish had grown as well an increase in the cost of fresh pork. Kantar said only a few items were cheaper during the period, such as fresh chicken and crisps. Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics, said that the rise in inflation had come ""at precisely the wrong time for retailers"". ""In the run-up to Christmas, the cost of living, now rising at the fastest rate in five years, remains uncomfortably high for households."" He said that food inflation ""is one of the most transparent indicators of living costs and often the catalyst to cut back on spending elsewhere"". However, he expects the inflation rate to now fall and could reach 2.5% by Easter. The ONS will announce employment data for the August to October period on Wednesday, which will include figures for wage growth. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, forecasts that average weekly wages have risen by 2.5% during the period. He said: ""With wage growth picking up we should see an end to falling real pay in due course.

"This video can not be played Odette has been waiting for a kidney and pancreas transplant for a year. In an attempt to make more organs available for transplant, ministers are proposing a radical change by moving to a system of ""presumed consent"". Current rules in England mean those willing to donate their organs, should they die, sign up to a donor register. A consultation,externalon the new system, which would see opting out of organ donation replacing opting in, starts on Tuesday. Wales has already adopted an approach of presumed consent. Scotland plans to introduce a similar scheme. Northern Ireland has also expressed an interest in doing likewise. About 6,500 people in the UK are waiting for an organ transplant. Every year, 450 of those on the waiting list die before the right donor is found. Emma was diagnosed with type-1 diabetes as a child. After nearly 30 years, the condition has wrecked her kidneys. Emma is on the waiting list for a transplant Every night Emma plugs herself in to a dialysis machine, and then nearly two litres (3.5 pints) of fluid is pumped in and out of her body, doing the job of her damaged organs. ""Everything I do is the dialysis and medical,"" she says. ""You get up, you come home and then you sit on a machine. ""That's all you do. ""I don't do anything else, I don't enjoy life, I don't have a hobby, nothing... so that's all I do."" With a young daughter, Emma relies a lot on her husband and family. And she still manages to hold down an office job. But, she says: ""You're tired all the time as it is, and it's like how much of this can I take, how much can you take being tired all the time? ""You want to do stuff - you need to do stuff - but where do you get the energy to do it? Where do I find that energy?"" It is still too early to say what impact the change in Wales has had, but so far about 205,000 people have signed the opt-out register, 6% of the population. The Health Secretary for England, Jeremy Hunt, says: ""The issue here is really we know the vast majority of people are willing for their organs to be used but the vast majority of people are not on the organ donor register. ""So it's about how we change that, and so the issue of presumed consent is one of the things we are looking at. ""But what we need really is to have much better communication inside families so people know what their family members actually want."" The percentage of all families who, if approached after their relative's death, consent to donation has remained stubbornly at 60-65%. It is rare for the family of a registered donor to object, but it is more common when people have not signed up or discussed it with their family. The donor system was radically overhauled in 2008, with the introduction of specialist nurses liaising closely with families. There were 793 deceased donors in 2007, and 10 years later that number had risen 78%, to 1,413. Meanwhile, the number of registered donors has risen 67%, from 14.1 million to 23.6 million. But the 2008 taskforce rejected the ides of presumed consent. Retired kidney transplant surgeon and former head of the UK's transplant services Prof Chris Rudge says: ""The key question is, 'Will it work? Will it make a difference?' ""And if the answer is yes, then that would be very good. But if the answer is no, then I question why we are going down this route. ""The only evidence I have seen is that it won't make any difference and it is not the answer to the problem, but there is a risk that it may make things worse. ""That is my starting point. I am not totally against it, but if I am right, it won't improve things. ""There is no good evidence it will increase the number of donors."" But Dr Afshin Tavakoli, a transplant surgeon at one of the UK's busiest units at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, says it's not the issue of presumed consent that matters most. ""It is very important that people talk about their wishes to members of their family, to their children, to their parents. ""The time can come at any time, for any one of us, and and at that moment our wishes need to be known. ""Members of the family have to respect that and they can only do so if they really know what we want."" Reality Check: Does organ donation without consent save lives?

"Black-legged kittiwake: Colonies are struggling to feed their chicks Overfishing and changing sea temperatures are pushing seabirds to the brink of extinction, according to new data on the world's birds. Birds that are now globally threatened include the kittiwake and the Atlantic puffin, which breed on UK sea cliffs. Meanwhile, on land, the Snowy Owl is struggling to find prey as ice melts in the North American Arctic, say conservation groups. The iconic bird is listed as vulnerable to extinction for the first time. ""Birds are well-studied and great indicators of the health of the wider environment,'' said Dr Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International, the IUCN Red List authority on birds. ''A species at higher risk of extinction is a worrying alarm call that action needs to be taken now. '' He added that success in kiwi and pelican conservation had shown that, when well-resourced and supported, conservation efforts do pay off. Snowy owl: Threatened by shortage of key prey Worldwide, over a quarter of more than 200 bird species reassessed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature have been moved to higher threat categories while a similar number have been downgraded. Seabirds are of particular concern, including Cape gannets, which are now classified as Endangered, and the Antipodean Albatross, which risks being drowned by fishing lines. Fishing pressures and ocean changes caused by climate change are reducing food supply for the chicks of  seabirds, while adults receive little protection when they fly over areas of the ''high seas'' that do not fall under the jurisdiction of any country, says BirdLife International. The kittiwake (Rissa Tridactyla, or black-legged kittiwake), which breeds along northern coasts, has declined globally by about 40% since the 1970s. Antipodean albatross: Bycatch in longline fishing is a major threat More than 70% of the British breeding kittiwake population is found in Scotland. However, there has been a dramatic decline, particularly in Orkney and Shetland and on St Kilda in the Western Isles. ""Some efforts are underway to protect important seabird foraging areas in international waters, but there is much more we could do around the UK to protect our internationally important and increasingly threatened seabird populations,"" said Laura Bambini, the RSPB Scotland's seabird recovery officer. Sandeels are a vital food source for breeding seabirds in the North Sea. The eels are threatened by rising sea temperatures and are also harvested by commercial fisheries. ""We need to ensure that the future management of the sandeel fishery is sustainable,'' said Dr Euan Dunn, the RSPB's marine policy specialist. Cape gannet: Fish stocks are depleted, so it is going hungry The other birds found in the UK to be placed on the IUCN Red List are: Atlantic Puffin European Turtle Dove Pochard Slavonian Grebe Balearic Shearwater Long-tailed Duck Velvet Scoter Aquatic Warbler. Elsewhere, the Snowy Owl has moved up the rankings from Least Concern to Vulnerable. The North American population has declined by 64% since 1970, as changing temperatures affect its habitat and prey. Collisions with vehicles and utility lines are also a threat to the owl, made famous in the Harry Potter books. ""Arctic biodiversity is under pressure from a number of stressors, including climate change, so hopefully the uplisting of the Snowy Owl as a flagship species will also draw attention to wider issues in this region,'' said Dr Burfield. Dalmatian pelican: On the rise due to added protection measures In Asia, the Yellow-breasted Bunting (Emberiza aureola), which is illegally trapped for food, has been uplisted from Endangered to Critically Endangered. More positive news comes from Europe, where Dalmatian Pelicans are recovering after conservation efforts. This year, pelicans on Lake Skadar in Montenegro had their most successful breeding season ever, raising 60 chicks. However, while two species of kiwi in New Zealand are now less threatened, the Kea is declining, in part due to tourists feeding the parrots with junk food like bread and chips.

"Several influential figures responsible for creating the internet have demanded that a controversial vote be cancelled. This week the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will decide on whether to repeal an Obama-era law that protects ""net neutrality"". It refers to the principle that all traffic on the internet is treated equally. The pioneers said the FCC did not know what it was doing. ""It is important to understand that the FCCâs proposed Order is based on a flawed and factually inaccurate understanding of internet technology,""the open letter read,external. Signees included several of the architects of the early internet and world wide web, such as Vint Cerf and Sir Tim Berners-Lee, along with Steve Wozniak, the Apple co-founder. Facebook and Google oppose net neutrality U-turn Regulator repeals US net neutrality rules The letter calls for the vote, due to be held on 14 December, to be cancelled due to what the authors regard as a lack of transparency and a refusal to listen to critics of the plan. ""The FCCâs rushed and technically incorrect proposed Order to abolish net neutrality protections without any replacement is an imminent threat to the internet we worked so hard to create,"" the letter states. ""It should be stopped."" Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is calling for net neutrality to be maintained The letter, signed by 21 notable people, was sent to the Senate's commerce subcommittee on communications, technology, innovation and the internet. This week could be pivotal in the history of the internet. Although it is yet to vote, there is no doubt that the Republican-controlled FCC will choose to end net neutrality when it makes its ruling on Thursday. Without laws protecting the principles, campaigners say internet service providers (ISPs) will have free rein to exploit new power by throttling certain types of internet traffic. For example, an ISP may decide to charge extra to use a service such as Netflix, or give a company an upper hand by not counting use of certain services when charging users for data bandwidth. Such moves are theoretical, but until now were prevented by law. Throttling The FCC believes the possible impact of the move has been exaggerated, and said the change in regulations would help improve competition and remove government meddling in the internet. It said the open market should mean users are not unfairly treated by ISPs - despite many Americans only having one choice of provider in certain parts of the country. In a move designed to allay fears of foul play, the FCC and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday announced new coordination to clamp down on unfair behaviour from telecoms companies. The FCC and the FTC, the government body tasked with protecting consumer rights, will jointly investigate any issues. Vint Cerf is known as one of the ""fathers of the internet"" ""Instead of saddling the Internet with heavy-handed regulations, we will work together to take targeted action against bad actors,"" the FCC said. The FCC's pledge reads that internet providers must be transparent in providing ""information concerning an ISPâs practices with respect to blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and congestion management"". That wording only seemed to intensify campaigners' fears. Chris Lewis, from pro-net neutrality group Public Knowledge, said: ""There is no comfort in this announcement from the FTC. ""Not only is the FCC eliminating basic net neutrality rules, but itâs joining forces with the FTC to say it will only act when a broadband provider is deceiving the public."" He added: ""This gives free rein to broadband providers to block or throttle your broadband service as long as they inform you of it."" Protests against the FCC's move will step up a gear on Tuesday. Campaigners havepledged to ""break the internet"" with floods of messages,externalurging people to contact their representatives.

"Roy Moore speaks at a final campaign rally in Alabama on Monday President Donald Trump has recorded an automated phone message for a Senate candidate accused of sexual misconduct, on the eve of the election. The president has thrown his political weight fully behind Republican former Alabama judge Roy Moore, who is vying with Democrat Doug Jones for the seat. Mr Moore denies claims by several women that he made unwelcome sexual advances, mostly when they were teenagers. The race remained too close to call in opinion polls. The eyes of the world are on Alabama Ten things Roy Moore believes Who is Alabama Democrat Doug Jones? A win for the Democrats could reduce the power of the Republican party, who currently hold just a two-seat Senate majority, to pass legislation ahead of next year's mid-term Congressional elections. While it is already difficult to pass legislation in the Senate, losing another seat would be a blow for Mr Trump, as approval must be reached by the majority of voting members. However a win for Mr Moore would be a victory for the president, who has been very vocal about his support for the Republican candidate. Mr Trump's relationship with fellow Republicans has been at times tense, with some launching attacks on both his character and his presidency. Mr Trump has previously blamed his own party for legislative failures. Tuesday's winner will take the seat held previously by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Allow Twitter content?

While endorsing Mr Moore, Mr Trump has pointed to the former Alabama supreme court judge's repeated denial of the allegations against him. One woman alleges Mr Moore molested her when she was 14. Another says he tried to rape her. Roy Moore accuser: I was a child At a rally on Monday night, Mr Moore reiterated his denials, again questioning why his accusers had kept quiet for 40 years while he held various political offices. Speaking alongside Mr Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, in front of a crowd which chanted the president's slogan ""Drain the Swamp"", Mr Moore drew heavily from the Bible. ""I want to make America great again with President Trump,"" he said. ""I want America great, but I want America good and she can't be good until we go back to God."" Mr Moore's wife, Kayla, defended her husband Mr Moore was joined at the rally by his wife Kayla who said that separate allegations last week that her husband was anti-Semitic were ""fake news"". ""One of our attorneys is a Jew, we have very close friends who are Jewish,"" she said. Mr Moore's campaign rolled out an audio message earlier on Monday with a recording of Mr Trump telling voters his agenda would be ""stopped cold"" if Mr Moore lost. At a rally in Florida on Friday, Mr Trump proclaimed his support for the 70-year-old conservative Christian who served in the Vietnam War. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Democrat Doug Jones is ahead by 10 points. No, Republican Roy Moore has a nine-point lead. The latest batch of Alabama opinion polls are having a difficult time contending with the idiosyncrasies of a low-turnout, mid-December special election, a scandal-plagued Republican candidate in a deeply conservative state and a Democratic base that, while small, may be intensely motivated. With so many variables at play, it will be tough to draw conclusions about the results of this election - but that won't deter anyone. A Jones win would not only be seen as a stern rebuke of President Trump, who has put his name on the line for Moore, it would make Democratic control of the US Senate in 2019 a much more realistic possibility. If Mr Moore prevails, it'd be a prize for the anti-establishment Steve Bannon faction of the Republican Party and an indication that, when it comes to a seat in the US Senate, ideology matters most for some. Back when Mr Trump named Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general last November, no one imagined all eyes would now be on Alabama. It makes for a fitting end to an entirely unpredictable year, however. Many other national Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have distanced themselves from their party's candidate. Richard Shelby, Alabama's other senator, said on Sunday he could not endorse Mr Moore because he found his accusers ""believable"" and the state ""deserves better"". The Moore team is banking on voters in the Deep South's staunchly conservative heartland refusing to pick a Democrat. This video can not be played Roy Moore: How Alabamans are defending the accused judge In Washington, a Democratic lawmaker has sent a letter to the Senate's sergeant at arms urging that Congress take steps to ensure the safety of teenagers working in the Senate page programme from Mr Moore's ""predatory conduct"". ""I believe my fears are well founded,"" wrote Wisconsin Congresswoman Gwen Moore, citing the multiple allegations against Mr Moore. Mr Moore has kept a low profile in recent days but he said in an interview with The Voice of Alabama Politics on Sunday that he had  ""never molested anyone"" and had been a victim of ""ritual defamation"". Democratic candidate Doug Jones accuses Roy Moore of hiding Mr Jones, a 63-year-old prosecutor, has spent the past week rallying African-Americans and held a series of rallies across the state on Sunday. On Monday in Birmingham, Mr Jones said the election was ""one of the most significant in our state's history"" and urged voters to ""put our decency... before a political party"". Mr Jones also accused his Republican opponent of hiding. Former President Barack Obama and ex-Vice-President Joe Biden have recorded robo-calls - telephone messages that can be played at rallies - for Mr Jones. ""This one's serious,"" Mr Obama said in his call. ""You can't sit it out.""

"Clive Lewis said he was ""taken aback"" by the allegation Labour MP Clive Lewis has been cleared of sexual harassment by a party inquiry, the BBC understands. The Norwich South MP was put under investigation last month after a party supporter claimed that she had been groped by him at the Labour conference in Brighton in September. Mr Lewis, the former shadow defence secretary, had always denied the allegation. He said: ""I am very pleased to be able to put this behind me and move on."" He added: ""I believe it right and proper that the Labour Party treats all allegations of bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct seriously. ""I want to express my gratitude to my wife, friends and constituents who have supported me during recent weeks."" The Labour Party launched its investigation into Mr Lewis after an unnamed woman told the Independent newspaper that he had groped her. At the time, Mr Lewis told the BBC he was ""vigorously"" disputing the allegation, which he said he had been ""pretty taken aback"" by. ""I don't as a rule at packed Labour Party conferences grope people's bottoms when I greet them,"" he said. ""It's just not how I roll, it's not what I do. ""Is the person mistaken? Have I given them a hug and this has been misinterpreted? I don't know. ""All I know is that I would not deliberately do that, do what's alleged. I completely deny that."" Announcing the conclusion of the case, a Labour Party spokesman said: ""After consideration of statements provided by the complainant and the respondent, the National Executive Committee's sexual harassment panel has ruled that on the balance of the evidence the matter should not be referred to a full hearing of the National Constitutional Committee.""

"This video can not be played The latest BBC Weather forecast with Philip Avery Drivers and other travellers are facing difficult journeys as icy conditions persist across much of the UK. The Met Office has a yellow warning for ice,externaluntil Wednesday 11:00 GMT, with the worst affected areas likely to be Scotland and the north of England. A ""flash freeze"" caused disruption at Glasgow Airport, with some flights cancelled or diverted to other Scottish airports after the runway froze. Hundreds of schools were closed for a second day. Temperatures in central and southern England remained only a few degrees above freezing throughout Tuesday. The Met Office's warning covers Wales, parts of Scotland and much of England - including the Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, London, the South East, East, South West, the North East and North West. How cold is it where you are? Why does snow close so many schools? 'Flash freeze' hits Glasgow Airport flights Schools in Wales shut again as snow turns to ice It said the chance of ice was highest across parts of Scotland and northern England where rain might fall onto frozen surfaces. Those areas were also likely to see a few centimetres of fresh snow on high ground. ""There will probably be icy stretches on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths with some injuries possible from slips and falls,"" the Met Office added. At Glasgow Airport sub-zero temperatures and heavy rain caused a rapid formation of ice on the runway and taxiways as well as roads around the airport. As a result, seven flights were forced to land at Edinburgh and Prestwick airports and four flights to and from London City Airport were cancelled. Operations were suspended at Glasgow for 45 minutes. It is back in operation but travellers are being advised to contact their airline before leaving for the airport. Travel may be disrupted over coming days as rain meets freezing temperatures and turns to ice on roads and pavements, said BBC Weather's Darren Bett. There remains a risk of snow in Scotland overnight on Tuesday, with a risk of light showers over high ground in northern England. Winds will strengthen over the course of Wednesday and Thursday, but temperatures will be higher than in recent days. Edmund King, AA president, said the service had rescued more than 140 people from snow and ice by lunchtime. He urged other drivers to slow down and leave more space between vehicles, and warned that opportunist thieves were stealing cars left defrosting on driveways and by the roadside. ""Give yourself extra time and don't leave the car running unattended to warm up,"" he advised. More than 350 schools in the West Midlands, some 200 in Shropshire and more than 300 schools in Wales remained shut for a second day. On Monday, more than 1,000 schools were closed - about 600 of which were in Wales. More snow and ice is forecast for the north of England and Scotland Horses were put through their paces at Newmarket racecourse despite the low temperatures Boats on the frozen Shropshire Union Canal at Market Drayton were going nowhere An estimated 190 homes were still without a power supply supply in the West Midlands on Tuesday evening. Heathrow Airport in west London said the ""majority"" of departures and arrivals would run as scheduled but advised passengers to check before travelling because of bad weather in Europe. Train travellers faced delays on their homeward journeys, with Great Western Railway, Greater Anglia and London Northwestern Railway all reporting major delays into the evening rush hour. Some Arriva Trains Wales lines were not running on Tuesday evening and the company expects delays to last until the early hours of Wednesday. Allow Twitter content?

"A UK government minister has said he is ""deeply uncomfortable"" about the prospect of Donald Trump's state visit, amid controversy over his tweets. Justice Minister Sam Gyimah said on BBC One's Question Time the US President would be ""divisive at a time when we are trying to unite our country"". Mr Trump's decision to retweet posts from a far-right group has prompted calls to scrap the planned visit. Theresa May has criticised the tweets but rejected calls to cancel. She saidretweeting from Britain First was ""the wrong thing to do"". John Pienaar: Can May manage Trump? Trump, Twitter and his 'filter bubble' The prospect of Mr Trump's visit - which would see him being hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle - was first raised by Theresa May in January 2017, soon after the president took office. No date for the visit has been set. It is at the invitation of the Queen. TheQuestion Time panel, made up of Conservative MP Mr Gyimah, Labour's Chuka Umunna, UKIP leader Henry Bolton, Economist Yanis Varoufakis and journalist Sarah Baxter, were critical of Mr Trump's retweets. But they were split over whether the visit should be cancelled. Mr Gyimah, a junior minister, said it was ""above my pay grade in terms of what happens"" but he thought the US president had ""definitely crossed a line"". Allow Twitter content?

"Roy Moore speaks at a final campaign rally in Alabama on Monday President Donald Trump has recorded an automated phone message for a Senate candidate accused of sexual misconduct, on the eve of the election. The president has thrown his political weight fully behind Republican former Alabama judge Roy Moore, who is vying with Democrat Doug Jones for the seat. Mr Moore denies claims by several women that he made unwelcome sexual advances, mostly when they were teenagers. The race remained too close to call in opinion polls. The eyes of the world are on Alabama Ten things Roy Moore believes Who is Alabama Democrat Doug Jones? A win for the Democrats could reduce the power of the Republican party, who currently hold just a two-seat Senate majority, to pass legislation ahead of next year's mid-term Congressional elections. While it is already difficult to pass legislation in the Senate, losing another seat would be a blow for Mr Trump, as approval must be reached by the majority of voting members. However a win for Mr Moore would be a victory for the president, who has been very vocal about his support for the Republican candidate. Mr Trump's relationship with fellow Republicans has been at times tense, with some launching attacks on both his character and his presidency. Mr Trump has previously blamed his own party for legislative failures. Tuesday's winner will take the seat held previously by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Allow Twitter content?

While endorsing Mr Moore, Mr Trump has pointed to the former Alabama supreme court judge's repeated denial of the allegations against him. One woman alleges Mr Moore molested her when she was 14. Another says he tried to rape her. Roy Moore accuser: I was a child At a rally on Monday night, Mr Moore reiterated his denials, again questioning why his accusers had kept quiet for 40 years while he held various political offices. Speaking alongside Mr Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, in front of a crowd which chanted the president's slogan ""Drain the Swamp"", Mr Moore drew heavily from the Bible. ""I want to make America great again with President Trump,"" he said. ""I want America great, but I want America good and she can't be good until we go back to God."" Mr Moore's wife, Kayla, defended her husband Mr Moore was joined at the rally by his wife Kayla who said that separate allegations last week that her husband was anti-Semitic were ""fake news"". ""One of our attorneys is a Jew, we have very close friends who are Jewish,"" she said. Mr Moore's campaign rolled out an audio message earlier on Monday with a recording of Mr Trump telling voters his agenda would be ""stopped cold"" if Mr Moore lost. At a rally in Florida on Friday, Mr Trump proclaimed his support for the 70-year-old conservative Christian who served in the Vietnam War. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Democrat Doug Jones is ahead by 10 points. No, Republican Roy Moore has a nine-point lead. The latest batch of Alabama opinion polls are having a difficult time contending with the idiosyncrasies of a low-turnout, mid-December special election, a scandal-plagued Republican candidate in a deeply conservative state and a Democratic base that, while small, may be intensely motivated. With so many variables at play, it will be tough to draw conclusions about the results of this election - but that won't deter anyone. A Jones win would not only be seen as a stern rebuke of President Trump, who has put his name on the line for Moore, it would make Democratic control of the US Senate in 2019 a much more realistic possibility. If Mr Moore prevails, it'd be a prize for the anti-establishment Steve Bannon faction of the Republican Party and an indication that, when it comes to a seat in the US Senate, ideology matters most for some. Back when Mr Trump named Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general last November, no one imagined all eyes would now be on Alabama. It makes for a fitting end to an entirely unpredictable year, however. Many other national Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have distanced themselves from their party's candidate. Richard Shelby, Alabama's other senator, said on Sunday he could not endorse Mr Moore because he found his accusers ""believable"" and the state ""deserves better"". The Moore team is banking on voters in the Deep South's staunchly conservative heartland refusing to pick a Democrat. This video can not be played Roy Moore: How Alabamans are defending the accused judge In Washington, a Democratic lawmaker has sent a letter to the Senate's sergeant at arms urging that Congress take steps to ensure the safety of teenagers working in the Senate page programme from Mr Moore's ""predatory conduct"". ""I believe my fears are well founded,"" wrote Wisconsin Congresswoman Gwen Moore, citing the multiple allegations against Mr Moore. Mr Moore has kept a low profile in recent days but he said in an interview with The Voice of Alabama Politics on Sunday that he had  ""never molested anyone"" and had been a victim of ""ritual defamation"". Democratic candidate Doug Jones accuses Roy Moore of hiding Mr Jones, a 63-year-old prosecutor, has spent the past week rallying African-Americans and held a series of rallies across the state on Sunday. On Monday in Birmingham, Mr Jones said the election was ""one of the most significant in our state's history"" and urged voters to ""put our decency... before a political party"". Mr Jones also accused his Republican opponent of hiding. Former President Barack Obama and ex-Vice-President Joe Biden have recorded robo-calls - telephone messages that can be played at rallies - for Mr Jones. ""This one's serious,"" Mr Obama said in his call. ""You can't sit it out.""

"Black-legged kittiwake: Colonies are struggling to feed their chicks Overfishing and changing sea temperatures are pushing seabirds to the brink of extinction, according to new data on the world's birds. Birds that are now globally threatened include the kittiwake and the Atlantic puffin, which breed on UK sea cliffs. Meanwhile, on land, the Snowy Owl is struggling to find prey as ice melts in the North American Arctic, say conservation groups. The iconic bird is listed as vulnerable to extinction for the first time. ""Birds are well-studied and great indicators of the health of the wider environment,'' said Dr Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International, the IUCN Red List authority on birds. ''A species at higher risk of extinction is a worrying alarm call that action needs to be taken now. '' He added that success in kiwi and pelican conservation had shown that, when well-resourced and supported, conservation efforts do pay off. Snowy owl: Threatened by shortage of key prey Worldwide, over a quarter of more than 200 bird species reassessed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature have been moved to higher threat categories while a similar number have been downgraded. Seabirds are of particular concern, including Cape gannets, which are now classified as Endangered, and the Antipodean Albatross, which risks being drowned by fishing lines. Fishing pressures and ocean changes caused by climate change are reducing food supply for the chicks of  seabirds, while adults receive little protection when they fly over areas of the ''high seas'' that do not fall under the jurisdiction of any country, says BirdLife International. The kittiwake (Rissa Tridactyla, or black-legged kittiwake), which breeds along northern coasts, has declined globally by about 40% since the 1970s. Antipodean albatross: Bycatch in longline fishing is a major threat More than 70% of the British breeding kittiwake population is found in Scotland. However, there has been a dramatic decline, particularly in Orkney and Shetland and on St Kilda in the Western Isles. ""Some efforts are underway to protect important seabird foraging areas in international waters, but there is much more we could do around the UK to protect our internationally important and increasingly threatened seabird populations,"" said Laura Bambini, the RSPB Scotland's seabird recovery officer. Sandeels are a vital food source for breeding seabirds in the North Sea. The eels are threatened by rising sea temperatures and are also harvested by commercial fisheries. ""We need to ensure that the future management of the sandeel fishery is sustainable,'' said Dr Euan Dunn, the RSPB's marine policy specialist. Cape gannet: Fish stocks are depleted, so it is going hungry The other birds found in the UK to be placed on the IUCN Red List are: Atlantic Puffin European Turtle Dove Pochard Slavonian Grebe Balearic Shearwater Long-tailed Duck Velvet Scoter Aquatic Warbler. Elsewhere, the Snowy Owl has moved up the rankings from Least Concern to Vulnerable. The North American population has declined by 64% since 1970, as changing temperatures affect its habitat and prey. Collisions with vehicles and utility lines are also a threat to the owl, made famous in the Harry Potter books. ""Arctic biodiversity is under pressure from a number of stressors, including climate change, so hopefully the uplisting of the Snowy Owl as a flagship species will also draw attention to wider issues in this region,'' said Dr Burfield. Dalmatian pelican: On the rise due to added protection measures In Asia, the Yellow-breasted Bunting (Emberiza aureola), which is illegally trapped for food, has been uplisted from Endangered to Critically Endangered. More positive news comes from Europe, where Dalmatian Pelicans are recovering after conservation efforts. This year, pelicans on Lake Skadar in Montenegro had their most successful breeding season ever, raising 60 chicks. However, while two species of kiwi in New Zealand are now less threatened, the Kea is declining, in part due to tourists feeding the parrots with junk food like bread and chips.

"The government has published a new law that says it must treat animals as ""sentient beings"" when it makes laws. Environment Secretary Michael Gove promised to ""make Brexit work not just for citizens but for the animals we love and cherish too"". The draft law also increases the maximum sentence for serious animal cruelty to five years in jail. The Green Party said the government had done a ""screeching U-turn"". Gove hits back at 'animal sentience' social media campaign The move follows last month's animal sentience ""fake news"" row involving a celebrity-backed social media campaign. After MPs voted not to incorporate part of an EU treaty recognising that animals could feel emotion and pain into the EU Withdrawal Bill, some widely-shared reports and petitions suggested it had been a vote against the idea of animal sentience itself. High-profile figures such as explorer Ben Fogle shared the stories. He later apologised for posting ""misleading threads"" but defended sharing details on ""important stories"". This video can not be played Animal sentience: Social media reaction to fake news claims In the aftermath Mr Gove hit out at the way social media ""corrupts and distorts"" political reporting and promised new UK legislation to ensure the principle of animal sentience is recognised. The draft bill says the government ""must have regard to the welfare needs of animals as sentient beings in formulating and implementing government policy"". Mr Gove said: ""Animals are sentient beings who feel pain and suffering, so we are writing that principle into law and ensuring that we protect their welfare. ""Our plans will also increase sentences for those who commit the most heinous acts of animal cruelty to five years in jail. ""We are a nation of animal lovers so we will make Brexit work not just for citizens but for the animals we love and cherish too."" Speaking in a House of Commons debate, Environment Minister Therese Coffey said that ""contrary to the fake news that was spread recently"" the ""direct effect of animal sentience"" was already recognised ""throughout the statute book"" but the new measure would put animals' capability of feeling pain or pleasure ""more clearly than ever before in domestic law"". David Bowles, the RSPCA's head of public affairs, said the plans were ""potentially great news"" for animals post-Brexit. He said: ""To include the recognition of animal sentience as well as increasing animal cruelty sentencing to five years into the new 2018 Animal Welfare Bill is a very bold and welcome move by the government."" Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, whose amendment to the EU bill sparked the debate about animal sentience, said the government had ""performed a screeching U-turn"" after previously insisting it was covered by existing UK law. ""There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that this legislation wouldn't have emerged now without the pressure of thousands of people who have taken action after the government voted against my amendment,"" she said. Labour's Sue Hayman, shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary, said: ""This is a rushed and haphazard attempt to backtrack on the government's mistake of not including animal sentience in the EU Withdrawal Bill. ""There are serious questions about whether this Bill is equivalent to current EU standards given that it does not appear to cover wild animals - giving this Tory government freedom to pursue their pro-fox hunting and reckless badger culling agenda across England.""
