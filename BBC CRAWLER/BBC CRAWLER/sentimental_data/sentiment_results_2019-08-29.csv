"Bethany Osborne moved back in to her parents' house with her children Oliver, 1, and Evelyn, 5, last Christmas Bethany Osborne left home at 19, but now, at 22, she's back in her parents' home in Romford, using their washing machine, eating food from the fridge and watching TV on her dad's Netflix account. ""I do my own washing if I get to the machine first. But my mum generally does it,"" she admits. The pile of dirty clothes is not just hers. She has a five-year-old and a one-year-old too. ""Buying the kids' clothes and food - I do it sometimes,"" she adds, but most of the time her mum's got there first. About a quarter of young adults in the UK aged 20-34 live at home, a figure which,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, has been growing steadily for 15 years. Many returning adult children enjoy home comforts such as cooked meals, a full fridge and cleaning, as well as their bills being covered by the ""hotel of mum and dad"", according to a survey by price comparison website MoneySuperMarket. The average cost to the hoteliers - mum and dad - has gone up sharply, meaning parents are sacrificing luxuries and holidays, the survey found. Mum and dad 'one of UK's biggest mortgage lenders' Housemates from hell - me and my 23-year-old son MoneySuperMarket found that last year, adult offspring were returning for an average of 9.7 months, while parents were incurring costs of around Â£895. This year, the ""kidults"" were staying longer - just over 10 months - and costing their parents Â£1,640 as the householders shouldered the water, heating and electricity bills, as well as paying for takeaway meals, toiletries and food. The price comparison site surveyed 500 adults who had moved back into their parents' home and 500 parents who had adult children back living with them. MoneySuperMarket's spokeswoman, Emma Craig, says parents are under huge emotional pressure to help children struggling with their finances. ""I think what we're seeing is more young people with more debt, so when they're going back to their parents', they're coming with higher student loans, probably credit card debt, maybe payday loans."" ""So the reason parents are paying more is they're trying to look after their children more. If your child comes home and you see them struggling financially, you feel more awkward asking them for rent or to contribute. It tugs on your heartstrings more."" Parents often end up doing the laundry of grown up children The survey found that 18% of adult children said they were moving back home because of debt, compared with 8% last year. Moreover, 12% said it was because they had lost their job, compared with 7% last year. This year, 27% said it was because they couldn't afford their rent, compared with 25% last year. On top of the day-to-day spending, parents reported forking out Â£1,886 on redecorating, buying new furniture and upgrading their wi-fi to accommodate returning offspring. In Bethany's case, she doesn't have any extra debt on top of her student loans, but her relationship with her partner broke down and as a trainee nurse she couldn't afford to rent an apartment on her own. With seven of them in her parents' house (including a 20-year-old sister home from university and an 18-year-old brother still at college), there is friction over the one bathroom and who should unload the dishwasher. But her parents seem willing, determined even, to shoulder the costs and help out, says Bethany. ""My mum feels obliged to, because it's like when we were little. She feels the three of us - me, my brother and sister - are like her little kids still,"" she says.

"This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian is heading towards Florida - the governor warns of a 'multi-day event'. A powerful storm threatening the Bahamas and south-eastern coast of the US has grown to category four, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) says. Hurricane Dorian has maximum sustained winds of nearly 145mph (225km/h). It is expected to grow even stronger, its centre potentially crossing the Bahamas before skirting Florida's east coast early next week. Reports from the Bahamas described tourists scrambling to leave before the closure of the international airport. States of emergency have been declared in Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina. Residents have been urged to stock enough food, water and medicine to last at least a week. Forecasters warn Dorian could be the region's worst storm since category five Hurricane Andrew killed 65 people and destroyed 63,000 homes in 1992. US President Donald Trump said he was monitoring Dorian,which he described as ""an extremely dangerous storm"" on Twitter,external. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Hurricanes, whose strength can range from category 1 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, tend to get stronger as they move over warm waters like those off Florida. By the middle of next week, forecasters expect Dorian to shift eastwards, putting the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina at risk. The NHC said ""life-threatening storm surge, devastating hurricane-force winds, and heavy rains capable of life-threatening flash floods"" are expected to hit the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama on Sunday. Jeffrey Simmons, the deputy director of Bahamas' Department of Meteorology, said storm surges of up to 15ft (4.5m) were expected. The country's National Emergency Management Agency believes thatdamage could be exacerbated by the fact that the storm's westward motion is forecast to slow,external- this would keep it over the islands for longer. A tropical storm watch is also in effect for a 120-mile (193km) stretch of Florida's eastern coast, with hurricane-force winds possible along the state's coast by early next week. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian approaches the Bahamas The coasts of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina are also at risk of strong winds and a ""dangerous storm surge"" during the middle of next week. Dorian's exact path toward Florida remains uncertain but millions of people could be affected, as well as holiday attractions such as Walt Disney World and President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Dorian is expected to drop up to 12in (30cm) of rain on the coastal US, with some areas getting as much as 18in. Tides in the region are already at some of their highest levels of the year, owing to a naturally occurring event. A new moon, combined with the coming autumn equinox, has created what are known in Florida as ""king tides"". These are likely to exacerbate dangerous levels of flooding, forecasters warn. Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis has announced an evacuation order for parts of Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands, both in the north of the archipelago. All tourists have also been asked to leave over the last few days. At a press conference, he begged residents to head for the country's main island to escape the ""devastating, dangerous storm"". ""I want you to remember: homes, houses, structures can be replaced. Lives cannot be replaced,"" he said, adding that 73,000 people and 21,000 homes were at risk. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

The governor has activated 2,500 National Guard troops, with another 1,500 on standby. Shoppers in Florida have been queuing around the block to snap up supplies such as medication and fuel. Some petrol stations reported fuel shortages, while a few shops had run out of bottled water. The coastal city of Miami ordered the removal of electric rental scooters from the streets to avoid any potential hazards. Officials fear the rental scooters, operated by firms such as Lime, Lyft and Uber's Jump, could be swept away by strong winds, turning them into projectiles.

Orlando International Airport announced it was halting commercial flights from 02:00 (06:00 GMT) on Monday ""out of an abundance of caution"". Tourist resorts in the city remained open, however.

"Doctors and NHS leaders have warned that a no-deal Brexit would make it ""likely"" there will be a delay in flu vaccine supply this year. They say the EU departure date coincides with the winter season in a way that creates ""a perfect storm for the NHS"". Major flu vaccine manufacturer Sanofi said delays in deciding what strains of flu to use in the vaccine mean over a million doses will have to be imported after 31 October. Vaccines are usually available for delivery by the end of August and throughout September, but the delay has had a knock on effect on the production schedule. These doses - which represent about 20% of imported flu vaccines - are specifically intended for under-65s in at risk groups (such as disabled people and their carers) as well as healthcare professionals, who are routinely exposed to the virus. The government said it was ""working closely with vaccine suppliers to ensure they have robust contingencies in place"". ""What we can see is we're likely to not have enough flu vaccine, we are likely not to have the flu vaccine coverage that we've had in previous years, and that is likely to have an impact on the NHS,"" Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, exclusively told Newsnight. In an open letter last week, Prof Goddard and other doctors' leaders warned the prime minister about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. They said that the government's ""EU exit strategy must include provision for different flu scenarios"". The government is yet to respond to the letter. He said NHS no-deal planners have ""done everything in their power to get ready. But there's only so much preparation you can do."" The government said: ""We want to reassure patients that our plans should ensure that supplies of vaccines remain uninterrupted when we leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances."" Different strains of the flu are used in the vaccine each year. Normally, the make-up of the vaccine in the northern hemisphere are decided in February by the World Health Organization (WHO). But this year, it took longer to identify which strains of the flu virus were to be included - and this had a knock-on effect on the production schedule. Moreover, the nature of the vaccine means doses cannot be stockpiled in advance of an October no-deal. This issue is thought to affect all of the UK's suppliers, including Sanofi. What is the UK doing to get ready for a no-deal Brexit? What could no deal mean for the Irish border? Do MPs have the power to stop no deal? A spokesperson for the company, Hugo Fry, said that in case all the ports were booked after 31st October, the firm has doubled its efforts to make sure it has booked space on aircraft as well as ferries. Even with these contingencies in place, the logistical process would have to run smoothly to ensure clinics have their vaccine supplies in time he said. Sanofi says it is confident that it has done all it can to ensure its flu vaccines arrive as scheduled. ""Unfortunately I didn't bring my crystal ball with me, but what we're doing is planning for what we think will be the worst case scenario."" Earlier this month, Newsnight reported thatdelays occurred during a ""dry run"" of emergency aircraft deliveries of radioisotopes used in cancer diagnosis and treatment.They are normally driven in on trucks. Vaccines shortages occur more often than they do for other medicines, because vaccines are biological (rather than chemical) and complicated to manufacture, Mr Fry said. When vaccine shortages occur health services might try to rush more doses into the country. But this ""might be difficult"" during the ""period post no-deal Brexit,"" he added. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said she understands measures have been put in place to minimise the risk of supplies being disrupted but that ""ultimately, we just don't know how things will pan out in the event of a no-deal. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said that there were already several signs of a tough winter ahead for the NHS and trust leaders were ""very concerned"". ""We are coming out of summer with record levels of demand for urgent and emergency care, leaving trusts struggling to catch up. ""We are seeing a severe level of flu in Australia and, on top of this, health services may be grappling with the 'new normal' of a no-deal Brexit."" What happens in Australia is taken as an indicator to the UK about what to expect, but it is not always reliable. Official data from Australia show that there were a higher number of cases of flu this year than in most of the previous five years. However, a similar number of people were hospitalised. Yet this year's flu has caused more deaths than strains in any of the past five years other than 2017, which was considered to be particularly virulent. Prof Goddard said: ""If there is a significant outbreak, or even an epidemic, it won't just bring more patients to hospitals, GPs and health clinics - especially older people and other vulnerable groups - but could also keep the very staff needed to treat them at home, with sickness levels rocketing at exactly the wrong time,"" Brexit: Health leaders issue new no-deal warning 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Pinterest to push vaccine searches to health sites LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

" By Saira Asher and Grace Tsoi  A political crisis has raged in Hong Kong through the summer and protest has spread to almost every corner of the territory - from suburban housing estates to neon shopping districts. It has, at times, spilled over into violent clashes. The protest on Sunday 25 August, in the working-class district of Tsuen Wan, came after the first full week without incident since June. Some had hoped that the worst of the violence was over. It did flare up, though, and with a new level of intensity. A warning shot was fired by a police officer - the first time a live round has been used since the demonstrations broke out in June. Also for the first time, water cannon  made an appearance. And a 12-year-old was among dozens arrested - the youngest detained to date. All of this has created a new sense of foreboding. This is the story of one evening in Hong Kong. Telegram chat has been translated and edited. Names have been changed Telegram chat has been translated and edited. Names have been changed  The Tsuen Wan protest began much like any other, with a group of people who wanted the city-wide outcry to be marked in their own neighbourhood. There is only one way that can happen - via the encrypted messaging app Telegram, where there are dozens of groups dedicated to ensuring the protest movement stays alive, stays strategic, well organised and supplied. Some groups - with tens of thousands of members - discuss strategy. Smaller channels organise protest logistics and provide live updates about marches, while individual channels coordinate supplies, first aid, and even offer to make posters. It was on Telegram where about a dozen or so strangers from Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan connected in June to organise the 25 August protest. One of them was 26-year-old Potter. “We never thought we would do it by ourselves,” he said, adding that none of them had done it before. Within days, those well-established Telegram groups for promotion, medical volunteers, supply procurement and even drivers swung into action for Tsuen Wan. There was even advice on how to negotiate with police to get permission to march. The supplies team collected 10 large bags of  water, bandages and other necessities, which had been mostly donated by enthusiastic residents. “Before the march, we had identified potential hotspots so we placed some supplies and protective gear nearby,” said Vita, a volunteer. “The movement can only become so big because everybody contributes in their own way,” Potter said. But he was quick to say that he was not a leader of the movement - in fact no-one could be called that. Protesters know it’s harder for the government to crack down if individuals can't be identified as faces of the movement. Their spiritual predecessor was the 2014 Umbrella Movement, which called for universal suffrage. Seventy-nine days of occupying central Hong Kong won no concessions from the government and put the movement’s leaders in jail. Umbrella Movement - October 19, 2014 Umbrella Movement - October 19, 2014 This time round, the popular messaging forum, LIHKG, has been used to make broad decisions about the direction of the movement. Posts are voted on by thousands of people, and whichever strategy gets the most votes is put into action. While Potter is helping to organise a peaceful march, most protesters know that violence will likely break out afterwards - as it has after many previous rallies. The hardline groups - those who form the frontline, facing police tear gas - are much smaller. Their Telegram chats are private. One hardline protester, who goes by the name Scorched Earth, said his group doesn't plan its moves much in advance. “We will fight every time there are clashes after protests,” he said. “This regime relies on the police force to maintain its rule. If we defeat the police, they can no longer avoid having a dialogue with us.” He believes there is a tacit understanding between the non-violent and more forceful camps. “They know something will happen next.”  Thousands of people streamed sedately in the pouring rain along the planned route, some 2.5km to the heart of Tsuen Wan. They chanted slogans like, “Heung Gong yahn ga yau”, which translates as “Hong Kong people add oil” -  but is used as an expression of encouragement to mean “keep going”. It has become one of the main slogans of the movement. Families with small children, the elderly and young adults mingled - but there were no police in sight, presumably because they knew, as with previous protests, that this is not where the violence would erupt.  A small group of young men set up barricades to block off part of a road from traffic. It was playful, lighthearted and one was just 15 years old. They had gone to great lengths to hide their faces. Since the start of this movement, protesters have concealed their identities. As well as using encrypted messaging apps, they have not given journalists too many personal details and avoided using their personal train passes for transport - for fear of being tracked by the authorities. Along the route, a family with two boys - aged three and six - handed out home-made rice balls. When the stream of people reached Tsuen Wan Park, the official end of the march, there was a sense that it wasn’t over. But no-one was sure where the focus might shift to next. “Hong Kong is now at a critical moment,” said one girl dressed all in black, as she watched the Telegram chats for live updates. Under a canopy, medical volunteers were making their final preparations in case things turned violent. “We are deciding on the positions of the patrol teams in case of emergency,” said Jonathan, a medical student who was among some 80 first aiders on the ground. Meanwhile, a few hundred metres away, on Yeung Uk Road - a major artery in the industrial neighbourhood - barricades were being set up. Hundreds of hardline protesters were gathering, wearing yellow hard hats and dressed in black.  Some of them had made their way over from the peaceful march. The hardliners believe escalating action and provoking the police is the only way to make the government take any action. They came ready to face tear gas and rubber bullets, their determination manifest as they dug up bricks from pavements to throw at police, and gathered metal gates and bamboo poles to shore up the barricades. Although these scenes are now common in Hong Kong, this hardline group has become increasingly militant. They have upped the ante every weekend. This time they came with petrol bombs.   A sense of anticipation swept through the crowd, as everyone got the next update on Telegram. “1650 Riot police is advancing,” the message said. As if on cue, the crowd moved towards Yeung Uk Road, to shout their support and watch the drama unfold. They arrived to find riot police arranged across the road in straight lines, their full-length shields forming a transparent bullet-proof wall in front of them. Anger surged through the front liners and bystanders, as well as those crowding the overhead footbridges. For many of those involved in the movement, the police have become a symbol of hate. Insults were hurled and piercing strands of neon blue light cut over the heads of the crowd, as a few protesters shone bright laser beams at the police - another tactic used to provoke and disorient officers. “Hong Kong police break the law knowingly,” someone shouted. There were chants of “add oil” and a deafening drum beat as people banged their umbrellas on any hard surface they could find. Suddenly, the hardline protesters rushed their barricades forward to within 50m of the police. Umbrellas out, they crouched behind the water-filled plastic barriers armed with bricks and metal poles. Some threw eggs, others poured soap and batteries on the ground to stop riot police from advancing. “We are just trying to express our feelings. We think the police are using force against protesters and journalists and we think we should speak out and stop this kind of madness,” said a frontline protester, his face fully covered. Then police raised a red warning flag - a signal that force would be used to disperse the crowds. Minutes later, a black flag went up, indicating tear gas would be fired. Police put on their gas masks, stood their shields up and prepared to fire. Police protocol dictates there should be some time between the warning and firing of the tear gas, to allow people to leave the vicinity. But the protesters were undeterred - the use of tear gas is routine now - and they put their own masks on. Twenty tense minutes passed, with more chanting, beating of umbrellas and taunts at police. “Now there are so many police,” said a male protester wearing a yellow helmet and a gas mask on the frontline. “We are a bit afraid and want to make sure those without gear will be able to leave safely.” As the first police tear gas rounds were fired over the protester lines, the protesters readied their own weapons - Molotov cocktails. As the smoke swept into the crowd, the first of many petrol bombs was thrown into the space between the two sides. Some protesters, armed with water guns, rushed to put out the tear gas canisters as they landed on the street. A man with a blue tennis racket, swimming floats on his arms for protection, started batting some of the canisters back at police. More threw the bricks and projectiles they had brought. Bamboo poles, metal barricades and signposts went flying towards police. Some used their umbrellas to catch tear gas canisters and lob them back at officers. A long-haired man fell to his knees as he breathed in CS gas, a component of tear gas that causes dizziness or difficulty breathing. Someone threw him a water bottle to pour over his face.  One student in her 20s who had earlier been on the peaceful march had little to protect her from the tear gas. It was her first experience of it. “I am not afraid. I am mentally prepared for it,” she said. In a nearby shopping centre, medical volunteers washed people's reddened eyes with saline and tended to protesters who were vomiting after inhaling the smoke.  Telegram lit up with a new warning, that water cannon trucks had been spotted in the area. This was the first time water cannon had been deployed in these protests, and some protesters retreated - unsure of their power. Telegram chat has been translated and edited. Names have been changed Telegram chat has been translated and edited. Names have been changed Most protesters held their positions. Many, crouching down, continued to beat poles or bamboo sticks on the floor and railings. Some had climbed on to an overhead footbridge and were throwing fire bombs and bricks from above. Dozens of police ran up the stairs to stop them. The main battle only ended when two water cannon trucks ploughed down the main street, followed by a line of police officers. The powerful water jets sprayed over the debris - canisters, bricks and poles - in the wake of retreating protesters. Despite the intensity of the 25 August confrontation on Yeung Uk Road, those scenes were not shocking for Hong Kong any more. What did shock everyone was what happened next.  Among the 54 people detained on Sunday - for unlawful assembly, possession of weapons and assaulting police officers - was a 12-year-old boy, the youngest person so far to be arrested. News of his arrest spread online. As he was being detained, he yelled out the name of his family members and their phone numbers. Later, we found out that a social worker had contacted them and he had been released on bail. In the hours after the stand-off on Yeung Uk Road, small groups of young men armed with makeshift weapons roamed the narrow streets of Tsuen Wan - streets too small for the water cannon trucks. At around 19:30, a group of police officers encountered a group of protesters. Holding up a shield, one of the officers fired a live shot into the sky. It was the first time live ammunition had been used in 12 weeks of protests. In an instant, five other officers drew their guns and advanced on the protesters. That picture - of this small group of police officers, eyes widened in the heat of the moment and guns held aloft - became a defining image of the night. As the police advanced, a middle-aged man wearing a vest and shorts and armed only with an umbrella, was kicked by one of them, as he knelt begging them not to shoot. Lam Yik Fei /NYT/eyevine Lam Yik Fei /NYT/eyevine Within minutes, the image was being shared online and was being described as an example of police brutality. It even drew comparisons with Tank Man of Tiananmen - the iconic image of a lone, unarmed man with shopping bags standing in front of an advancing row of tanks during the bloody Tiananmen Square crack down in Beijing 30 years ago. But a closer look at the footage of the entire incident, from several angles, shows the story of the 25 August 2019 was much more complex than that. In a statement afterwards, police said the officers had no choice but to defend themselves. Even after that stand-off, protesters fanned out to districts further away - they were seen in Sham Shui Po, Tsim Sha Tsui and the Cross-Harbour Tunnel. In doing this, they were putting into action the philosophy “Be Water” - which has emerged as a mantra in these protests. It has been taken from a famous line spoken by martial arts legend Bruce Lee to denote the importance of being fluid and adapting to different circumstances. In Hong Kong, it has become a rallying cry for protesters to be nimble and adapt to fast-changing situations. So, in a bid to outwit the police, protesters move swiftly to other parts of the city. As the evening of violence unfolded in Tsuen Wan, many residents of the housing estates there lined the streets - egging on the protesters and shouting their support. A small of group of protesters vandalised local shops they believed may be pro-Beijing - sparking fears that triad gangs, known to be in the area, may get involved again. At the end of July, white-shirted men, thought to be triads, attacked black-shirted protesters in the district of Yuen Long. In Tsuen Wan itself, there was a knife attack on black-shirted protesters just weeks ago. Meanwhile, in the district of Sham Shui Po, a solitary man was seen defiantly waving a Chinese flag outside a police station - two of the symbols most hated by protesters - provoking abuse from black-clad protesters. For his own protection - it appeared - police swiftly pulled him inside the station. The movement still has mass support in Hong Kong despite the routine disruption to the lives of those who support it. There is an understanding between the two types of protester. The more peaceful ones feel they must come out in large numbers because those who are more extreme are risking so much. Even though his peaceful march was marred by the violence that followed, organiser Potter said he wouldn’t distance himself from the more hardcore protesters because they share the same goals. “If we don’t have the courage to escalate our resistance, we will lose faith and be overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness.”      Publication date: 30 August 2019 ",Negative,0.02402089
"Mr Corbyn says Labour would not oppose a referendum if there was a ""legitimate and fresh"" mandate for it Jeremy Corbyn has said he would not allow a Scottish independence referendum ""in the formative years"" of a Labour government. But the Labour leader, on a visit to Scotland, said the party would not block a new poll at a future date  if there was a ""fresh mandate"" Mr Corbyn insisted independence was ""not the answer"" to Boris Johnson. His comments follow a row within Labour over whether a Labour UK government should seek to block a new referendum. The Labour leader was starting a three-day visit to Scotland in Dunfermline, speaking to local people about the fire at Woodmill High School. Mr Corbyn said: ""Boris Johnson's pursuit of a no-deal Brexit will be a disaster for the whole country. He is putting at risk Scottish jobs in manufacturing, food processing and service industries. His intention to suspend Parliament shows he is also a threat to our democracy. ""The best way to defeat Johnson is sticking together, electing a Labour government and allowing it to get on with sorting the Tory Brexit nightmare and introducing policies that will see transformative investment in Scotland's people, communities and public services. ""Scottish independence is not the answer to Johnson. Independence will only further prolong and intensify austerity and create more instability and chaos."" Clarifying Labour's likely response if the Scottish government formally requested a new vote on independence, he indicated it would be a question of timing. ""In the formative years of a Labour government we wouldn't agree to another independence referendum because we will be fully focused on these central priorities,"" he said. ""However, if at some future point there was a legitimate and fresh mandate, we wouldn't block it."" Scottish leader Richard Leonard is traditionally seen as a close ally of UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Scottish Labour has been opposed to another ballot on independence. But UK shadow chancellor John McDonnell re-opened debate on the issue during a visit to Edinburgh, saying the party would not stand in the way of a second referendum. Scottish leader Richard Leonard said he was in agreement with Mr Corbyn on the timing of a possible second ballot. ""Jeremy and I have agreed that, during the formative years of an incoming Labour government, we would not sanction a Section 30 order to allow a further referendum on Scottish independence to take place,"" he said. Mr Leonard added: ""It would also only be acceptable to a Labour government to allow a second referendum to proceed if it could be demonstrated that there was a fresh mandate for such a vote to be held. This would require a democratic mandate from the people of Scotland, which clearly signals the majority of people are in favour of a new vote. ""I do not believe that the conditions exist for such a move today, nor will they for the foreseeable future."" When Mr Corbyn spoke on the issue previously, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed Mr Corbyn's refusal to block a referendum. She said: ""It's perfectly legitimate to oppose independence, as he does, it's perfectly legitimate to argue against there being a second referendum. ""What's not legitimate is for Westminster to block a mandate as now exists for a second referendum, and to seek to block majority opinion in the Scottish Parliament.""

"Boris Johnson has promised a renewed effort to secure a deal with the EU before the Brexit deadline. The UK's negotiators will now meet EU counterparts twice a week in the run-up to a crucial summit on 17 October. It follows a backlash from MPs and opponents of a no-deal Brexit against the prime minister's decision to suspend Parliament next month. Former Conservative PM Sir John Major has announced he isbacking moves for a judicial reviewof Mr Johnson's plan. And another senior Tory, Sir Oliver Letwin, said MPs still had time to act to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal. As things stand, the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October with or without a ""divorce"" agreement. The EU said it expected the UK to come up with ""concrete proposals"" in the near future. A European Commission spokesperson said its ""doors remain open"" and insisted it had ""demonstrated our willingness to work 24/7 throughout this long process"". Brexit and Parliament: What just happened? How do you suspend Parliament? Will we see an early election? And other questions Sir John Major, who has previously threatened legal action against the prorogation - suspension - of Parliament, announced on Friday that he was backing campaigner Gina Miller's application for a judicial review of Mr Johnson's decision. This would ""avoid duplication of effort"" and was necessary because of the ""imminence of the prorogation"", he added. In a separate development,a Scottish judge has refused to order a temporary haltto the prime minister's plan. The previous government, under Theresa May, agreed a deal with the EU but it was rejected by MPs three times. Mr Johnson says, while he would prefer to reach a new deal, he is willing to leave without one - and maintains the UK will leave by the October deadline ""no ifs, no buts"". A number of MPs who oppose a no-deal Brexit are planning to take action in Parliament next week to force Mr Johnson to ask the EU for an extension to the deadline if a deal is not agreed in time. The PM's decision tosuspend Parliament for five weeks in September and Octoberhas been criticised as a tactic to prevent such action. But No 10 insists it is normal process to prompt a Queen's Speech and allow the new government to put forward its ""very exciting agenda"". Mr Johnson said he had been ""encouraged"" by the response from EU leaders but it was ""now time for both sides to step up the tempo"". He also said he had seen ""a willingness to talk about alternatives to the anti-democratic backstop"". The backstop - a controversial back-up plan to prevent a hard border in Ireland if no post-Brexit trade deal is agreed - is likely to be at the forefront of the twice-weekly discussions between Brussels and the prime minister's lead negotiator, David Frost. But Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Coveney, said it was up to the UK to ""propose alternatives that can solve those problems"". MPs are remaining tight-lipped about their precise plan to stop a no deal. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the party would attempt to bring legislation as soon as Parliament returns, and that a no-confidence vote to bring down the government remains an option. BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said a cross-party group of MPs was planning a ""surgical strike"", involving an emergency debate on Tuesday and a vote to take control of the Commons agenda the following day. That could prevent Chancellor Sajid Javid from carrying out his spending review, scheduled for Wednesday. It is also thought some MPs are exploring ways of ensuring Parliament can meet on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday before the planned suspension. This video can not be played Oliver Letwin says PM must get a deal or seek extension Sir Oliver said, despite Mr Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament, he still believed MPs had time to prevent a no-deal scenario. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I hope that Parliament will take a series of actions in a proper, orderly way that means, by the end of the week, Boris Johnson knows that as prime minister he has the backing of many of us to get a deal. ""But if he doesn't get a deal, he is going to have to seek an extension."" More on how MPs could block a no-deal Brexit Do MPs have the power to stop no deal? Shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti also told the programme she believed there was now enough support among MPs to stop no deal, saying the numbers had been ""strengthened"" by rebel Conservatives following the prorogation announcement. But their plan also faces possible challenges in the House of Lords, where Brexiteers could table multiple amendments as a delaying tactic until the shutdown begins. However, Lord Lisvane - the former clerk of the House of Commons - told Today he believed the Lords ""would be very cautious about seeking to kill a bill which had actually been passed by an elected house"". Within days we will know if the MPs who are implacably opposed to leaving the EU without a deal can really stop that happening. With lots of former ministers on the backbenches, the group which is openly fighting against the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal has a different complexion. But given Boris Johnson's main reason for success in the Tory leadership election was to leave the EU whatever it takes at the end of October, it is a pretty major goal for a group of backbenchers and opposition politicians. Read the full analysis There has been outrage from all sides of the House about prorogation, with Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group for Change and the Green Party releasing a joint statement to condemn it as ""undemocratic"". Some Tories have also condemned the decision, with government whip Lord Youngresigning in protest. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the idea it was some kind of constitutional outrage was ""nonsense"", and the public wanted to see the government getting on with things other than Brexit. This video can not be played BBC Radio 5 Live listeners have given their reaction to the suspension of Parliament. The planned suspension triggered protests across the country, with further demonstrations expected this weekend. Meanwhile, an e-petition on Parliament's website against the suspension reached more than 1.5 million signatures. What happens now that a deal's been done?

"  By Hugo  Bachega It was about 14:30 on 14 May when Jean Rodrigo da Silva Aldrovande pulled up on Carmen Cintra, a street in a poor district in northern Rio de Janeiro. Few in Alemão actually know Carmen Cintra by its name. Many call it Rua Do Rio, or River Street, because of the polluted stream that runs there, dividing it in two. It was an ordinary day for Jean Rodrigo. The popular Brazilian jiu-jitsu teacher was about to give a class to youngsters at a social project, just as he had been doing for years. He arrived with his eldest son, Juan, and a student, Thiago. Jean Rodrigo parked in his usual spot near the stream and as Juan, 17, went inside to get himself ready, Thiago, 18, waited to help him take in some boxes. It was a warm winter day and Jean Rodrigo was shirtless, having yet to change into his kimono. He was in good spirits. Hours earlier, his martial arts “master” had invited him to referee at a competition, an unexpected honour for a brown belt. Jean Rodrigo with his wife, Andrea Jean Rodrigo with his wife, Andrea  The normally busy street was quiet, and as teacher and student unloaded the car, a police vehicle arrived. Four officers rushed out and positioned themselves on the same side of the street as Jean Rodrigo and Thiago. On the other side of the street, Thiago saw a boy with a rifle. It all happened very quickly. There was no time to run. Having lived most of his life in Alemão, Jean Rodrigo probably knew what was going to happen. Thiago said he had shouted to him “Get down! Get down!” As they both sought cover beside Jean Rodrigo’s car and another parked behind it, the shots came fast. When Thiago realised he had been injured in the leg, he desperately called out to Jean Rodrigo for help: “Teacher, teacher.” But there was no reply. Shot in the head, Jean Rodrigo died instantly with the car keys still in his hand. By the time his wife Andrea Rios arrived at the scene some two hours later, Jean Rodrigo’s body had been covered by a blanket. A group had gathered around it, and there they stayed in a circle into the late evening. Jean Rodrigo had discovered jiu-jitsu almost by accident. When he was young, he had worked as a cleaner at a small gym, and every day after work he would quietly sit by the mat to watch the martial arts classes he could not afford. Over time, he picked up a few moves, saved some money to be properly coached, and eventually became a teacher himself. His family paint a portrait of a well-liked man who offered help in the gym and outside, with words of advice. He had no involvement with gangs, they say, nor had he ever been arrested. “Samurai”, as he was known, often told the students - and his four children - that jiu-jitsu could take them “from Alemão to the world”. He knew that for many of them, it could be very much either this or falling into a life of crime. It is easy to see why. The graffiti on the houses in Alemão celebrate the powerful group of drug traffickers Red Command, or Comando Vermelho, leaving no doubt about who is the authority here. Jean Rodrigo (sitting, centre) with fellow jiu jitsu enthusiasts Jean Rodrigo (sitting, centre) with fellow jiu jitsu enthusiasts I meet Andrea for the first time six weeks after Jean Rodrigo’s death, a day after he would have turned 40. The couple had got together on Brazil’s Valentine’s Day - 12 June - in 2018, and had quickly become “like husband and wife”, she says. The house they had shared, not far from Alemão, belonged to Andrea’s grandmother. It was so small that the living room was the only place they could put the fridge. On it was an old magnet that read: Peace. “Everybody knows it’s a violent area, and that’s why Jean Rodrigo wanted the project there,” Andrea says. “It was the only opportunity these children have.” He was a reference point for many of them, she says, and some called him late at night or at weekends, ""sometimes crying”, looking for guidance. Maneco Team, the martial arts project, had some nine students when Jean Rodrigo started it in 2012; seven years later, there were about 90. The club mainly relied on donations, scarce at the best of times. Classes were held in a room with high walls and peeling paint. Often students would get water from the taxi stand across the street because they could not get their ageing drinking fountain fixed. Kimonos were handed down when they had been grown out of, or someone had scraped the money together for a new one. Jean Rodrigo, Andrea says, had warned her right from the start that his life was all about Brazilian jiu-jitsu. This type of martial art, based on taking the fight to the ground, is now popular around the world and earlier this year a friend offered Jean Rodrigo the chance to do some coaching in Abu Dhabi. But he turned it down. “Who was he going to help there? People need help here,” Andrea says. “He said: ‘My place is here, in Brazil, at Alemão.’” The Maneco Team received funding from the federal government, just enough to pay Jean Rodrigo 950 reais ($250; £200) a month. It was not a lot, but he still used some of it to cover the fees for his students at competitions. Jean Rodrigo himself competed and, in April, won a bronze medal at a regional championship. He was getting ready for two bigger tournaments in May, including a national competition. His main income came from delivering gas bottles with his father early in the morning. There were times when he could not pay for either petrol for his car or the bus ticket to go to the lessons. So he would go by foot, and that meant walking for well over an hour under a sun that spares no-one. “He lived for this,” says Diego, his brother. On the day of his death, Jean Rodrigo had spent a rare morning with his wife at home. He was “euphoric” after the phone call asking him to be a referee, says Andrea. “He was joking, making hand gestures referees usually do, saying to me: ‘You’ve been penalised!’ It was his dream.” How Jean Rodrigo was killed is not yet completely clear, but Andrea is certain that he was shot by the police. “You think a lot of things. Was it because he was black? At the entrance to a favela? Was he mistaken for someone else? They could have asked for his ID. He was a law-abiding citizen. Why did they shoot him?” In an account of the events Thiago sent to the family on WhatsApp, he says he and Jean Rodrigo lay on the ground next to the car. “I don’t know whether the police positioned their rifle under the car... and shot [at us] thinking we were criminals. I heard a lot of shots. They fired under the car [towards] where we were.” Diego was one of the first to arrive at the scene. There, he says, he found four empty rifle bullet casings where the officers had positioned themselves, 3-5m (10-16ft) from where Jean Rodrigo and Thiago had hidden. There were bullet marks in the gutter near where they had been crouching, he adds. When Juan came out of the gym and saw his father’s motionless body on the ground, he shouted to the policemen “You’ve shot a resident, you’ve shot a resident,” Diego says, but the officers got back in their car and left. As word spread in Alemão that their coach had been killed, the impromptu gathering around Jean Rodrigo’s body grew into a protest against what was seen as another police killing.  There are hundreds of favelas in Rio, possibly even 1,000. Experts say decades of state neglect have allowed gangs to flourish, and in many of them they are the de facto rulers. The police presence is so weak that when they do come, it is often to conduct operations. Gun battles are almost the norm. For a long time Alemão, a maze of more than a dozen slums built on hill slopes, was considered one of the city’s most dangerous. Ten years or so ago, before Rio hosted the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games, there was hope that things could finally change as government programmes brought much-needed policing and social services to some areas, leading to a drop in crime. But money for these projects practically ended as recession took hold in Brazil in 2014. Violence spiked, and the federal government temporarily intervened last year. In an unprecedented decision, the army was put in charge of security. While there was a reduction in some types of crime, critics still question whether it has had any long-term impact. Last October, Wilson Witzel, a 51-year-old conservative former judge and marine, was elected governor of Rio de Janeiro state, promising to be tough on crime. During his campaign, he said the authorities would “dig graves” to bury criminals if necessary. Days after being elected, he vowed to “slaughter” anyone caught carrying a rifle. “The police will do the right thing,” he told a newspaper, “aim at their little heads and fire! So there’s no mistake.” Legal experts argue that shooting at people is unlawful if officers are not acting in self-defence. Witzel has an ally in Brazil’s far-right PresidentJair Bolsonaro, a former army captain and congressman for Rio, who also took office in January. They agree on many things, including that officers should not face charges if they kill on duty.    “A policeman who doesn’t kill,” Bolsonaro once said, “isn’t a policeman.” Wilson Witzel and President Jair Bolsonaro Wilson Witzel and President Jair Bolsonaro Bolsonaro, whose trademark gesture is a weapon with his thumb and index finger, has also worked to ease citizens’ access to guns so, he says, they will be able to defend themselves. Under Witzel’s watch, police raids in the greater Rio area increased 42% between March and June, according to a study by Rede de Observatórios de Segurança, or Security Observatory Network, a national group of researchers. The raids often take place in densely populated favelas, with large numbers of officers, heavy weapons, armoured vehicles and even helicopters with snipers. While I was in Rio, I downloaded the app Fogo Cruzado (Crossfire) which monitors operations and shootings and is frequently used by residents to avoid risky areas. I was alarmed by how frequent these raids were. Between January and July, police operations resulted in 1,075 deaths, an average of five per day, the highest number since official records began 20 years ago. Most of those who die are male, black and young. And while many are suspected criminals who have died in confrontations, there is also an unknown number of unarmed people and bystanders among the victims. “Both the state and federal governments are openly encouraging the killings of people,” says Dr Ignacio Cano, a professor of sociology at the State University of Rio (UERJ), and one of Brazil’s leading experts on violence. “In the past it was a more masked, subtler incentive. Today, it has become official policy.” In June, a television programme showed several armed men walking freely in Cidade de Deus, the favela in western Rio made famous by the movie City of God. All the while, children in  uniform appeared to be making their way to school. “In other parts of the world,” Witzel said, referring to the images during a speech to announce the expansion of a security programme, “we’d be allowed to send a missile to blow those [suspects] up.” He was applauded. While most of the battles between police and heavily-armed criminals have taken place on the streets of the favelas, Witzel, who had no previous political experience before becoming governor, has not hidden his enthusiasm for putting police marksmen in the sky. In May, he posted a video of himself on Twitter aboard a helicopter next to a sniper saying: “We’ll put an end to banditry... It’s over!” Snipers on police helicopters - popularly called “caveirão voador”,or “flying big skull” after the name for armoured police vehicles, “caveirão” - opened fire in 11 operations in the first six months of this year across Rio, according to Fogo Cruzado. Wilson Witzel Wilson Witzel One morning in Maré, Rio’s largest favela complex, Douglas Oliveira was working at the local library overseeing some children when he heard the sound of fireworks, the usual warning given by criminals that the police were about to launch a raid. As he left the building with a young girl, he saw a police helicopter with a sniper. “It shot in my direction. They didn’t care,” Oliveira, 24, says. “I started to pray. I thought about running.” But if he had run, he says, he thought he could have been mistaken for a suspect and become a direct target. So he kept walking, terrified, until he finally arrived at a nearby community activist office. A non-profit group based in the same favela, Redes da Maré, posted a video showing at least 19 bullet marks on the ground, which had allegedly been caused by a sniper on board a police helicopter in May. After the operation, the director of a school in the area posted pictures of a huge sign she had put on its roof two years ago, reading: “School. Don’t shoot.” Snipers, Witzel said, had also been deployed on the ground in undisclosed locations across the state. When asked by a newspaper about how many people had been shot dead, he said he had “no idea” because it was not his job to keep a tally of who was being killed by the police. Following Witzel’s video on the helicopter, Renata Souza, an opposition state parliamentarian, called on the United Nations to investigate the operations, saying the governor was personally leading a “policy of massacre”. She had already made a similar request to the Organization of American States. Renata Souza Renata Souza  “We don’t have the death penalty,” Souza, who also heads the Human Rights Commission at Rio State Assembly, tells me, “but Witzel is making this the policy in favelas and suburbs.” A month later, federal prosecutors said officers who had opened fire from helicopters would be investigated for possible crimes. At the protest next to Jean Rodrigo’s body after his death, friends took turns to pay emotional tributes. “We won’t forget the things he did,” one man told the crowd, “we need to keep [him] in our hearts.” Another said: “We have to continue what he started.” By the evening, journalists had gathered at the scene. Jean Rodrigo’s mother Sandra gave an emotional interview, saying: “When will [Witzel’s] police stop killing our sons? Ask Witzel. When will the police stop killing workers? Fathers?” Witzel himself described Jean Rodrigo’s death as “sad”. “It won’t end in impunity… Those found responsible will be tried in the courts,” he wrote on Twitter a day later. The governor’s words were “beautiful”, says Andrea, but not enough. “Nothing will bring [Jean Rodrigo] back, but at the least it can’t remain unsolved.” The police, she says, have not yet told her anything about what happened that day. Rio’s military police department said in an email to the BBC that four military officers who were in a patrol car had come under fire near the Carmen Cintra street by two armed men on two motorbikes. After a gunfight, they returned to the police station, unaware that people had been hit. But investigating cases involving the police is not easy. Paulo Roberto Mello Cunha, a state prosecutor, leads a team that looks into allegations of police violence, but mostly there is not a lot it can do. “You have to count on the police to investigate the police,” he says. “I don’t do forensics, for example.” States in Brazil have two separate police forces - the military force in charge of public order, and the civil force to carry out forensics and investigations. Apart from the chronic lack of personnel and resources, Cunha’s team often struggles with inadequate evidence from crime scenes that have not been preserved, sometimes intentionally. There are frequent claims from relatives and activists of people being taken to hospital already dead in alleged attempts by officers to cover up possible wrongdoing, or even of guns and drugs being put next to victims’ bodies as ways to incriminate them. I was told that residents and Jean Rodrigo’s relatives had gathered next to his body to protect the area until the forensics team arrived. His family also quickly released his pay cheque from the federal government and his jiu-jitsu certificates, hoping it would demonstrate that he was a working man with no links with criminals. Often, fearful witnesses remain silent and prosecutors reject taking on investigations, aware that they could become targets. Cunha himself has been given bodyguards after he and his family received threats. “We rarely have a proper investigation,” he says. “Sometimes it works. Depending on the stars, it’ll work. But that’s not the rule.” Since 2016, when his group was set up, they have investigated some 1,300 cases. Charges have been pressed in less than 5% of them. “Before, we had 0% of the cases, so I think we’re building something,” he says. “The bar is pretty low.” “I won’t backtrack,” Witzel said in August, arguing his government was “in the right way”. Proof of this, he said, was the drop in homicides - there were 2,392 cases in the state between January and July, a drop of 23% from 2018. Violent thefts and robberies are also falling, while the police have seized large amounts of drugs and weapons. The Red Command - Rio’s largest drug gang, controlling a vast number of neighbourhoods - was even running out of ammunition, Witzel claimed. He also said that drug traffickers should be legally defined as terrorists, with harsher sentences. “You can’t combat terrorism with flowers,” he said last month. “The message has been sent: Don’t fight the police.” It is not yet clear whether the improvements celebrated by Witzel are a direct result of his policies, experts say. The fall in the homicide rate, in particular, appears to follow a national trend - official numbers suggest 6,543 cases nationwide between January and February, a 20% drop on the same time last year. While Witzel has focused on drug traffickers, critics say he has downplayed the threat from violent paramilitary groups created by policemen, active and retired, known as milícias. None of the deaths in police operations between January and June occurred in districts where they are active, according to UOL Notícias, a news website. Witzel’s office did not respond to requests for an interview. Outside Rio’s poorest districts, there is some support for Witzel’s policies, as frightened residents despair of seeing an end to the violence. “We have to kill those boys,” one resident of Barra da Tijuca, a fashionable seaside neighbourhood where President Bolsonaro has a private residence, tells me, referring to drug traffickers. When I say innocent people are also being killed, he replies: “It’s the price!” The police were responsible for almost a third of all violent deaths - essentially any death that is not accidental or natural - in Rio de Janeiro between January and July, according to the state’s Institute for Public Safety. Parliamentarian Renata Souza says there is “widespread fear” that extrajudicial executions are being carried out. “There are operations in which the killings are indiscriminate... These are massacres committed by the state.” In February, residents of Fallet-Fogueteiro in the centre of Rio said nine men were tortured and stabbed by officers in a house, killed even after they had surrendered. Police said the suspects had responded with gunfire when they arrived, and the residence reportedly had 182 bullet holes on it. Locals, however, said the police had surrounded the place and that there had been no gunfight. In total, 15 people were killed, the deadliest raid in Rio in 12 years. Witzel defended the operation as “legitimate”. In May’s operation with the helicopter in Maré, police said they were looking for a suspected drug lord. Pictures of pupils fleeing a school as the police hovered overhead went viral. Eight people were killed in the raid, four of them in a single house. Again, residents said the men had already surrendered when they were killed. A witness, whose house was broken into by the heavily armed suspected drug traffickers, told me on condition of anonymity: “One of [the suspects] said ‘Perdi’, ‘I’ve lost it.’ The policeman said: ‘You didn’t only lose. My order is to kill.’” Both cases are still being investigated by the police. But Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brasil, says authorities are allowing this “violent approach” by officers. “Killing people can’t be considered public policy,” Werneck, who was herself born in a favela, says. “We have the proper way to deal with [suspected criminals]. It has to be in front of justice and not in front of guns.”  A number of operations have drawn comparisons with some of the policies Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, has implemented in his own war on drugs. Some 6,600 people have been killed there since 2016, according to police, but activists put this number at 27,000. Witzel, however, rejects the accusation that officers shoot indiscriminately. “The police,” he said in May, “don’t kill innocents.” The military police department says its operations are based on “prior planning and executed within the law” and that “criminals are the ones who typically initiate confrontation”. Col Carlos Fernando Ferreira Belo, president of Rio’s Military Police Officers Federation, the group that represents officers, says operations are usually “very intense and stressful” for the police. As a rule, he says, officers are attacked by criminals and that they “have to respond in the same proportion”. In the first six months of the year, seven policemen were killed while on duty in Rio. “The fact that in the confrontations criminals die I’d say ‘Thanks God!’ and I applaud it,” says Belo. “Killing is not the mission of the military police, but dying even less so.” Over four days in January, two men were shot dead in the northern neighbourhood of Manguinhos, with residents blaming snipers based in a tower at the civil police headquarters nearby. The cases are being investigated by the police and Cunha’s team, but a post-mortem examination published by Extra newspaper said one of them had been killed by a bullet fired from above. There was no suggestion any of them were armed. After six people aged between 16 and 21 were killed in police operations in five days this month, Meia Hora, a local tabloid, printed bullet marks on its front page with the headline: “In Rio, killing is a game.”  On the locked gate to the building where Jean Rodrigo used to hold his jiu-jitsu classes is a sign saying the team has moved. “Some children no longer felt safe there,” says Marcos Vinicius, one of Jean Rodrigo’s friends who now helps with the lessons. Others simply did not want to go back to their old place. They felt Jean Rodrigo everywhere. Andrea has moved, because she too felt his presence in the home they shared. “The joy I had,” she says, “is over.” When Jean Rodrigo was buried, two days after he was killed, his students wore kimonos and brought the medals they had won in competitions. They launched white balloons in the air asking for peace, and applauded when the jiu-jitsu “master” posthumously gave Jean Rodrigo a black belt.

"Doctors and NHS leaders have warned that a no-deal Brexit would make it ""likely"" there will be a delay in flu vaccine supply this year. They say the EU departure date coincides with the winter season in a way that creates ""a perfect storm for the NHS"". Major flu vaccine manufacturer Sanofi said delays in deciding what strains of flu to use in the vaccine mean over a million doses will have to be imported after 31 October. Vaccines are usually available for delivery by the end of August and throughout September, but the delay has had a knock on effect on the production schedule. These doses - which represent about 20% of imported flu vaccines - are specifically intended for under-65s in at risk groups (such as disabled people and their carers) as well as healthcare professionals, who are routinely exposed to the virus. The government said it was ""working closely with vaccine suppliers to ensure they have robust contingencies in place"". ""What we can see is we're likely to not have enough flu vaccine, we are likely not to have the flu vaccine coverage that we've had in previous years, and that is likely to have an impact on the NHS,"" Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, exclusively told Newsnight. In an open letter last week, Prof Goddard and other doctors' leaders warned the prime minister about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. They said that the government's ""EU exit strategy must include provision for different flu scenarios"". The government is yet to respond to the letter. He said NHS no-deal planners have ""done everything in their power to get ready. But there's only so much preparation you can do."" The government said: ""We want to reassure patients that our plans should ensure that supplies of vaccines remain uninterrupted when we leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances."" Different strains of the flu are used in the vaccine each year. Normally, the make-up of the vaccine in the northern hemisphere are decided in February by the World Health Organization (WHO). But this year, it took longer to identify which strains of the flu virus were to be included - and this had a knock-on effect on the production schedule. Moreover, the nature of the vaccine means doses cannot be stockpiled in advance of an October no-deal. This issue is thought to affect all of the UK's suppliers, including Sanofi. What is the UK doing to get ready for a no-deal Brexit? What could no deal mean for the Irish border? Do MPs have the power to stop no deal? A spokesperson for the company, Hugo Fry, said that in case all the ports were booked after 31st October, the firm has doubled its efforts to make sure it has booked space on aircraft as well as ferries. Even with these contingencies in place, the logistical process would have to run smoothly to ensure clinics have their vaccine supplies in time he said. Sanofi says it is confident that it has done all it can to ensure its flu vaccines arrive as scheduled. ""Unfortunately I didn't bring my crystal ball with me, but what we're doing is planning for what we think will be the worst case scenario."" Earlier this month, Newsnight reported thatdelays occurred during a ""dry run"" of emergency aircraft deliveries of radioisotopes used in cancer diagnosis and treatment.They are normally driven in on trucks. Vaccines shortages occur more often than they do for other medicines, because vaccines are biological (rather than chemical) and complicated to manufacture, Mr Fry said. When vaccine shortages occur health services might try to rush more doses into the country. But this ""might be difficult"" during the ""period post no-deal Brexit,"" he added. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said she understands measures have been put in place to minimise the risk of supplies being disrupted but that ""ultimately, we just don't know how things will pan out in the event of a no-deal. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said that there were already several signs of a tough winter ahead for the NHS and trust leaders were ""very concerned"". ""We are coming out of summer with record levels of demand for urgent and emergency care, leaving trusts struggling to catch up.

Yet this year's flu has caused more deaths than strains in any of the past five years other than 2017, which was considered to be particularly virulent. Prof Goddard said: ""If there is a significant outbreak, or even an epidemic, it won't just bring more patients to hospitals, GPs and health clinics - especially older people and other vulnerable groups - but could also keep the very staff needed to treat them at home, with sickness levels rocketing at exactly the wrong time,"" Brexit: Health leaders issue new no-deal warning 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Pinterest to push vaccine searches to health sites LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian is heading towards Florida - the governor warns of a 'multi-day event'. A powerful storm threatening the Bahamas and south-eastern coast of the US has grown to category four, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) says. Hurricane Dorian has maximum sustained winds of nearly 145mph (225km/h). It is expected to grow even stronger, its centre potentially crossing the Bahamas before skirting Florida's east coast early next week. Reports from the Bahamas described tourists scrambling to leave before the closure of the international airport. States of emergency have been declared in Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina. Residents have been urged to stock enough food, water and medicine to last at least a week. Forecasters warn Dorian could be the region's worst storm since category five Hurricane Andrew killed 65 people and destroyed 63,000 homes in 1992. US President Donald Trump said he was monitoring Dorian,which he described as ""an extremely dangerous storm"" on Twitter,external. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Hurricanes, whose strength can range from category 1 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, tend to get stronger as they move over warm waters like those off Florida. By the middle of next week, forecasters expect Dorian to shift eastwards, putting the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina at risk. The NHC said ""life-threatening storm surge, devastating hurricane-force winds, and heavy rains capable of life-threatening flash floods"" are expected to hit the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama on Sunday. Jeffrey Simmons, the deputy director of Bahamas' Department of Meteorology, said storm surges of up to 15ft (4.5m) were expected. The country's National Emergency Management Agency believes thatdamage could be exacerbated by the fact that the storm's westward motion is forecast to slow,external- this would keep it over the islands for longer. A tropical storm watch is also in effect for a 120-mile (193km) stretch of Florida's eastern coast, with hurricane-force winds possible along the state's coast by early next week. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian approaches the Bahamas The coasts of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina are also at risk of strong winds and a ""dangerous storm surge"" during the middle of next week. Dorian's exact path toward Florida remains uncertain but millions of people could be affected, as well as holiday attractions such as Walt Disney World and President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Dorian is expected to drop up to 12in (30cm) of rain on the coastal US, with some areas getting as much as 18in. Tides in the region are already at some of their highest levels of the year, owing to a naturally occurring event. A new moon, combined with the coming autumn equinox, has created what are known in Florida as ""king tides"". These are likely to exacerbate dangerous levels of flooding, forecasters warn. Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis has announced an evacuation order for parts of Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands, both in the north of the archipelago. All tourists have also been asked to leave over the last few days. At a press conference, he begged residents to head for the country's main island to escape the ""devastating, dangerous storm"". ""I want you to remember: homes, houses, structures can be replaced. Lives cannot be replaced,"" he said, adding that 73,000 people and 21,000 homes were at risk. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds.

The governor has activated 2,500 National Guard troops, with another 1,500 on standby. Shoppers in Florida have been queuing around the block to snap up supplies such as medication and fuel. Some petrol stations reported fuel shortages, while a few shops had run out of bottled water. The coastal city of Miami ordered the removal of electric rental scooters from the streets to avoid any potential hazards. Officials fear the rental scooters, operated by firms such as Lime, Lyft and Uber's Jump, could be swept away by strong winds, turning them into projectiles. Workers place hurricane shutters over windows in Florida No immediate mass evacuations have been ordered by state authorities but President Trump, who had warned that Dorian ""could be an absolute monster"", said a decision could be made on Sunday. People have been asked to bring their pets with them in case of evacuation. On social media, the names of hotels that accept pets are being shared. Orlando International Airport announced it was halting commercial flights from 02:00 (06:00 GMT) on Monday ""out of an abundance of caution"". Tourist resorts in the city remained open, however.

"Former FBI Director James Comey has been criticised in a Department of Justice report for the leak of memos on his interactions with President Trump. An internal watchdog said Mr Comey had failed to ""live up"" to his duty to safeguard sensitive information. The watchdog said Mr Comey broke FBI rules by giving the contents of a memo to a friend to share with a reporter. But the inspector general said he was not recommending that Mr Comey be prosecuted for the breach. Mr Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump since the president fired him in May 2017. The report said,externalthat, after losing his job, Mr Comey divulged the unclassified parts of a memo he had written on his private conversations with Mr Trump. He passed the contents to a friend, his personal lawyer Dan Richman, and authorised him to share them with a New York Times journalist. The inspector general's report said: ""Were current or former FBI employees to follow the former Director's example and disclose sensitive information in service of their own strongly held personal convictions, the FBI would be unable to dispatch its law enforcement duties properly."" The watchdog found that Mr Comey had also violated departmental policies by keeping copies of the memos in a safe at his home and failing to notify the FBI that he had done so. The inspector general said Mr Comey shared the document because he wanted to pressure the Department of Justice to launch an independent investigation into the president. ""Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a Special Counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,"" the report says. ""What was not permitted was the unauthorised disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome."" Despite the findings, Mr Comey claimed vindication. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Comey disgraced himself and his office to further a personal political agenda, and this report further confirms that fact,"" she added. After he was fired, Mr Comey wrote a book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, condemning the president as ""unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values"".

The good news for former FBI Director James Comey in the inspector general's report is the conclusion that he did not break the law and will not face criminal prosecution. The bad news is everything else. Mr Comey violated FBI policies and standards. He, in effect, acted as though the rules didn't apply to him. President Trump and his supporters will point to this as evidence that Mr Comey was a bad actor with an axe to grind against the president. Those in Hillary Clinton's circle will note, with irony, that the man whose investigation into the former secretary of state's handling of government documents that helped derail her presidential campaign is now on the receiving end of a not-prosecutable-but-not-proper finding. Mr Comey's claim that the inquiry is a vindication is a real stretch. It is, rather, a stinging rebuke of the nation's former top cop - a man who in his writings and public statements has presented himself as striving for virtue in a toxic political world. Mr Comey wrote seven memos between January and April 2017 about conversations he had with Mr Trump. He said that the president asked the FBI director to pledge loyalty to him during a private dinner. And at a private Oval Office meeting weeks later, Mr Comey says the president asked him to drop an inquiry into former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn was fired for misleading the White House about his interactions with Russian officials. He pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the encounters. The firing of Mr Comey prompted nationwide uproar and one day after his memo was leaked to the New York Times, the Department of Justice launched an investigation to establish if there was collusion between the president's 2016 election campaign and Russia. That special counsel inquiry by another former FBI Director, Robert Mueller, concluded there was not enough evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy, despite a number of interactions between Trump aides and Russian officials. Mr Mueller's final report also noted that the president repeatedly tried to interfere with his investigation, though the special counsel did not conclude whether this amounted to criminal obstruction of justice.

"Alibaba's Jack Ma and Tesla's Elon Musk took opposing views of the risks and potential rewards of artificial intelligence at an event in Shanghai. The Chinese entrepreneur said he was ""quite optimistic"" about AI and thought it was nothing for ""street smart"" people like them to be scared of. ""I don't know man, that's like famous last words,"" responded Tesla's chief. Mr Musk added that technology was evolving faster than our ability to understand it. The two did, however, agree on one topic: that one of the biggest problems the world is facing is population collapse. The businessmen are two of the most influential tech leaders shaping the world today. US-based Mr Musk made his fortune at the digital payments firm PayPal before going on to run electric car-maker Tesla, space rocket company SpaceX and tunnel-transport business The Boring Company among other ventures. He also helped create OpenAI, a San Francisco-based AI research company, although he hassince broken ties with it.,external Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba, which rivals Amazon for the title of the world's largest e-retailer and is also one of the world's largest cloud computing providers. The group is one of the world's biggest spenders on AI, both within its own business as wellas via investments in dozens of third-party companies,external. Their 45-minute conversation kicked off the World AI Conference (WAIC), which ties into China's goal of overtaking the US to becomethe world's leading artificial intelligence innovator by 2030,external. Mr Ma focused much of his comments on how machine learning could act as a force for good. He said it was something ""to embrace"" and would deliver fresh insights into how people think. ""When human beings understand ourselves better, then we can improve the world better,"" he explained. Furthermore, he predicted AI would help create new kinds of jobs, which would require less of our time and be centred on creative tasks. ""I think people should work three days a week, four hours a day,"" he said. ""In the artificial intelligence period, people can live 120 years. ""At that time we are going to have a lot of jobs which nobody [will] want to do. So, we need artificial intelligence for the robots to take care of the old guys. ""So that's my view about jobs, don't worry about it, we will have jobs."" Jack Ma is China's second richest man, according to Forbes magazine By contrast, Mr Musk suggested that mass unemployment was a real concern. ""AI will make jobs kind of pointless,"" he claimed. ""Probably the last job that will remain will be writing AI, and then eventually, the AI will just write its own software."" He added that there was a risk that human civilization could come to an end and ultimately be seen as a staging post for a superior type of life. ""You could sort of think of humanity as a biological boot loader for digital super-intelligence,"" Mr Musk explained. ""A boot loader is... sort of like the minimal bit of code necessary for a computer to start. ""You couldn't evolve silicon circuits. There needed to be biology to get there."" To avoid such a fate, he said we needed to find a way to connect our brains to computers so that we could ""go along for the ride with AI"" - somethinghe is trying to achieve via one of his latest start-ups. Otherwise, he cautioned, AI would become weary of trying to communicate with humans, as we would be much slower thinkers in comparison. ""Human speech to a computer will sound like very slow tonal wheezing, kind of like whale sounds,"" Mr Musk explained. ""What's our bandwidth? Like a few hundred bits per second, basically, maybe a few kilobits per second, if you're going to be generous. ""Whereas a computer can easily communicate at a terabit level. So, the computer will just get impatient if nothing else. It'll be like talking to a tree - that's humans. ""It will be barely getting any information out."" Musk and Zuckerberg clash over future of AI Elon Musk quits AI ethics research group Jack Ma defends the 'blessing' of a 12-hour working day By contrast, Mr Ma acknowledged that AI could now beat humans at games like chess and Go, but claimed computers would only be one of several intelligent tools that we would develop in time. ""Don't worry about the machines,"" he said. ""For sure, we should understand one thing: that man can never make another man. ""A computer is a computer. A computer is just a toy. ""Man cannot even make a mosquito. So, we should have a confidence. Computers only have chips, men have the heart. It's the heart where the wisdom comes from."" Although Mr Ma acknowledged that we needed to find ways to become ""more creative and constructive"", he concluded that ""my view is that [a] computer may be clever, but human beings are much smarter"". Mr Musk responded: ""Yeah, definitely not. ""It's going to get to the point where [AI] just can completely simulate a person in every way possible, like many people simultaneously,"" he added. ""In fact, there's a strong argument, we're in the simulation right now."" The two men were given a range of topics to discuss but the event was unmoderated Towards the end of the event the two men came together on one point - that concerns about overpopulation were misguided. ""Assuming... there's a benevolent future with AI, I think that the biggest problem the world will face in 20 years is population collapse,"" said Mr Musk ""I want to emphasise this, the biggest issue in 20 years will be population collapse, not explosion collapse."" Mr Ma said he was absolutely in agreement. ""One point four billion in China sounds a lot, but I think [over the] next 20 years we'll see this thing bring big trouble to China,"" he said. ""And the speed of population decreasing is going to speed up. Now you've got a collapse."" However, he suggested, using AI to help people live longer, healthier lives could be part of the solution.

"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders. Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January The key points of the Brexit deal How to get ready for Brexit in 2021 How your Europe holidays will change What is the Brexit transition period?

"Former FBI Director James Comey has been criticised in a Department of Justice report for the leak of memos on his interactions with President Trump. An internal watchdog said Mr Comey had failed to ""live up"" to his duty to safeguard sensitive information. The watchdog said Mr Comey broke FBI rules by giving the contents of a memo to a friend to share with a reporter. But the inspector general said he was not recommending that Mr Comey be prosecuted for the breach. Mr Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump since the president fired him in May 2017. The report said,externalthat, after losing his job, Mr Comey divulged the unclassified parts of a memo he had written on his private conversations with Mr Trump. He passed the contents to a friend, his personal lawyer Dan Richman, and authorised him to share them with a New York Times journalist. The inspector general's report said: ""Were current or former FBI employees to follow the former Director's example and disclose sensitive information in service of their own strongly held personal convictions, the FBI would be unable to dispatch its law enforcement duties properly."" The watchdog found that Mr Comey had also violated departmental policies by keeping copies of the memos in a safe at his home and failing to notify the FBI that he had done so. The inspector general said Mr Comey shared the document because he wanted to pressure the Department of Justice to launch an independent investigation into the president. ""Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a Special Counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,"" the report says. ""What was not permitted was the unauthorised disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome."" Despite the findings, Mr Comey claimed vindication. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After he was fired, Mr Comey wrote a book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, condemning the president as ""unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values"".

The good news for former FBI Director James Comey in the inspector general's report is the conclusion that he did not break the law and will not face criminal prosecution. The bad news is everything else. Mr Comey violated FBI policies and standards. He, in effect, acted as though the rules didn't apply to him. President Trump and his supporters will point to this as evidence that Mr Comey was a bad actor with an axe to grind against the president. Those in Hillary Clinton's circle will note, with irony, that the man whose investigation into the former secretary of state's handling of government documents that helped derail her presidential campaign is now on the receiving end of a not-prosecutable-but-not-proper finding. Mr Comey's claim that the inquiry is a vindication is a real stretch. It is, rather, a stinging rebuke of the nation's former top cop - a man who in his writings and public statements has presented himself as striving for virtue in a toxic political world. Mr Comey wrote seven memos between January and April 2017 about conversations he had with Mr Trump. He said that the president asked the FBI director to pledge loyalty to him during a private dinner. And at a private Oval Office meeting weeks later, Mr Comey says the president asked him to drop an inquiry into former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn was fired for misleading the White House about his interactions with Russian officials. He pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the encounters. The firing of Mr Comey prompted nationwide uproar and one day after his memo was leaked to the New York Times, the Department of Justice launched an investigation to establish if there was collusion between the president's 2016 election campaign and Russia. That special counsel inquiry by another former FBI Director, Robert Mueller, concluded there was not enough evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy, despite a number of interactions between Trump aides and Russian officials. Mr Mueller's final report also noted that the president repeatedly tried to interfere with his investigation, though the special counsel did not conclude whether this amounted to criminal obstruction of justice.

"Alibaba's Jack Ma and Tesla's Elon Musk took opposing views of the risks and potential rewards of artificial intelligence at an event in Shanghai. The Chinese entrepreneur said he was ""quite optimistic"" about AI and thought it was nothing for ""street smart"" people like them to be scared of. ""I don't know man, that's like famous last words,"" responded Tesla's chief. Mr Musk added that technology was evolving faster than our ability to understand it. The two did, however, agree on one topic: that one of the biggest problems the world is facing is population collapse. The businessmen are two of the most influential tech leaders shaping the world today. US-based Mr Musk made his fortune at the digital payments firm PayPal before going on to run electric car-maker Tesla, space rocket company SpaceX and tunnel-transport business The Boring Company among other ventures. He also helped create OpenAI, a San Francisco-based AI research company, although he hassince broken ties with it.,external Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba, which rivals Amazon for the title of the world's largest e-retailer and is also one of the world's largest cloud computing providers. The group is one of the world's biggest spenders on AI, both within its own business as wellas via investments in dozens of third-party companies,external. Their 45-minute conversation kicked off the World AI Conference (WAIC), which ties into China's goal of overtaking the US to becomethe world's leading artificial intelligence innovator by 2030,external. Mr Ma focused much of his comments on how machine learning could act as a force for good. He said it was something ""to embrace"" and would deliver fresh insights into how people think. ""When human beings understand ourselves better, then we can improve the world better,"" he explained. Furthermore, he predicted AI would help create new kinds of jobs, which would require less of our time and be centred on creative tasks. ""I think people should work three days a week, four hours a day,"" he said. ""In the artificial intelligence period, people can live 120 years. ""At that time we are going to have a lot of jobs which nobody [will] want to do. So, we need artificial intelligence for the robots to take care of the old guys. ""So that's my view about jobs, don't worry about it, we will have jobs."" Jack Ma is China's second richest man, according to Forbes magazine By contrast, Mr Musk suggested that mass unemployment was a real concern. ""AI will make jobs kind of pointless,"" he claimed. ""Probably the last job that will remain will be writing AI, and then eventually, the AI will just write its own software."" He added that there was a risk that human civilization could come to an end and ultimately be seen as a staging post for a superior type of life. ""You could sort of think of humanity as a biological boot loader for digital super-intelligence,"" Mr Musk explained. ""A boot loader is... sort of like the minimal bit of code necessary for a computer to start. ""You couldn't evolve silicon circuits. There needed to be biology to get there.""

"Ruth Davidson became leader of the Scottish Conservatives in November 2011 Ruth Davidson has resigned as leader of the Scottish Conservatives after almost eight years in charge. In her resignation letter, she said she had not hidden the ""conflict"" she felt over Brexit. But she added that the birth of her son in October last year was the biggest change in her life and had led her to make a different choice about where her priorities lie. She said the threat of spending hundreds of hours away from her home and family fighting election campaigns ""now fills me with dread"". While she said she would continue to support the party and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, she is known to be deeply unhappy with his pursuit of a possible no-deal Brexit. She did not support Mr Johnson when he was campaigning to be Conservative leader and has often come into conflict with him over Brexit. Ms Davidson campaigned for a Remain vote during the 2016 EU referendum and put in a typically passionate performance whilerepeatedly clashing with Mr Johnsonin a TV debate days before the vote. This video can not be played EU Referendum: Davidson and Johnson close Great Debate After the UK voted to leave the European Union, she pushed for a deal that would mean the UK remained part of the European Single Market and Customs Union. At the same time, she continued her objection to a second referendum on Scottish independence, saying this was not the answer to concerns raised by the prospect of leaving the EU. Ms Davidson, who turned 40 late last year, has only been a Conservative Party member for a decade. But after her meteoric rise to the top, her party has seen a remarkable turnaround of fortunes in a country where the Tories had been a toxic brand since the days of Margaret Thatcher. From a very low base, the Scottish Tories overtook Labour to become the second-largest party in the Scottish Parliament and official opposition of the Scottish government. At the 2017 snap election, they returned 13 Scottish Tory MPs to Westminster, enough to keep Theresa May in power as prime minister. Much of Ms Davidson's wider appeal comes from her not being seen as a ""typical"" Tory - often being referred to instead as a ""kickboxing lesbian"". In the past, Ms Davidson has referred to LGBTI rights as one thing she cares about more than her party. In October last year, she celebrated the birth to a baby boy with her partner Jen Wilson. Ms Davidson tweeted a picture of herself with Finn and her partner Jen Wilson Born in Edinburgh and raised in the Borders and Fife, she studied at Edinburgh University before pursuing a career as a journalist. She worked at Kingdom FM in Fife, before moving to BBC Scotland in Glasgow in 2002. She left the BBC in 2009 and stood unsuccessfully to be an MP in Glasgow North East twice in quick succession, ina by-election in 2009,externaland then in the 2010 general election. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Ms Davidson then ran in the Glasgow Kelvin constituency. She finished a distant fourth, but was elected to Holyrood via the regional top-up list system - having been promoted to the top only after fellow list colleague Malcolm Macaskillstood down. The new MSP was provided with an immediate opportunity for further advancement. After the election, which saw the Tories drop two seats as Alex Salmond's SNP surged to an unprecedented majority,Annabel Goldie resignedas Scottish Tory leader. Ms Davidson, then aged 32, was one of four candidates for the job anddeclared the winner in November 2011. This video can not be played Ruth Davidson tells the BBC that she offers ""the generational change that our party has been looking for"" The 2014 Scottish independence referendum was where the Tory revival really began. Ms Davidson was part of the Better Together campaign during the poll, which finished with the No side winning by 55% to 45%. In the aftermath, as the SNP surged and Labour collapsed, she shaped her party firmly as the defenders of the Union, seeking to sweep up support from the 55%. There wasn't an immediate bounce - in the 2015 general election it was the SNP who dominated,winning 56 of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats. The Conservatives took one - but they were starting from a very low base, having won at best a single seat in each contest since 1992. Ms Davidson has a fondness for a wacky photocall Ruth Davidson is an energetic campaigner, up for most things, including a shot at playing the bagpipes But with the issue of the union continuing to play a major role in Scottish politics, Ms Davidson's strategy was to pay off in style in the 2016 Holyrood elections. Ahead of the poll, Ms Davidson announced she wasswitching constituency, from Glasgow to Edinburgh. A politician known as an energetic campaigner, she was often the subject of colourful photo opportunities - including standing astride a tank flying a union jack flag. For the 2016 campaign she rode a buffalo, played ice hockey, pulled countless pints and drove everything from a racing car to a crane to a snowmobile. Not only did she score an unexpectedvictory in Edinburgh Central, gaining the seat from the SNP, her Toriesleapfrogged Labour into second place. Ruth Davidson was a leading voice in the Remain campaign across the UK This left Ms Davidson as the main sparring partner for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at weekly question sessions, giving her a new platform. While defence of the union and opposition to a second independence referendum remained at the core of the Scottish Tory approach, Ms Davidson broadened her attacks to focus on education in particular. Hot on the heels of the Holyrood election though was the EU referendum - and here, Ms Davidson found herself on the same side as Ms Sturgeon. The result was a disappointment to the Scottish Tory leader - but she adapted, positioning herself on the soft-Brexit wing of the ensuing debate, continuing toadvocate single market access. Ruth Davidson is an energetic campaigner In the subsequent Conservative leadership contest, triggered by the resignation of David Cameron, some called for Ms Davidson to seek a move to Westminster. She ruled that out saying that she had a ""pretty bloody big job"" in Scotland, instead endorsing the candidacy of Theresa May. Ms Davidson later said said she never wants to be prime minister because she values her ""mental health too much"". In an interview with the Sunday Times Magazine, she revealed her struggles with self-harm, suicidal thoughts and depression as a teenager. After giving birth last year, she stepped back from frontline politics to go on maternity leave. Ms Davidson made her comeback speech at the Scottish Conservative conference in Aberdeen in May. In her resignation letter, she said that party and work had always come first, often at the expense of commitments to loved ones. ""The arrival of my son means I now make a different choice,"" she said.

"Huawei's next flagship smartphone will not come with Google's popular apps including Maps and YouTube. Google confirmed that due to a US government ban on sales to Huawei, it could not license its apps to the Chinese smartphone giant. It also means the next Huawei phone will not have access to the Google Play app store, which could leave customers without access to other popular apps. Analysts suggest Huawei will struggle to sell a phone without Google's apps. The US government restricted American companies from selling products and services to Huawei in May, citing national security concerns, which Huawei rejects. Huawei: UK to make 5G decision 'by the autumn' Huawei announces its new Harmony operating system President Donald Trump said last month that some exemptions would be allowed. ButUS officials have not granted any licences to trade with Huawei,despite receiving more than 130 requests. Reuters wasfirst to report the latest development,external. The Android operating system is open-source software, so any manufacturer can offer it on their smartphone or tablet. But companies need an agreement with Google to include its popular apps such as Maps, Pay, Search, Photos, Play Store and YouTube. Google has not said whether it has applied for permission to offer its apps to Huawei. Huawei said in a statement: ""Huawei will continue to use the Android OS and ecosystem if the US government allows us to do so. Otherwise, we will continue to develop our own operating system and ecosystem."" It has set up a website named Huawei Answers,externalto address consumer concerns about the company's relationship with Android. ""Anyone who has already bought, or is about to buy a Huawei smartphone, can continue to access the world of apps as they have always done.

"Huawei's next flagship smartphone will not come with Google's popular apps including Maps and YouTube. Google confirmed that due to a US government ban on sales to Huawei, it could not license its apps to the Chinese smartphone giant. It also means the next Huawei phone will not have access to the Google Play app store, which could leave customers without access to other popular apps. Analysts suggest Huawei will struggle to sell a phone without Google's apps. The US government restricted American companies from selling products and services to Huawei in May, citing national security concerns, which Huawei rejects. Huawei: UK to make 5G decision 'by the autumn' Huawei announces its new Harmony operating system President Donald Trump said last month that some exemptions would be allowed.

"We need to change our behaviours and our lifestyles, says Sir Ian People must use less transport, eat less red meat and buy fewer clothes if the UK is to virtually halt greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the government's chief environment scientist has warned. Prof Sir Ian Boyd said the public had little idea of the scale of the challenge from the so-calledNet Zero emissions target. However, he said technology would help. The conundrum facing the UK - and elsewhere - was how we shift ourselves away from consuming, he added. In an interview with BBC News, Sir Ian warned that persuasive political leadership was needed to carry the public through the challenge. Asked whether Boris Johnson would deliver that leadership, he declined to comment. Mr Johnson has already been accused by environmentalists of talking up electric cars whilst reputedly planning a cut in driving taxes that would increase emissions and undermine the electric car market. UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 Government 'like Dad's Army' on climate change Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Sir Ian said polluting activities should incur more tax. He believes the Treasury should reform taxation policy to reward people with low-carbon lifestyles and nudge heavy consumers into more frugal patterns of behaviour. It was vital, he said, for the changes to be fair to all parts of society. He also believes Net Zero won't happen unless the government creates a Net Zero ministry to vet the policies of all government departments in the way the Brexit ministry vets Brexit-related decisions. Emissions won't be reduced to Net Zero while ministers are fixed on economic growth measured by GDP, instead of other measures such as environmental security and a relatively stable climate, he argued. Asked why the UK should take the lead when China's emissions are so high, he answered that the Chinese government was very worried about the climate and was taking it very seriously. Sir Ian has been in his post as the government's chief environment scientist for seven years Sir Ian, a polar expert with a chair in biology at St Andrews University, suggested that the UK was in a good position to show the world how to achieve Net Zero. But he agreed that similar radical action was ultimately needed by all nations. He said that on broader issues the government had produced (or was in the process of producing) impressive strategies on the environment, waste, air pollution, marine and food. Some ministers were enthusiastic to translate these into firm strategies, but they needed support from the public, he said. He confessed that he was not optimistic about the future of the planet because so many systems of government needed to change in a short time. Sir Ian, who leaves Defra on Thursday after seven years in post, said: ""The way we live our lives is generally not good for the environment. ""We like to consume things, but the more we consume the more we absorb the resources of the planet. ""That means we have to grow those resources or we have to mine them - and in doing that we generate waste. And consumption is going up all the time. ""(There's) a conundrum - how do we shift ourselves from consuming? We need to do more about learning to live sustainably. We talk about sustainability but we don't really know what it means. ""We need to make major technological advances in the way we use and reuse materials but we (also) need to reduce demand overall - and that means we need to change our behaviours and change our lifestyles. ""We certainly won't be able to travel so much as we have in the past, so we have to get used to using modern communications methods. ""Moving material round the planet will be more difficult so we'll have to do more with 3D printing; that sort of thing. Greater use is required of new technologies such as 3D printing ""We've got to reduce demand to a much greater extent than we have in the past, and if we don't reduce demand we're not going to reduce emissions. ""Emissions are a symptom of consumption and unless we reduce consumption we'll not reduce emissions. ""It will very rarely come down to a direct message like 'sorry, you can't buy that but you can buy this'. But there will be stronger messages within the (tax) system that make one thing more attractive than the other."" He said UK government strategies were in place on air, environment, resources, waste, marine, and food. ""[Ministers] need to be persuasive."" Asked if he was optimistic about the future of the planet, he said: âWe have the intelligence to do it; we have the potential to develop the technologies to do itâ¦ Iâm doubtful that we have the governance structures to make it happen at the speed it needs to happen at."" Richard Black, from the think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Sir Ian's words were ""somewhat surprising"". He added: ""They appear to contradict the mass of evidence assembled on getting to Net Zero, including the major report from the government's statutory adviser the Committee on Climate Change."" I understand that the Confederation of British Industry, the CBI, accept there will have to be behavioural change to meet Net Zero. A source in the organisation said they were frustrated that government climate policies were currently too weak. Given the very broad nature of Sir Ian's comments, we approached Downing Street for a comment. They declined and passed us back to Sir Ian's department, Defra. But their statement didn't address any of his key questions about governance, leadership and consumption. It said: ""The impact of climate change is clear and demands urgent action from countries around the world. The UK has already shown global leadership by becoming the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050 - but we know there is more to do. ""That's why we're reforming farming policy to reward environmental actions, reviewing our food system to ensure it is more sustainable, taking steps to accelerate tree-planting and peatland restoration, and introducing a flagship Environment Bill to address the biggest environmental priorities of our age.""

"This video can not be played This Hong Kong park lit up in a sex abuse protest Several thousand people have rallied in Hong Kong to protest against alleged sexual violence by police during the past months of demonstrations. The rally was billed as a #MeToo event, echoing global protests to end sexual assault and harassment. Organisers said some 30,000 people attended, while police put the figure at 11,500, local media say. Hong Kong Police said they respected the rights of people in detention, and had not received formal complaints. At Wednesday's rally, some attendees told the crowd they had been mistreated by police officers. According to the South China Morning Post, one woman broke down in tears,externalas she accused police of conducting an unnecessary strip-search. Police officials had denied her allegations on Tuesday, saying their video footage did not support her account. The protesters accused Hong Kong police of using sexual violence as a means of intimidation Another speaker said her underwear had been exposed while she was dragged away by police, and said officers insulted her and called her a prostitute. ""I told them I was wearing a dress and asked them to let me walk. But, of course, they played deaf,"" reports quoted her as saying. ""I am not ashamed of talking about what happened that night, because I did not make any mistakes. I am not a weakling. I don't need people to sympathise with me."" The anti-government rallies in Hong Kong have frequently escalated into violence between police and activists, with injuries on both sides. Police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets, while some activists have thrown bricks, firebombs and other objects. On Wednesday, police said 900 people had been arrested since the protests began. Demonstrators have repeatedly accused the police of brutality, and are demanding an independent inquiry. Police have rejected claims that officers abused their power At a separate protest organised by the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, hundreds of people denounced Cathay Pacific Airways for dismissing staff who took part in or supported anti-government rallies. Employees have spoken of a climate of fear at the airline. Earlier this month, demonstrations at Hong Kong international airport led to hundreds of flights being cancelled. The protests began as rallies against a controversial extradition bill - now suspended - which would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. They have since expanded in scope, becoming a broader pro-democracy movement. Beijing has repeatedly condemned the protesters and described their actions as ""close to terrorism"". This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence On Thursday, China's military moved a new batch of troops into Hong Kong. State media described it as a routine annual rotation. When last year's rotation was announced, it was stated that the number of troops stationed in Hong Kong ""was maintained with no change"". There was no such line this time, fuelling speculations Beijing might have raised the number. News agency Xinhua showed pictures of armoured personnel carriers and trucks, as well as a small naval ship arriving in Hong Kong. The troop rotation follows reports of increased Chinese military and police presence in the city of Shenzhen just across the border from Hong Kong. A former British colony, Hong Kong has some autonomy and more rights than the Chinese mainland under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement. It has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China. Activists increasingly fear its freedoms are being eroded.

"An FCA ad campaign featuring an image of Arnold Schwarzenegger has urged consumers to make claims before the deadline Consumers say they are having problems making claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) with just hours to go until the deadline. Santander's online complaints form stopped working on Wednesday night. NatWest's form is still having issues. There have also been long waits to reach banks by phone amid a surge of last-minute calls. Customers have until 23:59 to make a claim as one the UK's biggest financial scandals draws to a close. Some customers vented their fury about the problems on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Santander said it was sorry for any inconvenience caused and that it had now fixed the glitch. Consumers given 'wrong' PPI information PPI fuelling fraud culture, says Barclays boss ""If any customer has been unable to submit a claim due to the issue, we will ensure that their claim is considered, even if it is submitted after the deadline."" RBS, which owns NatWest, said customers were still having ""intermittent"" issues accessing its form and advised them to reload the page. Both RBS and Barclays admitted there had been long waiting times on their PPI phone lines as the deadline neared. PPI was designed to cover loan repayments when policyholders fell ill or lost their jobs. But banks and loan providers mis-sold millions of policies - mainly between 1990 and 2010 - to people who did not need them or would not be covered. An astonishing Â£36bn in compensation has been paid out so far, with the typical payout amounting to Â£2,000. And the bill will continue to grow - banks have set aside an estimated Â£3bn for further compensation. More information on PPI and how you can claim is available on theFCA website,external. A free phone line, managed by the FCA, can be called on 0800 101 8800. Various templates are also available to download, along with guidance on claiming, on websites such asWhich?,external,MoneySavingExpert,external, andResolver,external. The floodgates opened to make historical claims for mis-sold PPI in 2011, when banks lost a legal battle to stop a review of past sales of the insurance. Since then, campaigners and the Financial Conduct Authority have been urging consumers to take action if they think they were wronged, amid fears that many consumers were unaware of their rights. It was when PPI was mentioned on youth TV hit Love Island that Guy Anker, managing editor of Moneysavingexpert, realised that the scandal had put consumer rights firmly into the mainstream. ""PPI has brought claiming and big-ticket money-back consumer rights into focus,"" he told the BBC last week. PPI was even mentioned on Love Island Moneysavingexpert and its founder Martin Lewis were at the forefront of the campaign for PPI compensation and the subject has been one of the biggest concerns of visitors to the website ever since. Mr Anker said the scandal had been at the heart of the public's distrust of banks, in a more tangible way than the banking crisis of a decade ago. Martyn James, of consumer website Resolver, also said that the PPI scandal had emboldened consumers to fight for their rights. ""As a nation, we are no longer willing to put up with being treated badly and are increasingly vocal about it,"" he said. Yet the PPI compensation campaign has been tarnished by the large number of claims management companies (CMCs) that sprang up to make claims on consumers' behalf. These companies - which typically take a 25% cut of any compensation payouts - made large volumes of unsolicited calls to the public, as well as sending texts, leading many to brand them a nuisance. However, the companies themselves have said many of these people would never have claimed without their help. Claims companies have sent a large number of unsolicited texts to the public The deadline may be arriving on Thursday, but the work will not be over for the banks and loan providers responsible for the scandal. Collectively, they have set aside billions of pounds more to cover compensation that has yet to work through the system. That process could still take years. Several high-profile companies have been fined by the Financial Conduct Authority, too. It is a huge change from how things stood a decade ago, when banks engaged in a long legal fight to stop past PPI sales being reviewed. Lloyds was the first to budge in May 2011 after it lost its legal battle, and others followed - although their reluctance to pay out led to heightened criticism of banks in some quarters. However, some in the banking industry have subsequently complained about members of the public making false claims. And John McFarlane, when he was chairman of Barclays, said in an interview last year that PPI had ""turned portions of Britain into fraudsters"". UK Finance, the banking trade body, told the BBC: ""The industry has worked closely with the [regulator] to ensure PPI complaints are handled fairly and consistently. ""The regulator's deadline for PPI complaints has provided additional clarity for consumers, with the accompanying awareness campaign intended to prompt action and help ensure that customers who deserve compensation receive it.""

"High Street retailers have illegally sold knives to children during test purchases conducted by National Trading Standards, the organisation says. Tesco, Asda, Poundland and Home Bargains sold blades to under-18s at least 15 times each during tests between April 2018 and March 2019. Tesco and Asda have since updated their checks and further restricted sales. Poundland said it stopped selling kitchen knives last year, while Home Bargains has not yet commented. Trading Standards sent in ""mystery shoppers"" under the age of 18 to carry out the test purchases. Shop staff failed to prevent the sale of a knife to a child 344 times, equal to 15% of the 2,231 tests carried out by Trading Standards at national chain and independent shops. Knives and alcohol sold to children Major stores caught selling knives to teen Knife crime at record levels in 2018 The key facts about rising knife crime It is illegal to sell knives to those under 18,unless it has a folding blade 3 inches long (7.62 cm) or less,external. There were 285 killings by a knife or sharp instrument in the 12 months ending March 2018, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis. One in four (71) of all victims (285) were men aged 18-24,ONS said. Lord Toby Harris, chairman of National Trading Standards, said: ""Restricting the sale of knives to children is clearly a difficult issue for retailers, especially those with large numbers of outlets, staff and delivery partners. ""I am aware that many retailers are working incredibly hard to train staff and introduce robust procedures to stem the flow of knives to children. ""But let's be clear - it's illegal to sell a knife to a child. Our tests show that it's still too easy for a child to buy a knife."" Separately, 100 online test purchases were carried out; children were sold a knife on 41 occasions. Underthe new Offensive Weapons Act,external, retailers will be stopped from delivering knives to residential addresses, in a bid to curb under-18s circumventing age restrictions. The act, which received Royal Assent in May, is currently under public consultation before the new laws come into force. Some online retailers already refuse to deliver knives without the courier checking the person's ID. An Asda spokesman said: ""In April 2019, we became the first retailer toremove all single knives from sale across our storesto help ensure that they do not fall into the wrong hands. ""Whilst we are clearly disappointed with the results from a small number of cases between April 2018 and March 2019, we would like to reassure customers that we have since provided updated training for colleagues."" The spokesman added the supermarket has ""clear Challenge 25 policies"", which require staff to check a customer's proof of age to ensure they are over 18, when buying a restricted item. Tesco UK and Ireland chief executive Jason Tarry said: ""Tesco takes the safety of our colleagues, customers, and the communities we serve very seriously. ""We have made significant changes to our approach to displaying and selling knives, without taking choice away from customers, including a new two-stage age verification process and removing knives from display on the shop floor."" A spokesman for Poundland said: ""As this body [Trading Standards] is aware, we're baffled by their numbers.

"Mr Corbyn says Labour would not oppose a referendum if there was a ""legitimate and fresh"" mandate for it Jeremy Corbyn has said he would not allow a Scottish independence referendum ""in the formative years"" of a Labour government. But the Labour leader, on a visit to Scotland, said the party would not block a new poll at a future date  if there was a ""fresh mandate"" Mr Corbyn insisted independence was ""not the answer"" to Boris Johnson. His comments follow a row within Labour over whether a Labour UK government should seek to block a new referendum. The Labour leader was starting a three-day visit to Scotland in Dunfermline, speaking to local people about the fire at Woodmill High School. Mr Corbyn said: ""Boris Johnson's pursuit of a no-deal Brexit will be a disaster for the whole country. He is putting at risk Scottish jobs in manufacturing, food processing and service industries. His intention to suspend Parliament shows he is also a threat to our democracy. ""The best way to defeat Johnson is sticking together, electing a Labour government and allowing it to get on with sorting the Tory Brexit nightmare and introducing policies that will see transformative investment in Scotland's people, communities and public services. ""Scottish independence is not the answer to Johnson. Independence will only further prolong and intensify austerity and create more instability and chaos."" Clarifying Labour's likely response if the Scottish government formally requested a new vote on independence, he indicated it would be a question of timing. ""In the formative years of a Labour government we wouldn't agree to another independence referendum because we will be fully focused on these central priorities,"" he said. ""However, if at some future point there was a legitimate and fresh mandate, we wouldn't block it."" Scottish leader Richard Leonard is traditionally seen as a close ally of UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Scottish Labour has been opposed to another ballot on independence. But UK shadow chancellor John McDonnell re-opened debate on the issue during a visit to Edinburgh, saying the party would not stand in the way of a second referendum. Scottish leader Richard Leonard said he was in agreement with Mr Corbyn on the timing of a possible second ballot. ""Jeremy and I have agreed that, during the formative years of an incoming Labour government, we would not sanction a Section 30 order to allow a further referendum on Scottish independence to take place,"" he said. Mr Leonard added: ""It would also only be acceptable to a Labour government to allow a second referendum to proceed if it could be demonstrated that there was a fresh mandate for such a vote to be held. This would require a democratic mandate from the people of Scotland, which clearly signals the majority of people are in favour of a new vote. ""I do not believe that the conditions exist for such a move today, nor will they for the foreseeable future."" When Mr Corbyn spoke on the issue previously, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed Mr Corbyn's refusal to block a referendum. She said: ""It's perfectly legitimate to oppose independence, as he does, it's perfectly legitimate to argue against there being a second referendum. ""What's not legitimate is for Westminster to block a mandate as now exists for a second referendum, and to seek to block majority opinion in the Scottish Parliament.""

"We need to change our behaviours and our lifestyles, says Sir Ian People must use less transport, eat less red meat and buy fewer clothes if the UK is to virtually halt greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the government's chief environment scientist has warned. Prof Sir Ian Boyd said the public had little idea of the scale of the challenge from the so-calledNet Zero emissions target. However, he said technology would help. The conundrum facing the UK - and elsewhere - was how we shift ourselves away from consuming, he added. In an interview with BBC News, Sir Ian warned that persuasive political leadership was needed to carry the public through the challenge. Asked whether Boris Johnson would deliver that leadership, he declined to comment. Mr Johnson has already been accused by environmentalists of talking up electric cars whilst reputedly planning a cut in driving taxes that would increase emissions and undermine the electric car market. UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 Government 'like Dad's Army' on climate change Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Sir Ian said polluting activities should incur more tax. He believes the Treasury should reform taxation policy to reward people with low-carbon lifestyles and nudge heavy consumers into more frugal patterns of behaviour. It was vital, he said, for the changes to be fair to all parts of society. He also believes Net Zero won't happen unless the government creates a Net Zero ministry to vet the policies of all government departments in the way the Brexit ministry vets Brexit-related decisions. Emissions won't be reduced to Net Zero while ministers are fixed on economic growth measured by GDP, instead of other measures such as environmental security and a relatively stable climate, he argued. Asked why the UK should take the lead when China's emissions are so high, he answered that the Chinese government was very worried about the climate and was taking it very seriously. Sir Ian has been in his post as the government's chief environment scientist for seven years Sir Ian, a polar expert with a chair in biology at St Andrews University, suggested that the UK was in a good position to show the world how to achieve Net Zero. But he agreed that similar radical action was ultimately needed by all nations. He said that on broader issues the government had produced (or was in the process of producing) impressive strategies on the environment, waste, air pollution, marine and food. Some ministers were enthusiastic to translate these into firm strategies, but they needed support from the public, he said. He confessed that he was not optimistic about the future of the planet because so many systems of government needed to change in a short time. Sir Ian, who leaves Defra on Thursday after seven years in post, said: ""The way we live our lives is generally not good for the environment. ""We like to consume things, but the more we consume the more we absorb the resources of the planet. ""That means we have to grow those resources or we have to mine them - and in doing that we generate waste. And consumption is going up all the time. ""(There's) a conundrum - how do we shift ourselves from consuming? We need to do more about learning to live sustainably. We talk about sustainability but we don't really know what it means. ""We need to make major technological advances in the way we use and reuse materials but we (also) need to reduce demand overall - and that means we need to change our behaviours and change our lifestyles. ""We certainly won't be able to travel so much as we have in the past, so we have to get used to using modern communications methods. ""Moving material round the planet will be more difficult so we'll have to do more with 3D printing; that sort of thing. Greater use is required of new technologies such as 3D printing ""We've got to reduce demand to a much greater extent than we have in the past, and if we don't reduce demand we're not going to reduce emissions. ""Emissions are a symptom of consumption and unless we reduce consumption we'll not reduce emissions. ""It will very rarely come down to a direct message like 'sorry, you can't buy that but you can buy this'. But there will be stronger messages within the (tax) system that make one thing more attractive than the other."" He said UK government strategies were in place on air, environment, resources, waste, marine, and food. ""[Ministers] need to be persuasive."" Asked if he was optimistic about the future of the planet, he said: âWe have the intelligence to do it; we have the potential to develop the technologies to do itâ¦ Iâm doubtful that we have the governance structures to make it happen at the speed it needs to happen at."" Richard Black, from the think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Sir Ian's words were ""somewhat surprising"". He added: ""They appear to contradict the mass of evidence assembled on getting to Net Zero, including the major report from the government's statutory adviser the Committee on Climate Change."" I understand that the Confederation of British Industry, the CBI, accept there will have to be behavioural change to meet Net Zero. A source in the organisation said they were frustrated that government climate policies were currently too weak. Given the very broad nature of Sir Ian's comments, we approached Downing Street for a comment. They declined and passed us back to Sir Ian's department, Defra. But their statement didn't address any of his key questions about governance, leadership and consumption. It said: ""The impact of climate change is clear and demands urgent action from countries around the world. The UK has already shown global leadership by becoming the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050 - but we know there is more to do. ""That's why we're reforming farming policy to reward environmental actions, reviewing our food system to ensure it is more sustainable, taking steps to accelerate tree-planting and peatland restoration, and introducing a flagship Environment Bill to address the biggest environmental priorities of our age.""

"The PD's Nicola Zingaretti: ""We love Italy and we consider it worthwhile to try this"" The leaders of Italy's centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and populist Five Star Movement have agreed to form a coalition government. ""We consider it worthwhile to try this experience,"" the PD's Nicola Zingaretti said after meeting the president on Wednesday - the deadline for any deal. It was agreed that Giuseppe Conte should stay on as prime minister. The planned joint administration will serve until the next scheduled elections in 2023. On Tuesday, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio welcomed what he referred to as the PD's willingness to accept Mr Conte's reappointment. The two parties, traditionally staunch rivals, have been holding tense talks following the collapse of the previous coalition government last week. ""In difficult times like these, shunning our responsibility to have the courage to try this is something we cannot afford,"" Mr Zingaretti said. Video: What Italians think of the government crisis President Sergio Mattarella, who met party leaders in Rome to try to chart a way forward, has summoned Mr Conte to a meeting on Thursday morning. He is widely expected to give him a mandate to form a new government. The two parties have been in discussions since Mr Conte resigned as prime minister in dramatic fashion last week. His decision came after Matteo Salvini, the leader of the nationalist League party, tabled a no-confidence motion against him. During his 20 August resignation speech,Mr Conte launched a blistering attack on Mr Salvini, accusing him of being ""irresponsible"". President Sergio Mattarella (L) shakes hands with League party leader Matteo Salvini Mr Salvini's League party had been in power with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement for 14 months when he effectively ended the coalition, saying he could no longer work with his partners. Both Mr Salvini and Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi called for fresh elections after meeting President Mattarella. This coalition agreement represents a major setback for the League's leader Matteo Salvini. For 14 months, he was the dominant figure in Italian politics. But a share of power wasn't enough for him - he wanted outright power. This led him to overreach. Mr Salvini brought down the government last week in the hope of winning a potential snap election. But it turns out that his gamble had a fatal flaw. The League Party's leader did not count on the possibility of his opponents teaming up to stop him. A common aim - Stop Salvini - now binds together the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party in their new coalition. But in order for this administration to last, the two parties may need to find more common ground than their mutual distrust of a single man. Their coalition will be harried and chased at every step by the man they've sent into sudden opposition. Following weeks of hostility between the two ruling parties, Mr Salvini called for a snap election this month, saying that differences with his Five Star coalition partners could not be mended. A failed attempt by Five Star to scrap plans for a high-speed rail link showed that the coalition could no longer govern, the right wing leader said at the time. However, addressing the Senate last week, Mr Conte said that Mr Salvini had been ""looking for a pretext to return to the polls"" since his party's success in European elections in May. This video can not be played Conte attacks Salvini in resignation speech The League has soared ahead of Five Star in opinion polls, due mainly to Mr Salvini's stance against illegal immigration, but has fallen back slightly since pulling the plug on the coalition. In the May elections, the League came top with 34% of the votes in Italy, whereas Five Star got about 17%. Salvini: Can Italy trust this man? Despite this, Mr Di Maio has said his party does not fear another election. Italy crisis talks resume as parties agree on PM Italy parties set tough demands to avoid election Italy PM makes fierce attack on Salvini and quits Conte attacks Salvini in speech.

"The House of Commons could sit empty for five weeks if the extended suspension goes through In a dramatic move on Wednesday morning, Britain's new Prime Minister Boris Johnson set in motion the suspension of the UK Parliament - which means MPs have much less time to debate Brexit, the process of the UK leaving the European Union. Parliament is to be suspended for five weeks ahead of 31 October, the day the UK is due to leave the EU. That's just nine weeks away. People who want the UK to remain in the EU are calling it a coup - and even some in favour of Brexit have criticised the move. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Mr Johnson wants to start a new parliamentary session, with a fresh programme, from 14 October. Instead of a normal three-week autumn recess, parliament will now wrap up some time around 10 September. With so little time, MPs would find it difficult to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Parliament always stops work for a few weeks in the autumn. But this isn't a normal recess: Mr Johnson is cutting short the current parliamentary session at a critical time. The UK was originally scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March. After Parliament rejected the deal negotiated with the EU three times, that deadline was extended. Departure day is now 31 October. Mr Johnson, who was one of the key figures in the Leave campaign, has promised to complete Brexit ""do or die"" - with or without a deal. However, most opposition members of Parliament (MPs) and many from the governing Conservative Party don't want to leave the EU without a deal. They fear it would damage the British economy, putting up prices and limiting access to the UK's biggest market. They've threatened to bring legislation ruling out a no-deal Brexit. Failing that, they could also call a vote of no-confidence in the government. Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Yes. It's what normally happens between the end of one session and the beginning of the next. However, the circumstances are unusual. A legal challenge would be difficult, since the government isn't breaking any law. It's just using parliamentary procedure, as Mr Johnson tries to fulfil his campaign promise to get the UK out of the EU. MPs could either go along with the suspension, with the risk of a no-deal Brexit, or they could trigger an election with a vote of no confidence in the government. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has called the suspension a ""constitutional outrage"" designed to prevent MPs from debating Brexit. How do you suspend Parliament? She does have a say, but it's limited. Technically, the government had to ask her for permission to suspend Parliament. This is normally a formality: the Queen keeps out of politics. If she had refused, that would have been unprecedented. She did not refuse. The Queen has always kept herself out of frontline politics Good question. Parliament will go back to work next Tuesday 3 September, but will then go into recess. If Mr Johnson gets his way, Parliament returns on 14 October, two-and-a-half weeks before the UK leaves the EU. However, if MPs pass a vote of no-confidence before 10 September, there could be a general election in October. Please upgrade your browser That depends. If the Conservatives win, then yes. They're ahead in the opinion polls, at about 31% last week, after Mr Johnson took over from the previous Prime Minister, Theresa May, in July. The main opposition Labour Party is trailing by 10 to 12 points, on about 21%. Labour is divided between traditional working-class areas, which tend to support Brexit, and voters in cities like London who are more in favour of remaining in the EU. But a Conservative win is not necessarily in the bag. Other parties, including the centre-left Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Nationalists, are all staunchly opposed to Brexit on any terms. Johnson is putting those MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit on the spot And then there's the Brexit Party under Nigel Farage, whose central policy is to get the UK out of the EU. The fluid political situation and tight opinion polls make it difficult to say who might get a majority, if anyone. This makes any election difficult to predict. Just ask Mrs May: she called an early election in 2017 but returned with a reduced majority, dependent on 10 MPs from Northern Ireland. As a result, she had to agree to a deal which would keep the UK aligned with EU rules for longer than Brexit supporters would accept. And so here we are. Why are MPs being sent home again?

"We need to change our behaviours and our lifestyles, says Sir Ian People must use less transport, eat less red meat and buy fewer clothes if the UK is to virtually halt greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the government's chief environment scientist has warned.

"An FCA ad campaign featuring an image of Arnold Schwarzenegger has urged consumers to make claims before the deadline Consumers say they are having problems making claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) with just hours to go until the deadline. Santander's online complaints form stopped working on Wednesday night. NatWest's form is still having issues. There have also been long waits to reach banks by phone amid a surge of last-minute calls. Customers have until 23:59 to make a claim as one the UK's biggest financial scandals draws to a close. Some customers vented their fury about the problems on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Santander said it was sorry for any inconvenience caused and that it had now fixed the glitch. Consumers given 'wrong' PPI information PPI fuelling fraud culture, says Barclays boss ""If any customer has been unable to submit a claim due to the issue, we will ensure that their claim is considered, even if it is submitted after the deadline."" RBS, which owns NatWest, said customers were still having ""intermittent"" issues accessing its form and advised them to reload the page. Both RBS and Barclays admitted there had been long waiting times on their PPI phone lines as the deadline neared. PPI was designed to cover loan repayments when policyholders fell ill or lost their jobs. But banks and loan providers mis-sold millions of policies - mainly between 1990 and 2010 - to people who did not need them or would not be covered. An astonishing Â£36bn in compensation has been paid out so far, with the typical payout amounting to Â£2,000. And the bill will continue to grow - banks have set aside an estimated Â£3bn for further compensation. More information on PPI and how you can claim is available on theFCA website,external. A free phone line, managed by the FCA, can be called on 0800 101 8800. Various templates are also available to download, along with guidance on claiming, on websites such asWhich?,external,MoneySavingExpert,external, andResolver,external. The floodgates opened to make historical claims for mis-sold PPI in 2011, when banks lost a legal battle to stop a review of past sales of the insurance. Since then, campaigners and the Financial Conduct Authority have been urging consumers to take action if they think they were wronged, amid fears that many consumers were unaware of their rights. It was when PPI was mentioned on youth TV hit Love Island that Guy Anker, managing editor of Moneysavingexpert, realised that the scandal had put consumer rights firmly into the mainstream. ""PPI has brought claiming and big-ticket money-back consumer rights into focus,"" he told the BBC last week. PPI was even mentioned on Love Island Moneysavingexpert and its founder Martin Lewis were at the forefront of the campaign for PPI compensation and the subject has been one of the biggest concerns of visitors to the website ever since. Mr Anker said the scandal had been at the heart of the public's distrust of banks, in a more tangible way than the banking crisis of a decade ago. Martyn James, of consumer website Resolver, also said that the PPI scandal had emboldened consumers to fight for their rights. ""As a nation, we are no longer willing to put up with being treated badly and are increasingly vocal about it,"" he said. Yet the PPI compensation campaign has been tarnished by the large number of claims management companies (CMCs) that sprang up to make claims on consumers' behalf. These companies - which typically take a 25% cut of any compensation payouts - made large volumes of unsolicited calls to the public, as well as sending texts, leading many to brand them a nuisance. However, the companies themselves have said many of these people would never have claimed without their help. Claims companies have sent a large number of unsolicited texts to the public The deadline may be arriving on Thursday, but the work will not be over for the banks and loan providers responsible for the scandal. Collectively, they have set aside billions of pounds more to cover compensation that has yet to work through the system. That process could still take years. Several high-profile companies have been fined by the Financial Conduct Authority, too. It is a huge change from how things stood a decade ago, when banks engaged in a long legal fight to stop past PPI sales being reviewed. Lloyds was the first to budge in May 2011 after it lost its legal battle, and others followed - although their reluctance to pay out led to heightened criticism of banks in some quarters. However, some in the banking industry have subsequently complained about members of the public making false claims.
