"Talks to avert the collapse of British Steel will resume later on Friday after the firm secured funds to stay afloat until the end of May. Sources close to owners Greybull Capital say its future will be discussed at ""ministerial level"". British Steel has admitted it needs further financial support from the government to help it address ""Brexit-related issues"". One possibility is a Â£75m government lifeline to the company. Otherwise, ministers can decide to nationalise the firm or see it fall into administration. On Thursday, British Steel said it had the backing of shareholders and lenders and that operations continued as usual while it sought a ""permanent solution"" to its financial troubles. A spokeswoman said: ""As the business navigates the significant uncertainties caused by Brexit, and explores options to strengthen the business for the long term, we are pleased to confirm that we have the required liquidity while we work towards a permanent solution."" British Steel seeks loan for 'Brexit issues' British Steel seeks Â£100m government loan British Steel is the UK's second largest steel firm, employing 4,500 people and about 20,000â indirectly via its supply chain. In April, the firm was forced to borrow Â£100m from the government to pay an EU carbon bill, so it could avoid a steep fine. However, concerns about its future were raised this week after Sky News reported that insolvency experts had been lined up in case the firm could not secure further government funding. It is understood that along with administration, nationalisation or a management buyout are being discussed as fall-back options for the company. British Steel's troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. The firm has also been struggling with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. Greybull Capital, a private equity firm, rescued Tata Steel's long products business during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016, saving more than 4,000 jobs. It has since rebranded the company as British Steel and recently returned it to profit. The concerns come days after Tata signalled its planned merger with German rival Thyssenkrupp was off, raising fresh doubts about its Port Talbot site. Tata, which admitted it is facing tough operating conditions in the UK, promised to keep its UK plants running, but only if they could be profitable.

"Boeing has completed development of a software update for its 737 Max plane which was grounded following two fatal crashes within five months. The US firm announced that it had flown the 737 Max with the updated software on 207 flights. It added it would provide data to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on how pilots interact with controls and displays in different scenarios. The FAA expects Boeing to submit the upgrade for certification next week. An Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed in March, killing all 157 people on board. It followed the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October, in which 189 people died. Both crashes were linked to the Boeing 737 Max's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System - a new feature on the aircraft which was designed to improve the handling of the plane and to stop it pitching up at too high an angle. What went wrong inside the Max cockpit How can Boeing regain trust? Pilots 'raised Boeing safety fears' months before Ethiopia crash Boeing said that once information on how pilots work with the upgraded system is submitted to the FAA, it will work with the regulator to schedule a certification test flight and submit final certification documentation. The Ethiopian Airlines crash killed all 157 people on board The company also said it had completed associated simulator testing on the upgraded system and had developed training and education materials that are now being reviewed by the FAA, global regulators and its airline customers. The FAA said earlier this week that it would hold a meeting on 23 May with air regulators from around the world to provide an update on reviews of Boeing's software fix and new pilot training. Aviation safety analyst Todd Curtis told the BBC that the US regulator was not the only one that Boeing had to satisfy. ""You also have other national authorities in Canada and the United Kingdom and in Europe who have said they would like to have their own tests and their own evaluation before certifying this aircraft for flight,"" he said. ""It's unclear whether or not there will be approval, let's say from Canada, to have this aircraft fly, which could directly affect US carriers, since many routes - even domestic US routes - overfly Canadian airspace. ""If the authorities there don't certify the 737 Max, they'll have to avoid that airspace."" Pilots are expected to undergo extra training on the new system once it receives certification. Mr Curtis said it would take a lot to convince them and other flight crew members that the aircraft was safe. ""They probably will have a fairly high bar to be satisfied before they'll give the seal of approval, as it were, that the aircraft is safe to fly,"" he said.

"More than two-thirds of LGBT people in the UK have been sexually harassed at work, a survey suggests. Of 1,151 LGBT people polled by the Trades Union Congress, 68% said they had experienced harassment, with 42% saying colleagues had made unwanted comments about their sex life. More than a quarter (27%) said they had received unwelcome sexual advances. The government said it was planning to shortly consult on how to strengthen existing laws on harassment. The survey - released on International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia - was conducted by the Trade Union Congress and is believed to be the first major study into LGBT sexual harassment at work in the UK. Are you being sexually harassed at work? When does flirting become sexual harassment? According to the survey, of the 68% who said they had experienced sexual harassment, 66% did not tell their employer, sometimes because they were afraid of being ""outed"" at work. The figure of 68% for LGBT people in the TUC's survey compares with a figure of 37% for the wider population in a BBC survey carried out in 2017. Of the 2,031 British adults questioned for BBC Radio 5 Live 53% of women and 20% of men said they had experienced sexual harassment,ranging from inappropriate comments to actual sexual assaults, at work or a place of study. Helen describes herself as pansexual. She works as a psychologist and says she regularly experiences sexual harassment at work. ""Recently I was working out in the gym at work and two male colleagues were standing behind me. One said, 'She's such a waste of a woman,' referring to the fact I am in a relationship with a woman. ""When I was leaving the gym one of them asked me, 'Is it because you've never had a real man?' He laughed and then they both wolf-whistled at me. I haven't been back to the work gym since."" Helen said the sexual harassment she has experienced hasn't only been verbal. ""I returned home early from my work Christmas party because a colleague asked to see a picture of my partner. ""When I showed him my Facebook profile picture, he said, 'I would pay Â£100 to watch you two.' I was really upset and he said, 'Don't be touchy,' and slapped my bum as I walked off."" Helen also has concerns about what reporting sexual harassment would mean for her at work. She said: ""I worry what it might do for my reputation and my chances of career progression to report these incidents."" For some people who have suffered sexual harassment at work, reporting their experiences did not make things easier. Patrick, not his real name, works in the public sector. He says he has endured years of sexual harassment. ""After a colleague found out I was gay, he asked me how much I charge as a rent boy. I reported it but nothing came of it. After an investigation into his experiences, Patrick's work life impacted his personal life too. ""All of my team were preparing for an away day, which was going to involve different sports activities. ""A few weeks before the away day, I was pulled into an office and told that the others didn't want to do the activities with me as they'd be uncomfortable about taking showers with me there. ""I was told I wouldn't be going on the away day. I reported it and I was off work for over a year during the investigation. The investigation outed me to my family."" Patrick says he went on to try to take his life twice. The TUC survey also suggested LGBT women were more likely to experience unwanted touching and sexual assault at work than men. Over a third of the women (35%) surveyed had experienced unwanted touching, for example placing hands on their lower back or knee. One in eight (12%) had been seriously sexually assaulted or raped at work. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the research revealed a ""hidden epidemic"" of LGBT abuse. She said: ""In 2019 LGBT people should be safe and supported at work. But instead they're experiencing shockingly high levels of sexual harassment and assault."" ""Workplace culture needs to change."" She said the government needed to ""change the law to put the responsibility for preventing harassment on employers, not victims"". Laura Russell, director of campaigns, policy and research at Stonewall, said the figures were ""shocking"", but added: ""We know from our own research and this report that LGBT people still face abuse and discrimination in Britain's workplaces."" A Government Equalities Office spokesperson said: ""It is appalling LGBT people are suffering this harassment. Workplaces should be safe, supportive environments for everybody. ""The government will consult shortly on how we can strengthen and clarify existing laws on third-party harassment, as well as making sure employers fully understand their legal responsibility to protect their staff.""

"Microsoft and Sony have formed a partnership on video games streaming, despite being fierce competitors. It is expected Sony will use Microsoftâs Azure cloud service to host its upcoming  PlayStation streaming service. Microsoft has been trialling a streaming offer of its own, under its Xbox brand. The firms said they would also work together on semiconductors and artificial intelligence applications. ""For many years, Microsoft has been a key business partner for us, though of course the two companies have also been competing in some areas,â said Kenichio Yoshida, Sonyâs chief executive. âI believe that our joint development of future cloud solutions will contribute greatly to the advancement of interactive content.â Microsoftâs chief executive, Satya Nadella, said: ""Sony has always been a leader in both entertainment and technology, and the collaboration we announced today builds on this history of innovation.â Does the new Xbox mean game over for discs?

For Sony, if its PlayStation is to remain competitive, it too is likely to need to move heavily into streaming full, high-quality games over the internet. Industry analysts say Sony might have struggled to do it alone. ""Everybody else has a head start on them,â said Rebekah Valentine, from GamesIndustry.biz. âThere was a lot of discussion that Sony seemed to going the traditional route of making a normal console and continuing with what they had been doing in the past.

"Microsoft and Sony have formed a partnership on video games streaming, despite being fierce competitors. It is expected Sony will use Microsoftâs Azure cloud service to host its upcoming  PlayStation streaming service. Microsoft has been trialling a streaming offer of its own, under its Xbox brand. The firms said they would also work together on semiconductors and artificial intelligence applications. ""For many years, Microsoft has been a key business partner for us, though of course the two companies have also been competing in some areas,â said Kenichio Yoshida, Sonyâs chief executive. âI believe that our joint development of future cloud solutions will contribute greatly to the advancement of interactive content.â Microsoftâs chief executive, Satya Nadella, said: ""Sony has always been a leader in both entertainment and technology, and the collaboration we announced today builds on this history of innovation.â Does the new Xbox mean game over for discs? Gaming worth more than video and music How the UK became a major player in the gaming world The two companies have been bitter rivals in gaming since the launch of the first Xbox console in 2001. But in its pursuit to compete with Amazon Web Services, hosting PlayStationâs streaming service would be a major coup for Azure, the fastest growing part of Microsoftâs business. For Sony, if its PlayStation is to remain competitive, it too is likely to need to move heavily into streaming full, high-quality games over the internet. Industry analysts say Sony might have struggled to do it alone. ""Everybody else has a head start on them,â said Rebekah Valentine, from GamesIndustry.biz. âThere was a lot of discussion that Sony seemed to going the traditional route of making a normal console and continuing with what they had been doing in the past. This partnership with Microsoft shows they are fully exploring streaming technology.â Sony already has a significant footing in games streaming - its PS Now service, which offers streaming access to the PlayStation back catalogue, accounts for 36% share of the $387m global games streaming market, said analyst Piers Harding-Rolls, from IHS Markit. However, with the streaming market expected to expand rapidly over the next five years, Sonyâs comparative lack of expertise and infrastructure left it exposed. ""It is clear that Microsoft is the best choice for Sony even with the competitive dynamic between Xbox and PlayStation,â Mr Harding-Rolls said. ""Working together they have a better chance to head off competition from the likes of Google, which has gone on to dominate the last wave of technology disruption in the mobile space alongside Apple."" While precise details of the partnership are still vague, the companies also said they would be working together on new semiconductors, image sensors and artificial intelligence. For Microsoft, that opens the door to getting its cloud technology integrated into more consumer products, such as cameras and televisions, rather than working mostly on business applications as it does today.

"The agency, Splash, apologised to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for ""distress"" caused by the images The Duke of Sussex has accepted damages and an apology from a news agency which used a helicopter to take photographs of his home in the Cotswolds. Prince Harry's lawyers told a High Court hearing the pictures taken by Splash News and Picture Agency included one of the inside of a bedroom at the privately-rented Oxfordshire property. The court heard the pictures had ""seriously undermined"" Harry's safety. Splash said it had made an ""error of judgement"" which would not be repeated. In a statement, it added: ""We apologise to the Duke and Duchess (of Sussex) for the distress we have caused."" Buckingham Palace said the duke ""acknowledges and welcomes the formal apology"" from Splash. The court heard the photos, which were ""published by the Times newspaper and elsewhere online"", were of living and dining areas, and included a shot taken ""directly into the bedroom"". The duke's lawyers told Mr Justice Warby that Harry and his wife Meghan had chosen to make the Oxfordshire property their home because of its ""high level of privacy"". But Gerrard Tyrrell, who read a statement in court on the duke's behalf, said the couple had subsequently felt unable to live there. The duke and duchess now live at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor When the photos were published in mid-January, the couple's official residence was Kensington Palace. But a spokeswoman for the Sussexes said they had spent a lot of time at their country retreat in the Cotswolds, which had been privately rented by Harry. Privacy, publicity and the royal baby The duke and duchessmoved from Kensington Palace to Frogmore Cottage, Windsor, in April- shortly before Meghan gave birth to their son Archie. Mr Tyrrell said Splash had agreed to pay a ""substantial"" sum of damages and legal costs to settle the privacy and data claims faced by the agency. He added Splash would ""not repeat its conduct by using any aerial means to take photographs or film footage of the duke's private home, which would infringe privacy or data rights or otherwise be unlawful activity"". Splash News and Picture Agency sells news, photos and videos across the world, including paparazzi images of celebrities. It boasts of taking more than 150,000 photos a day across the globe. In its code of conduct, Splash says it is ""committed to the fair and ethical treatment of our subjects, our contributors and our customers"". But the case brought by Prince Harry is not the first time Splash has been accused of taking intrusive photos. In 2014, Corbis Images UK Limited - which was trading under Splash's name - made photos of Adele's two-year-old son available for publishing in the English press. The singer's lawyersaccepted a five-figure sum to settle the case.

"Pret a Manger is reportedly planning to buy rival Eat and turn the chain's 94 stores into vegetarian outlets. Pret, which has 400 stores in the UK, has four branded as ""Veggie Pret"" and is aiming to jump on the trend for vegetarian and vegan foods. It comes as plant-based foods are increasing in popularity, with shares in US company Beyond Meat soaring at this month's stock market debut. Both Pret a Manger and Eat declined to comment. The Evening Standard reportedthat talks between the two chains were understood to be at an advanced stage,external, with Pret in line to buy the majority of Eat's 94 shops or the whole business. The paper reported that in February Eat's private-equity owner Horizon Capital appointed Spayne Lindsay, a corporate advisory firm, to offload the business. Both food chains are owned by private equity companies. Pret a Manger was sold by Bridgepoint to Luxembourg-based JAB Holdings last year and as resultall 12,000 staff employed at Pret received a Â£1,000 bonus. It has 500 stores globally. The Financial Timesreported that ""nothing had been signed"",externalbut that the ""details were being ironed out"" on a deal. It also added that there were potential other bidders for Eat. In April, Eat reported a pre-tax loss of Â£17.2m in the year to end of June 2018, but said that it had since experienced 11 consecutive months of like-for-like sales growth. Veganism is becoming more popular in Great Britain. Research by the Vegan Society in 2016 estimated there were about 540,000 vegans in the country, compared with about 150,000 in 2006.

"An international crime gang which used malware to steal $100m (Â£77m) from more than 40,000 victims has been dismantled. A complex police operation conducted investigations in the US, Bulgaria, Germany, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The gang infected computers with GozNym malware, which captured online banking details to access bank accounts. The gang was put together from criminals who advertised their skills on online forums. The details of the operation were revealed at the headquarters of the European police agency Europol in The Hague. It said that the investigation was unprecedented, especially in terms of cross-border co-operation. Ten members of the network have been charged in Pittsburgh, US on a range of offences, including stealing money and laundering those funds using US and foreign bank accounts. Five Russian nationals remain on the run, including one who developed the GozNym malware and oversaw its development and management, including leasing it to other cyber-criminals. Various other gang members now face prosecution in other countries, including: The leader of the network, along with his technical assistant, faces charges in Georgia Another member, whose role was to take over different bank accounts, has been extradited to the US from Bulgaria to face trial A gang member who encrypted GozNym malware to make sure it was not detected on networks faces prosecution in Moldova Two more face charges in Germany for money-laundering Among the victims were small businesses, law firms, international corporations and non-profit organisations. Europol said it was a great example of cross-border co-operation One of the things that the operation has highlighted is how common the selling of nefarious cyber-skills has become, says Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist from University of Surrey. ""The developers of this malware advertised their 'product' so that other criminals could use their service to conduct banking fraud. ""What is known as 'crime as a service' has been a growing feature in recent years, allowing organised crime gangs to switch from their traditional haunts of drugs to much more lucrative cyber-crime."" UK cyber-crime victims lose Â£190,000 a day Unpicking the cyber-crime economy It is a hybrid of two other pieces of malware, Nymaim and Gozi. The first of these is what is known as a ""dropper"", software that is designed to sneak other malware on to a device and install it. Up until 2015, Nymaim was used primarily to get ransomware on to devices. Gozi has been around since 2007. Over the years it has resurfaced with new techniques, all aimed at stealing financial information. It was used in concerted attacks on US banks. Combining the two created what one expert called a ""double-headed monster"". Scott Brady said the case represented a ""milestone"" in the fight against international cybercrime Unsuspecting citizens thought they were clicking a simple link - instead they gave hackers access to their most intimate details. US attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Scott Brady stood alongside prosecutors and cyber-crime fighters from five other nations inside Europol's high security headquarters, to announce the takedown of what he described as a ""global conspiracy"". The suspected ringleader used GozNym malware and contracted different cyber-crime services - hard to detect bulletproof hosting platforms, money mules and spammers - to control more than 41,000 computers and enable cyber-thieves to steal and whitewash an estimated $100m from victims' bank accounts. Gang members in four countries have been charged - a coup for cyber-crime fighters who say the discovery of this sophisticated scam demonstrates the borderless nature of cyber-crime and need for cross border co-operation to detect and disrupt these networks.

"Giving the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei a role in building the UK's 5G network poses an unnecessary risk to national security, a former MI6 chief has said. Sir Richard Dearlove said such a move could give the Chinese government a ""potentially advantageous exploitative position"" in the UK's telecoms network. It follows reports last month thatthe PM is ready to let the firm supply some parts of the UK's 5G infrastructure,external. A Huawei spokesman said Sir Richard's warnings were ""short on fact"". Sir Richard's intervention comes asUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively banning American firms from using foreign telecoms deemed to pose a threat to national security. Although it does not name Huawei, it is widely considered to be aimed at the firm following repeated warnings by US officials that it could be used by the Chinese state to spy on or sabotage foreign networks. The company has vehemently denied the allegations and insists it is independent from state control. All you need to know about Huawei's problems UK at odds with cyber-allies over Huawei Huawei leak not criminal offence, police say In a foreword to a new report by the Henry Jackson Society think tank, Sir Richard said: ""The fact that the British government now appears to have decided to place the development of some of its most sensitive critical infrastructure in the hands of a company from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is deeply worrying. ""The PRC uses its sophisticated technical capabilities not only to control its own population (to an extreme and growing degree), but it also conducts remotely aggressive intelligence gathering operations on a global scale. ""No part of the communist Chinese state is ultimately able to operate free of the control exercised by its Communist Party leadership. ""To place the PRC in a potentially advantageous exploitative position in the UK's future telecommunications systems therefore is a risk, however remote it may seem at the moment, we simply do not need to take."" Former defence secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after details concerning Huawei from a National Security Council meeting were leaked Last month, former defence secretaryGavin Williamson was sackedafter details about Huawei's potential involvement in the UK's 5G network - discussed at the National Security Council - were leaked to the Daily Telegraph. In the paper's report, Mrs May was said to have overridden ministers who had expressed concerns about the plans. Mr Williamson has strenuously denied leaking the information. The government has insisted no final decision has been taken on Huawei's involvement in the UK network, although the issue remains highly sensitive in Whitehall. Sir Richard said the government - which has been seeking to build economic links with China - should not be influenced by fears of economic reprisals by Beijing if Huawei is excluded. ""If Australia can blackball Huawei as its 5G provider, the UK can certainly do the same without undue concern about the consequences,"" he said. A Huawei spokesman said: ""This report is long on politically motivated insinuation but short on fact. ""It fundamentally misunderstands the nature of modern China, global technology markets and of 5G. ""The isolationist approach they recommend may support an America-first trade agenda but it's hard to see how it's in UK's national interest."" A government spokesman said individual countries were taking ""a range of different approaches"" to the issue of 5G security. ""There are no universal solutions,"" the spokesman said. ""Whatever final decision the UK government takes about 5G network infrastructure, the UK is not considering any options that would put our national security communications at risk, within the UK and with our closest allies.""

"The supervision of all offenders on probation in England and Wales is being put back in the public sector after a series of failings with the part-privatisation of the system. It reverses changes made in 2014 by then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. The National Audit Office saidproblems with the part-privatisation had cost taxpayers nearly Â£500m. All offenders will be monitored by the National Probation Service from December 2020. It had previously been managing just those posing the highest threat, with low and medium risk offenders monitored by community rehabilitation companies. Chief probation inspector Dame Glenys Stacey said she was ""delighted"" about the decision because the model of part-privatisation was ""irredeemably flawed"", and people would be safer under a system delivered by the public sector. The National Audit Office - Parliament's spending watchdog - also said that the numbers returning to prison for breaching their licence conditions had ""skyrocketed"" under part-privatisation. Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC he recognised that ""the system isn't working"" and  renationalisation was the best way to reduce reoffending and rehabilitate people. But he said there was still a role to be played by private companies, as well as charities. Probation services 'systematically flawed', says chief inspector Rise in deaths of offenders on probation Under the new system, released prisoners and those serving community sentences will be monitored by staff from the National Probation Service based in eleven new regions. Each area will have a dedicated private or voluntary sector partner, responsible for unpaid work schemes, drug misuse programmes and training courses. This video can not be played Probation service caused offender, Roger Mann, to fall back into crime: ""It doesn't actually do anything for me"" Payment by results - a key element of Mr Grayling's model - will not be used. The community rehabilitation companies' contracts are not being renewed. When Mr Grayling introduced changes in 2014, opponents warned the public could be put at risk, and many probation staff quit due to fears that the new system would be too fragmented. The House of Commons justice committee also expressed ""considerable concern"" at the time, that companies supervising low and medium risk offenders would not be required to have professionally qualified staff - although Mr Grayling promised employees would have the right skills to manage offenders. The man said he now had to use a call centre to get through to a probation officer (stock image) A former prisoner with experience of the system before and after Mr Grayling's reforms spoke to BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I've now been on probation five, six months and I've seen my probation officer five times. I don't blame the staff because they're just overworked. It's become more about hitting targets, and with that you end up with less time with your probation officer. ""The thing is with me, I've come to a point where I've had enough and I want to do something with my life. And none of that support has come through probation. ""They used to have a work phone number and they used to say, 'if you need to phone me or if there's a problem come up, then you call the probation officers'. They'd ring you back and say, 'is everything alright?', because they'd saved all of our numbers within that phone. ""It felt like there was somebody there for you. ""At the moment, if I want to speak to my probation officer, I have to phone a call centre, who then tries to find my probation officer, so I've gone through two or three people, for basically an email."" Mr Gauke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We've run into difficulties for complex reasons"", including that ""the case loads have not been what was anticipated"", with more higher-risk cases needing to be dealt with and fewer in the lower-risk categories. He said there was still a ""really important role"" to be played by both the private and voluntary sectors, for example in terms of drug rehabilitation and unpaid work. But when it comes to offender management, ""it would be better done if that was a unified model and we bring it under one organisation"", he told BBC Breakfast. He added that ""the reoffending rate has fallen by a couple of points since 2014"". The MoJ said the reforms announced on Thursday were designed to build on the ""successful elements"" of the existing system, which led to 40,000 additional offenders being supervised every year. The decision to renationalise offender supervision will be seen as an admission by the government that Chris Grayling's flagship reforms have failed. He went ahead in 2014 despite numerous warnings about the considerable risks of splitting probation services between different providers and introducing a method of payment-by-results. Probation unions and criminal justice experts urged him to at least pilot the new approach, so problems could be identified and rectified. But Mr Grayling went for quick, wholesale change. He wanted the contracts with the private companies firmly in place before the 2015 general election so the system couldn't be undone if there was a change of government. However, inspection after inspection signalled serious problems, with the nail in the coffin being Dame Glenys Stacey's report in March. Probation union Napo welcomed the new approach, saying the part-privatisation should never have happened. It said it would continue to oppose the involvement of private firms in rehabilitation programmes. And shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said the Conservatives had been ""forced to face reality"" that their probation model was ""broken"". But speaking on behalf of four companies that are responsible for 17 of 21 community rehabilitation companies in England and Wales, Janine McDowell, of Sodexo Justice Services in the UK & Ireland, said she was disappointed by the decision. ""As well as increasing cost and risk, this more fragmented system will cause confusion as offenders are passed between various organisations for different parts of their sentence,"" she said.

During her cognitive behavioural therapy, she traced her problems back to when her brother and sisters both had life-threatening illnesses as young children, and the severe bullying she suffered at primary school. Racist bullies would pull her hair out, slam her fingers in doors until all her fingernails fell out, and flush her head down the toilet. ""I still have that memory of the water going up my nose and feeling like if they don't pull me up now I am going to drown with my head in this toilet,"" she said. After that, she hid under a sink and had her first panic attack. ""If I could erase my memory, then I would take that one memory out of my head, because that memory is always there,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: 'We now need to get on with the job of delivering Brexit' Prime Minister Theresa May has won a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party by 200 to 117. After securing 63% of the total vote, she is now immune from a leadership challenge for a year. Speaking in Downing Street, she vowed to deliver the Brexit ""people voted for"" but said she had listened to the concerns of MPs who voted against her. Her supporters urged the party to move on but critics said losing the support of a third of MPs was ""devastating"". The prime minister won the confidence vote with a majority of 83, with 63% of Conservative MPs backing her and 37% voting against her. The secret ballot was triggered by 48 of her MPs angry at her Brexit policy, which they say betrays the 2016 referendum result. What next for Theresa May? For or against? How Tory MPs said they would vote Brexit: A really simple guide The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the level of opposition was ""not at all comfortable"" for the prime minister and a ""real blow"" to her authority.

Speaking shortly after the result was announced, Mrs May said she would be fighting for changes to her Brexit deal at an EU summit on Thursday. ""I am pleased to have received the backing of my colleagues in tonight's ballot,"" she said. ""Whilst I am grateful for that support, a significant number of colleagues did cast a vote against me and I have listened to what they said."" She spoke of a ""renewed mission - delivering the Brexit people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that really works for everyone"". Jacob Rees-Mogg, who led calls for the confidence vote, said losing the support of a third of her MPs was a ""terrible result for the prime minister"" and called on her to resign. Brexit-backing Tory MP Mark Francois told the BBC it was ""devastating"" that more than half of backbenchers not serving in the government had abandoned the prime minister. ""In the cold light of day when people reflect on that number - 117 - it's a massive number, far more than anyone was predicting. I think that will be very sobering for the prime minister. I think she needs to think very carefully about what she does now."" This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, announces May survive confidence vote Transport Secretary Chris Grayling conceded there were ""lessons"" for the prime minister and the party in the result but former cabinet minister Damian Green said it was a ""decisive"" victory for the prime minister, which should allow her to ""move on and get on with the job in hand"". Conservative grandee Nicholas Soames urged Brexiteers to ""throw their weight"" behind the PM as she sought to address the ""grave concerns"" many MPs had about aspects of the EU deal. The result was greeted by cheers and applause from Tory MPs as it was announced by backbench Tory chairman Sir Graham Brady. The prime minister still faces a battle to get the Brexit deal she agreed with the EU through the UK Parliament, with all opposition parties and, clearly, dozens of her own MPs against it. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the vote had ""changed nothing"". ""Theresa May has lost her majority in Parliament, her government is in chaos and she's unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country."" This video can not be played Theresa May: How the PM fought through Brexit battles Labour has said it will table a no-confidence motion that all MPs - not just Conservatives - will be able to vote in when they felt they had a chance of winning it, and forcing a general election. The SNP's Stephen Gethins urged Labour to ""step up to the plate"" and call a vote of no confidence in Mrs May, accusing the government of ""playing games with people's lives"". DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said his party, which helps keep Mrs May in power, was still concerned about the Irish backstop plan, which most MPs were against. ""I don't think this vote really changes anything very much in terms of the arithmetic,"" he told BBC News. But he said the DUP would not support a no-confidence motion in Parliament at this stage. Mrs May earlier vowed to fight on to deliver her Brexit deal, which she argues is the only option for leaving the EU in an orderly way on 29 March. But in a last-minute pitch to her MPs before the vote she promised to stand down as leader before the next scheduled election in 2022. While ""in her heart"" she wanted to fight another election as leader, she realised her party did not want her to. However, she resisted calls to name a firm date for her departure. If she had lost the confidence vote Mrs May would have been forced to stand down as Conservative Party leader, and then as prime minister. But she is now expected to travel to a summit in Brussels on Thursday to continue trying to persuade EU leaders to change the deal - they have previously said it cannot be renegotiated. The outcome of the vote was welcomed by Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who said avoiding a no-deal exit from the EU was their ""shared goal"".

"Five banks have been fined â¬1.07bn (Â£935m) by the European Commission after traders clubbed together to rig the foreign exchange market. Four banks in the ""Banana Split"" cartel - Barclays, RBS, Citigroup and JP Morgan - were fined â¬811m in all. Three banks in the ""Essex Express"" cartel - Barclays and RBS again, plus MUFG - were fined â¬258m. A sixth bank, UBS, was excused financial penalties for revealing the cartels' existence.

"Helen Kennett said she spoke to a knifeman with ""evil"" in his eyes after he stabbed a waiter An off-duty nurse asked one of the London Bridge attackers what was wrong with him before he stabbed her in the neck, an inquest has heard. Helen Kennett told the Old Bailey she was trying to help Alexandre Pigeard, who was fatally wounded, when she was confronted by his ""evil-eyed"" attacker. When she spoke to him, he replied, ""no, what's wrong with you?"" before wounding her too. Eight people were killed in the attacks on the night of 3 June 2017. ""I was convinced I was going to die but I didn't want to die there,"" Ms Kennett told the court. ""I wanted to die round the corner with my family."" Ms Kennett had been drinking prosecco to celebrate her birthday with her mother and sister in the courtyard of Boro Bistro, at the southern end of London Bridge. Minutes after she saw the attackers' van plough into railings above where they were sitting, she noticed a waiter, Mr Pigeard, was bleeding. She told the court she then saw the man holding a knife behind Mr Pigeard, describing him as having an ""empty"", ""soulless"" and ""evil"" look in his eyes. ""Before I could process what I was seeing was happening... he stabbed me in the neck to the left side,"" she said. Alexandre Pigeard had been working as a waiter Although she escaped with her family, she did not get to an ambulance for two hours, the inquest heard. Mr Pigeard, 26, died of his injuries. Eight people, including Mr Pigeard, who were killed by three men who drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people in and around Borough Market. The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Another witness told the court he believed the man who killed Mr Pigeard was Rachid Redouane. Geoffrey Huet said he locked eyes with the attacker as he dealt what looked like the fatal blow to Mr Pigeard. ""He had this craziness in his eyes, this anger. He was furious,"" Mr Huet added. The witness ran away and tried to get help, the court heard. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened Medics 'not told' where attack victims were Redouane, 30, was shot dead by police minutes later, alongside his accomplices Khuram Butt and Youssef Zaghba. Another witness told the court she too saw Mr Pigeard being wounded as she celebrated a friend's birthday. Andzelika Abokaityte said in a statement read to the court that she watched as the ""evil and smiling"" attacker grabbed hold of Mr Pigeard before stabbing him from behind. ""As he was stabbed, the attacker was looking around as if to find the next person to stab."" ""I remember thinking: 'I'm going to die'"", the court heard. The inquests continue.

"Theresa May has promised to set a timetable for the election of her successor after the next Brexit vote in the first week of June. The agreement follows a meeting between the prime minister and senior Tory MPs who are demanding a date for her departure from Downing Street. If she loses the vote on her Brexit plan, already rejected three times, sources told the BBC she would resign. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has said he will run for leader once Mrs May goes. The prime minister survived a confidence vote by Conservative MPs at the end of last year and party rules mean she cannot formally be challenged again until December. Johnson confirms bid for Tory leadership MPs 'have duty to support Brexit bill' What happens next? But Mrs May has come under increasing pressure to leave Downing Street this summer, amid the Brexit impasse and poor results for the Conservatives in the recent local elections in England. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said senior sources had told her it was ""inconceivable"" the prime minister could remain in office if MPs rejected her Brexit plans for a fourth time. ""Discussing an election timetable"" doesn't sound that exciting. But the paragraph tucked into the short formal letter from Sir Graham Brady to Tory MPs all but marks the end of Theresa May's premiership and the beginning of the official hunt for the next leader of the country. After the lines in the short note restate the prime minister's determination to get Brexit done, it confirms in black and white that after the next big vote, in the first week of June, the prime minister will make plans with the party for choosing a successor. Right now, the expectation is that vote will be lost (although it is not impossible, of course, that Number 10 could turn it round). And the conversation that's been arranged won't just be a gentle chat about what to do next. Senior sources have told me that means, even though the letter doesn't spell it out, that if her Brexit plan is defeated again, Mrs May will announce she is going. Read more from Laura The chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, Sir Graham Brady, said he had reached an agreement over the prime minister's future during ""very frank"" talks in Parliament. He said the committee's executive and Mrs May would meet again to discuss her future following the first debate and vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning 3 June. Sir Graham said there was now ""greater clarity"" about the situation. Johnson confirms bid for Tory leadership MPs 'have duty to support Brexit bill' What happens next? Asked if that meant the prime minister would quit immediately if MPs rejected her Brexit plans once more, he said that scenario went ""beyond"" what had been agreed. MPs have rejected the prime minister's Brexit agreement with the EU three times. But she will have another go at gaining their support in the week beginning 3 June, when the Commons votes for the first time on the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation needed to implement her deal with the EU. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady: PM will announce departure timetable in early June Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has joined the growing list of Conservatives who say they will stand for leader when Mrs May announces her departure. He told a business conference in Manchester: ""Of course I am going to go for it."" Conservative MP Grant Shapps welcomed the announcement that a timetable would be set out for Mrs May's departure, suggesting it would inject greater ambition and dynamism into the Brexit process. The former party chairman told BBC News the Brexit bill had no chance of passing in its current state but holding another vote would allow Mrs May to demonstrate she had ""tried everything"". ""It is right to bring this whole saga to a conclusion,"" he said. This video can not be played The Conservatives jostling to be the next prime minister But fellow Tory Phillip Lee, who backs another Brexit referendum, said replacing the prime minister would not ""solve the crisis"" the UK found itself in or build a parliamentary majority for the terms of the UK's departure. ""Forcing the PM's resignation and spending this summer locked in a leadership election where candidates trade ever more fantastic visions of unicorn Brexitsâ¦is neither in the interests of the Conservative Party nor of the United Kingdom,"" he said. Last month,the 1922 Committee executive narrowly decided against changing the party's leadership rulesto allow an early challenge to Mrs May. Local Tory associations have confirmedthey will hold a vote of confidencein her leadership on 15 June, although its result will not be binding. Much of the anger in the Conservative parliamentary party is focusing on the prime minister's talks with Labour, aimed at reaching a cross-party compromise to get her deal through the Commons. BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said he understood the talks will ""soon be drawing to a close"" adding that Tory whips had ""given up on this phase of the negotiations and are looking to pack the legislation with goodies for Brexiteers"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would not support the Withdrawal Agreement Bill unless it guaranteed membership of a customs union with the EU, and protected workers' rights, consumer rights and environmental rights. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said his party would ""happily support"" the legislation, provided it was subject to a ""confirmatory public vote"".

But Mrs May has come under increasing pressure to leave Downing Street this summer, amid the Brexit impasse and poor results for the Conservatives in the recent local elections in England. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said senior sources had told her it was ""inconceivable"" the prime minister could remain in office if MPs rejected her Brexit plans for a fourth time. ""Discussing an election timetable"" doesn't sound that exciting. But the paragraph tucked into the short formal letter from Sir Graham Brady to Tory MPs all but marks the end of Theresa May's premiership and the beginning of the official hunt for the next leader of the country. After the lines in the short note restate the prime minister's determination to get Brexit done, it confirms in black and white that after the next big vote, in the first week of June, the prime minister will make plans with the party for choosing a successor. Right now, the expectation is that vote will be lost (although it is not impossible, of course, that Number 10 could turn it round). And the conversation that's been arranged won't just be a gentle chat about what to do next. Senior sources have told me that means, even though the letter doesn't spell it out, that if her Brexit plan is defeated again, Mrs May will announce she is going. Read more from Laura The chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, Sir Graham Brady, said he had reached an agreement over the prime minister's future during ""very frank"" talks in Parliament. He said the committee's executive and Mrs May would meet again to discuss her future following the first debate and vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning 3 June. Sir Graham said there was now ""greater clarity"" about the situation. Johnson confirms bid for Tory leadership MPs 'have duty to support Brexit bill' What happens next? Asked if that meant the prime minister would quit immediately if MPs rejected her Brexit plans once more, he said that scenario went ""beyond"" what had been agreed. MPs have rejected the prime minister's Brexit agreement with the EU three times. But she will have another go at gaining their support in the week beginning 3 June, when the Commons votes for the first time on the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation needed to implement her deal with the EU. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady: PM will announce departure timetable in early June Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has joined the growing list of Conservatives who say they will stand for leader when Mrs May announces her departure. He told a business conference in Manchester: ""Of course I am going to go for it."" Conservative MP Grant Shapps welcomed the announcement that a timetable would be set out for Mrs May's departure, suggesting it would inject greater ambition and dynamism into the Brexit process. The former party chairman told BBC News the Brexit bill had no chance of passing in its current state but holding another vote would allow Mrs May to demonstrate she had ""tried everything"". ""It is right to bring this whole saga to a conclusion,"" he said. This video can not be played The Conservatives jostling to be the next prime minister But fellow Tory Phillip Lee, who backs another Brexit referendum, said replacing the prime minister would not ""solve the crisis"" the UK found itself in or build a parliamentary majority for the terms of the UK's departure. ""Forcing the PM's resignation and spending this summer locked in a leadership election where candidates trade ever more fantastic visions of unicorn Brexitsâ¦is neither in the interests of the Conservative Party nor of the United Kingdom,"" he said. Last month,the 1922 Committee executive narrowly decided against changing the party's leadership rulesto allow an early challenge to Mrs May. Local Tory associations have confirmedthey will hold a vote of confidencein her leadership on 15 June, although its result will not be binding. Much of the anger in the Conservative parliamentary party is focusing on the prime minister's talks with Labour, aimed at reaching a cross-party compromise to get her deal through the Commons. BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said he understood the talks will ""soon be drawing to a close"" adding that Tory whips had ""given up on this phase of the negotiations and are looking to pack the legislation with goodies for Brexiteers"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would not support the Withdrawal Agreement Bill unless it guaranteed membership of a customs union with the EU, and protected workers' rights, consumer rights and environmental rights. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said his party would ""happily support"" the legislation, provided it was subject to a ""confirmatory public vote"".

"Tiffany Gillard and James Francis' son Jenson died 40 minutes after he was born in June last year A newborn baby died due to a number of ""systemic failures"" in his care at a Welsh hospital, a coroner has said. Returning a narrative verdict, coroner David Regan found Jenson James Francisdied 40 minutes after he was born. His mother Tiffany Gillard gave birth to him at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil on 21 June 2018. The head of midwifery at Cwm Taf health board said a number of changes had since been implemented. Itsmaternity services are in special measures. Ms Gillard told the inquest that when she was told what had happened, she was left ""shocked and numb"". Mr Regan found Jenson died of cardiopulmonary failure due to ""a failure to deliver him in good time, exposing him to the effects of developing maternal sepsis"". Pontypridd Coroner's Court heard evidence from Dr Pina Amin, the obstetric lead at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff, who was asked to look at the case. Referring to the cardiotocography (CTG) reading - a recording of the foetal heartbeat and uterine contractions - Dr Amin indicated a caesarean section delivery should have been offered to the mother about six hours before the baby was actually delivered at 05:20 BST. The CTG was ""abnormal"" from 22:21 on 20 June which Dr Amin said ""would tell me this baby is not happy"". The Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil has been at the centre of a damning report about maternity services She suggested CTG training in Cwm Taf health board ""needs to be such that it's actually fit for purpose"". She told the hearing ""ineffective communication"" resulted in ""a dysfunctional team without a clear leader"". Dr Amin interviewed staff on the maternity unit ahead of the inquest and said they appeared to have a reluctance to ask for help because ""maybe they might be seen as not being able to cope"". Another independent expert who was asked to review the case said there were ""systemic issues"" which led to baby Jenson's death. Dr Helen Claire Francis, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at UHW, said ""incorrect interpretation"" of the CTG readings ""played a big role"". Merthyr baby's death 'could have been avoided' Mothers ignored and made to feel worthless Mum 'scared' to use hospital Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity problems Dr Francis said when a second opinion on the CTG readings was sought, ""it wasn't always correct"". She also raised concerns that there was ""no thought"" to escalate to senior members of the clinical team. Although she acknowledged a midwife might not have been as skilled as senior member of the team, Dr Francis said the CTG ""should have been picked up"" over the course of the evening. The inquest also heard from Cwm Taf health board's head of midwifery, Kerri Eilertsen-Feeney. She told the inquest that training for her staff ""is the same as what is offered across Wales"", adding that a number of changes had been implemented prior to the publication of the critical report. Ms Eilertsen-Feeney said work was under way to change the culture within the health board so junior staff would feel able to ""jump call or query senior staff"". ""But cultural changes can't happen over night,"" she added.

"Five banks have been fined â¬1.07bn (Â£935m) by the European Commission after traders clubbed together to rig the foreign exchange market. Four banks in the ""Banana Split"" cartel - Barclays, RBS, Citigroup and JP Morgan - were fined â¬811m in all. Three banks in the ""Essex Express"" cartel - Barclays and RBS again, plus MUFG - were fined â¬258m. A sixth bank, UBS, was excused financial penalties for revealing the cartels' existence. The European Commission said the market-rigging took place from 2007 to 2013. The Commission's investigation, which began in September 2013, revealed that some individual foreign exchange traders, using online chatrooms, exchanged trading plans and occasionally co-ordinated their trading strategies. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the banks' behaviour ""undermined the integrity of the sector at the expense of the European economy and consumers"". RBS said its â¬249m share of the fines was ""fully covered by existing provisions"". Barclays also said it had set aside money to cover the fine. Similar fines for manipulating the currency markets wereimposed in 2014 by UK, US and Swiss regulators. Margrethe Vestager was critical of the banks' behaviour UBS, which escaped the latest fines, said: ""This is a legacy matter where UBS was the first bank to disclose potential misconduct. We've made significant investments to further strengthen our control framework since then and are pleased this matter is resolved."" But the matter may not end there. Lambros Kilaniotis, a partner at City-based law firm RPC, said the Commission's announcement was ""an open invitation for parties who may have been impacted by these cartels to sue these banks"". ""If they haven't already, any party involved in forex trading, such as institutional investors, pension funds and large corporates, should now be reviewing what losses they have incurred,"" he added. ""Most of the traders participating in the chatrooms knew each other on a personal basis,"" said the Commission. ""For example, one chatroom was called Essex Express 'n the Jimmy because all the traders but 'James' lived in Essex and met on a train to London. ""Some of the traders created the chatrooms and then invited one another to join, based on their trading activities and personal affinities, creating closed circles of trust."" Other chatrooms used included Semi Grumpy Old Men, Two and a Half Men and Only Marge. Information that the traders exchanged related to: Outstanding customers' orders (names of clients, currencies and amounts involved) Prices applicable to specific transactions Open risk positions in different currencies Other details of current or planned trading. Their chats ""enabled them to make informed market decisions on whether to sell or buy the currencies they had in their portfolios and when"", the Commission said.

"Opinion polls for the European Parliament elections on 23 May put the Brexit Party in the lead. Each dot shows one poll result for one party. The trend lines are calculated as an average of the polls to date, with greater weight given to the most recent polls and to larger polls. Pollsters have been releasing their final figures ahead of voting on Thursday 23 May. If anything the Brexit Party have extended the lead that they've held consistently over the last two weeks, although there is quite a lot of variation between the different polling companies. Unless the polls are seriously wrong they can expect to win the most seats when votes are counted on Sunday 26 May. It's less easy to say who is in second place - largely because there is a huge range between estimates for Labour's share of the vote. YouGov has them on 13% whereas Panelbase has 25%. So it's impossible to say whether they or the Lib Dems are on course to be runners up. Most of the companies put the Conservatives in fourth, but not far ahead of the Greens. Change UK and UKIP are further behind. It's important to restate that these are GB polls and the situation is very different in Scotland where the SNP are certainly expected to win. In Wales Plaid Cymru are challenging Labour for second place. There will also be very significant variations between different regions of England. National polls cannot be a good guide to how results will go everywhere. New polls over the weekend again continue a familiar trend. The Brexit Party has a clear lead across the country as a whole. Most of the polling companies have Labour in second followed by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. But YouGov put Labour on a much lower share than the others - 15% in their two most recent polls - and have the Lib Dems ahead of them in second place. Regional figures The latest YouGov poll also provided a regional breakdown - this was possible because it had a large sample of more than 9,000 people. It's only a single poll and it's important to keep in mind the point about other pollsters being more positive about Labour. But the breakdown fits the pattern you would expect - the Brexit Party is strongest in regions that voted firmly for Leave in the 2016 referendum, but weaker in areas where Remain was stronger. So they lead in Wales and most of the regions of England - but not in Scotland, where the SNP are dominant, and not in London - where YouGov give a small lead to the Lib Dems. A new YouGov poll with a large sample of more than 7,000 people has the Brexit Party and Liberal Democrats making further advances at the expense of the Conservatives and Labour. For the first time the Lib Dems are ahead of Labour in second place - and the Conservatives have fallen just below the Greens in fifth. Of course this is just one poll but, as the chart suggests, it does fit with the direction of travel that's been clear over the last couple of weeks. Wales YouGov has also published a Welsh poll - the first since it was confirmed that the UK would take part in the Euro elections. Like in Britain as a whole, it puts the Brexit Party in a clear lead, with 33% of the vote. Labour and Plaid Cymru are battling it out for second place, on 18% and 16% respectively. And the Lib Dems, Greens and Conservatives trail further behind. Three new polls suggest that support for the various political parties has settled, for the time being, into a fairly clear pattern. Across Britain as a whole, the Brexit Party leads the pack with Labour in second and the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats battling it out for third place. In Scotland, there's no evidence to overturn previous polls which put the SNP in a dominant position. Northern Ireland There's also been a Lucid Talk poll this week for the election in Northern Ireland. That uses a different voting system from the rest of the UK - the Single Transferrable Vote, where voters get to rank candidates in preference order. Seats are awarded through a process of elimination and redistribution of votes. Three seats are available. At recent elections they've gone to the DUP, Sinn Fein and the UUP. But the poll suggests the race for the third seat is likely to be close this time. Sinn Fein lead the poll in terms of first preferences with the DUP clearly ahead of the rest in second place. But it's very close for third between the SDLP, UUP and Alliance Party. If the actual votes follow a similar pattern, the final outcome will depend upon how votes are redistributed after the weaker candidates are eliminated. More on a 'proxy referendum' It's not easy to interpret the results of the European elections as a proxy for another Brexit referendum - people might vote on other issues and it's hard to know what to do about Labour and the Conservative voters. Academics at The UK in a Changing Europe have suggested an interesting alternative approach. In areport,externalthey suggest that it would be useful to look at levels of turnout in different parts of the country. If turnout goes up most in areas that voted Remain in 2016, that could indicate that Remain voters would be more likely to turn up in any future referendum. Whereas if voting is stronger in Leave areas, it could suggest the opposite. New polls over the weekend suggest the Brexit Party has further strengthened its position. Opinium and YouGov now have them on 34% with a big lead over Labour in second place. However in a third poll, by ComRes, the picture looks much less clear - the Brexit Party are only narrowly ahead of Labour by 27% to 25%. It's not just the Brexit Party who are on the up. The Lib Dems have also made progress - in the past three polls they've been in third place, ahead of the Conservative Party. In fact, in YouGov's poll, the Tories are down in fifth place, below the Greens as well. Proxy referendum? One way that the results of the European elections will be analysed is as a sort of proxy vote for another referendum. It will be interesting to add together the votes for anti-Brexit parties - SNP, Plaid Cymru, Lib Dems, Greens and Change UK - and compare the result with the combined score of UKIP and the Brexit Party. By this measure, the polls suggest it's pretty close between these two groups, with the pro-Brexit group slightly ahead on average. However, it isn't necessarily a good guide as to how another referendum would go. For one thing, people's reasons for voting will not just be about Brexit. Another issue is that it doesn't account for Conservative and Labour voters. The two big parties might be near historic lows but they will still account for a decent proportion of voters. Will those people be equally split between Leavers and Remainers? It's possible to get a clue to this by looking at the detailed breakdown of the polling figures. This can be a risky business because the subsamples in polls aren't always representative so you can get misleading results. However, in this case the pattern is very consistent. People who say they will vote Conservative are evenly split between Remain and Leave. But people who say they'll vote Labour favour Remain by about 3:1. The polls that have been published up to now can fairly neatly be divided into two groups: before and after the Brexit Party's campaign launch on 12 April. Before then, Nigel Farage's new group and UKIP seemed to be splitting the pro-Brexit vote pretty evenly - allowing Labour to enjoy a clear lead overall. Afterwards, the Brexit Party has risen to the top of the pile, mostly at the expense of UKIP. There have only been two polls since with another party (Labour) in the lead. As with all polls, it's important to remember that they are subject to error. And that can be particularly true when there are new parties in the frame. Historic Conservative low? Prospects for the Conservatives look bleak, according to the polls so far. They've been bumping around in the low to-mid teens. That would be by a distance the lowest share of the vote ever for the party in a national election. Labour are faring better, although considerably below where they would want to be. A score in the mid-20s would mean little change since 2014 when they were runners-up to UKIP. Anti-Brexit parties The creation of Change UK - The Independent Group, adds to an already crowded field for pro-EU, anti-Brexit parties. They are fighting for votes with the Liberal Democrats, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru. In Scotland, the SNP are on course to dominate. But in other parts of the UK, the divisions could be costly. European elections in Britain use a form of proportional representation, but on a regional basis. Most of the regions have too few seats to guarantee a fully proportional outcome. It's quite easy for a party to get a decent number of votes in a region but fail to win a seat. In 2014, for example, 160,000 votes (10.7%) was not enough for the Liberal Democrats in the South West. If the final result this time is close to what the polls have been suggesting, the anti-Brexit parties could end up missing out in several regions. However, in the latest to be published, it perhaps looks as though in England the Lib Dems are emerging as the strongest of them - possibly receiving a boost after their very strong showing in the local elections.

"Marine Le Pen was one of 11 leaders from Europe's populist far right who joined Matteo Salvini for a rally in Milan on 18 May The populist far right are looking to this week's EU parliamentary elections to kick-start a pan-European nationalist alliance. For years, they have tried to form a cohesive group, and now they have a figurehead in Italy's most powerful politician - Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister  Matteo Salvini, previously the leader of a half-forgotten regional party. But the challenges are clear. Days before the vote, one of the very few far-right parties in power in Europe was forced out of government in Austria amid a secret video scandal. BBC correspondents report on the would-be alliance from around Europe. By James Reynolds, BBC News, Turin Matteo Salvini does not like to be interrupted. A few minutes into his campaign rally in this northern Italian town, a small group of hecklers caught his attention. He raised his finger. ""If you touch any of the good people in the crowd,"" Matteo Salvini shouted at the hecklers, ""I will get angry like a beast. OK? OK?"" Mr Salvini has travelled across Europe in an attempt to drum up support for a nationalist alliance ""Salvini is the future of Europe,"" one woman told me. Italy's League party leader aims to bring together Europe's disparate far right into a cohesive movement. The far-right, populist movements are united by their condemnation of EU bureaucracy, migration, and Islam. They aim to take enough seats in the EU parliamentary election to be able to disrupt the institution from within. Their election campaign culminated in Milan on 18 May, when far-right, populist politicians from 11 EU countries joined Mr Salvini at a rally. Anti-fascist campaigners in Milan held their own counter-protests, and called on the populists to leave. It would have been 12 countries, but Austrian Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache could not attend as he was caught up in the secret video scandal and had to resign. If they do succeed in winning more seats in the European Parliament, they may also end up revealing the divisions within their ad hoc alliance - particularly over economic policy. By Bethany Bell, BBC News, Vienna The Freedom Party is arguably Europe's most well-established far-right movement, but has become embroiled in a full-blown corruption scandal. With its anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim messages, the FPÃ has been a source of inspiration for many of Europe's populist parties, notably Germany's main opposition AfD, the Finns Party and the Danish People's Party. In a matter of days, it has gone from influential coalition partner to national disgrace, its leader caught in a video sting apparently promising public contracts in return for political and financial support to a woman posing as a Russian oligarch's niece. The scandal could hit the party at the polls. Marine Le Pen extols rise of patriotism Leader Heinz-Christian Strache has enjoyed cordial relations with Matteo Salvini and signed up to his European alliance, taking part before the scandal broke in a series of what appear to have been carefully choreographed meetings. Mr Strache resigned hours after the video emerged of him and a party colleague caught in a sting in the Spanish resort island of Ibiza But analysts believe they have competing nationalisms. They have clashed over Freedom Party proposals to give dual citizenship to the German-speaking minority in South Tyrol in northern Italy. In the same way, parties in the far-right alliance may agree on what they oppose in Europe, but they may find it harder to agree on a common course of action. Northern and southern parties have very different views on the EU's budget. Mr Salvini, Mr Strache and French far-right leader Marine Le Pen are interested in closer relations with Russia, but that goes down very badly with parties in Eastern Europe, notably Poland. Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? By Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Paris There's been a certain stiffness in the air around Marine Le Pen's new political courtship. Perhaps it's not surprising; company is not something her party is used to. It's not that France's populist leader is unenthusiastic about her Italian partner's rise to power. An early campaign poster for the European elections featured a large portrait of Ms Le Pen alongside Matteo Salvini: ""All over Europe, our ideas are coming to power,""  the caption said. Marine Le Pen's embrace of Matteo Salvini's European alliance has not come naturally And the growing strength of populists across Europe has led her National Rally (Rassemblement National in French) party to change its policy on EU membership. There's no more talk of ""Frexit"", or even a referendum on the subject; the party now talks of changing Europe ""from within"". There's no doubt Europe's grand, old, populist party lends weight to Mr Salvini's new alliance, but both the politics and the diplomacy of its role are tricky. ""Lega is the Italian Rassemblement National,"" one senior RN adviser told a French newspaper. ""Salvini created his party on our model. Even as a young man, he was asking Marine for selfies."" ""We have no ego contest,"" Marine Le Pen said recently.  But there's no doubt who is now leading Europe's nationalist parties - and it's not clear how well her party fits in. The RN is not popular among Europe's other populists. Its warmth towards Russia, its historic image of anti-Semitism, and alleged fraud in its handling of European parliament funds have all contributed to tensions. Hungarian PM Viktor Orban recently said he wanted nothing to do with Ms Le Pen. It shows the challenge of uniting Europe's populist parties, all of whom pride themselves on putting national interests first. And even if they get the seats they're hoping for, the new group won't amount to more than a quarter of the EU chamber; what Le Monde newspaper this week described as a ""blocking minority that will let them carry on undermining things"". By Nick Thorpe, BBC News, Budapest As the poster boy of the far right in Europe, any new nationalist alliance would look pale without Viktor Orban. Hungary's leader has invited both Matteo Salvini and Heinz-Christian Strache to Budapest in recent weeks, but he has been reticent about joining a new ""nationalist bloc"" after the EU elections. His ruling Fidesz party still belongs to the EU's biggest political grouping - the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) - even though the EPP suspended its membership because of its right-wing policies. Mr Orban met President Trump on Monday - his first visit to the White House His hope until now was that he could drag the EPP to the right, then weld it into a tight alliance with a new, Salvini-led grouping, without quite merging with them. But his relationship with the centre right is getting no better, and he identifies with the nationalist right so much more. A long-awaited recent audience with President Donald Trump in the White House has put further wind in Mr Orban's sails. His slogan in this election is: Support Viktor Orban's Programme, Let's Stop Immigration. It is a populist, popular, but peculiar message in a country where there are very few immigrants, in an EU in which more than 600,000 Hungarians are regarded as immigrants themselves.

The couple are thought to be Scotland's largest landowners. Their children Alfred, five, Agnes, 12 and Alma, 15, were among more than 250 people killed in the bombing attacks on churches and hotels in April. The couple said the messages they had received had touched their hearts. Their children died when Islamist extremists targeted the hotel they were staying in, the Shangri La in Colombo, during the attacks on Easter Sunday. Churches and other hotels were also targeted.

"Theresa May has promised to set a timetable for the election of her successor after the next Brexit vote in the first week of June. The agreement follows a meeting between the prime minister and senior Tory MPs who are demanding a date for her departure from Downing Street. If she loses the vote on her Brexit plan, already rejected three times, sources told the BBC she would resign. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has said he will run for leader once Mrs May goes. The prime minister survived a confidence vote by Conservative MPs at the end of last year and party rules mean she cannot formally be challenged again until December. Johnson confirms bid for Tory leadership MPs 'have duty to support Brexit bill' What happens next? But Mrs May has come under increasing pressure to leave Downing Street this summer, amid the Brexit impasse and poor results for the Conservatives in the recent local elections in England. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said senior sources had told her it was ""inconceivable"" the prime minister could remain in office if MPs rejected her Brexit plans for a fourth time. ""Discussing an election timetable"" doesn't sound that exciting. But the paragraph tucked into the short formal letter from Sir Graham Brady to Tory MPs all but marks the end of Theresa May's premiership and the beginning of the official hunt for the next leader of the country. After the lines in the short note restate the prime minister's determination to get Brexit done, it confirms in black and white that after the next big vote, in the first week of June, the prime minister will make plans with the party for choosing a successor. Right now, the expectation is that vote will be lost (although it is not impossible, of course, that Number 10 could turn it round). And the conversation that's been arranged won't just be a gentle chat about what to do next. Senior sources have told me that means, even though the letter doesn't spell it out, that if her Brexit plan is defeated again, Mrs May will announce she is going. Read more from Laura The chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, Sir Graham Brady, said he had reached an agreement over the prime minister's future during ""very frank"" talks in Parliament. He said the committee's executive and Mrs May would meet again to discuss her future following the first debate and vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning 3 June. Sir Graham said there was now ""greater clarity"" about the situation. Johnson confirms bid for Tory leadership MPs 'have duty to support Brexit bill' What happens next? Asked if that meant the prime minister would quit immediately if MPs rejected her Brexit plans once more, he said that scenario went ""beyond"" what had been agreed. MPs have rejected the prime minister's Brexit agreement with the EU three times. But she will have another go at gaining their support in the week beginning 3 June, when the Commons votes for the first time on the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation needed to implement her deal with the EU. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady: PM will announce departure timetable in early June Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has joined the growing list of Conservatives who say they will stand for leader when Mrs May announces her departure. He told a business conference in Manchester: ""Of course I am going to go for it."" Conservative MP Grant Shapps welcomed the announcement that a timetable would be set out for Mrs May's departure, suggesting it would inject greater ambition and dynamism into the Brexit process. The former party chairman told BBC News the Brexit bill had no chance of passing in its current state but holding another vote would allow Mrs May to demonstrate she had ""tried everything"". ""It is right to bring this whole saga to a conclusion,"" he said. This video can not be played The Conservatives jostling to be the next prime minister But fellow Tory Phillip Lee, who backs another Brexit referendum, said replacing the prime minister would not ""solve the crisis"" the UK found itself in or build a parliamentary majority for the terms of the UK's departure. ""Forcing the PM's resignation and spending this summer locked in a leadership election where candidates trade ever more fantastic visions of unicorn Brexitsâ¦is neither in the interests of the Conservative Party nor of the United Kingdom,"" he said. Last month,the 1922 Committee executive narrowly decided against changing the party's leadership rulesto allow an early challenge to Mrs May. Local Tory associations have confirmedthey will hold a vote of confidencein her leadership on 15 June, although its result will not be binding. Much of the anger in the Conservative parliamentary party is focusing on the prime minister's talks with Labour, aimed at reaching a cross-party compromise to get her deal through the Commons. BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said he understood the talks will ""soon be drawing to a close"" adding that Tory whips had ""given up on this phase of the negotiations and are looking to pack the legislation with goodies for Brexiteers"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would not support the Withdrawal Agreement Bill unless it guaranteed membership of a customs union with the EU, and protected workers' rights, consumer rights and environmental rights. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said his party would ""happily support"" the legislation, provided it was subject to a ""confirmatory public vote"".

"Donald Trump signed the order on Wednesday President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to protect US computer networks from ""foreign adversaries"". He signed an executive order which effectively bars US companies from using foreign telecoms believed to pose national security risks. The order does not name any company, but is believed to target Huawei. The Chinese tech giant said restricting its business in the US would only hurt American consumers and companies. This video can not be played We explain the controversy around Huawei's 5G tech â using castles Several countries, led by the US, have raised concerns in recent months that Huawei products could be used by China for surveillance, allegations the company has vehemently denied. The US has been pressuring allies to shun Huawei in their next generation 5G mobile networks. What is President Trump's strategy? Huawei: The world's most controversial company? The next US-China battleground In a separate development, the US commerce department added Huawei to its ""entity list"", a move that bans the company from acquiring technology from US firms without government approval. The moves are likely to worsen tensions between the US and China, which had already escalated this week with tariff hikes in a trade war. Huawei has been at the epicentre of the US-China power struggle that has dominated global politics over the past year. According to a White House statement, Mr Trump's order aims to ""protect America from foreign adversaries who are actively and increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology infrastructure and services"". It gives the secretary of commerce the power to ""prohibit transactions posing an unacceptable risk to the national security"", the statement adds. Huawei is the world's largest maker of telecoms equipment The move was instantly welcomed by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, who called it ""a significant step toward securing America's networks"". The US had already restricted federal agencies from using Huawei products and has encouraged allies to shun them, while Australia and New Zealand have both blocked the use of Huawei gear in 5G networks. In April 2018 another Chinese tech company, ZTE, was barred from buying US parts after it was placed on the same ""entity list"".It resumed business after reaching a deal with the US in July. Huawei has said its work does not pose any threats and that it is independent from the Chinese government. ""Restricting Huawei from doing business in the US will not make the US more secure or stronger,"" the company said in a statement. The US cannot crush us, says Huawei boss ""Instead, this will only serve to limit the US to inferior yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the US lagging behind in 5G deployment, and eventually harming the interests of US companies and consumers."" The company also said ""unreasonable restrictions"" on Huawei raised ""other serious legal issues"". During a meeting in London on Tuesday, Huaweichairman Liang Hua said it was ""willing to sign no-spy agreements with governments""as concerns over the security of its products used in mobile networks continued to grow. By declaring a national emergency President Trump can effectively bypass other branches of government and gains access to a raft of special powers. The Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan public policy institute, has compileda list of more than 120 legal powers the president can use,externalin such an event - they range from taking over farmland to calling up military reservists or seizing property with few or no restrictions. President Trump has now declared five national emergencies,including most recently over the southern US border. A rolling list of national emergencies compiled by the centre showsthere are now 33 active national emergencies in the US,external. The oldest emergency still in place was signed by President Jimmy Carter in November 1979 as a response to the Iran hostage crisis. Others signed by Presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama also remain in effect. President Trump does not name or single out Huawei in his executive order but the intent is clear: keep the company out of the US. What is more - this comes against the backdrop of an escalating trade war - and will no doubt inflame tensions between the two countries. Huawei consistently says that if the US bans Huawei from its networks, they are the ones to lose out, not Huawei. That is true. Even without the US market, Huawei is likely to control 40-60% of the networks around the world, industry analysts say. But what may hurt Huawei more is the US decision to put them on the ""entity list"" - effectively banning American suppliers from selling to the firm. Huawei may not need the US market, but it certainly needs the key components that it gets from the US. President Trump has complained about China's trading practices since before taking office in 2017. The USmore than doubled tariffs on $200bn (Â£154.9bn) of Chinese goodson Friday andChina retaliatedwith its own tariff hikes on US products. This escalated the situation which only recently seemed to be nearing a conclusion.

"The agency, Splash, apologised to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for ""distress"" caused by the images The Duke of Sussex has accepted damages and an apology from a news agency which used a helicopter to take photographs of his home in the Cotswolds. Prince Harry's lawyers told a High Court hearing the pictures taken by Splash News and Picture Agency included one of the inside of a bedroom at the privately-rented Oxfordshire property. The court heard the pictures had ""seriously undermined"" Harry's safety. Splash said it had made an ""error of judgement"" which would not be repeated. In a statement, it added: ""We apologise to the Duke and Duchess (of Sussex) for the distress we have caused."" Buckingham Palace said the duke ""acknowledges and welcomes the formal apology"" from Splash. The court heard the photos, which were ""published by the Times newspaper and elsewhere online"", were of living and dining areas, and included a shot taken ""directly into the bedroom"". The duke's lawyers told Mr Justice Warby that Harry and his wife Meghan had chosen to make the Oxfordshire property their home because of its ""high level of privacy"". But Gerrard Tyrrell, who read a statement in court on the duke's behalf, said the couple had subsequently felt unable to live there. The duke and duchess now live at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor When the photos were published in mid-January, the couple's official residence was Kensington Palace. But a spokeswoman for the Sussexes said they had spent a lot of time at their country retreat in the Cotswolds, which had been privately rented by Harry. Privacy, publicity and the royal baby The duke and duchessmoved from Kensington Palace to Frogmore Cottage, Windsor, in April- shortly before Meghan gave birth to their son Archie. Mr Tyrrell said Splash had agreed to pay a ""substantial"" sum of damages and legal costs to settle the privacy and data claims faced by the agency. He added Splash would ""not repeat its conduct by using any aerial means to take photographs or film footage of the duke's private home, which would infringe privacy or data rights or otherwise be unlawful activity"". Splash News and Picture Agency sells news, photos and videos across the world, including paparazzi images of celebrities. It boasts of taking more than 150,000 photos a day across the globe. In its code of conduct, Splash says it is ""committed to the fair and ethical treatment of our subjects, our contributors and our customers"". But the case brought by Prince Harry is not the first time Splash has been accused of taking intrusive photos. In 2014, Corbis Images UK Limited - which was trading under Splash's name - made photos of Adele's two-year-old son available for publishing in the English press. The singer's lawyersaccepted a five-figure sum to settle the case.

"Burnley midfielder Aaron Lennon has spoken publicly about mental health problems A record number of footballers are seeking mental health support, according to the Professional Footballers' Association. PFA director of player welfare Michael Bennett expects the organisation to help ""double or treble"" the number of players in 2019 than it did in 2018. Since January, 355 professionals have accessed therapy - the highest number ever recorded by the end of a season. The figure for the whole of 2018 was 438, having risen from 160 in 2016. Bennett says the increase is ""a good thing"" - as it shows increased trust in the PFA - rather than a growing problem. He expects to see a spike in the number of players seeking help in the coming weeks as clubs decide who will not be retained for next season. ""When players go back to pre-season, that's when those who haven't got contracts realise they're struggling mentally, emotionally and financially,"" Bennett, who played professionally for several clubs, including Charlton Athletic and Brighton & Hove Albion, told The Next Episode podcast. So what's it like to get released? And what support is out there when you do? Listen to The Next Episode on BBC Sounds Olu Maintain was released by a Premier League side at 18. He'd been with the club since he was seven. ""I went crazy, because I thought it was a done thing,"" he says. ""I was training with the first team. I wasn't even playing with a youth team. ""I'd spent my whole life at one place. How the hell do you expect me to mentally prepare?"" Maintain was told after a training session that he was not going to be kept on. ""It was a blur. I just remember walking out, I didn't even shower, just walked out,"" he says. ""I got my clothes on, got in my car and drove off. Then the head of the academy rang me because I think he thought I was going to kill myself or do something crazy. ""I spent my whole life there. They'd watched me grow up. I just couldn't accept it."" Maintain says he did get support from the club's coaches, but still found it tough. ""Mentally I wasn't in the space to hear anything from anyone,"" he says. ""That was the root of why my life spiralled out of control. A lot of my depression, a lot of mental health and all that stuff was me not dealing with rejection then."" Although Maintain went on to sign for Norwich and Falkirk, he feels the impact of that early rejection stayed with him. ""You're rubbish - that's how I took it. Point blank, you're not good enough for anything. Relationships, friendships, jobs,"" he adds. ""I'll start something now and never finish it. I can never see stuff through because I'm thinking it's just too good to be true. ""I'm worried about what people think. Worried about how people perceive me."" Since leaving the professional game, Maintain has begun writing a comedy series. He still plays semi-professional football for Woking - who have just been promoted to the National League - but says the game still has a long way to go in tackling the mental health problems of some of its players. ""No-one wants to talk about emotions, and if you do you're soft,"" he says. Andy Ali has been at the academies of four different clubs. ""I never actually had a contract,"" says the 21-year-old. ""I was one of those players who was in for maybe two or three months."" At 16, Ali was at the academy of a Championship club and thought he had finally done enough to earn a pro contract. ""I thought this was finally the one that was going to pay off, so when they eventually told me [he was being released], I honestly I couldn't see a way forward,"" he says. ""I was thinking, 'how am I going to tell people what's happened?' ""No-one's your friend. One or two people might take a liking to you, but the system isn't there for you."" About 12,000 boys are in academies at any one time, and mental health provisions are being stepped up. Any 16-year-old at a club has to carry on with some kind of education, and the PFA visits all 92 English league clubs to give workshops on mental health and emotional well-being. The English Football League is halfway through a two-year partnership with mental health charity Mind, and on Wednesday the Football Association launched a new campaign using football to ""generate the biggest ever conversation around mental health"". Ali is all too aware of the impact rejection can have on young players' lives. ""I've seen friends who were probably the best at football in my area go to jail,"" he says. ""I know one guy who made it as a pro at 18 and now he's in jail because he got released. He just couldn't accept that."" Maz Bettache manages Rising Ballers, a Sunday league team in west London including several players released by professional clubs. ""I was lucky enough to be part of a Premier League club from the age of nine up to 18 but unfortunately I didn't get a professional contract,"" he says. ""It didn't work out, but I bounced back and it's only made me a better person on and off the pitch."" The players at Rising Ballers say it feels a lot different to the professional academies they were at, in terms of the support network. ""When players get released, their life changes very, very quickly and it's hard to take,"" Bettache says. ""I'm just trying to create an environment for players to enjoy their football, showcase their talent and put it out there for the whole world to see."" Rising Ballers film all their games and upload them to YouTube. Their social media following is growing, and more and more scouts from professional clubs are watching the team, who are on a 21-game unbeaten run. ""That time when players have been told that they're not getting a professional contract is very crucial,"" says Bettache. ""It's about getting them opportunities with other clubs, opportunities away from football, different career paths and helping them, really helping them build up as a person again.""

"Donald Trump's book The Art of the Deal could give you some insight into how he is negotiating with China amid the current trade war. One of his business philosophies is called negative thinking - anticipating the worst outcome, and preparing for it. ""I always go into the deal anticipating the worst,"" he writes. ""If you plan for the worst - if you can live with the worst - the good will always take care of itself."" But is the US really prepared for the absolute worst China could do? In a clip from China Central Television, that's now gone viral on Chinese social media, anti-US sentiment appears to be at a peak. ""China is not willing, but not afraid, to fight"", says the presenter. ""After 5,000 years of winds and storms - what kind of hardship has the great Chinese nation not weathered?"" Looking even further back in China's history, perhaps Beijing is taking a page out of China's ancient strategic manual The Art of War. As author Sun Tzu advises: ""If your opponent is of choleric temperament, seek to irritate him"". Here's what could China do to ""irritate"" President Trump's arguably ""choleric temperament"" in this trade war. US-China trade war in 300 words The next US-China battleground China hits back in trade war with US Who loses out in the US-China trade war? China is thebiggest foreign holder of US government bonds,external, known as Treasuries, but in Marchstepped up its sale of these bonds,externalto the quickest pace in two and a half years - according to data from the US Treasury department. And Beijing could keep doing this - although it would come at a cost. Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the Global Times which is published by the Communist Party's official mouthpiece the People's Daily,has tweeted,external: ""China may stop purchasing US agricultural products and energy, reduce Boeing orders and restrict US service trade with China. Many Chinese scholars are discussing the possibility of dumping US Treasuries and how to do it specifically."" But analysts say doing that would actually hurt China more. In simple terms, if Beijing sold US Treasuries then it would drive down the US dollar - and that could potentially destabilise the US economy. But that wouldn't be good for China in the long term. It needs a stable global economy as its economy weakens - so hurting the US in this way would, in effect, hurt China too. Selling US Treasuries would also devalue China's holdings - effectively becoming an own goal. China's currency is controlled, which means it's not freely traded. The central bank guides where the midpoint of the currency should be and then it trades within a narrow band around that midpoint. It has already lowered it in recent days, which analysts say is a signal to the market that China is willing to use the currency as a tool to offset the impact of US tariffs. The weaker the Chinese currency, the less expensive its goods are in the US. In theory, this means more people will buy them, and Chinese companies won't suffer as much. But the downside is that China's imports will become more expensive too - which will affect goods such as oil, and other raw materials that it needs to keep its economy chugging along. It's a delicate balance - and a tough position to be in. This is one area where China could really tighten the screws on the US. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been a key factor driving China's economic growth - and it's also reaped dividends for the foreign companies investing in China, despite the challenging business environment. However, Beijing could decide to make the environment even tougher. In 2018, China was thesecond largest recipient of FDI in the world,externaland a large chunk of that money came from the US, even as the trade war between the two intensified. However, according to reports, China's National Development and Reform Council - the country's central planning agencyhas taken over the responsibility of deciding who will be allowed to invest in the country,externalbased on national security criteria. That's an important move, because now the council is the equivalent in some respects of the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, (CFIUS)  - the entity tasked with evaluating which companies are security risks and which aren't. Beijing will seethe latest US movesto keep Huawei out of its markets as discriminatory - and could make it harder for American companies to get licences to operate in China, target the buying of American products as being anti-patriotic, and hold up goods at ports and customs. Expect more American firms to see renewed scrutiny whilst investing in China. This video can not be played Will a trade deal end US-China rivalry? China has consistently said it doesn't want to fight - it says it's being forced into a corner by the US. In fact even if you drill down intothe $60bn-worth of US goods that Beijing raised tariffs on this weekin retaliation, the scale of the tariff increase is less than what's being reported, according to Vinesh Motwani of Silk Road Research. In December China suspended retaliatory tariffs on vehicles and auto parts, and that suspension has remained in place. Analysts say this signals that Beijing wants to show some good faith in the lead up to the meeting between the two leaders at the G20 in Japan in June. Still, Sun Tzu's Art of War prescribes: ""Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt."" Perhaps - if those talks in June don't go well - China is leaving room for itself to apply further pressure in the future.

"No paramedics were sent to help Sebastien Belanger where he lay dying Medics were not told that three victims of the London Bridge attack needed urgent attention, an inquest has heard. Andrew Beasley co-ordinated the medical response to the attack on 3 June 2017. He told the inquest he did not know Sebastien Belanger, James McMullan and Alexandre Pigeard lay mortally wounded in a courtyard near Borough Market. Earlier, a police officer explained how she had repeatedly asked for paramedics to be sent to help one victim -  Mr Belanger - but none came. The inquest has heard that the scene of the attack was deemed a ""hot zone"" under London Ambulance Service (LAS) protocol, which prevents paramedics from entering for their own safety. Mr Beasley said he had parked a short distance away as the safety of his crew on the scene was ""paramount"". After hearing gunfire in Borough Market, he said he wondered 'am I going to be shot next?'. ""For our own safety we couldn't go forward,"" he told the Old Bailey, which is hearing the inquests into the deaths of the eight people killed in the attack at London Bridge and Borough Market. Mr Belanger, Mr McMullan and Mr Pigeard were eventually brought to ambulances at a safe meeting point, but were already dead. Mr Belanger, a 36-year-old chef, originally from Angers, western France, had been drinking at the Boro Bistro when he was stabbed in the stomach. He was one of eight people killed in the attack. The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden PC Mia Kerr said she had been a police officer for about a year at the time of the attacks. She said she came across members of the public giving first aid to Mr Belanger at 22:12 BST. He had collapsed in Green Dragon Court, below where the attackers' van had crashed into railings on London Bridge. After deciding that the group ""looked like they knew what they were doing"", PC Kerr drew her baton in case the attackers returned to the area. ""I was the only officer down there for a little while which felt like forever,"" she said. ""I'd only had about a year of service so it was a lot of pressure."" PC Kerr was recognised for her bravery during the London Bridge attack Another police officer and a police medic arrived over the next few minutes, the court heard. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened Victim came 'nose to nose' with attacker The court heard that no members of the LAS came to the scene to help Mr Belanger, despite PC Kerr calling the Metropolitan Police control room to request paramedics. Two members of the public and the officers spent more than half an hour performing CPR on Mr Belanger before he was eventually moved up steps to a waiting ambulance at about 22:45 BST, the inquest heard. BBC correspondent Richard Lister, at the inquest PC Kerr was composed as she told the inquest about how she, another officer and two members of the public fought to revive Sebastien Belanger. She talked of initially being the only police officer there. ""Time just stood still. I just wanted some help,"" she said. The Belanger family listened intently to their interpreter as PC Kerr described standing guard while Lisa Deacon and Craig Smith did what they could for Mr Belanger. None of them knew whether the attackers would come back and PC Kerr, who only had a baton for protection said: ""I was very aware that where I was standing, I was trying to cover three potential entrances and exits."" Ambulance service incident response officer Nicholas Lesslar told the court he was unaware there were seriously injured casualties in the courtyard. Questioning PC Kerr on behalf of the victim's family, Gareth Patterson QC said: ""If you had been told there were LAS [London Ambulance Service] resources available before then, up on the High Street, presumably you would have discussed getting Sebastien up to those ambulances as quickly as possible?"" PC Kerr said: ""We would have discussed it, yes."" Mr Belanger's mother told the inquest on its opening day thatshe was ""so proud"" of him. The Old Bailey also heard from a reveller who described how he jumped over a flowerbed and almost trampled on 32-year-old entrepreneur James McMullan. Andrius Vorobjovas had been celebrating a friend's birthday at the Boro Bistro on the night of the attack. When a man emerged wielding a bloody knife, people ran for their lives. ""You could hear the tables moving, glasses smashing, people running,"" he told the inquest. Mr Vorobjovas headed towards some flowerbeds, where he nearly stepped on Mr McMullan, who had been stabbed after coming to the aid of au pair Sara Zelenak. Mr Vorobjovas said: ""I nearly stepped on a person on his belly. I was very shocked and amazed to see someone there because I could not figure out how they got there."" He added that he hid in the dark passage for some seconds before he ventured out and ""decided to make a run for it"". Mr Vorobjovas said he later directed armed officers back to the courtyard of the Boro Bistro. The other five people killed in the attack were: Xavier Thomas, 45; Chrissy Archibald, 30; Ignacio Echeverria, 39: Sara Zelenak, 21; and Kirsty Boden, 28. The inquests into their deaths continues.

"This video can not be played Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou as politically motivated The founder of Huawei has said there is ""no way the US can crush"" the company, in an exclusive interview with the BBC. Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer, as politically motivated. The US is pursuing criminal charges against Huawei and Ms Meng, including money laundering, bank fraud and stealing trade secrets. Huawei denies any wrongdoing. Mr Ren spoke to the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in his first international broadcast interview since Ms Meng was arrested - and dismissed the pressure from the US. ""There's no way the US can crush us,"" he said. ""The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit."" However, he acknowledged that the potential loss of custom could have a significant impact. Ren Zhengfei: Reclusive but confident Should we worry about Huawei? Who is Ren Zhengfei? Why Huawei matters in five charts What is 5G? Who is Meng Wanzhou? Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned the country's allies against using Huawei technology, saying it would make it more difficult for Washington to ""partner alongside them"". Australia, New Zealand, and the US have already banned or blocked Huawei from supplying equipment for their future 5G mobile broadband networks, while Canada is reviewing whether the company's products present a serious security threat. Mr Ren warned that ""the world cannot leave us because we are more advanced"". ""If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North goes dark, there is still the South. America doesn't represent the world. America only represents a portion of the world."" The UK'sNational Cyber Security Centre has decidedthat any risk posed by using Huawei technology in UK telecoms projects can be managed. Many of the UK's mobile companies, including Vodafone, EE and Three, are working with Huawei to develop their 5G networks. They are awaiting a government review, due in March or April, that will decide whether they can use Huawei technology. Commenting on the possibility of a UK ban, Mr Ren said Huawei ""won't withdraw our investment because of this. We will continue to invest in the UK. ""We still trust in the UK, and we hope that the UK will trust us even more. ""We will invest even more in the UK. Because if the US doesn't trust us, then we will shift our investment from the US to the UK on an even bigger scale."" Huawei has denied that it poses any risk to the UK or any other country Mr Ren's daughter Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, was arrested on 1 December in Vancouver at the request of the US, and is expected to be the subject of a formal extradition request. In total,23 charges are levelled against Huawei and Ms Weng. The charges are split across two indictments by the US Department of Justice. The first covers claims Huawei hid business links to Iran - which is subject to US trade sanctions. The second includes the charge of attempted theft of trade secrets. Mr Ren was clear in his opposition to the US accusations. ""Firstly, I object to what the US has done. This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable. ""The US likes to sanction others, whenever there's an issue, they'll use such combative methods. ""We object to this. But now that we've gone down this path, we'll let the courts settle it."" Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver last December Huawei, which is China's largest private company, has been under scrutiny for its links to the Chinese government - with the US and others expressing concern its technology could be used by China's security services to spy. Under Chinese law, firms are compelled to ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"". But Mr Ren said that allowing spying was a risk he wouldn't take. ""The Chinese government has already clearly said that it won't install any backdoors. And we won't install backdoors either. ""We're not going to risk the disgust of our country and of our customers all over the world, because of something like this. ""Our company will never undertake any spying activities. If we have any such actions, then I'll shut the company down."" Analysis - Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent - Shenzhen For a man known as reclusive and secretive, Ren Zhengfei seemed confident in the conviction that the business he's built for the last 30 years can withstand the scrutiny from Western governments. Mr Ren is right: the US makes up only a fraction of his overall business. But where I saw his mood change was when I asked him about his links to the Chinese military and the government. While he answered all of my questions, he refused to be drawn into a conversation on this, only to say that these were not facts, simply allegations - and insisted that political connections are not what has led Huawei to be successful today. When I put to him the reports that his former chairwoman, Sun Yafang, had once worked with China's Ministry of State Security, he told me that her profile was up on the company's corporate website and that he didn't think it was ""OK to suspect or guess where this person used to be"". He also confirmed that there is a Communist Party committee in Huawei, but he said this is what all companies - foreign or domestic - operating in China must have in order to abide by the law.

"Caspar Capel's offending was linked with alcohol which gradually became a coping mechanism The number of people dying while on probation in England and Wales has risen by almost a third in three years, analysis of official figures shows. Campaign groups said there had been ""institutional indifference"" towards offenders released from custody. A social worker said her job had become ""a treadmill of bureaucracy"". The Ministry of Justice said a ""great deal of caution was needed when trying to draw conclusions"" from its figures. The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysedMinistry of Justice data,externalfrom 2015-16 to 2017-18. It found: Last year 966 deaths of offenders were recorded, compared to 752 in 2015-16 About one in three of those deaths were self-inflicted In 2014-15, there were 558 deaths, but that was before 40,000 extra offenders were brought under supervisionfollowing government reforms Caspar Capel was a ""sweet but shy and anxious child"", his mother said Caspar Capelwas 43 when he took his own life while a resident at an Approved Premises, formerly known as bail hostels. He had borderline personality disorder and was troubled with depression and alcoholism for most of his adult life, contributing to many suicide attempts. Weeks before his death, Mr Capel had spent several months on remand waiting for sentencing after exposing himself to a train conductor while drunk. His mother Sue, said he had ""no opportunities"" for rehabilitation whilst on remand and kept a journal detailing how he wanted to kill himself. She said: ""I'd like to see offenders treated as whole people with a combination of problems which have led to the offending, and for the offence to be seen in the context of that person's history and mental health problems. ""Caspar wasn't offending because he wanted to gain anything from it, he wasn't aware he was offending, I'm sure. But he was very sad and angry - not caused by the drink, but exacerbated by it."" A review by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman concluded there was nothing staff could have done to prevent Mr Capel's death, but acknowledged his complex history of mental health problems and alcohol misuse. The arrangements for managing offenders were overhauled in 2014, with the probation service split in two. A new state body, the National Probation Service (NPS), which has eight divisions, was set up to supervise high-risk offenders, with 21 privately-run Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) supervising low and medium-risk offenders. In March, the chief inspector of probation saidthe new system was ""irredeemably flawed"". Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said homelessness, cuts to the voluntary sector and the spread of drugs such as Spice may have contributed to the rise in deaths. She added: ""Whereas before we had a successful publicly-run probation service with qualified and trained staff who saw their mission as befriending and turning lives around, we now have a fragmented service with a tick-box culture where some people have not even met face-to-face."" One offender manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ""When you lose a service user it has a massive emotional impact on you. ""Officers, when they know someone is quite vulnerable, will go above and beyond to try and mitigate some of that risk, but then there's frustration felt when services are in a similar boat to us and can't commit the time some of these service users need."" In Scotland, the work of the probation service is devolved to local authorities' social work departments, which are not required to record a cause of death for offenders under their care. Figures for 27 out of 32 councils that responded to a BBC Freedom of Information request, show there were 556 recorded deaths across Scottish councils since 2014-15. A Scottish Government spokesman said: ""The death of any individual, no matter what the circumstances, while on release under supervision or licence, is regrettable, and our sympathies go to their family and friends."" Similar records from the Probation Board for Northern Ireland began in November 2016 and show a rise in deaths from 14 to 21 since then. The Ministry of Justice said it was investing Â£22m to support offenders upon release. A spokesman said: ""Our probation reforms were a positive change for public safety, extending supervision and support to approximately 40,000 extra offenders each year - nearly 20% more than in 2014. ""This significant increase in volume, along with the rising age of offenders and improved recording practices, means a great deal of caution is needed when trying to draw conclusions from this data."" A programme to improve access to health services for vulnerable offenders with mental health, alcohol and substance abuse issues has also been launched. The MoJ has invested Â£22 million so offenders under supervision have equal access to services Dr Jake Phillips, senior criminology lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, said national records of deaths under probation had improved since he first began researching the subject nearly a decade ago. He said: ""There's a fairly strong argument for saying we know a lot about why people kill themselves in prison, for example, because there's been learning taking place for the last 20 years or so, from a range of angles. Under probation supervision, we just don't know that."" Rebecca Roberts, head of policy at Inquest, said: ""There's been complete institutional indifference towards the lives and deaths of people following release from custody and a total lack of visibility and investigation. ""Deaths have been rising year after year and we need more scrutiny on why this is, and what can be done to prevent these deaths in future.""

"Helen Kennett said she spoke to a knifeman with ""evil"" in his eyes after he stabbed a waiter An off-duty nurse asked one of the London Bridge attackers what was wrong with him before he stabbed her in the neck, an inquest has heard. Helen Kennett told the Old Bailey she was trying to help Alexandre Pigeard, who was fatally wounded, when she was confronted by his ""evil-eyed"" attacker. When she spoke to him, he replied, ""no, what's wrong with you?"" before wounding her too. Eight people were killed in the attacks on the night of 3 June 2017. ""I was convinced I was going to die but I didn't want to die there,"" Ms Kennett told the court. ""I wanted to die round the corner with my family."" Ms Kennett had been drinking prosecco to celebrate her birthday with her mother and sister in the courtyard of Boro Bistro, at the southern end of London Bridge. Minutes after she saw the attackers' van plough into railings above where they were sitting, she noticed a waiter, Mr Pigeard, was bleeding. She told the court she then saw the man holding a knife behind Mr Pigeard, describing him as having an ""empty"", ""soulless"" and ""evil"" look in his eyes. ""Before I could process what I was seeing was happening... he stabbed me in the neck to the left side,"" she said. Alexandre Pigeard had been working as a waiter Although she escaped with her family, she did not get to an ambulance for two hours, the inquest heard. Mr Pigeard, 26, died of his injuries. Eight people, including Mr Pigeard, who were killed by three men who drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people in and around Borough Market. The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Another witness told the court he believed the man who killed Mr Pigeard was Rachid Redouane. Geoffrey Huet said he locked eyes with the attacker as he dealt what looked like the fatal blow to Mr Pigeard. ""He had this craziness in his eyes, this anger. He was furious,"" Mr Huet added. The witness ran away and tried to get help, the court heard.

Another witness told the court she too saw Mr Pigeard being wounded as she celebrated a friend's birthday. Andzelika Abokaityte said in a statement read to the court that she watched as the ""evil and smiling"" attacker grabbed hold of Mr Pigeard before stabbing him from behind. ""As he was stabbed, the attacker was looking around as if to find the next person to stab."" ""I remember thinking: 'I'm going to die'"", the court heard. The inquests continue.

"This video can not be played Five key moments from Bob Hawke's life Former Australian prime minister and Labor Party leader Bob Hawke, who dominated the country's politics in the 1980s, has died at the age of 89. The charismatic politician, renowned for his love of beer and cricket, served from 1983 to 1991 and is credited with modernising the economy. He was the centre-left Labor Party's longest-serving PM, who achieved the highest approval ratings of any leader. He died ""peacefully at home"", his wife said in a statement.

A woman whose uncle took his own life after being sent home by health workers despite three suicide attempts in four days has criticised an inquiry into the services provided, the Scottish Labour leader said. Richard Leonard quoted Gillian Murray at FMQs as saying: ""Nothing seems to have happened. We're not kept involved. It's definitely not been transparent."" The Scottish government commissioned an independent inquiry into mental health services in NHS Tayside after concerns were raised by Ms Murray after the death of her uncle David Ramsay. Nicola Sturgeon stressed the inquiry was independent from government and that its report was expected imminently. David Ramsay committed suicide in 2016 Allow Twitter content?

The Scottish government motion is agreed to The Tory amendment from the food and drink bill is not agreed to with 29 MSPs backing it and 82 against. The Labour amendment also falls with 14 MSPs for and 97 against and it is joined by the Green amendment in the rejected pile, as it garnered the support of 20 MSPs but was opposed by 35, with 56 abstentions. The Scottish government's motion, unamended, is agreed to with 76 MSPs backing, 29 against and six abstentions. Edward Mountain cites the vision in the Scottish Conservative's New Approach to Scottish Farming and contrasts that with what he sees as the lack of vision of the Scottish government. Mr Mountain asks where the Good Food Nation Bill and Agriculture Bill are and insists the cabinet secretary must ""stop dithering and start delivering"". The Tory MSP agrees with Fergus Ewing that it is the farmers that make the countryside worth visiting and he believes it's a pity so much of people's speeches were not directed to them. Rural Affairs Secretary Fergus Ewing says there have been some very good contributions to this debate and some other ones. Mr Ewing tells the chamber there is ""something really seedy"" about using no-deal as a tool given Michael Gove is against it. On freedom of movement he says: ""I entirely agree with Mr Ruskell, I don't actually think I've uttered that phrase before"". The minister, impassioned, adds: ""The Scottish Tories have discovered political permafrost."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Closing for the Greens, Mark Ruskell says the Green New Deal is all about transformation in the food and farming sectors. It would require an active government driving innovation forward in tandem with the private sector, he states. Mr Ruskell goes on the highlight that 40% of people in the food service sector are immigrants and he criticises the ""hostile immigration policy"". Labour MSP Rhoda Grant says everyone has agreed a no-deal Brexit should be avoided at all costs. She also suggests the entire parliament seems to support a Good Food Nation Bill, insisting the sooner it is brought forward the sooner parties can get round the table for discussions. We must also ensure fair trade does not get lost in Brexit negotiations and we do not forget to protect vulnerable workforces, Ms Grant says. Trees are a powerful tool to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere The Scottish government will legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045 after receiving fresh advice from an expert panel. The Committee on Climate Change,external(CCC) urged that Scotland set the targetfive years ahead of the UK as a whole. The CCC advice recommends a net-zero target of 2050 for the UK as a whole. To achieve it, the report says a fifth of agricultural land needs to shift to alternative uses that support emissions reductions such as forestry or biomass production. It adds that carbon capture and storage would be crucial. Read more here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Five of the seven MSPs on the Committee backed the general principles of the Bill. The two members who dissented were Tory MSPs Oliver Mundell and Annie Wells. Andrew BlackBBC Scotland The chairman of Scotland's biggest employee-owned company has said Brexit uncertainty is setting off ""big red flashing lights"" for business. Dennis Overton, of high-end seafood processor Aquascot, said his industry was now facing a time of ""real risk"" for both imports and exports. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""If we do see a no-deal exit from the EU, that's gong to be problematic to quite a number of players in the food and drink sector. ""It's probably most extreme for those people who export high-value perishable products and seafood. Shellfish, farmed salmon and farmed trout come into that."" Read more. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles says our food and drink producers are on the frontline of the greatest threat to the economy for many, many years. Brexit could cost the sector Â£2bn pounds a year Mr Rumbles adds. There is little doubt that a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for the rural economy, he says, adding Michael Gove is inexplicably relaxed about the threat. He tells the chamber the Lib Dems will be supporting the government motion today and in terms of the amendments, he prefers the government motion as it stands. Voting against all the amendments will prevent dilution of the message this parliament sends, he says. Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to recent scientific studies. But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it. Try out the calculator here. Mr Ruskell says 35% of British consumers are having meat-free days throughout the week and the CCC had estimated there would be a 20% drop in meat consumption. A 50% drop in consumption would help reaching the net-zero emissions target he states, adding even this would be more than the recommended amount from public health bodies. The Green MSP adds there is an appetite for sustainable ethical food. This will require significant change and investment, such as incorporating more trees on farms and reducing herd densities he suggests. 1. The contents of your shopping basket may change What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. About 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more expensive in the event of no deal. Increased import taxes and transport delays could all mean a rise in prices. And if a no-deal Brexit was followed by a fall in the value of the pound, that would also have the same effect. Supermarkets themselves have already warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. And Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that, in a worst-case scenario, our shopping billscould increase by 10%. Read more. Green MSP Mark Ruskell Green MSP Mark Ruskell begins by saying by leaving the EU, Scotland stands to lose economic benefits, but also much much more. Mr Ruskell says the future of our food and drink industry is intrinsically linked with the environment, which has been established by the EU. He says Scottish MEPs have been disempowered by the UK government in efforts to get agriculture helping to fight climate change. The Green MSP argues there should be parallel discussion about CAP payments whether we remain in it or not. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Environment Secretary Michael Gove has promised that the government will apply tariffs to food imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, to provide ""specific and robust protections"" for farmers. His remarks come as the government is poised to release details of tariffs (taxes on imports) that would apply to thousands of products coming in from around the world, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Many supporters of Brexit argue that tariffs on food and other items should be scrapped in order to lower prices for consumers. But farmers fear that cheap imports and lower standards would destroy many parts of British agriculture. Read more here. In terms of climate change, Ms Grant says there is no credit given to farmers that are sequestrating carbon through forestation. The Scottish government must urgently draw up a strategy to help farmers sequestrate more, the Labour MSP argues. She says farmers and crofters are seeking leadership on climate change from the government. Pivoting to Brexit Ms Grant says there has been a referendum and democracy must be honoured, however people did not vote for this chaos. Further chaos must be prevented she adds. The human right to food should be put into Scots Law to protect people from rising insecurity, a report to the Scottish government suggests. The Scottish Human Rights Commission believes the move ""would help tackle health inequalities"". Its report was compiled forthe Scottish government's consultation on making Scotland a ""good food nation"". The government said it was committed to protecting internationally-recognised human rights. Read more here. Labour MSP Rhoda Grant says Brexit looms large over the industry and a no-deal would have a negative impact. We must do all we can to avoid a no-deal Brexit she says, and she urges the Scottish government to stop using it as a tool to promote its independence aims. Ms Grant says it is simply wrong that in such a rich country people are struggling to afford food. She says legislating on the right to food would help hold the Scottish government to account. We're still waiting for a Good Food Nation Bill, Mr Cameron goes on. The Tory MSP insists there are many opportunities for the food and drink sector if we get Brexit right. However he expresses concern that the Scottish government won't grasp those opportunities. Mr Cameron argues independence threatens the UK market, which is worth more than the EU market. He says the plan to change currency will damage Scotland's food and drink sector. Mr Ewing is using Brexit to hide his failure of coming up with an innovative new approach, the Tory MSP argues. Labour MSP Alex Rowley says fruit farmers are finding it difficult to recruit workers due to the ""botched visa scheme"". Mr Cameron says he hopes the UK and Scottish government's can work together on a solution. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Burnley midfielder Aaron Lennon has spoken publicly about mental health problems A record number of footballers are seeking mental health support, according to the Professional Footballers' Association. PFA director of player welfare Michael Bennett expects the organisation to help ""double or treble"" the number of players in 2019 than it did in 2018. Since January, 355 professionals have accessed therapy - the highest number ever recorded by the end of a season. The figure for the whole of 2018 was 438, having risen from 160 in 2016. Bennett says the increase is ""a good thing"" - as it shows increased trust in the PFA - rather than a growing problem. He expects to see a spike in the number of players seeking help in the coming weeks as clubs decide who will not be retained for next season. ""When players go back to pre-season, that's when those who haven't got contracts realise they're struggling mentally, emotionally and financially,"" Bennett, who played professionally for several clubs, including Charlton Athletic and Brighton & Hove Albion, told The Next Episode podcast. So what's it like to get released? And what support is out there when you do? Listen to The Next Episode on BBC Sounds Olu Maintain was released by a Premier League side at 18. He'd been with the club since he was seven. ""I went crazy, because I thought it was a done thing,"" he says. ""I was training with the first team. I wasn't even playing with a youth team. ""I'd spent my whole life at one place. How the hell do you expect me to mentally prepare?"" Maintain was told after a training session that he was not going to be kept on. ""It was a blur. I just remember walking out, I didn't even shower, just walked out,"" he says. ""I got my clothes on, got in my car and drove off. Then the head of the academy rang me because I think he thought I was going to kill myself or do something crazy. ""I spent my whole life there. They'd watched me grow up. I just couldn't accept it."" Maintain says he did get support from the club's coaches, but still found it tough. ""Mentally I wasn't in the space to hear anything from anyone,"" he says. ""That was the root of why my life spiralled out of control. A lot of my depression, a lot of mental health and all that stuff was me not dealing with rejection then."" Although Maintain went on to sign for Norwich and Falkirk, he feels the impact of that early rejection stayed with him. ""You're rubbish - that's how I took it. Point blank, you're not good enough for anything. Relationships, friendships, jobs,"" he adds. ""I'll start something now and never finish it. I can never see stuff through because I'm thinking it's just too good to be true. ""I'm worried about what people think. Worried about how people perceive me."" Since leaving the professional game, Maintain has begun writing a comedy series. He still plays semi-professional football for Woking - who have just been promoted to the National League - but says the game still has a long way to go in tackling the mental health problems of some of its players. ""No-one wants to talk about emotions, and if you do you're soft,"" he says. Andy Ali has been at the academies of four different clubs. ""I never actually had a contract,"" says the 21-year-old. ""I was one of those players who was in for maybe two or three months."" At 16, Ali was at the academy of a Championship club and thought he had finally done enough to earn a pro contract. ""I thought this was finally the one that was going to pay off, so when they eventually told me [he was being released], I honestly I couldn't see a way forward,"" he says. ""I was thinking, 'how am I going to tell people what's happened?' ""No-one's your friend. One or two people might take a liking to you, but the system isn't there for you."" About 12,000 boys are in academies at any one time, and mental health provisions are being stepped up. Any 16-year-old at a club has to carry on with some kind of education, and the PFA visits all 92 English league clubs to give workshops on mental health and emotional well-being. The English Football League is halfway through a two-year partnership with mental health charity Mind, and on Wednesday the Football Association launched a new campaign using football to ""generate the biggest ever conversation around mental health"". Ali is all too aware of the impact rejection can have on young players' lives. ""I've seen friends who were probably the best at football in my area go to jail,"" he says. ""I know one guy who made it as a pro at 18 and now he's in jail because he got released. He just couldn't accept that."" Maz Bettache manages Rising Ballers, a Sunday league team in west London including several players released by professional clubs. ""I was lucky enough to be part of a Premier League club from the age of nine up to 18 but unfortunately I didn't get a professional contract,"" he says. ""It didn't work out, but I bounced back and it's only made me a better person on and off the pitch."" The players at Rising Ballers say it feels a lot different to the professional academies they were at, in terms of the support network. ""When players get released, their life changes very, very quickly and it's hard to take,"" Bettache says. ""I'm just trying to create an environment for players to enjoy their football, showcase their talent and put it out there for the whole world to see."" Rising Ballers film all their games and upload them to YouTube. Their social media following is growing, and more and more scouts from professional clubs are watching the team, who are on a 21-game unbeaten run. ""That time when players have been told that they're not getting a professional contract is very crucial,"" says Bettache. ""It's about getting them opportunities with other clubs, opportunities away from football, different career paths and helping them, really helping them build up as a person again.""

The Scottish government motion is agreed to The Tory amendment from the food and drink bill is not agreed to with 29 MSPs backing it and 82 against. The Labour amendment also falls with 14 MSPs for and 97 against and it is joined by the Green amendment in the rejected pile, as it garnered the support of 20 MSPs but was opposed by 35, with 56 abstentions. The Scottish government's motion, unamended, is agreed to with 76 MSPs backing, 29 against and six abstentions. Edward Mountain cites the vision in the Scottish Conservative's New Approach to Scottish Farming and contrasts that with what he sees as the lack of vision of the Scottish government. Mr Mountain asks where the Good Food Nation Bill and Agriculture Bill are and insists the cabinet secretary must ""stop dithering and start delivering"". The Tory MSP agrees with Fergus Ewing that it is the farmers that make the countryside worth visiting and he believes it's a pity so much of people's speeches were not directed to them. Rural Affairs Secretary Fergus Ewing says there have been some very good contributions to this debate and some other ones. Mr Ewing tells the chamber there is ""something really seedy"" about using no-deal as a tool given Michael Gove is against it. On freedom of movement he says: ""I entirely agree with Mr Ruskell, I don't actually think I've uttered that phrase before"". The minister, impassioned, adds: ""The Scottish Tories have discovered political permafrost."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Closing for the Greens, Mark Ruskell says the Green New Deal is all about transformation in the food and farming sectors. It would require an active government driving innovation forward in tandem with the private sector, he states. Mr Ruskell goes on the highlight that 40% of people in the food service sector are immigrants and he criticises the ""hostile immigration policy"". Labour MSP Rhoda Grant says everyone has agreed a no-deal Brexit should be avoided at all costs. She also suggests the entire parliament seems to support a Good Food Nation Bill, insisting the sooner it is brought forward the sooner parties can get round the table for discussions. We must also ensure fair trade does not get lost in Brexit negotiations and we do not forget to protect vulnerable workforces, Ms Grant says. Trees are a powerful tool to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere The Scottish government will legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045 after receiving fresh advice from an expert panel. The Committee on Climate Change,external(CCC) urged that Scotland set the targetfive years ahead of the UK as a whole. The CCC advice recommends a net-zero target of 2050 for the UK as a whole. To achieve it, the report says a fifth of agricultural land needs to shift to alternative uses that support emissions reductions such as forestry or biomass production. It adds that carbon capture and storage would be crucial. Read more here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Five of the seven MSPs on the Committee backed the general principles of the Bill. The two members who dissented were Tory MSPs Oliver Mundell and Annie Wells. Andrew BlackBBC Scotland The chairman of Scotland's biggest employee-owned company has said Brexit uncertainty is setting off ""big red flashing lights"" for business. Dennis Overton, of high-end seafood processor Aquascot, said his industry was now facing a time of ""real risk"" for both imports and exports. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""If we do see a no-deal exit from the EU, that's gong to be problematic to quite a number of players in the food and drink sector. ""It's probably most extreme for those people who export high-value perishable products and seafood. Shellfish, farmed salmon and farmed trout come into that."" Read more. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles says our food and drink producers are on the frontline of the greatest threat to the economy for many, many years. Brexit could cost the sector Â£2bn pounds a year Mr Rumbles adds. There is little doubt that a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for the rural economy, he says, adding Michael Gove is inexplicably relaxed about the threat. He tells the chamber the Lib Dems will be supporting the government motion today and in terms of the amendments, he prefers the government motion as it stands. Voting against all the amendments will prevent dilution of the message this parliament sends, he says. Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to recent scientific studies. But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it. Try out the calculator here. Mr Ruskell says 35% of British consumers are having meat-free days throughout the week and the CCC had estimated there would be a 20% drop in meat consumption. A 50% drop in consumption would help reaching the net-zero emissions target he states, adding even this would be more than the recommended amount from public health bodies. The Green MSP adds there is an appetite for sustainable ethical food. This will require significant change and investment, such as incorporating more trees on farms and reducing herd densities he suggests. 1. The contents of your shopping basket may change What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. About 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more expensive in the event of no deal. Increased import taxes and transport delays could all mean a rise in prices. And if a no-deal Brexit was followed by a fall in the value of the pound, that would also have the same effect. Supermarkets themselves have already warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. And Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that, in a worst-case scenario, our shopping billscould increase by 10%. Read more. Green MSP Mark Ruskell Green MSP Mark Ruskell begins by saying by leaving the EU, Scotland stands to lose economic benefits, but also much much more. Mr Ruskell says the future of our food and drink industry is intrinsically linked with the environment, which has been established by the EU. He says Scottish MEPs have been disempowered by the UK government in efforts to get agriculture helping to fight climate change. The Green MSP argues there should be parallel discussion about CAP payments whether we remain in it or not. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Environment Secretary Michael Gove has promised that the government will apply tariffs to food imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, to provide ""specific and robust protections"" for farmers. His remarks come as the government is poised to release details of tariffs (taxes on imports) that would apply to thousands of products coming in from around the world, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Many supporters of Brexit argue that tariffs on food and other items should be scrapped in order to lower prices for consumers. But farmers fear that cheap imports and lower standards would destroy many parts of British agriculture. Read more here. In terms of climate change, Ms Grant says there is no credit given to farmers that are sequestrating carbon through forestation. The Scottish government must urgently draw up a strategy to help farmers sequestrate more, the Labour MSP argues. She says farmers and crofters are seeking leadership on climate change from the government. Pivoting to Brexit Ms Grant says there has been a referendum and democracy must be honoured, however people did not vote for this chaos. Further chaos must be prevented she adds. The human right to food should be put into Scots Law to protect people from rising insecurity, a report to the Scottish government suggests. The Scottish Human Rights Commission believes the move ""would help tackle health inequalities"". Its report was compiled forthe Scottish government's consultation on making Scotland a ""good food nation"". The government said it was committed to protecting internationally-recognised human rights. Read more here. Labour MSP Rhoda Grant says Brexit looms large over the industry and a no-deal would have a negative impact. We must do all we can to avoid a no-deal Brexit she says, and she urges the Scottish government to stop using it as a tool to promote its independence aims. Ms Grant says it is simply wrong that in such a rich country people are struggling to afford food. She says legislating on the right to food would help hold the Scottish government to account. We're still waiting for a Good Food Nation Bill, Mr Cameron goes on. The Tory MSP insists there are many opportunities for the food and drink sector if we get Brexit right. However he expresses concern that the Scottish government won't grasp those opportunities. Mr Cameron argues independence threatens the UK market, which is worth more than the EU market. He says the plan to change currency will damage Scotland's food and drink sector. Mr Ewing is using Brexit to hide his failure of coming up with an innovative new approach, the Tory MSP argues. Labour MSP Alex Rowley says fruit farmers are finding it difficult to recruit workers due to the ""botched visa scheme"". Mr Cameron says he hopes the UK and Scottish government's can work together on a solution. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Labour Party is unveiling plans to take the National Grid into public ownership. It wants to create a National Energy Agency to own and maintain transmission infrastructure. Labour said its nationalisation pledge would ""usher in a Green Industrial Revolution"" and tackle climate change. But National Grid - the largest transmitter of electricity and gas in Britain - said the proposal was the ""last thing"" that was needed. The firm, which does not operate in Northern Ireland, said the Labour plan would hinder the shift to green energy. Labour also set out plans to put solar panels on nearly two million homes. Its proposals are contained in a document entitledBringing Energy Home,external, due to be presented on Thursday by leader Jeremy Corbyn and Rebecca Long Bailey, shadow energy secretary. Installing solar panels on social homes and those with low-incomes is part of Labour's plan to ""usher in a Green Industrial Revolution in housing, transport and industry - creating over 400,000 jobs and tackling climate change"". Labour said the solar panels would reduce fuel bills, and that it would also offer interest-free loans, grants and make changes to regulations to help an additional 750,000 properties install solar panels. Unused electricity would be used by the National Grid, which would be nationalised. ""Energy networks that are owned by the public and responsive to the public interest will be able to prioritise tackling climate change, fuel poverty and security of supply over profit extraction, while working with energy unions to support energy workers through the transition,"" Labour said. But National Grid said the plan would ""delay the huge amount of progress and investment that is already helping to make this country a leader in the move to green energy"". ""At a time when there is increased urgency to meet the challenges of climate change, the last thing that is needed is the enormous distraction, cost and complexity contained in these plans,"" it added. Reality Check: What has happened to energy since privatisation? Gas heating ban for new homes from 2025 UK has first coal-free week for a century National Grid chief executive John Pettigrew told the BBC's Today programme: ""We do not believe the Labour proposals are in the interests of customers."" He defended National Grid's record, saying it was ""in the middle of a huge transformation"" and ""investing hugely in the network"". He said Labour had to consider what problem it was looking to solve. Labour is committed to generating at least 60% of the UK's electricity and heat from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030. It would take the four licensed and regulated electricity and gas transmission companies, including National Grid Electricity and National Grid Gas, back into public ownership and ""replace existing private monopolies with publicly owned and locally run institutions"". Mr Corbyn said: ""Our Green Industrial Revolution will benefit working-class people with cheaper energy bills, more rewarding well-paid jobs, and new industries to revive the parts of our country that have been held back for far too long."" However, Dan Neidle, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance, told the BBC that Labour's nationalisation plans could contravene international law, because of suggestions that it would not necessarily pay stock market value to buy back the assets. He said that in every UK privatisation so far, the state paid market value, so it was not up to Labour to decide what was a fair price. ""That's not what the UK precedent is and that's not what international law says,"" he says. ""The courts have never said that's acceptable,"" he added. With the rare exception of Venezuela, ""you have to look quite hard for governments that have done that"". If the UK did this, it might struggle to raise money in the bond market, he suggested. The Conservative's vice-chairman for policy, Chris Philp, said Labour's ""ideological plan for the state to seize these companies would cost an eye-watering Â£100bn and saddle taxpayers with their debts"". ""It would leave politicians in Westminster in charge of keeping the lights on and leave customers with nowhere else to turn,"" he added. ""With no credible plan for how Labour would pay for this, more borrowing and tax hikes would be inevitable."" What has happened to energy since privatisation?

"The world's first drugs designed to stop cancer cells becoming resistant to treatment could be available within the next decade, scientists have said. A Â£75m investment to develop the drugs has been announced by the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). Chief executive Prof Paul Workman said cancer's ability to adapt to drugs is the biggest challenge in treatment. The new drugs could make cancer a ""manageable"" disease in the long term and ""more often curable"", he said. Researchers say existing treatments such as chemotherapy sometimes fail because the deadliest cancer cells adapt and survive, causing the patient to relapse. Prof Workman said: ""Cancer's ability to adapt, evolve and become drug resistant was the cause of the vast majority of deaths from the disease and the biggest challenge we face in overcoming it."" 'Dismantling cancer' reveals weak spots Cancer's 'internal wiring' predicts relapse risk The breakthroughs that could save our lives He said the institute was ""changing the entire way we think about cancer"" to focus on anticipating the way cancer cells will evolve to prevent them from becoming resistant to drugs. The ICR aims to attract a further Â£15m of funding for its new Centre for Drug Discovery at its campus in Sutton, south London, which is intended to bring together almost 300 scientists from different fields. By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News All cancers are constantly evolving and that is a major problem because patients relapse if their cancer develops resistance to therapy. The approach by the Institute of Cancer Research is to harness the process of evolution, to turn to the theories of Charles Darwin in the hunt for new therapies. One idea is to develop drugs that limit a cancer's ability to evolve. Another is ""evolutionary herding"" that guides a cancer's development into a state that makes it more vulnerable to drugs. Or combinations of therapies could present an impossible hurdle for cancer to overcome. Early-stage experiments using these ideas have had promising results, but any changes to the way patients are treated are at least a decade away.Â Scientists aim to use new approaches including multidrug combination treatments and artificial intelligence to predict and influence the evolution of cancer cells, creating weaknesses that treatments can exploit. Dr Andrea Sottoriva, deputy director of cancer evolution in the new centre, said: ""Artificial intelligence and mathematical predictive methods have huge potential to get inside cancer's head and predict what it is going to do next and how it will respond to new treatments."" Researchers are already working on new drugs designed to stop a type of protein molecule called Apobec, which is part of the immune system hijacked by more than half of cancer types to speed up the evolution of drug resistance. Prof Workman said laboratory testing and clinical trials for the new drugs would take around 10 years before they could potentially become available for patients. He added: ""We firmly believe that, with further research, we can find ways to make cancer a manageable disease in the long term and one that is more often curable, so patients can live longer and with a better quality of life.""

"HS2 bosses say the project will transform the UK economy HS2 will not offer value for money and risks ""short changing"" the North of England, a group of peers has warned. A report from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee also said it was ""far from convinced"" the new high-speed railway will be built within the Â£55.7bn budget. It said the project should not go ahead without a new assessment of its costs and benefits. The government said it ""fundamentally disagreed"" with the report. The committee, which includes former chancellors Lord Darling and Lord Lamont, said that more than Â£4bn had already been spent on the first phase of HS2, which will run between London and Birmingham. But it said the scheme had put too much emphasis on cutting journey times and not enough on the economic impact on regions. Minister promises no 'betrayal' over HS2 High speed rail 'will benefit Scotland' It said the first phase of the project offered ""little benefit"" to northern cities, despite them being in most need of better rail infrastructure. And it said the second phase, which would improve journey times between Leeds and Sheffield, risked never going ahead because of spending overruns. ""The northern sections of High Speed 2 must not be sacrificed to make up for overspending on the railway's southern sections,"" said Lord Forsyth, who chairs the committee. The report called for the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme - a separate scheme connecting towns and cities in the region - to be completed alongside HS2. Currently work on that scheme does not begin until the mid 2020s. It also urged the government to control the costs of HS2, amid warnings that ""nobody knows"" what the final cost will be. It suggested lowering the speed of HS2 or placing its terminal in west London rather than Euston would save money. The report is the latest in a series of warnings about the railway, amid concern over its finances and environmental impact. HS2 is planned to run up to 18 trains per hour at a top speed of 225mph, with phase one set to open in 2026. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ""By 2020, the government will have invested a record Â£13bn in transport across the North, and we have a clear plan for linking the Midlands and the North through HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail - the full benefits of which can only be delivered on the back of HS2. ""This is not either/or, we are clear we want both. ""HS2 will deliver additional rail capacity, significantly improve connections and provide opportunities for economic growth - with around Â£92bn in benefits - for people and businesses across the North.""

Black renounced his Canadian citizenship when he became a British peer in 2001 but moved back to Canada following his release from a Florida prison. In 2014Canada stripped him of its highest honour, the Order of Canada, which was awarded in 1990 for a lifetime of achievement. Conrad Black and Barbara Amiel at a fancy dress party at Kensington Palace in 2000 In 2007 Black was convicted of defrauding Hollinger International shareholders of $6.1m (Â£4.7m), by paying himself a tax-free bonus from the sale of newspaper assets without the approval of the company's board. He had been forced out of the company by shareholders in 2003. After his conviction, Black was sentenced to 78 months in prison. He then pursued a partially successful appeal, in which a judge cut his sentence down to 42 months. The White House has also announced a pardon for Patrick Nolan, a former Republican leader who spent more than two years in prison after pleading guilty to a racketeering charge. Nolan told the Los Angeles Times he was ""obviously very grateful"",externaland ""had hoped"" to get a pardon.

"Gucci, pictured at Milan Fashion Week in February, is one of the brands owned by Kering Fashion company Kering has announced that it will no longer use models who are under the age of 18. The French luxury group owns several major fashion houses, including Gucci, Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen. The policy will come into effect in time for the 2020-2021 Autumn/Winter collections, Kering said. Chief executive FranÃ§ois Henri-Pinault said in a statement that the company was ""conscious of the influence exerted on younger generations"" by its images. ""We believe that we have a responsibility to put forward the best possible practices in the luxury sector, and we hope to create a movement that will encourage others to follow suit,"" he said. Marie-Claire Daveu, Kering's chief sustainability officer, added: ""The physiological and psychological maturity of models aged over 18 seems more appropriate to the rhythm and demands that are involved in this profession."" 'I was a teen fashion model' The companies that prey on aspiring models Christian Dior and Gucci owners drop super-skinny models Sara Ziff, founder of the campaign group Model Alliance, told BBC News the announcement was ""a positive step towards eliminating the intense pressure models currently face to maintain an adolescent physique and to go to extremes to lose weight"". But she added that it lacks a ""mechanism for actual enforcement"" - and that she fears the pledge could ""amount to little more than lip service to critical issues that have plagued the industry for far too long"". Kering's decision comes as fashion brands are increasingly trying to become more ethical, both in their designs and in their working practices. In August last yearCondÃ© Nast, which publishes Vogue magazine, announced that it would not use models under the age of 18in editorial shoots, unless they were the subject of an article. ""This is partly the result of an internal reckoning,"" an editorial in Vogue said at the time. ""Vogue, along with a number of other publications, has played a role in making it routine for children - since that's what they are - to be dressed and marketed as glamorous adults."" It continued: ""No more: it's not right for us, it's not right for our readers, and it's not right for the young models competing to appear in these pages. While we can't rewrite the past, we can commit to a better future."" Kaia Gerber, a rising star in the industry, is just 17 years old The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) made a similar declaration last year. Its CEO Steven Kolb said: ""Young models are still developing. There can be a lack of the confidence, strength, experience, and maturity it takes to deal with the pressures of this work."" In 2017, both Kering and a rival fashion group LVMH signed a charter agreeing to - among other things - stop hiring models who were under the age of 16. A number of fashion designers have alsopledged not to hire ultra-thin models, andnot to use exotic animal skins and fur in their designs. It has long been common across the industry to cast models who were under 18 - and indeed, many supermodels got their start in the fashion industry at a young age. Naomi Campbell, now 48, was just shy of 16 when she launched her career. Kate Moss, 45, was discovered at the age of 14. Brooke Shields was just 14 when she appeared on the front cover of Vogue in February 1980. Currently, 17-year-old Kaia Gerber is a rising star, while the late Karl Lagerfeld's godson Hudson Kroenig, 11, was regularly seen on the catwalk. But a spotlight was shone on the treatment of young models in October 2017, when 14-year-old Russian model Vlada Dzyuba collapsed backstage at Shanghai Fashion Week and later died in hospital. Vogue, in making its decision, also cited a number of allegations of sexual harassment in the fashion industry, which were publicised as part of the #MeToo movement. It added that in the mid-1980s, when Campbell launched her career, there were so few fashion shows a year that ""a model could stay in school if she wished"" - but nowadays the work is much more demanding.

" The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for. A long marbled staircase, covered in plush red carpet, greets you as you first walk in. At the top of the stairs, a giant painting depicts a traditional Chinese New Year scene. Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ A few kilometres away in Dongguan, Huawei’s latest campus is even more eye-catching. The site - designed to accommodate the company’s 25,000 R&D staff - comprises 12 “villages”, each of which recreates the architecture of a different European city, among them Paris, Bologna and Granada. It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones.

Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. ...but Huawei's Dongguan Campus It’s a world away from the environment that Mr Ren found himself in when he first started the company in 1987. “I founded Huawei when China began to implement its reform and opening up policy,” he says. “At that time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy. Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead.

"Normally following the birth of a baby, the placenta and cord blood are discarded, according to routine hospital practice The number of people paying thousands of pounds to freeze parts of their baby's umbilical cord in case they get ill has risen sharply, figures show. Cord blood and tissue are rich in stem cells and can be stored with private companies to use to treat the child for a range of life-threatening diseases. Some 27,028 blood and tissue units were banked privately in 2018 compared with 16,965 units in 2014. The Royal College of Midwives has previously not backed private banking. According to regulator the Human Tissue Authority, there are seven private establishments in the UK licensed to process either cord blood or tissue. Rosaira Tormey banked her son's cord blood and tissue in December Mother-of-three Rosaira Tormey, from Sheffield, who has a mutation of the BRCA1 gene, which increases her chances of getting breast cancer, said because of this she paid Â£2,700 to bank her son's umbilical cord blood and tissue. Although stem cell treatment cannot currently treat her condition, she said she hoped keeping the cord could one day help her children if they were to get ill. Ms Tormey, who also pays Â£100 a year for storage fees, said: ""We just saw it as investment in their health. ""I've got no control over whether I've passed a faulty gene to them but I feel like I've got a little bit of control now if something was to happen. ""People save for their kids' weddings and things like that, so why not put something in place if they ever need that protection?"" Mothers can also choose to donate cord blood to the public stem-cell bank, the NHS Cord Blood Bank, or one run by a charity, such as the Anthony Nolan Trust. These donations are made available for public use and are not kept specifically for individuals. Private banks differ in that they store units solely for use by the donor or their family in the hope that if one of them becomes ill with a stem cell-treatable disease, such as blood cancer or immunodeficiencies, there might be a perfect match unit available. Figures from the regulator, obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act, showed the number of umbilical cord tissue units processed privately almost doubled between 2014 and 2018, rising from 6,289 to 11,950. There was also an increase in the number of cord blood units processed, going from 10,676 in 2014 to 15,078 in 2018. While numbers for private storage have risen, donations of cord blood to the public banks dropped from 4,634 in 2014 to 2,573 in 2018. However, some public banks, including the NHS one, have a lower set collection target and therefore would not expect as many donations. Cord blood and tissue are stored in liquid nitrogen containers and can be kept for 25 years In the past, the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said they supported public but not private banking. They said there was not enough evidence to recommend routine private cord collection and banking unless there was a medical reason. But both bodies said they were currently looking at their position on the issue.

"Normally following the birth of a baby, the placenta and cord blood are discarded, according to routine hospital practice The number of people paying thousands of pounds to freeze parts of their baby's umbilical cord in case they get ill has risen sharply, figures show. Cord blood and tissue are rich in stem cells and can be stored with private companies to use to treat the child for a range of life-threatening diseases. Some 27,028 blood and tissue units were banked privately in 2018 compared with 16,965 units in 2014. The Royal College of Midwives has previously not backed private banking. According to regulator the Human Tissue Authority, there are seven private establishments in the UK licensed to process either cord blood or tissue. Rosaira Tormey banked her son's cord blood and tissue in December Mother-of-three Rosaira Tormey, from Sheffield, who has a mutation of the BRCA1 gene, which increases her chances of getting breast cancer, said because of this she paid Â£2,700 to bank her son's umbilical cord blood and tissue. Although stem cell treatment cannot currently treat her condition, she said she hoped keeping the cord could one day help her children if they were to get ill. Ms Tormey, who also pays Â£100 a year for storage fees, said: ""We just saw it as investment in their health. ""I've got no control over whether I've passed a faulty gene to them but I feel like I've got a little bit of control now if something was to happen. ""People save for their kids' weddings and things like that, so why not put something in place if they ever need that protection?"" Mothers can also choose to donate cord blood to the public stem-cell bank, the NHS Cord Blood Bank, or one run by a charity, such as the Anthony Nolan Trust. These donations are made available for public use and are not kept specifically for individuals. Private banks differ in that they store units solely for use by the donor or their family in the hope that if one of them becomes ill with a stem cell-treatable disease, such as blood cancer or immunodeficiencies, there might be a perfect match unit available. Figures from the regulator, obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act, showed the number of umbilical cord tissue units processed privately almost doubled between 2014 and 2018, rising from 6,289 to 11,950. There was also an increase in the number of cord blood units processed, going from 10,676 in 2014 to 15,078 in 2018. While numbers for private storage have risen, donations of cord blood to the public banks dropped from 4,634 in 2014 to 2,573 in 2018. However, some public banks, including the NHS one, have a lower set collection target and therefore would not expect as many donations. Cord blood and tissue are stored in liquid nitrogen containers and can be kept for 25 years In the past, the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said they supported public but not private banking. They said there was not enough evidence to recommend routine private cord collection and banking unless there was a medical reason. But both bodies said they were currently looking at their position on the issue.

"This video can not be played Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou as politically motivated The founder of Huawei has said there is ""no way the US can crush"" the company, in an exclusive interview with the BBC. Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer, as politically motivated. The US is pursuing criminal charges against Huawei and Ms Meng, including money laundering, bank fraud and stealing trade secrets. Huawei denies any wrongdoing. Mr Ren spoke to the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in his first international broadcast interview since Ms Meng was arrested - and dismissed the pressure from the US. ""There's no way the US can crush us,"" he said. ""The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit."" However, he acknowledged that the potential loss of custom could have a significant impact. Ren Zhengfei: Reclusive but confident Should we worry about Huawei? Who is Ren Zhengfei? Why Huawei matters in five charts What is 5G? Who is Meng Wanzhou? Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned the country's allies against using Huawei technology, saying it would make it more difficult for Washington to ""partner alongside them"". Australia, New Zealand, and the US have already banned or blocked Huawei from supplying equipment for their future 5G mobile broadband networks, while Canada is reviewing whether the company's products present a serious security threat. Mr Ren warned that ""the world cannot leave us because we are more advanced"". ""If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North goes dark, there is still the South. America doesn't represent the world. America only represents a portion of the world."" The UK'sNational Cyber Security Centre has decidedthat any risk posed by using Huawei technology in UK telecoms projects can be managed. Many of the UK's mobile companies, including Vodafone, EE and Three, are working with Huawei to develop their 5G networks. They are awaiting a government review, due in March or April, that will decide whether they can use Huawei technology. Commenting on the possibility of a UK ban, Mr Ren said Huawei ""won't withdraw our investment because of this. We will continue to invest in the UK. ""We still trust in the UK, and we hope that the UK will trust us even more. ""We will invest even more in the UK. Because if the US doesn't trust us, then we will shift our investment from the US to the UK on an even bigger scale."" Huawei has denied that it poses any risk to the UK or any other country Mr Ren's daughter Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, was arrested on 1 December in Vancouver at the request of the US, and is expected to be the subject of a formal extradition request. In total,23 charges are levelled against Huawei and Ms Weng. The charges are split across two indictments by the US Department of Justice. The first covers claims Huawei hid business links to Iran - which is subject to US trade sanctions. The second includes the charge of attempted theft of trade secrets. Mr Ren was clear in his opposition to the US accusations. ""Firstly, I object to what the US has done. This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable. ""The US likes to sanction others, whenever there's an issue, they'll use such combative methods. ""We object to this. But now that we've gone down this path, we'll let the courts settle it."" Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver last December Huawei, which is China's largest private company, has been under scrutiny for its links to the Chinese government - with the US and others expressing concern its technology could be used by China's security services to spy. Under Chinese law, firms are compelled to ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"". But Mr Ren said that allowing spying was a risk he wouldn't take. ""The Chinese government has already clearly said that it won't install any backdoors. And we won't install backdoors either. ""We're not going to risk the disgust of our country and of our customers all over the world, because of something like this. ""Our company will never undertake any spying activities. If we have any such actions, then I'll shut the company down."" Analysis - Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent - Shenzhen For a man known as reclusive and secretive, Ren Zhengfei seemed confident in the conviction that the business he's built for the last 30 years can withstand the scrutiny from Western governments. Mr Ren is right: the US makes up only a fraction of his overall business. But where I saw his mood change was when I asked him about his links to the Chinese military and the government. While he answered all of my questions, he refused to be drawn into a conversation on this, only to say that these were not facts, simply allegations - and insisted that political connections are not what has led Huawei to be successful today. When I put to him the reports that his former chairwoman, Sun Yafang, had once worked with China's Ministry of State Security, he told me that her profile was up on the company's corporate website and that he didn't think it was ""OK to suspect or guess where this person used to be"". He also confirmed that there is a Communist Party committee in Huawei, but he said this is what all companies - foreign or domestic - operating in China must have in order to abide by the law.

"Theresa May has promised to set a timetable for the election of her successor after the next Brexit vote in the first week of June. The agreement follows a meeting between the prime minister and senior Tory MPs who are demanding a date for her departure from Downing Street. If she loses the vote on her Brexit plan, already rejected three times, sources told the BBC she would resign. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has said he will run for leader once Mrs May goes. The prime minister survived a confidence vote by Conservative MPs at the end of last year and party rules mean she cannot formally be challenged again until December. Johnson confirms bid for Tory leadership MPs 'have duty to support Brexit bill' What happens next? But Mrs May has come under increasing pressure to leave Downing Street this summer, amid the Brexit impasse and poor results for the Conservatives in the recent local elections in England. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said senior sources had told her it was ""inconceivable"" the prime minister could remain in office if MPs rejected her Brexit plans for a fourth time. ""Discussing an election timetable"" doesn't sound that exciting. But the paragraph tucked into the short formal letter from Sir Graham Brady to Tory MPs all but marks the end of Theresa May's premiership and the beginning of the official hunt for the next leader of the country. After the lines in the short note restate the prime minister's determination to get Brexit done, it confirms in black and white that after the next big vote, in the first week of June, the prime minister will make plans with the party for choosing a successor. Right now, the expectation is that vote will be lost (although it is not impossible, of course, that Number 10 could turn it round). And the conversation that's been arranged won't just be a gentle chat about what to do next. Senior sources have told me that means, even though the letter doesn't spell it out, that if her Brexit plan is defeated again, Mrs May will announce she is going. Read more from Laura The chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, Sir Graham Brady, said he had reached an agreement over the prime minister's future during ""very frank"" talks in Parliament. He said the committee's executive and Mrs May would meet again to discuss her future following the first debate and vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning 3 June. Sir Graham said there was now ""greater clarity"" about the situation. Johnson confirms bid for Tory leadership MPs 'have duty to support Brexit bill' What happens next? Asked if that meant the prime minister would quit immediately if MPs rejected her Brexit plans once more, he said that scenario went ""beyond"" what had been agreed. MPs have rejected the prime minister's Brexit agreement with the EU three times. But she will have another go at gaining their support in the week beginning 3 June, when the Commons votes for the first time on the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation needed to implement her deal with the EU. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady: PM will announce departure timetable in early June Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has joined the growing list of Conservatives who say they will stand for leader when Mrs May announces her departure. He told a business conference in Manchester: ""Of course I am going to go for it."" Conservative MP Grant Shapps welcomed the announcement that a timetable would be set out for Mrs May's departure, suggesting it would inject greater ambition and dynamism into the Brexit process. The former party chairman told BBC News the Brexit bill had no chance of passing in its current state but holding another vote would allow Mrs May to demonstrate she had ""tried everything"". ""It is right to bring this whole saga to a conclusion,"" he said. This video can not be played The Conservatives jostling to be the next prime minister But fellow Tory Phillip Lee, who backs another Brexit referendum, said replacing the prime minister would not ""solve the crisis"" the UK found itself in or build a parliamentary majority for the terms of the UK's departure. ""Forcing the PM's resignation and spending this summer locked in a leadership election where candidates trade ever more fantastic visions of unicorn Brexitsâ¦is neither in the interests of the Conservative Party nor of the United Kingdom,"" he said. Last month,the 1922 Committee executive narrowly decided against changing the party's leadership rulesto allow an early challenge to Mrs May. Local Tory associations have confirmedthey will hold a vote of confidencein her leadership on 15 June, although its result will not be binding. Much of the anger in the Conservative parliamentary party is focusing on the prime minister's talks with Labour, aimed at reaching a cross-party compromise to get her deal through the Commons. BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said he understood the talks will ""soon be drawing to a close"" adding that Tory whips had ""given up on this phase of the negotiations and are looking to pack the legislation with goodies for Brexiteers"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would not support the Withdrawal Agreement Bill unless it guaranteed membership of a customs union with the EU, and protected workers' rights, consumer rights and environmental rights. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said his party would ""happily support"" the legislation, provided it was subject to a ""confirmatory public vote"".

"This video can not be played Theresa May: MPs ""have a duty"" to deliver Brexit Theresa May says MPs have a ""duty"" to ""ensure we deliver"" Brexit by voting for the withdrawal bill in the Commons. The government says the bill - required to implement the PM's deal - will be considered by MPs in the week beginning 3 June. Earlier, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the deal would be ""dead"" if MPs did not pass it. But Jeremy Corbyn's spokesman has said Labour would not support the bill if no cross-party agreement is reached. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after Theresa May's Brexit deal, the withdrawal agreement that was negotiated with the EU, was rejected three times by MPs. Asked twice during a trip to Paris whether she would resign if her Brexit plan is rejected again by MPs, Mrs May said the withdrawal bill would ""ensure that we deliver Brexit for the public"". She added: ""When MPs come to look at this bill, come to vote on this legislation, I'm sure they will be thinking of the duty we have to ensure we deliver on the vote of the British public."" Government sources have told the BBC there would not be a further attempt if the plan is rejected. PM all but out of time to pass Brexit deal Remain parties 'shouldn't squabble' The vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) - which will take place when MPs return from half-term recess - would bring the withdrawal agreement into UK law. This video can not be played Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay: PM's deal is ""dead"" if bill fails BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was not the same thumbs up or thumbs down that another meaningful vote would be - a straightforward yes or no to the divorce deal that the prime minister negotiated with the EU. Instead, she said, MPs would be voting on the Withdrawal Bill, which is a whole tome of new laws that will be needed to take us out of the European Union. Speaking to a House of Lords committee earlier, Stephen Barclay said the withdrawal bill will be published ""as soon as possible"". He said: ""I think if the House of Commons does not approve the WAB, then the Barnier deal is dead in that form and I think the House will have to then address a much more fundamental question between whether it will pursue... a no-deal option or whether it will revoke."" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said MPs will have to decide ""if they want to vote for Brexit or not"". Bringing the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill forward would allow the prime minister to push ahead with her ambition of delivering Brexit before the summer - despite the lack of agreement so far in the cross-party talks, said BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. Mr Corbyn's spokesman said that unless there was an agreement based on ""real compromise and movement by the government"" then the bill would be ""based on the same botched Brexit deal that has been rejected three times already by Parliament"". As things stand pulling off a victory in the Brexit bill would seem to be like pulling off a miracle. Not impossible, but very unlikely. Which is why we come back to that question. If the bill falls, does Theresa May fall too? Plenty of her critics are out there publicly claiming that must be the end. One of her oldest and staunchest supporters suggested quietly today, ""I think she knows that's it"". Another loyal lieutenant who's been fighting off attempts to oust her for months says ""losing the bill would have to be it - we are in the end now."" This has already for Theresa May been a very long goodbye, and we can't know yet when she will actually bid a final farewell. But by committing to bringing the Brexit bill back to Parliament, the prime minister has set herself another huge test, that if she loses, it could turn out to be her last in the job. Read more from Laura Brexiteer and Conservative MP Steve Baker said bringing the bill forward ""over the heads"" of DUP MPs - on whom the government relies for a majority - would ""eradicate the government's majority"". ""What is the government thinking?"" he asked. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn discussed the ongoing cross-party talks on Tuesday DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said: ""If the prime minister brings the withdrawal bill to the Commons for a vote, the question will be, 'What has changed?' ""Unless she can demonstrate something new that addresses the problem of the backstop, then it is highly likely her deal will go down to defeat once again."" Thebackstopis the controversial part of the withdrawal deal that aims to ensure an open border on the island of Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. This is a requirement under the terms of previous Brexit legislation passed last year. The legislation would make the citizens' rights part of the agreement directly enforceable in UK courts, and set their relationship with the EU's Court of Justice. It will also allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal, and give effect to the so-called backstop plan for the Irish border. MPs will be able to vote on amendments to the bill, and this could allow ministers to make good on any compromise they reach with Labour in the cross-party talks. If the bill is introduced in the first week of June it will come seven days after the European Parliament elections -  which Education Secretary Damian Hinds has acknowledged could be ""difficult"" for the Conservatives. A state visit by US President Donald Trump and a by-election in Peterborough will also take place that same week.

"Sarah Hanson-Young called out a sexist slur yelled at her in parliament last year Australian women in politics have had enough. A slew of allegations of sexist bullying and misogyny have emerged in recent years, while at the same time the country has steadily tumbled down the global rankings for female political representation. Australia has tended to favour ""larrikin"" and ""aggressor"" MPs who thrive in the ""rough-and-tumble"" atmosphere of Canberra. But women MPs are increasingly saying that's a culture in dire need of change. As the country prepares to go to the polls on Saturday, the BBC looks at what's come to be known as the ""women problem"" in Australian politics. Sarah Hanson-Young was 25 when she won a seat in Australia's Senate in 2007, the youngest woman ever to do so. The Greens member has always been a forthright voice on progressive issues and women's rights, but she has spoken extensively about how this was against a backdrop of mutterings from male opponents ""about my dress, my body, and my supposed sex life"". She had largely ignored them, choosing the well-trodden path of rising above it all. But an exchange in parliament last year proved the final straw. It happened during a debate on women's safety followinga murder which shocked the nation. A young comedian walking home late at night had been killed by a stranger. Ms Hanson-Young said women wouldn't need extra protection if men didn't rape them. In response, an older male senator called out: ""You should stop shagging men, Sarah."" Liberal Democrat Senator David Leyonhjelm - known for revelling in his controversial remarks - refused to apologise when confronted by Ms Hanson-Young, who is divorced with a child. He instead repeated his comments and other explicit claims in TV and radio interviews. He accused her of hypocrisy. She accused him of ""slut-shaming"" - where slurs about a women's alleged sexual activities are used to demean or silence her. Ms Hanson-Young said her 11-year-old daughter was asked at school whether her mum had ""lots of boyfriends"". Tony Abbott was criticised for standing in front of controversial protest signs while opposition leader in 2011 ""I decided at that moment I'd had enough of men in that place using sexism and sexist slurs, sexual innuendo as part of their intimidation and bullying on the floor of the parliament,"" the senator said in a later interview. She is suing Mr Leyonhjelm for defamation, on the grounds that he had attacked her character by suggesting she was a hypocrite and a misandrist (man-hater), and by repeatedly accusing her of making the claim that all men were rapists. Mr Leyonhjelm has consistently denied defaming her. Ms Hanson-Young says she took the action because she is in a powerful enough position to do so whereas many women who encounter such comments at work are not. ""If we can't clean it up in our nation's parliament, well, where can we do it?"" Australian politics is known to be rambunctious, with plain speaking considered a national trait. But female lawmakers say the comments and treatment they receive can often be explicitly gendered in nature, can border on abuse or intimidation and do not happen to their male counterparts. When one woman sensationally quit the ruling Liberal-led government last year, she sparked something of a groundswell revolt. Australia, a hotspot of political coups, had just witnessed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's ousting by party rivals. Julia Banks felt she had to act after experiencing the vicious infighting. Julia Banks stands to deliver her resignation speech, prompting government MPs to leave the chamber She pointed the finger at the ""scourge of cultural and gender bias,external, bullying and intimidation"" saying: ""Women have suffered in silence for too long."" She was later backed up by other women in the government, including the party's deputy Julie Bishop who described ""appalling"" behaviour. One female senator threatened to name bullies, while the Minister for Women Kelly O'Dwyer confirmed allegations of bullying and intimidation. Julie Bishop, Australia's most powerful female MP in recent years, criticised ""appalling"" behaviour The Liberal women have scotched suggestions that they're just not up to the ""rough-and-tumble"" of politics, as one of their male colleagues put it. ""The hallmark characteristics of the Australian womanâ¦ are resilience and a strong authentic independent spirit,"" blazed Ms Banks as she moved to the crossbench. For her, it's proof that it's time for parliamentary culture to change. And that the only way to do that is ""equal representation of men and women in this parliament"". When it comes to gender diversity, Australia's parliament is flagging. Women - crucially, excluding indigenous Australians and most women of colour - first won the right to run in federal elections in 1902. But it took four decades - and 29 other countries do it first - before Australian women would actually win seats. They have always won more in the Senate because, say experts, it uses proportional voting by state - whereas the lower house has distinct electorates. The current parliament has reached an all-time high for percentage of women MPs. But when it comes to its international standing, Australia has fallen behind. In the past 20 years it's slumped from 15th in the world to 50th for parliamentary gender diversity. Overall, that's partly due to a lack of pressure on both parties, says Dr Jill Sheppard, a political scientist at the Australian National University. A recent Australian Broadcasting Corporation survey,externalfound significant support among women - though not men - for measures to improve the deficit. Labor has such a mechanism. It introduced an affirmative action quota in 1994 and is now close to 50% representation - about double the proportion of women in the government. At Saturday's election, women will contest 31% of its safe seats,according to election analyst Ben Raue,external. The Liberal-National coalition may even see a dip in female representation, some analysts say. The coalition has put up women in only 16% of its safe seats, Mr Raue says. ""The Liberal Party is the drag here,"" says Dr Sheppard, when asked about the nation's fall in global diversity rankings. She says the party tends to view its successful women ""as almost unicorns - tremendous women who can't be replicated"". The party is seeking parity by 2025, but it is ideologically resistant to the idea of mandatory quotas and wants change to happen more organically. ""We don't want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse,"" said party leader and Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, in a speech on International Women's Day. He drew considerable criticism for the remarks, which were seen as implying men shouldn't lose out to allow women to move up. This is not a new issue for women in Canberra. Natasha Stott Despoja joined parliament in 1995 at age 26, when women made up just 14% of the room. Natasha Stott Despoja with her baby in her parliamentary office In her 13 years as a senator, during which she became leader of the Australian Democrats, sexism was ""endemic"" in the political culture, she says. ""It ranged from male senators saying to me 'you really should wear skirts' to another senator referring to me only as 'mother' once I had children,"" she told the BBC. After leaving parliament, she went on to be Australia's representative advancing women's rights around the world. She observed other nations' progress while watching the harassment continue at home. ""The single biggest disappointment for me has been the slow pace of change,"" she says. Many thought Australia had turned a corner when Julia Gillard became the first female prime minister in 2010. Ms Gillard achieved many reforms in a tough three years of minority government. But her seizure of the top job - ousting Kevin Rudd in a party coup - haunted her reputation and public legitimacy. Julia Gillard in her final speech as PM in 2013 after losing a leadership contest Opponents and some media regularly portrayed her as a Lady Macbeth figure - a characterisation that invokes latent fears about ambitious women. Debate over policies like a contentious carbon tax often degenerated into personal and gendered attacks. She was ""routinely demonised"" for being unmarried and ""childless"" in office, say Associate Prof Cheryl Collier from the University of Windsor and Associate Prof Tracey Raney from Ryerson University, both in Canada. Such terms ""are rarely if ever used to describe male heads of state"", they say in a 2018 report which compared the treatment of women MPs in Australia, UK and Canada. Throughout her time in power the prime minister was called by her critics and opponents: ""a lying cow"" ""a menopausal monster"" ""deliberately barren"" a ""bitch"" and ""Ju-liar"" The fixation with her appearance at times was unashamedly lewd - a Liberal party fundraising dinner included a ""Julia Gillard"" menu item with explicit references to parts of her body. It also descended into violent imagery - one TV commentator said Australians ""ought to be out there kicking her to death"". Another high-profile radio host said she should be ""put into a chaff bag and thrown into the sea"". The academics suggest the vitriol was so intense because Ms Gillard challenged the Australian stereotype of a good leader. ""Even women who have reached the top of the political ladder are working within an institution that privileges masculinity,"" say Prof Collier and Prof Raney. In 2012, Ms Gillard confronted the sexist, misogynistic attacks in a searing speech in parliament. It reverberated around the world, and to this day girls in Young Labor can quote it like a chant. This video can not be played Julia Gillard accuses Tony Abbott of a long history of misogyny and sexism But in her final speech as prime minister, after she had been removed by her party, she was stoic about the impact her gender had had on her time in office. ""It doesn't explain everything, it doesn't explain nothing, it explains some things. And it is for the nation to think in a sophisticated way about those shades of grey."" So is the problem just how things are done in parliament, or is it a wider issue about Australian culture? It's telling that the most senior female politicians in the past decade - Ms Gillard from Labor and Julie Bishop, a former Liberal deputy - do not have children. In a country the size of Australia, parliamentary life for MPs based far from Canberra is especially taxing on families, a challenge which tends to be particularly hard for women to overcome. In the past year, several MPs - including Ms O'Dwyer but also a male MP - left parliament saying the job was incompatible with family life. Minister for Women Kelly O'Dwyer (carrying the baby) quit politics in January But Dr Sonia Palmieri, a gender politics researcher at the50/50 by 2030 Foundation,external- which wants to ""achieve gender parity in leadership"" - says unacknowledged bias remains the fundamental problem. ""Our system always seems to assume that our political actors are gender neutral - when in fact they revolve around standards which are masculine and of course that excludes and shuts out women,"" she says. Dr Palmieri argues this is partly because of specific notions of good political leadership in Australia. She suggests there are roughly two types of accepted leader styles. The first is the idea of the ""larrikin"" politician, a unique Australian term for a boisterous person - usually a man - whose bad behaviour is excused as disregard for convention. Former prime ministers Bob Hawke and Gough Whitlam were known for their 'big' personalities Larrikins are seen as endearing in Australian culture, argues Dr Palmieri. There remains a cultural fascination with leaders such Prime Minister Bob Hawke - who could famously down a beer in seconds, and joked that the nation's workers deserved a day off after a landmark sporting victory. The second accepted leader is the aggressor - the acerbic politician revered for their ability to cut down the other side in parliamentary debate. Prime ministers such as Paul Keating and Tony Abbott were noted for their attacking rhetoric in parliamentary debates although their styles widely differed. Gillard's successor, Tony Abbott, often displayed his sporty masculinity Larrikins and aggro fit within the wider stereotypes of Australian identity, says political researcher Blair Williams from the Australian National University. ""We have these models of football players, surf lifesavers, that sort of blokey masculinity that someone like Tony Abbott definitely displayed. But it leaves women out."" Aggression and even ambition are seen as unbecoming in women, says Dr Palmieri. She too points to Ms Gillard, who was not only attacked for how she attained power - despite previous male leaders having seized control that way - but then wasn't given the opportunity to show a different model of leadership to the public. Julia Gillard made a point of visiting a pub while campaigning for election in 2010 Some have also pointed out double standards in the treatment of Emma Husar, a Labor MP forced to resign last year after a news story made a salacious sexual harassment claim. The report broke mistreatment claims, but focused on the MP's sex life. Ms Husar, a single mother, later said the ""slut-shaming smears"" ended her career. Her party asked her to step down less than two days after the report, she said. A subsequent Labor investigation found no evidence of sexual harassment, but said ""complaints that staff were subjected to unreasonable managementâ¦ have merit"".

Dr Sheppard says both major parties are held back by traditional assumptions about women. Party organisers fast-track men to office while ""throwing obstacles in the path of women candidates"", she says. ""They're not doing it deliberately, rather they're acting on decades of ingrained behaviour and what they're used to."" Men are just seen as the safer option. However, her research shows that women are very electable. Her survey of more than 2,000 Australians in 2018 found that when other markers were equal, women candidates were actually more popular than men. She refers to Scandinavian countries when she suggests that women in politics will become normalised once levels reach 30-40%. This is already the case for Labor, she says, while the Liberal party ""has another 20 years to go"". ""We're not there yet, but what we are seeing in Australia is quite rapid generational shift. ""I hope in 15 to 20 years, it won't even be talked about as an issue."" Does this give hope to young women aspiring to enter politics? In her school years Megan Stevens, 19 harboured ambitions of a career in parliament and is now studying politics at the University of Melbourne. The sexism in Canberra has been off-putting for young women like Megan who are interested in politics But increasingly she feels that she would be ""more comfortable"" working behind the scenes as a political staffer. ""How they treated Julia Gillard really put me off,"" she says. The same goes for Liliana Tai, the University of Sydney student union president and a debating champion who interned at parliament over the summer. She says pursuing a career in ""real"" politics is an almost overwhelming prospect. Ms Tai fears that the cultural change needed to allow someone like her, a young, Chinese-Australian woman, to become an elected representative ""may not be achieved in our lifetime"". ""People think of leaders as what they're familiar with and what they know and historically that's been predominantly male, predominantly Anglo people,"" she says. Liliana Tai is the student union president at the University of Sydney She believes that both parties still cater towards stereotypes in selecting candidates. ""I think they fixate so much on electability that they prioritise what they think people want and that leads to a pernicious cycle of not having change."" ""But you need to be a bit brave, and go out on a limb and give that new person a chance."" Last year, the failed leadership bid by the government's most powerful woman, Julie Bishop, proved to Ms Tai that merit isn't enough. Ms Bishop was deputy to four successive male party leaders over 11 years. An MP for two decades, she also served as Australia's first female foreign minister. Julie Bishop (in white) has long featured on the front bench of Liberal coalition government But she resigned from the front bench last year after losing a leadership battle to Scott Morrison. Her prospects were dashed by colleagues who tactically voted to keep another man out. The Australian Financial Review called her: ""The female Prime Minister who never was"". On the day of her resignation, she wore scarlet heels. Ms Bishop donated her famous pair of heels to a democracy museum Whatever the politics of the events, a photograph of the lavish shoes, amid a sea of brogues and dark suits, became an iconic image of a lone woman cut out of power. Australia's Museum of Democracy later exhibited the shoes, along with the photo, which they said were ""a bold statement and a symbol of solidarity and empowerment among Australian women"". Ms Tai says she also took some hope from Ms Bishop's departure. She mentions her final parliamentary speech, where the outgoing MP said public office was ""one of the highest callings"". ""I really resonated with that because that's what I believe too,"" says Ms Tai. ""Being in parliament is still the best way to represent people and bring about change.""
