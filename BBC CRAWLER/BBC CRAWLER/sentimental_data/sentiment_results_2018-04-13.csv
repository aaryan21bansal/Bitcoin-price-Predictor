"This is what you will hear at the National Gallery's blockbuster Monet and Architecture exhibition, which opened to the public this week: ""Excuse me."" ""Excuse me."" ""Excuse me."" ""Can I justâ¦"" ""Sorry."" ""Ouch!"" It is the sound art-lovers make when gathered en masse in a confined space full of eye-popping pictures by one of the finest painters to have ever picked up a brush. Call it the Monet Mumble: the polite but insistent whispers uttered by well-dressed ladies and gentleman making their way around packed galleries. Much has been made about the amount of money the National Gallery is charging punters for the privilege of seeing its Monet show while having their toes trodden on (I was on the receiving end twice, and the apologetic perpetrator once). If you have the audacity to go for the 'Admission Only' option and ignore the explicit and assumed 'suggested' Â£2 donation, tickets purchased online for those over 11 years old cost Â£18 during the week and Â£20 at the weekend (they are Â£2 more if bought in the gallery). That works out at around 25p a painting (there are 78 in the show). Value for money, you could argue. Particularly when you take into account the ever-increasing costs incurred by museums when putting on such ambitious, 'once-in-a-lifetime' exhibitions. That said, there must be scope to be a bit more innovative and flexible on pricing when planning a sure-fire box office smash, which will be too pricey for too many (e.g. students, families with teenagers, the currently unemployed, low paid workers). The gallery has clearly thought about the visitor experience. Houses of Parliament, Sunset (Le Parlement, coucher de soleil), 1900-1 For the first time, there are no wall texts beside the paintings, just a number, which you then refer to in the small booklet that comes with your ticket. The upshot is rooms full of earnest, bespectacled faces peering down at this bijou publication like race-goers studying the formbook at the Grand National. From time-to-time we look up and cross-reference text with picture, before an ""excuse me"" and move on. It is a better system than having mini essays by pictures, which causes large huddles of people to gather to the side of paintings like giant barnacles. But I'd prefer a half-way house that had a sparse wall caption stating the artwork's date and title, and a booklet for the details. As for the show itself, wellâ¦ The Grand Canal, Venice, 1908 It is very good. Although the title is misleading. Monet had no formal interest in architecture. Canaletto painted architecture. You could argue Ed Ruscha paints architecture. But not Monet. Never Monet. His concern was with the immaterial. Monet only ever really painted two things, both of which are as ephemeral as a snap-chat. His subjects were light and air. The Water-Lily Pond (Le Bassin aux nympheas), Giverny, 1899 ""Other painters paint a bridge, a house, a boat"" he once said, ""I want to paint the air that surrounds the bridge, the house, the boat - the beauty of light in which they exist."" Yes, there are buildings in every one of the paintings on show at the National Gallery. Sometimes - as is the case with his spectacular depictions of the medieval faÃ§ade of Rouen Cathedral - the same building many times over. But Monet is not exploring its architectural characteristics. For him it is a superficial motif: a compelling surface on which light falls to create an all-enveloping ""atmosphere"". Rouen Cathedral: The Portal (Morning Effect), Normandy, 1894 He painted the same faÃ§ade from the same spot dozens of times in the early 1890s. Not to show the intricate details of every nook and cranny, but to capture how the changing light and weather conditions physically altered the 'impression' of what he saw. ""Colour, a single colour, lasts a second, sometimes three or four minutes at most. What can one do, can one paint, in three or four minutes?"" He said to the dealer RenÃ© Gimpel. Monet was the ultimate Impressionist; an on-the-spot improviser reacting to Nature's every move, however small. Buildings were useful to him in terms of providing a compositional structure, a consistent reference point, and a means of evoking mood. As you can see in Snow Effect at Giverny (1893), which is an utterly wonderful, beautifully rendered psychological depiction of a rural landscape covered in snow. Snow Effect at Giverny (Effet de neige a Giverny), 1893 It is not a literal account of what was before the artist, nor is it of what he felt about what he saw (that was Van Gogh's shtick); it is a sensational interpretation of the experience of looking at that particular moment: a manifestation in oil paint on canvas of Monet's senses reporting back live from the scene. His best paintings, of which there are several examples in this show, have an almost electric sense of immediacy. The Doge's Palace (Le Palais ducal), Venice, 1908 Whether it is Normandy, the Netherlands, the Mediterranean coast, or Venice - he takes you there in an instant. If you can afford the ticket price and don't mind crowded spaces (there's still plenty of room to see the paintings and no sense of being rushed through), I would thoroughly recommend you see this show. You will meet a Monet you know and one that you don't. You'll see how he progressed from Courbet-type realism in his early twenties into a dare-devil picture-maker who changed the way we look at our world. Nobody thought about art in the way he did: ""When you go out to paint, try to forget what objects you have before you, a tree, a house, a field or whatever. Merely think, here is a little square of blue, here an oblong of pink, here a streak of yellow, and paint it just as it looks to you, the exact colour and shape, until it gives your own naÃ¯ve impression of the scene before you.""

"This video can not be played Frances Carroll before and after her weight loss One in eight middle-aged adults in the UK could have a potentially serious form of liver disease - because they are overweight. Scans of nearly 3,000 individuals from the UK Biobank research project showed that 12% had inflamed, fatty livers. The British Liver Trust said the ""very alarming"" findings were a 'wake-up call' because the condition can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and death. Hepatologists said there was a silent epidemic of fatty liver disease. This is especially worrying because symptoms often do not emerge until permanent damage is done - but the condition is reversible if caught in time. Frances Carroll, aged 52, from Oxford, was told she had fatty liver disease seven years ago. At the time she weighed over 18 stone (116 kilos). She lost 7 stone, and went down from a size 22 to a 12. Frances said: ""I was shocked when I was told my liver was diseased, but determined to do something about it. I started by eating more healthily and then combined that with physical activity - I'm delighted my liver is back to normal."" Frances now teaches fitness classes and does nutrition coaching. She said: ""Back in 2011 I would not have believed that I would end up as a personal trainer. I used to get out of breath when I walked any distance - now I run up hills!"" And she has had a new type of MRI scan which has showed her liver is healthy again. The results of the MRI scanning study, led by scientists in Oxford, were announced at the International Liver Congress in Paris. They were made possible by an innovative software analysis tool called LiverMultiScan, developed by Perspectum Diagnositics, a spin-out company from the University of Oxford. Dr Rajarshi Banerjee, CEO of Perspectum Diagnostics said: ""LiverMultiScan is a great example of a smart health technology discovered and developed by UK clinicians and scientists with clear benefits for patients, the NHS, and taxpayers. ""Whilst liver biopsy remains an important part of hepatology practice, clearly we need better non-invasive tools at our disposal to evaluate the nature and severity of liver disease."" Frances is now a personal trainer An inflamed liver in red on the left and a healthy liver in green on the right Needle biopsies are the gold standard for assessing liver disease, but they are costly, invasive, painful and carry some health risks. The software tool can be used in any MRI scanner but is not yet in routine clinical practice. Southampton General is the first NHS hospital to use the new system outside of research. David Breen, associate professor of radiology at University Hospital Southampton believes it could reduce the need for biopsies. He said: ""The scan gives a map of the entire liver as opposed to a needle-core biopsy which samples just one area and can be unpleasant. ""It also allows us to re-scan patients over time and see if they improve."" Going from a size 22 to a 12 has meant Frances no longer has fatty liver disease Previous studies had suggested that around one in 20 adults might have the potentially serious form of fatty liver disease known as NASH (non-alcoholic steatophepatitis). This is where there is inflammation in and around the liver cells liver which, over time, can can lead to the build up of scar tissue known as fibrosis - eventually this can lead to cirrhosis. But the scanning study suggests the proportion could be much higher. Steve Ryder, consultant liver specialist in Nottingham said: ""This study accords with what we are seeing on the ground - a lot of people are coming to hospital with significant liver disease because they are overweight."" Ninety per cent of liver disease is reversible if caught in time. Judi Rhys, chief executive of the British Liver Trust said: ""Reducing alcohol is important which most people already know, but for fatty liver disease the key things are having a healthy weight and doing exercise.""

"Steven Pladl, 42, and his biological daughter Katie Rose Pladl, 20 A US man in an incest case has reportedly killed his biological daughter, their child, and the girl's adopted father, before killing himself. The murder-suicide by Steven Pladl spanned three states, authorities told local media. North Carolina police began a search for Pladl, 42, after his mother called police, saying her son had confessed to the killings. Katie Pladl and her adoptive father, Anthony Fusco, were later found dead. Incest case as US woman has baby 'by dad' Police in New Milford, Connecticut, found the bodies of Ms Pladl, 20, and Mr Fusco, 56, in a truck that had its windows shot out on Thursday morning. The suspect was later found in upstate Dover, New York, in a minivan, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound,WTVR-TV reports,external. Katie and her adoptive father were found shot to death inside a truck in Connecticut Last January the father and daughter were arrested in Virginia and charged with incest. Katie Pladl reconnected with her biological parents at the age of 18 through social media. She became pregnant shortly after moving in with them. Pladl's wife - Katie's biological mother - moved out, telling police he planned to wed their daughter. In March, Pladl was released from jail on bail, on condition he not make contact with his biological daughter. According to a 911 call obtained byWTIC-News,external, his mother called to report he had admitted the killings to her. ""My son just called me. He told me... he killed his baby and he's in the house,"" she tearfully told emergency officials. US mother jailed for marrying daughter ""He killed his wife. He killed her father. I can't even believe this is happening."" She added that ""his wife broke up with him yesterday over the phone"". Pladl's mother had been granted custody of her son's seven-month-old son, Bennett, as part of his bail agreement. The day before the murders, he picked up his son from her, saying he planned to take the child to New York to see his mother. Police in Knightdale, North Carolina, discovered the infant's body on Thursday. Knightdale Police Chief Lawrence Capps said: ""We are heartbroken, and saddened over the death of this child and like you, we are trying to make sense of all the factors that led up to this senseless taking of life."" Chief Capps added that Pladl had driven to New York ""for the specific purpose of making some confrontations"". Pladl's lawyer Rick Friedman told WNCN-TV in North Carolina that Mr Fusco and Ms Pladl were shot, and ""then Steven took his own life"". ""This is a terrible tragedy that nobody foresaw,"" Mr Friedman said. ""I really believe that if the judges or the prosecutor or the defence attorneys in this case had any clue that the minor child or anyone would be harmed there would not be a bond set for any of the parties,"" added Mr Friedman.

"A businessman fighting for the ""right to be forgotten"" has won a UK High Court action against Google. The man, who has not been named due to reporting restrictions surrounding the case, wanted search results about a past crime he had committed removed from the search engine. The judge, Mr Justice Mark Warby, ruled in his favour on Friday. But he rejected a separate claim made by another businessman who had committed a more serious crime. The businessman who won his case was convicted 10 years ago of conspiring to intercept communications. He spent six months in jail. The other businessman, who lost his case, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiring to account falsely. He spent four years in jail. Both had ordered Google to remove search results about their convictions, including links to news articles, stating that they were no longer relevant. They took Google to court when it refused to remove the search results. Google said it would accept the rulings. ""We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest,"" it said in a statement. ""We are pleased that the Court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgements they have made in this case."" The right to be forgotten is a legal precedent set by the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2014, following a case brought by Spaniard Mario Costeja Gonzalez who had asked Google to remove information about his financial history. Google says it has removed 800,000 pages from its results following so-called ""right to be forgotten"" requests. However, search engines can decline to remove pages if they judge them to remain in the public interest. Explaining the decisions made on Friday, the judge said one of the men had continued to ""mislead the public"" while the other had ""shown remorse"". The Open Rights Group, which campaigns for internet freedoms, said the rulings set a ""legal precedent"". ""The right to be forgotten is meant to apply to information that is no longer relevant but disproportionately impacts a person,"" said Jim Killock, executive director. ""The Court will have to balance the public's right to access the historical record, the precise impacts on the person, and the public interest.""

Tom Evans and Kate James will ask the Court of Appeal on Monday to allow Alfie Evans to continue treatment. A date to withdraw life support had been set but his parents hope to transfer him to a hospital in Italy. Mr Evans said he had tried to discharge Alfie from Alder Hey Children's Hospital but was stopped by police. Mr Evans, 21, and Ms James, 20, from Liverpool, want to take Alfie to a hospital in Rome and say they have a private ambulance and jet on stand-by. Speaking outside Alder Hey on Friday, Mr Evans said he had been told he could face prison if he removes Alfie. He said there are police officers on the ward to stop him taking his son. This video can not be played Protesters have gathered at Alder Hey Children's Hospital He said they had ""attempted to discharge"" Alfie from Alder Hey ""by formally withdrawing their duty of care"" on Thursday. But he said the ""alarm was pulled and police were alerted"" and within 15 or 20 minutes there were three police officers at Alfie's bedside. ""If he stays here and dies, he dies, if he goes and he dies at least he has died a hero, trying,"" he said. A spokesman for the hospital said: ""Alfie's clinical condition is truly heart rending but at each stage of the legal process which has to be followed in such cases, the courts have agreed with the treating team and the independent expert advisers instructed by the trust and the family that Alfie's condition is irreversible and untreatable. ""All treatable conditions have been diagnosed. ""All the experts agree that it will not assist Alfie to subject him to further tests in order to identify a diagnosis."" Allow Twitter content?

On Thursday,hundreds of people protested outside Alder Hey Children's Hospital, where Alfie has been treated since December 2016. Some protesters returned to the hospital on Friday afternoon. In February, Mr Justice Hayden ruled doctors could stop treating Alfie against the wishes of his parents following hearings in the Family Division of the High Court in London and Liverpool. On Wednesday, the judge said Alfie's undiagnosed degenerative brain disease was ""profoundly unfair"", as the court endorsed an end-of-life care plan drawn up by specialists. The judge said details of that plan could not be revealed because the toddler was entitled to privacy. The Christian Legal Centre, which is representing Mr Evans and Ms James, said its counsel argued ""the ancient right of habeas corpus"" at the hearing on Wednesday, which ""requires a court to show a valid reason for a person's detention"". The centre said Mr Justice Hayden was unable to rule on the issue of parental rights and so Alfie's parents asked for an urgent appeal, which will be heard on Monday. Appeal court officials said an appeal court judge had decided that Alfie should continue to receive treatment pending Monday's hearing. His parents want to move him to Rome's Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital, which has links to the Vatican, where his palliative care would continue. The Pope previously tweeted his support for Alfie, saying he hoped the ""deep suffering"" of the toddler's parents would be heard. In December, the family said Bambino Gesuwould give Alfie a tracheotomy and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) to allow him to be fed through his stomach. But Alder Hey's hospital trust argues that Bambino Gesu has a similar belief that care for Alfie should be palliative. The couple have lost cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal, and had their case rejected by the Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights. In a post on Alfie's Army Official Facebook page, the family thanked supporters but also referred to some negativity and ""trolls"". 9 May 2016: Alfie is born December 2016: Alfie is first taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital after suffering seizures 11 December 2017: Hospital bosses say they are ""liaising directly"" with the youngster's family following disagreements over his treatment 19 December: A High Court judge, Mr Justice Hayden, begins overseeing the case.

"Michael Cohen works as a lawyer for President Donald Trump US President Donald Trump's top lawyer is under criminal investigation, the US justice department has announced. Prosecutors say they are focusing on Michael Cohen's business dealings rather than his work as a lawyer. Mr Cohen has been under investigation for months, the court filing says. The filing was in response to efforts by Mr Cohen's own lawyer to stop prosecutors reviewing material seized from Mr Cohen's office on Monday. Mr Cohen's team argues that the papers are covered by the attorney-client privilege. President Trump has condemned the office raid, calling it ""disgraceful"" and ""an attack on our country"".

During a court hearing in New York on Friday, prosecutor Tom McKay accused Mr Cohen of trying to use attorney-client privilege ""as a sword to challenge the government's ability to review evidence"". Trump hits out at 'disgraceful' FBI raid Why the raid on Trump's lawyer is a big deal Government prosecutors also said they believed Mr Cohen had ""a low volume of potentially privileged communication"" because he seems to only have one client - President Trump. ""It is neither apparent that Cohen, in his capacity as an attorney, has many, or any, attorney-client relationships other than with President Donald Trump,"" the filing said. It added that while Mr Cohen was an attorney, ""he also has several other business interests and sources of income"", and is ""being investigated for criminal conduct that largely centres on his personal business dealings"". A new lawyer for President Trump, Joanna Hendon, said the president had an ""acute interest"" in the case. Ms Hendon, who was hired on Wednesday, asked the judge to adjourn the session so she had more time to prepare. According toa New York Times report,external, the president phoned Mr Cohen to ""check in"" on him today. Lawyers tend to advise clients not to discuss investigations - which means their discussion could cause them problems, depending on what they talked about. Joanna Hendon, left, said President Trump hired her firm on Wednesday In a separate development, Mr Cohen reportedly negotiated a $1.6 million settlement with a former Playboy model on behalf of a Republican fundraiser, according toa Wall Street Journal article,external. Elliott Broidy, a Los Angeles investor, acknowledged ""a consensual relationship"" with the Playmate, who became pregnant. Mr Broidy said it was ""unfortunate"" that the personal matter was ""the subject of national discussion"" because of the involvement of Mr Cohen. The investor was previously in the news afterhe urged President Trump to sack then-Secretary of State Rex Tillersonover a diplomatic dispute. The president and the porn star: Why this matters Mr Cohen has admitted to have paid a porn actress, Stormy Daniels,$130,000 before the 2016 US presidential election. Ms Daniels claims she had an affair with Mr Trump, and he and his lawyers made attempts to buy her silence. The president denies the alleged relationship.

"US President Donald Trump has pardoned former Vice-President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, who was convicted of lying about leaks to the media. Lewis Libby, known as Scooter, was found guilty in 2007 following an investigation into the unauthorised disclosure of a CIA agent's identity. The White House said Libby was ""fully worthy of this pardon"". ""I don't know Mr Libby,"" said Mr Trump, ""but for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly. ""Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life."" Libby (right) was at Mr Cheney's side in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks Libby was found guilty of perjury, obstruction of justice, and making false statements following an investigation into a leak that revealed the name of CIA agent Valerie Plame. His trial heard that Bush administration officials wanted to get back at Ms Plame's husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson. Mr Wilson had written a 2003 New York Times op-ed accusing Mr Cheney of doctoring pre-war intelligence on Iraq. Libby was charged with lying to investigators about his contacts with reporters, but he maintained he simply misremembered the sequence of events. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison and fined $250,000 (Â£175,000). But his sentence was commuted by then-President George W Bush. Ms Plame and her husband, Joe Wilson, at a 2006 news conference In an interview on Friday with MSNBC, Ms Plame condemned Mr Trump's decision to pardon Libby. ""My personal sense is that I didn't think my contempt for Donald Trump could go lower, but he surprises me each and every day,"" she said. ""It's very clear that this is a message he is sending, that you can commit crimes against national security and you will be pardoned,"" she added. Ms Plame has previously said her career as a CIA agent was finished ""in an instant"" once her identity was leaked. She told the BBC in 2007 that ""treason"" had been committed in pursuit of political retribution. Mr Cheney told the New York Times,externalMr Libby is ""one of the most capable, principled and honourable men I have ever known. ""He is innocent and he and his family have suffered for years because of his wrongful conviction. I am gratedful that President Trump righted this wrong..."" On Friday, Democrats charged Mr Trump with hypocrisy for pardoning a man who leaked to the media, despite the president's condemnation of such disclosures in his White House. Mr Trump's decision came on the same day that he savaged former FBI Director James Comey as a ""proven LEAKER & LIAR"". Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff tweeted: ""This is the President's way of sending a message to those implicated in the Russia investigation: You have my back and I'll have yours."" Trump goes to war with 'un-American' leakers Six claims about Trump in Comey book Mr Cheney had pressured Mr Bush to pardon Libby in the final days of his presidency. But Mr Cheney's badgering reached the point where Mr Bush reportedly told his aides his vice-president was beginning to annoy him. After consulting White House lawyers, Mr Bush decided it was best not to issue a pardon. When he finally told Mr Cheney about his decision, Mr Cheney snapped at him, saying: ""You are leaving a good man wounded on the field of battle."" ""The comment stung,"" Mr Bush would write in his memoirs. ""In eight years, I had never seen Dick like this, or even close to this. ""I worried that the friendship we had built was about to be severely strained, at best."" Key players in the 2007 CIA leak probe,external Protesters rally against White House leaks in 2005 Libby's pardon amounts to official forgiveness for his crime, but does not equate to exoneration or finding that he was innocent. Presidential pardons can overturn consequences of a conviction such as being denied the right to carry out jury service, vote or run for political office. Since the conviction, Libby has already had his law license reinstated. And former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell restored his voting rights in 2013. This is the third time Mr Trump has issued a pardon. In August last year, he did so for former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of criminal contempt over his crackdown on undocumented immigrants. Last month he pardoned Kristian Saucier, a Navy sailor who took photos of classified areas inside a US submarine and served a year in federal prison. Can Trump stop the leaks to US media?

"Russian intelligence agencies targeted poison victim Yulia Skripal's email account as early as 2013, the UK's national security adviser has said. In a letter to Nato, Sir Mark Sedwill also said Russia trained ""special units"" to use nerve agents, including applying them to door handles. Police said a nerve agent was found on Yulia's father Sergei Skripal's front door in Salisbury. The Russian government has denied any involvement in the 4 March attack. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Poisoned ex-spy's daughter leaves hospital Who is Sergei Skripal? Inspectors back UK in spy poisoning row The UK says Ms Skripal, 33, and her 66-year-old father, who were found slumped on a park bench in the city on 4 March, were exposed toa nerve agent belonging to the Novichok group. This analysis has been backed by the international chemical weapons watchdog. Mr Skripal remains at Salisbury District Hospital, while his daughter was discharged on Monday. Sir Mark's letter to Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg,externalis the first time the UK government has claimed to have specific information that the Russians were interested in the Skripal family. ""We have information indicating Russian intelligence service interest in the Skripals dating back at least as far as 2013,"" he said. ""Email accounts belonging to Yulia Skripal were targeted by GRU cyber specialists,"" he said, referring to Russia's foreign military intelligence agency. The letter accuses Russia of testing assassination methods with chemical weapons, including using nerve agents smeared on to door handles. Police say traces of a Novichok nerve agent have been found at sites across Salisbury at low concentrations following the attack - with thehighest concentration found on the door handle of Mr Skripal's front door.

But the details contained in the letter do not identify the exact culprits behind the poison attack. Sir Mark said it was ""highly likely"" people such as Mr Skripal, who was exchanged in a spy swap in 2010 after being convicted of passing information to the UK, may be regarded as ""legitimate targets"" for ""state-sponsored assassination"" by Russia. He said the UK government continued ""to judge that only Russia has the technical means, operational experience and motive for the attack on the Skripals and that it is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible"". ""There is no plausible alternative explanation,"" he added. The letter also claims President Vladimir Putin was closely involved in the Russian chemical weapons programme in the mid-2000s, and that it was ""highly unlikely"" any former Soviet republic other than Russia pursued chemical weapons after independence. The Russian embassy has published an 8,000-word report on the Skripal case, including a timeline and details of the British response. The report accuses the British government of isolating the Skripals, concealing evidence and preventing an independent investigation. It also says the UK is using ""the same script, but in fast forward mode"" as it did on the case of Alexander Litvinenko - the former Russian agent poisoned in London in 2006. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said around 250 detectives were working on the Salisbury investigation. She said they would do everything to establish the facts and ""if at all possible"" bring those responsible to justice. Ex-spy's daughter leaves hospital What happened to the Skripals?

Antonio Guterres also warned about the dangers of escalation over Syria. The US and its allies are considering launching missile strikes against Syria after a suspected chemical attack, an action which Russia - whose forces are there supporting the government- has said would risk starting a war. Russia has accused the UK of faking an attack, an allegation Britain dismissed as a ""grotesque, blatant lie"". The Cold War, which followed the Allied victory in World War Two, saw the US and its allies facing off for decades with the Soviet Union, of which Russia is the main successor state. Why is the West considering strikes? Syria crisis: Your questions answered Firepower of key countries Corbyn: PM waiting for Trump on Syria Mr Guterres delivered his warnings at the opening of a bad-tempered UN Security Council meeting. The USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier is on its way to the Middle East ""The Cold War is back with a vengeance, but with a difference,"" he said. ""The mechanisms and the safeguards to manage the risks of escalation that existed in the past no longer seem to be present."" He urged countries to ""act responsibly in these dangerous circumstances"". During the meeting: The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, accused the US of using the suspected chemical attack as a pretext to overthrow the Assad government and ""contain"" Russia The US ambassador accused Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of using chemical weapons at least 50 times in seven years France's ambassador said Syria had gone ""beyond the point of no return"" and France would ""shoulder its responsibility to end an intolerable threat to our collective security"" The US and France have both said they have proof the Syrian government attacked the Eastern Ghouta town of Douma last Saturday, but neither country has officially given further details. On Friday, US state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: ""We know for a fact that it was a chemical weapon."" When she was asked whether the US had proof the Syrian government was behind the attack, she said: ""Yes."" The suspected attack, in which dozens of people reportedly died, was denied by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. Rescue workers from the Syria Civil Defence and the Syrian American Medical Society, which supports hospitals in rebel-held areas, said victims were found with foam coming out of their mouths, blue skin and lips, and corneal burns.

Syria 'chemical attack': What we know What can Western military intervention achieve? Are we heading for a third world war? The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, told the network: ""We definitely have enough proof but now we just have to be thoughtful in our action."" Control over the town has since passed from rebels to the Syrian and Russian military authorities. A UN report last year found the Syrian government responsible for a deadly chemical attackon the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, in which more than 80 people died. That attack was followed by a US cruise missile attack on a Syrian airbase. A delegation from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will arrive in the area of the suspected attack on Saturday. General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia's defence ministry, said: ""We have... evidence that proves Britain was directly involved in organising this provocation."" In avideo produced by the Russian defence ministry,externaltwo men speaking Arabic say they were working in the casualty ward of Douma's central hospital when they assisted people brought in after the bombing of a multi-storey building. While they are clearly talking about the suspected chemical attack, both say the bombing occurred on Sunday 8 April when it actually occurred on Saturday 7 April. The two men say people were suffering from smoke inhalation, not chemical poisoning, but a panic began when one man said they were victims of a chemical attack. ""This is grotesque, it is a blatant lie, it is some of the worst pieces of fake news we've yet seen from the Russia propaganda machine,"" the UK's UN ambassador, Karen Pierce said. In a statement, the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""This simply shows (Russia's) desperation to pin the blame on anyone but their client: the Assad regime."" In the UK, cabinet ministers agreed it was ""highly likely"" the Syrian government was responsible for the alleged attack and said the use of chemical weapons must not ""go unchallenged"". This video can not be played Trump: Decisions on Syria will be made ""fairly soon"" The US president has said Russian President Vladimir Putin bears responsibility for the alleged attack in Douma because of his support for the Syrian government. On Wednesday he warned Russia that missiles were ""coming"" but later tweeted that he had ""never said when"". It ""could be very soon or not so soon at all"", Donald Trump said,external. What can Macron and Trump do? The significance of Eastern Ghouta's fall Why is there a war in Syria? Before the Security Council meeting, Mr Nebenzia accused Washington of putting international peace at risk. ""The immediate priority is to avert the danger of war,"" he said on Thursday.

"Western powers are believed to be considering air strikes against Syria in response to a suspected chemical attack near Damascus. The White House says it is continuing to assess intelligence and talk to its allies on how to respond while France's President Emmanuel Macron says he will decide ""in due course"" whether to take action. In the UK, Cabinet ministers have agreed the use of chemical weapons in Douma must not ""go unchallenged"". Location of suspected chemical attacks, 7 April The call for action comes after a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Douma, just outside Damascus, on Saturday, which killed dozens of people, according to opposition activists, rescue workers and medics. France's president says he has unspecified proof that the Syrian government attacked the town in the Eastern Ghouta without. Chemical weapons attacks have taken place in Syria before. Last year, the US retaliated with cruise missiles after at least 80 people died in Khan Sheikhoun, ina chemical attack the UN later blamed on the Syrian government. President Bashar al-Assad's government - which receives military backing from Russia - has denied involvement in any chemical attack, calling the reports ""fabricated"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the latest suspected attack was staged by foreign agents. Russia has also warned the US that launching air strikes could spark a war between the two countries. Dozens of people were killed when government aircraft dropped bombs filled with toxic chemicals on the formerly rebel-held town on Saturday, according to Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics. Activists from the Violations Documentation Center (VDC), an opposition network which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, reportedtwo separate incidents of bombs believed to contain toxic substances being dropped by the Syrian Air Force.,external 1) First chemical attack The first alleged incident occurred at approximately 16:00 local time and saw a bakery on Omar Ibn Al-Khattab street in north-western Douma targeted, the VDC said. A rescue worker from the Syria Civil Defence told the organisation he had smelt chlorine in the air after the strike. Patients were hosed down with water ""We later discovered the bodies of people who had suffocated from toxic gases,"" he added. ""They were in closed spaces, sheltering from the barrel bombs, which may have caused their quick death as no-one heard their screams."" 3) Second chemical attack The VDC said the second incident took place on Martyrs' Square - east of the first attack - at approximately 19:30. The Syrian-American Medical Society (Sams) saidmore than 500 people had been found with symptoms ""indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,external"" after the attacks. On Thursday, unnamed US officials said they had obtained blood and urine samples from victims which had tested positive for chlorine and a nerve agent, according to NBC News. Independent chemical weapons inspectors are en route to the Eastern Ghouta area to look for evidence. They are expected to arrive on Saturday. What we know about the attack Why is there a war in Syria? Among other assets,the UShas the guided-missile destroyer the USS Donald Cook in the Mediterranean and the US Navy has a sizeable number of fighter jets on carriers in the Gulf. A strike group, headed by the aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman, is also heading to the Mediterranean, the US Navy has confirmed. In addition, the Americans have long-range subsonic B-52 bombers, which they have deployed and used on targets in the region before. There are also an estimated 2,000 US troops on the ground in Syria, according to the Pentagon.,external Russiahas a contingent of warplanes based in Syria, which it has used in support of the Syrian government. It also has warships and support vessels deployed in the Mediterranean. Some are armed with cruise missiles. Anti-ship missiles stationed in Syria could also attack Western vessels in the Eastern Mediterranean. It could bring into play the advanced, but as yet untested, S-400 air defence system. The multi-layered anti-aircraft system was deployed to Syria after a Russian jet was downed there but has so far only served as a deterrent. How the S-400 system works Steps 1- 4 show how the S-400 system's radar tracks objects, assesses potential threats and launches missiles to destroy the targets. It can guide up to 12 missiles simultaneously, engaging up to six targets at once. The UKhas eight supersonic Tornados stationed in Cyprus and RAF Typhoons have also been operating in the region. The aircraft use Paveway IV laser-guided bombs and Brimstone missiles to target strikes. Britain also has a fleet of unmanned aircraft in the Middle East, including about 10 Reaper drones. The UK's Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft are also available. ForFrance,the frigate Aquitaine, which is equipped with cruise missiles, is currently in the Mediterranean, according to French media. France has also stationed several Mirage and Rafale fighter jets in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. With its nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier undergoing refitting, France has deployed sailors and aviators on board the US aircraft carrier USS George HW Bush for training and joint operations.

"Sir Cliff arrived at the High Court with broadcaster Gloria Hunniford Sir Cliff Richard has broken down in court as he described the ""shocking and upsetting"" BBC television coverage of a police raid on his home in 2014. He is suing the BBC over privacy and said in a witness statement his health suffered ""mentally and physically"". South Yorkshire Police searched the singer's Berkshire apartment after a claim of historical sexual assault. Sir Cliff, 77, was not charged with any offence. The BBC says its coverage was in the public interest. BBC coverage 'invasion of privacy' Cliff Richard case 'likely to have huge impact' Lawyers for Sir Cliff said the BBC decision to name the singer in its report - which featured shots taken from a helicopter showing officers inside his property - caused him ""profound and long-lasting damage"". Giving evidence for more than hour at the High Court, Sir Cliff recalled watching the BBC footage of the August 2014 raid from a hotel in Portugal. He said: ""It wasn't a very pleasant feeling and by that time I had heard of the allegation and seeing it made me feel even worse."" In Sir Cliff's written statement,which has been made available online,externalby his lawyers Simkins, he said:  ""It was shocking and upsetting."" He added: ""My health suffered, both mentally and physically... ""At one point... I actually thought I was going to have a heart attack or stroke."" He said: ""I felt as though everything I had worked for during my life - trying to live as honestly and honourably as I could - was being torn apart. ""I felt forever tainted. I still do."" By Lucy Manning, BBC News Sir Cliff Richard stood in the witness box for what would be an emotional 90 minutes. He was tearful at the start, composed himself but then broke down at the end when he accused the BBC of smearing his name across the world. There was the odd moment of humour when he said rock and roll hadn't been good for his ears as he struggled to hear a question. Listening intently in court were the BBC managers he accuses of invading his privacy. They will give evidence next week. Sir Cliff added he ""never felt right"" in the 22 months it took for prosecutors to say they were not going to be taking further action. ""During the day there was an ever-present knot in my stomach,"" he said. ""I'd wake up in the middle of the night, going over things in my head again and again."" He said he lost a ""considerable amount"" of weight and felt unable to return to the Sunningdale property ""except to pack up my belongings"". ""In my mind it had become contaminated,"" his statement said. ""I didn't feel comfortable there any longer. ""I have in fact been burgled before, and this for me was a worse experience."" He said the police search and subsequent publicity ""not only seriously disrupted my personal life, but also my charitable work and my plans for my professional work"", including an album release and a revised edition of his autobiography. The BBC's barrister, Gavin Millar QC, started his questioning of Sir Cliff by asking about instances where he had used his ""public profile"" to talk about his personal beliefs. While discussing how the coverage had affected his life, Sir Cliff broke down. He said: ""Everywhere I have ever been, I felt my name was smeared. The police didn't do that, the BBC did."" Sir Cliff said to date the case had cost him Â£3.4m, including spending on lawyers and media representatives, and lost business. He is suing the BBC for the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. In his statement, Sir Cliff added he had always held a great deal of respect for the BBC which helped him with his career from the start. However, he said while it was tempting to ""just try to forget the whole episode"", he decided to take action to ""perhaps make it less likely"" that anyone has to go through a similar experience. His lawyers say he is seeking ""very substantial"" damages or compensation for the breach of his rights. Sir Cliff leaving the court with Gloria Hunniford after giving evidence They say BBC journalist Dan Johnson received a tip-off about the investigation from a Metropolitan Police source working in Operation Yewtree, the inquiry into allegations of historical sex offences. The Met Police later passed the allegation, a claim of an offence against a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985, to South Yorkshire Police. Jason Beer QC, for South Yorkshire Police, which paid the singer Â£400,000 to settle a privacy claim, told the court the force had acted unlawfully by confirming Sir Cliff's identity to the BBC and by discussing the search. But he argued the judge, Mr Justice Mann, should rule the BBC contribute to the money it paid the singer because the broadcaster was ""far more causative of the damage suffered"". He also accused Mr Johnson of using ""heavy-handed"" tactics when dealing with officers from the force ahead of the raid. Lawyers representing the BBC have told court the police raid was of ""legitimate public interest"". They said the BBC had been given information about an investigation into a serious criminal offence and had a duty to pass on the information to the public. Mr Millar for the BBC said its journalists had respected Sir Cliff's rights as a ""suspect"" and the ""presumption of innocence"". Addressing the court on the first day of the case, he said ""you have to focus on that point... at which the BBC publish the information and ask whether Sir Cliff had a reasonable expectation of privacy? ""He may have wanted that. But that would not have been a reasonable expectation for somebody in his position.""

"University staff will decide on Tuesday whether to back the deal announced by unions and employers University staff have suspended strikes which were set to hit summer exams after agreeing to fresh pension plans. Planned changes to staff pensions prompted 14 days of strike action at 64 universities in February and March, and more strikes were planned. University employers withdrew plans which the University and College Union (UCU) said would have left members Â£10,000 a year worse off in retirement. Both sides agreed a joint expert panel to re-evaluate the pension scheme. UCU members backed the deal by two to one. The dispute started after employers' group Universities UK (UUK) said it planned to remove the guaranteed ""defined benefit"" pension for members of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). Employers pointed to a large deficit ahead in the pensions scheme, but the scale of this was queried by academics. As part of the agreement, employers said they would not return to the original proposals. A spokesman for UUK said: ""The decision by UCU members to support the creation of a Joint Expert Panel means that strike action is immediately suspended. ""This gives students important reassurance that they won't be affected by further disruption during their summer study and exam period. ""Reviewing the methodology and assumptions in the current valuation will build confidence and trust and increase transparency in the valuation process. ""It will provide an opportunity to consider the questions raised about the valuation by scheme members and employers."" He added: ""Working in partnership with UCU, we will now appoint a jointly agreed chair for the panel as soon as possible before developing its terms of reference, order of work and timescales."" Sally Hunt, general secretary of the UCU, said the union had come a very long way since January when it seemed that the employers' proposals for a defined contribution pension were to be imposed. ""Now we have agreement to move forward jointly, looking again at the USS valuation alongside a commitment from the employers to a guaranteed, defined benefit scheme."" She added: ""We hope this important agreement will hearten workers across the UK fighting to defend their pension rights and was won through the amazing strike action of UCU members.""

"This video can not be played 'An escalation of the war is in no-one's interest' The UK government is ""waiting for instructions"" from Donald Trump about whether to launch a missile strike on Syria, Jeremy Corbyn has said. The Labour leader spoke out after Cabinet ministers agreed ""on the need to take action"" in Syria to ""deter the further use of chemical weapons"". Ministers said it was ""highly likely"" the Assad regime was responsible for a suspected chemical attack. But Mr Corbyn said military action was unlikely to solve the situation. Russia says 'chemical attack' was staged What can Western military intervention achieve? Has Jeremy Corbyn ever supported a war? Medical sources say dozens of people were killed, including children, during the alleged toxic bombing of the formerly rebel-held town of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. But Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said its specialists had ""irrefutable"" evidence that the alleged attack had been faked by foreign intelligence agents. He said inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ""will find no proof of chemical weapons or chlorine"", adding that ""this was another staged event - and the staging was done by the special services of one of the countries that has been at the forefront of the anti-Russian campaign"". Campaigners from the Stop the War Coalition, an organisation once chaired by Jeremy Corbyn, handed a letter to Downing Street signed by MPs, trade unionists, celebrities and academics urging Mrs May not to take military action in Syria. Stop the War staged a demonstration outside Downing Street On Thursday, cabinet ministers agreed that the use of chemical weapons must not ""go unchallenged"". But Transport Minister Jo Johnson later stressed: ""There has been no decision to take military action at this point."" Sources say the PM is prepared to take action against the Assad regime without first seeking parliamentary consent. But Mr Corbyn said: ""More bombing, more killing, more war will not save life. It will just take more lives and spawn the war elsewhere."" He added: ""The government appears to be waiting for instructions from President Donald Trump on how to proceed. ""Britain should press for an independent UN-led investigation of last weekend's horrific chemical weapons attack so that those responsible can be held to account."" In a later interview, the Labour leader would not say if there were any circumstances in which he would back military intervention in Syria, adding: ""Let's cross that bridge when we get there."" Why are Western states considering air strikes? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Weapons key players have at their disposal President Trump spoke to the prime minister on Thursday evening, and the pair agreed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had ""established a pattern of dangerous behaviour in relation to the use of chemical weapons"". A statement from Downing Street added: ""They agreed to keep working closely together on the international response."" President Trump is expected to speak to French President Emmanuel Macron about what form action could take, with the White House saying ""no final decision has been made"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was understood the UK was planning a genuinely joint effort with the US and France, rather than playing a supporting role. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Environment Secretary Michael Gove leave the meeting at No 10 Labour's Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott hesitated repeatedly when asked by BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether she believed Russia or the US presented a ""greater threat"" to world peace. ""At this point, after Salisbury, and with the unremitting support of Russia for Assad, you have to say Russia isn't bringing forward the cause for world peace,"" she said. Pushed again on the point by presenter Nick Robinson, Ms Abbott clarified: ""It's clear, that at this point, Russia - its role in Syriaâ¦ its role in the poison gas attack in Salisbury - is a greater threat to world peace than the United States."" Ms Abbott also joined calls from UK opposition parties and some Conservative MPs for Parliament to have a vote before any military action is taken, saying it would be ""outrageous"" if the request is denied. ""The reason they're not doing it is they are frightened they'll lose the vote."" This video can not be played Should Parliament have a vote on Syria strikes? But Conservative backbencher Chris Philp said he disagreed - and instead urged MPs to trust the prime minister. ""To ask me to vote on an issue as important as this without seeing all of the material, is something that one should think about very carefully,"" he told the BBC. ""And that's why, if there are things that can't be disclosed publicly in Parliament, there are circumstances under which you can have action without a vote first."" Mrs May has said ""all the indications"" are that the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad, which denies mounting a chemical attack, was responsible for the alleged attack in the formerly rebel-held town of Douma. During Thursday's cabinet meeting called to discuss the UK response, she described it as ""shocking and barbaric"" and said it was a ""further example of the erosion of international law in relation to the use of chemical weapons, which was deeply concerning to us all"". Downing Street said the cabinet had ""agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged"" and ""on the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress and to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime"". ""Cabinet agreed the prime minister should continue to work with allies in the United States and France to coordinate an international response,"" the statement added.

Senior figures from Russia have warned of a Russian response to a US attack. On Tuesday President Donald Trumptweeted,externalto warn Russia that a missile attack on Syria ""will be coming"".

"Jaguar Land Rover says it will not be renewing the contracts of 1,000 temporary workers at two factories. The UK's biggest carmaker, owned by India's Tata Motors, blamed ""continuing headwinds"" affecting the car industry. It said it was continuing to recruit large numbers of engineers and apprentices and it remained committed to its UK plants. Earlier this year, it said it would cut production amid uncertainty over Brexit and changes to taxes on diesel cars. Those cuts were made at its Halewood plant in Merseyside. These jobs will go at the Solihull. Simon Jack: Jaguar Land Rover's diesel dependency Diesel cars: Your questions answered What's gone wrong in the UK car market? UK car registrations plunge in March JLR was expected to announce the cuts on Monday, with Brexit and confusion over diesel cars again being cited as the chief reasons for the changes. JLR employs 40,000 people in the UK, 10,000 at Solihull. Professor of industry, David Bailey, from Aston University, said: ""With the big turn against diesel engines, Jaguar Land Rover is particularly exposed as more than 90% of its UK sales are diesels. ""JLR has just revealed its full-electric i-Pace model and have indicated offering all-electric or hybrid variants of all their models by around 2021, but they have been far too slow compared with Tesla and BMW."" He said the problems caused by Brexit were also unlikely to be solved in a timely manner: ""It's hard to say how long this production uncertainty will continue around Brexit negotiations, because it's still unclear what the trading relationship will be between the UK and EU with regards to tariffs."" JLR was very exposed to the demise of diesel. Recent figures from the trade body showed sales of diesels fell a whopping 37% in March compared with the previous year. Unhappily for JLR, 90% of its vehicles are powered by diesel engines and there are critical industry voices that say they have been slower than their rivals to embrace hybrids and electric. JLR Plants in China and Slovakia are increasing production, but company insiders were keen to stress that it would continue to invest in its UK plants and recently launched a drive to recruit another 5,000 engineers. Jaguar sales are down 26% so far this year, compared with last year,  while demand for Land Rovers in the UK is down 20%. Last year, global sales hit a record, but the company acknowledged that the UK market was ""tough"".

"Open University vice-chancellor Peter Horrocks has resigned after a vote of no confidence by academic staff. He said he was ""ready to move on"" but added the OU faced ""a scale of challenge that is unprecedented"". The university, which has suffered a collapse in student numbers,aims to save Â£100mfrom its Â£420m annual budget by cutting courses and staff. Mr Horrocks had angered staff by saying academics ""get away with not teaching"" and the cuts were ""reprioritising"". He later apologised, saying: ""I sincerely regret that my careless language caused offence or hurt."" But the academics union, University and College Union (UCU),called for him to golast week, saying its members had no confidence in his plans or intentions for the university. They said they were pleased he had listened and resigned. University bosses paid tribute to him, with pro-chancellor Richard Gillingwater saying Mr Horrocks made an ""enormous contribution to securing the future of the Open University"". ""He has shown real courage and determination in articulating and addressing the challenges we face internally and externally,"" he said. The announcement came a few days after the governing body of the university met to discuss academic staff's vote of no confidence. In his resignation statement, Mr Horrocks - who took up the post three years ago - said he was ""ready to move on, having achieved my primary goals"". He said: ""The OU faces a scale of challenge that is unprecedented. ""The requirement for social justice in education is acute and the demands for new skills are ever present, which means that a great institution like ours is needed more than ever. ""I know that all members of the university will continue to commit themselves to the changes necessary to live up to these opportunities."" He added that he had given ""everything I could"" to the cause of part-time learning. He has resigned with immediate effect, but will continue working for the university for ""a few months"" as he hands over to the acting vice-chancellor. Welcoming his resignation, UCU regional official Lydia Richards said: ""The Open University is a fantastic institution and Horrocks' replacement must defend the unique role it plays in our education system and the work of its staff."" She also called for his plan to cut staff and courses to be axed. However, the university governing body is expected to continue with the bulk of the plans Mr Horrocks drew up on changing the university curriculum. The university is projecting an annual deficit of around Â£20m. Mr Horrocks had previously worked at the BBC for 33 years, leaving his post as director of the BBC World Service Group in 2014. The OU was founded in 1969 to offer higher education distance learning to students who often did not fit the traditional undergraduate mould - many were older and studying part-time while working.

"President Trump has signalled military intervention is likely in the near future As the US and UK governments continue to discuss their potential response tothe suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma in Syria, what could military intervention achieve? The critical military virtue of surprise has long since disappeared for theUnited States and its allies in the strikes it is planning against Syrianmilitary facilities. Indeed, Syrian forces have had more than two days to move their aircraft and other military assets into Russian bases at Latakia, Tartus and Khmeimim, where they will be within the protective bubbles of Russia's highly capable S-400 surface-to-air missiles. The Syrians have emptied their infantry bases and dispersed as much of their armed forces as possible, in anticipation of incoming Western missiles. The Russians will undoubtedly try to protect their bases, if attacked, so the situation is fraught with superpower brinkmanship and the danger of accidental conflict. For Western military planners the two greatest questions are what can they achieve militarily in this situation, and what strategic difference can it make? Theresa May summons cabinet to discuss Syria action Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria? Syria 'chemical attack': France's President Macron says he has proof Firepower of key countries in Syrian crisis With Syrian forces forewarned, dispersed and under Russian protection, Western strikes will have to concentrate on Syria's fixed military facilities - bombing runways, destroying buildings and capital equipment where it remains in place. This video can not be played The US president has said ""nothing's off the table"" - so what options are on the table? Western attacks will probably try to destroy Syria's military command and control system, possibly with bunker-busting bombs and deep penetration warheads. They are likely to try to dismantle the military infrastructure that Syria has effectively rebuilt since 2015. More ambitiously, and also more risky, the United States might declare a longer-term policy of revisiting these targets to keep them out of use and have Syrian aircraft bottled up inside their Russian bases - in effect trying to operate a quasi ""no-fly zone"" in Syria, at least for a while. In April 2017 the US launched 59 cruise missiles at the Shayrat airbase in response to a previous chemical weapons attack Last year when theUS struck President Assad's Shayrat airbase in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun,the Syrian air force made sure it was seen to be back in action within a day. The US will be determined that this does not happen again, which is why we can expect this to be a more prolonged air campaign with repeated attacks on key sites. What strategic purpose can be served by this? It certainly won't make any immediate difference to the civil population of Syria, who have suffered so much at the hands of their own government, and the multitude of rebel, terrorist and guerrilla groups, some of whom have intimidated, as much as they have represented, them. And President Assad is unlikely to relent in his determination to consolidate his hold on the country. Why is there a war in Syria? Experts: Are we heading for a third world war? So why take all the risks of escalation with Russia and the prospects of unintended consequences that normally follow? On its own, military force is meaningless. It has to be part of a political strategy and in this case the strategy is about bigger issues than Syria itself and only offers a long-shot hope for the Syrian population. The first objective is to push back against the increasing ""normalisation"" of chemical weapons being used in wars of any kind. The taboo against them has been surprisingly strong since the end of World War One.The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993,externalhas been one of the most effective disarmament measures in modern history. Syria is a signatory to it. In2013 President Obama claimed he would uphold that taboo as a ""red line"", but then didn't. And despite firm denials from the Assad government, there is an abundance of evidence that Syrian forces, with Russian connivance, have been using chemical weapons against their own people on a regular basis ever since. Many Western politicians feel that - with all the moral grey areas of this situation - they cannot sell the pass on this issue yet again. It has become a test case for the international rule of law, which is under severe pressure on many fronts. The World Health Organization has demanded ""unhindered access"" to Douma in Syria to verify claims about the attack Beyond that, some argue effective military action would represent an acceptance that Western powers have got to get back into the game of Middle East politics at a time when the region is melting down. The campaign against so-called Islamic State (IS) was always a geopolitical sideshow, and Western influence on what has been happening from Lebanon to the Yemen has been in steep decline. Of course, it is tempting, and understandable, for Western leaders to want to leave it all alone. But while they took their eye off the ball fighting IS, the future of the area was being determined by Iran, Russia and partly also by Turkey. Syria war: Why Turkey's battle for northern Syria matters Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? The calculation is whether long-term Western interests are served better by involvement than indifference to a constellation of powers that is sliding out of control. And the hope for the Syrian population is that an effective military campaign could possibly push President Assad back into negotiations so that the war might end with something more humane than a vicious victory. Using military force is never easy, but it can only be effective if it is part of a coherent and realistic political strategy.

"Sir Cliff arrived at the High Court with broadcaster Gloria Hunniford Sir Cliff Richard has broken down in court as he described the ""shocking and upsetting"" BBC television coverage of a police raid on his home in 2014. He is suing the BBC over privacy and said in a witness statement his health suffered ""mentally and physically"". South Yorkshire Police searched the singer's Berkshire apartment after a claim of historical sexual assault. Sir Cliff, 77, was not charged with any offence. The BBC says its coverage was in the public interest. BBC coverage 'invasion of privacy' Cliff Richard case 'likely to have huge impact' Lawyers for Sir Cliff said the BBC decision to name the singer in its report - which featured shots taken from a helicopter showing officers inside his property - caused him ""profound and long-lasting damage"". Giving evidence for more than hour at the High Court, Sir Cliff recalled watching the BBC footage of the August 2014 raid from a hotel in Portugal. He said: ""It wasn't a very pleasant feeling and by that time I had heard of the allegation and seeing it made me feel even worse."" In Sir Cliff's written statement,which has been made available online,externalby his lawyers Simkins, he said:  ""It was shocking and upsetting."" He added: ""My health suffered, both mentally and physically... ""At one point... I actually thought I was going to have a heart attack or stroke."" He said: ""I felt as though everything I had worked for during my life - trying to live as honestly and honourably as I could - was being torn apart. ""I felt forever tainted. I still do."" By Lucy Manning, BBC News Sir Cliff Richard stood in the witness box for what would be an emotional 90 minutes. He was tearful at the start, composed himself but then broke down at the end when he accused the BBC of smearing his name across the world. There was the odd moment of humour when he said rock and roll hadn't been good for his ears as he struggled to hear a question. Listening intently in court were the BBC managers he accuses of invading his privacy. They will give evidence next week. Sir Cliff added he ""never felt right"" in the 22 months it took for prosecutors to say they were not going to be taking further action. ""During the day there was an ever-present knot in my stomach,"" he said. ""I'd wake up in the middle of the night, going over things in my head again and again."" He said he lost a ""considerable amount"" of weight and felt unable to return to the Sunningdale property ""except to pack up my belongings"". ""In my mind it had become contaminated,"" his statement said. ""I didn't feel comfortable there any longer. ""I have in fact been burgled before, and this for me was a worse experience."" He said the police search and subsequent publicity ""not only seriously disrupted my personal life, but also my charitable work and my plans for my professional work"", including an album release and a revised edition of his autobiography. The BBC's barrister, Gavin Millar QC, started his questioning of Sir Cliff by asking about instances where he had used his ""public profile"" to talk about his personal beliefs. While discussing how the coverage had affected his life, Sir Cliff broke down. He said: ""Everywhere I have ever been, I felt my name was smeared. The police didn't do that, the BBC did."" Sir Cliff said to date the case had cost him Â£3.4m, including spending on lawyers and media representatives, and lost business. He is suing the BBC for the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. In his statement, Sir Cliff added he had always held a great deal of respect for the BBC which helped him with his career from the start. However, he said while it was tempting to ""just try to forget the whole episode"", he decided to take action to ""perhaps make it less likely"" that anyone has to go through a similar experience. His lawyers say he is seeking ""very substantial"" damages or compensation for the breach of his rights. Sir Cliff leaving the court with Gloria Hunniford after giving evidence They say BBC journalist Dan Johnson received a tip-off about the investigation from a Metropolitan Police source working in Operation Yewtree, the inquiry into allegations of historical sex offences. The Met Police later passed the allegation, a claim of an offence against a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985, to South Yorkshire Police. Jason Beer QC, for South Yorkshire Police, which paid the singer Â£400,000 to settle a privacy claim, told the court the force had acted unlawfully by confirming Sir Cliff's identity to the BBC and by discussing the search. But he argued the judge, Mr Justice Mann, should rule the BBC contribute to the money it paid the singer because the broadcaster was ""far more causative of the damage suffered"". He also accused Mr Johnson of using ""heavy-handed"" tactics when dealing with officers from the force ahead of the raid. Lawyers representing the BBC have told court the police raid was of ""legitimate public interest"". They said the BBC had been given information about an investigation into a serious criminal offence and had a duty to pass on the information to the public. Mr Millar for the BBC said its journalists had respected Sir Cliff's rights as a ""suspect"" and the ""presumption of innocence"". Addressing the court on the first day of the case, he said ""you have to focus on that point... at which the BBC publish the information and ask whether Sir Cliff had a reasonable expectation of privacy? ""He may have wanted that. But that would not have been a reasonable expectation for somebody in his position.""

"Dame Helen will shortly be seen in road movie The Leisure Seeker Dame Helen Mirren has said the rise of watching films on streaming services at home is ""devastating"" for people who want to make films for the big screen. ""It's devastating for people like my husband, film directors, because they want their movies to be watched in a cinema with a group of people,"" the actress told Total Film magazine. Dame Helen, 72, is married to Taylor Hackford, director of 2004 biopic Ray. She said the ""communal"" experience of cinema is in danger of dying out. ""An audience, a movie, and you're all in it together,"" she said. ""You're frightened, you laugh, you cry all together. So it's a communal thing. And that's beginning to disappear."" The Oscar winner's comments continue a debate about services like Netflix, which has bought films like Annihilation and Mudbound for its own subscribers. Its business model generally bypasses cinemas - a fact that has unsettled many in the film industry. Netflix films have been banned from this year's Cannes Film Festival, which has introduced a rule saying all films in competition must have a cinema release. Streaming services may be able to offer fans advantages in terms of price, selection and home comforts - but the attraction of the cinema doesn't seem to be waning. Last year, UK cinemagoers spent a record Â£1.38bn on tickets, up 6.1% on the previous year. We put Dame Helen's commentsto our Facebook group,external. Here's a sample of what people said: ""I love the cinema experience but it's so expensive that I only go to see a movie I've been waiting ages for (next trip is Avengers: Infinity War!). With Netflix and Amazon Prime subscriptions there are so many movies I can watch at home in the comfort of my living room and movies tend to come out faster for streaming than they used to on DVD.""Rosie Smith ""I love seeing great films on huge screens in the dark in comfy seats and with treats to eat. However, my husband will no longer go any more because of the cost and the fact he can now download for free so feels there's no need nor justification to go.""Claire Stokes ""I love going to the cinema, as nothing compares to being completely enveloped in that room with that sound and vision! Yes the price has risen a lot but where hasn't it these days? If you're watchful you can get two for the price of one or become a member for reduced prices. Compared to the cost of a meal out or the price of a few drinks, it's much less expensive.""Louise Prior ""The cinema has become so expensive, so I'll only go a few times a year. Love the experience, but will only go for films I am dying to see and have been waiting to come out. Otherwise I feel these films do come to Sky or online pretty quickly, so I'm happy to wait.""Eve St Claire ""I love the cinema and my hubby and I would like to make it a weekly treat. However the cost means we wait until a film we desperately want to see comes out rather than seeing less exciting films. With travel and ticket price a cinema trip has become a luxury and not a regular outing.""Bbev Hall Palfreyman ""I still go regularly. I like being at the cinema but also like having a closer look at the production, maybe because I also enjoy the theatre. Film is definitely a big screen medium and it's a shame to see the works ignored at the cinema.

"Regularly drinking above the UK alcohol guidelines can take years off your life,according to a major report.,external The study of 600,000 drinkers estimated that having 10 to 15 alcoholic drinks every week could shorten a person's life by between one and two years. And they warned that people who drink more than 18 drinks a week could lose four to five years of their lives. The2016 UK guidelinesrecommend no more than 14 units a week, which is six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine. Authors of the Lancet study said their findings backed up the new guidelines and also said they did not find an increased risk of death for light drinkers. Your guide to alcohol drinking limits Alcohol limits cut to reduce risks Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? Scientists, who compared the health and drinking habits of alcohol drinkers in 19 countries, modelled how much life a person could expect to lose if they drank the same way for the rest of their lives from the age of 40. They found people who drank the equivalent of about five to 10 drinks a week could shorten their lives by up to six months. The study's authors also found drinking increased the risk of cardiovascular illness, with every 12.5 units of alcohol people drank above the guidelines raising the risk of: Stroke by 14% Fatal hypertensive disease by 24% Heart failure by 9% Fatal aortic aneurysm by 15% Drinking alcohol was linked with a reduced risk of non-fatal heart disease, but scientists said this benefit was wiped out by a higher risk of other forms of the illness. Previous studies have suggested that drinking red wine can be good for our hearts, althoughsome scientists have suggested these benefits may be overhyped. Another Danish study found drinking three to four times a weekwas linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. ""This study makes clear that on balance there are no health benefits from drinking alcohol, which is usually the case when things sound too good to be true,"" said Tim Chico, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Sheffield, who was not involved in the research. ""Although non-fatal heart attacks are less likely in people who drink, this benefit is swamped by the increased risk of other forms of heart disease including fatal heart attacks and stroke.""

"Dame Helen will shortly be seen in road movie The Leisure Seeker Dame Helen Mirren has said the rise of watching films on streaming services at home is ""devastating"" for people who want to make films for the big screen. ""It's devastating for people like my husband, film directors, because they want their movies to be watched in a cinema with a group of people,"" the actress told Total Film magazine. Dame Helen, 72, is married to Taylor Hackford, director of 2004 biopic Ray. She said the ""communal"" experience of cinema is in danger of dying out. ""An audience, a movie, and you're all in it together,"" she said. ""You're frightened, you laugh, you cry all together. So it's a communal thing. And that's beginning to disappear."" The Oscar winner's comments continue a debate about services like Netflix, which has bought films like Annihilation and Mudbound for its own subscribers. Its business model generally bypasses cinemas - a fact that has unsettled many in the film industry. Netflix films have been banned from this year's Cannes Film Festival, which has introduced a rule saying all films in competition must have a cinema release. Streaming services may be able to offer fans advantages in terms of price, selection and home comforts - but the attraction of the cinema doesn't seem to be waning. Last year, UK cinemagoers spent a record Â£1.38bn on tickets, up 6.1% on the previous year. We put Dame Helen's commentsto our Facebook group,external. Here's a sample of what people said: ""I love the cinema experience but it's so expensive that I only go to see a movie I've been waiting ages for (next trip is Avengers: Infinity War!). With Netflix and Amazon Prime subscriptions there are so many movies I can watch at home in the comfort of my living room and movies tend to come out faster for streaming than they used to on DVD.""Rosie Smith ""I love seeing great films on huge screens in the dark in comfy seats and with treats to eat. However, my husband will no longer go any more because of the cost and the fact he can now download for free so feels there's no need nor justification to go.""Claire Stokes ""I love going to the cinema, as nothing compares to being completely enveloped in that room with that sound and vision! Yes the price has risen a lot but where hasn't it these days? If you're watchful you can get two for the price of one or become a member for reduced prices. Compared to the cost of a meal out or the price of a few drinks, it's much less expensive.""Louise Prior ""The cinema has become so expensive, so I'll only go a few times a year. Love the experience, but will only go for films I am dying to see and have been waiting to come out. Otherwise I feel these films do come to Sky or online pretty quickly, so I'm happy to wait.""Eve St Claire ""I love the cinema and my hubby and I would like to make it a weekly treat. However the cost means we wait until a film we desperately want to see comes out rather than seeing less exciting films. With travel and ticket price a cinema trip has become a luxury and not a regular outing.""Bbev Hall Palfreyman ""I still go regularly. I like being at the cinema but also like having a closer look at the production, maybe because I also enjoy the theatre. Film is definitely a big screen medium and it's a shame to see the works ignored at the cinema. Lots of times I have seen only three or four people at a screening for something that was really good and that a lot of effort had gone into.""Alex Pinfold Join the conversationon our Facebook group,external.

"Jaguar Land Rover says it will not be renewing the contracts of 1,000 temporary workers at two factories. The UK's biggest carmaker, owned by India's Tata Motors, blamed ""continuing headwinds"" affecting the car industry. It said it was continuing to recruit large numbers of engineers and apprentices and it remained committed to its UK plants. Earlier this year, it said it would cut production amid uncertainty over Brexit and changes to taxes on diesel cars. Those cuts were made at its Halewood plant in Merseyside. These jobs will go at the Solihull. Simon Jack: Jaguar Land Rover's diesel dependency Diesel cars: Your questions answered What's gone wrong in the UK car market? UK car registrations plunge in March JLR was expected to announce the cuts on Monday, with Brexit and confusion over diesel cars again being cited as the chief reasons for the changes. JLR employs 40,000 people in the UK, 10,000 at Solihull. Professor of industry, David Bailey, from Aston University, said: ""With the big turn against diesel engines, Jaguar Land Rover is particularly exposed as more than 90% of its UK sales are diesels. ""JLR has just revealed its full-electric i-Pace model and have indicated offering all-electric or hybrid variants of all their models by around 2021, but they have been far too slow compared with Tesla and BMW."" He said the problems caused by Brexit were also unlikely to be solved in a timely manner: ""It's hard to say how long this production uncertainty will continue around Brexit negotiations, because it's still unclear what the trading relationship will be between the UK and EU with regards to tariffs."" JLR was very exposed to the demise of diesel. Recent figures from the trade body showed sales of diesels fell a whopping 37% in March compared with the previous year. Unhappily for JLR, 90% of its vehicles are powered by diesel engines and there are critical industry voices that say they have been slower than their rivals to embrace hybrids and electric. JLR Plants in China and Slovakia are increasing production, but company insiders were keen to stress that it would continue to invest in its UK plants and recently launched a drive to recruit another 5,000 engineers. Jaguar sales are down 26% so far this year, compared with last year,  while demand for Land Rovers in the UK is down 20%. Last year, global sales hit a record, but the company acknowledged that the UK market was ""tough"".

"Russian intelligence agencies targeted poison victim Yulia Skripal's email account as early as 2013, the UK's national security adviser has said. In a letter to Nato, Sir Mark Sedwill also said Russia trained ""special units"" to use nerve agents, including applying them to door handles. Police said a nerve agent was found on Yulia's father Sergei Skripal's front door in Salisbury. The Russian government has denied any involvement in the 4 March attack. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Poisoned ex-spy's daughter leaves hospital Who is Sergei Skripal? Inspectors back UK in spy poisoning row The UK says Ms Skripal, 33, and her 66-year-old father, who were found slumped on a park bench in the city on 4 March, were exposed toa nerve agent belonging to the Novichok group. This analysis has been backed by the international chemical weapons watchdog. Mr Skripal remains at Salisbury District Hospital, while his daughter was discharged on Monday. Sir Mark's letter to Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg,externalis the first time the UK government has claimed to have specific information that the Russians were interested in the Skripal family. ""We have information indicating Russian intelligence service interest in the Skripals dating back at least as far as 2013,"" he said. ""Email accounts belonging to Yulia Skripal were targeted by GRU cyber specialists,"" he said, referring to Russia's foreign military intelligence agency. The letter accuses Russia of testing assassination methods with chemical weapons, including using nerve agents smeared on to door handles. Police say traces of a Novichok nerve agent have been found at sites across Salisbury at low concentrations following the attack - with thehighest concentration found on the door handle of Mr Skripal's front door.

But the details contained in the letter do not identify the exact culprits behind the poison attack. Sir Mark said it was ""highly likely"" people such as Mr Skripal, who was exchanged in a spy swap in 2010 after being convicted of passing information to the UK, may be regarded as ""legitimate targets"" for ""state-sponsored assassination"" by Russia. He said the UK government continued ""to judge that only Russia has the technical means, operational experience and motive for the attack on the Skripals and that it is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible"". ""There is no plausible alternative explanation,"" he added. The letter also claims President Vladimir Putin was closely involved in the Russian chemical weapons programme in the mid-2000s, and that it was ""highly unlikely"" any former Soviet republic other than Russia pursued chemical weapons after independence. The Russian embassy has published an 8,000-word report on the Skripal case, including a timeline and details of the British response. The report accuses the British government of isolating the Skripals, concealing evidence and preventing an independent investigation. It also says the UK is using ""the same script, but in fast forward mode"" as it did on the case of Alexander Litvinenko - the former Russian agent poisoned in London in 2006. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said around 250 detectives were working on the Salisbury investigation. She said they would do everything to establish the facts and ""if at all possible"" bring those responsible to justice. Ex-spy's daughter leaves hospital What happened to the Skripals?

"The UK's garden centres are suffering after the country's spate of bad weather, with sales at their worst levels in at least five years. So far this year, average underlying sales are down 15% to 20%, with the early Easter proving a washout, says the Garden Centre Association. Now the horticulture industry is hoping for brighter late spring weather. ""It's literally in the lap of the gods,"" said the association's chief executive, Iain Wylie. He told the BBC that people were not coming in to buy flowers and other plants because of unfavourable conditions in their often waterlogged gardens. ""We need a sustained period of good weather. The worst thing would be one good day, one bad day. ""It's been too cold and too wet and we need better weather to pick things up."" According to the Horticultural Trades Association, the UK garden market is worth about Â£5bn a year, with two-thirds of British adults visiting a garden centre at least once a year. The last time garden centres had such a bad start to the year was 2013, said Mr Wylie. However, on that occasion, conditions improved in subsequent months, so that by the summer, they were back on track. Mr Wylie is hoping that the weather will repeat the trick in 2018. ""There will be some lost sales, but hopefully they will catch up with later selling plants,"" he said. ""Nurseries produce crops that bud and flower at the time they should, but if the weather outside isn't conducive, it's very difficult to manage the production cycle."" If the weather does not improve, garden centres could suffer two poor seasons in a row, Mr Wylie warned. ""The risk is that the weather is not good enough for summer bedding, but it's past the time for spring bedding,"" he said. Toby Davies, deputy manager of the Camden Garden Centre in London, said the bad weather had cost his centre tens of thousands of pounds. He said spring plants, such as primroses, and summer bedding plants, such as geraniums, were failing to find buyers. He said: ""What we have experienced is a backlog of things I would have expected to have gone by now, while the summer stuff is not moving at the rate it usually would.""

""We have information indicating Russian intelligence service interest in the Skripals dating back at least as far as 2013,"" he said. ""Email accounts belonging to Yulia Skripal were targeted by GRU cyber specialists,"" he said, referring to Russia's foreign military intelligence agency. The letter accuses Russia of testing assassination methods with chemical weapons, including using nerve agents smeared on to door handles. Police say traces of a Novichok nerve agent have been found at sites across Salisbury at low concentrations following the attack - with thehighest concentration found on the door handle of Mr Skripal's front door.

But the details contained in the letter do not identify the exact culprits behind the poison attack. Sir Mark said it was ""highly likely"" people such as Mr Skripal, who was exchanged in a spy swap in 2010 after being convicted of passing information to the UK, may be regarded as ""legitimate targets"" for ""state-sponsored assassination"" by Russia. He said the UK government continued ""to judge that only Russia has the technical means, operational experience and motive for the attack on the Skripals and that it is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible"". ""There is no plausible alternative explanation,"" he added. The letter also claims President Vladimir Putin was closely involved in the Russian chemical weapons programme in the mid-2000s, and that it was ""highly unlikely"" any former Soviet republic other than Russia pursued chemical weapons after independence. The Russian embassy has published an 8,000-word report on the Skripal case, including a timeline and details of the British response. The report accuses the British government of isolating the Skripals, concealing evidence and preventing an independent investigation. It also says the UK is using ""the same script, but in fast forward mode"" as it did on the case of Alexander Litvinenko - the former Russian agent poisoned in London in 2006. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said around 250 detectives were working on the Salisbury investigation. She said they would do everything to establish the facts and ""if at all possible"" bring those responsible to justice. Ex-spy's daughter leaves hospital What happened to the Skripals?

"The UK's garden centres are suffering after the country's spate of bad weather, with sales at their worst levels in at least five years. So far this year, average underlying sales are down 15% to 20%, with the early Easter proving a washout, says the Garden Centre Association. Now the horticulture industry is hoping for brighter late spring weather. ""It's literally in the lap of the gods,"" said the association's chief executive, Iain Wylie. He told the BBC that people were not coming in to buy flowers and other plants because of unfavourable conditions in their often waterlogged gardens. ""We need a sustained period of good weather. The worst thing would be one good day, one bad day. ""It's been too cold and too wet and we need better weather to pick things up."" According to the Horticultural Trades Association, the UK garden market is worth about Â£5bn a year, with two-thirds of British adults visiting a garden centre at least once a year. The last time garden centres had such a bad start to the year was 2013, said Mr Wylie. However, on that occasion, conditions improved in subsequent months, so that by the summer, they were back on track. Mr Wylie is hoping that the weather will repeat the trick in 2018. ""There will be some lost sales, but hopefully they will catch up with later selling plants,"" he said. ""Nurseries produce crops that bud and flower at the time they should, but if the weather outside isn't conducive, it's very difficult to manage the production cycle."" If the weather does not improve, garden centres could suffer two poor seasons in a row, Mr Wylie warned. ""The risk is that the weather is not good enough for summer bedding, but it's past the time for spring bedding,"" he said. Toby Davies, deputy manager of the Camden Garden Centre in London, said the bad weather had cost his centre tens of thousands of pounds. He said spring plants, such as primroses, and summer bedding plants, such as geraniums, were failing to find buyers. He said: ""What we have experienced is a backlog of things I would have expected to have gone by now, while the summer stuff is not moving at the rate it usually would.""

"Regularly drinking above the UK alcohol guidelines can take years off your life,according to a major report.,external The study of 600,000 drinkers estimated that having 10 to 15 alcoholic drinks every week could shorten a person's life by between one and two years. And they warned that people who drink more than 18 drinks a week could lose four to five years of their lives. The2016 UK guidelinesrecommend no more than 14 units a week, which is six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine. Authors of the Lancet study said their findings backed up the new guidelines and also said they did not find an increased risk of death for light drinkers. Your guide to alcohol drinking limits Alcohol limits cut to reduce risks Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? Scientists, who compared the health and drinking habits of alcohol drinkers in 19 countries, modelled how much life a person could expect to lose if they drank the same way for the rest of their lives from the age of 40. They found people who drank the equivalent of about five to 10 drinks a week could shorten their lives by up to six months. The study's authors also found drinking increased the risk of cardiovascular illness, with every 12.5 units of alcohol people drank above the guidelines raising the risk of: Stroke by 14% Fatal hypertensive disease by 24% Heart failure by 9% Fatal aortic aneurysm by 15% Drinking alcohol was linked with a reduced risk of non-fatal heart disease, but scientists said this benefit was wiped out by a higher risk of other forms of the illness. Previous studies have suggested that drinking red wine can be good for our hearts, althoughsome scientists have suggested these benefits may be overhyped. Another Danish study found drinking three to four times a weekwas linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. ""This study makes clear that on balance there are no health benefits from drinking alcohol, which is usually the case when things sound too good to be true,"" said Tim Chico, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Sheffield, who was not involved in the research. ""Although non-fatal heart attacks are less likely in people who drink, this benefit is swamped by the increased risk of other forms of heart disease including fatal heart attacks and stroke."" This video can not be played The UK's drinking limits are at the right level, Richard Piper from Alcohol Research UK says Scientists say the study challenges the idea that drinking in moderation is good for our health Recommended limits in Italy, Portugal, and Spain are almost 50% higher than the UK guidelines, and in the USA the upper limit for men is nearly double this. But Victoria Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation, which partly funded the study, said this did not mean the UK ""should rest on its laurels"". ""Many people in the UK regularly drink over what's recommended"" she said. ""We should always remember that alcohol guidelines should act as a limit, not a target, and try to drink well below this threshold."" Dr Angela Wood, from the University of Cambridge, lead author of the study, said: ""The key message of this research is that, if you already drink alcohol, drinking less may help you live longer and lower your risk of several cardiovascular conditions.""

"This video can not be played Hundreds gathered outside Alder Hey Hospital on Thursday night Hundreds of people have staged a protest outside a hospital in Merseyside where a terminally ill toddler is being cared for. A date to switch off the life support for Alfie Evans has been set by a High Court judge following a legal battle. Alfie's parents' legal fight against the decision ultimately ended in March when theEuropean Court of Human Rights rejected their case. Merseyside Police had asked protesters at Alder Hey to be respectful. Officers said the ""large"" and ""peaceful"" protest in Liverpool on Thursday night ""did cause significant traffic disruption and inconvenience for other people trying to access the hospital"". Alfie has been at Alder Hey since December 2016 with an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease. His parents Tom Evans and Kate James, who are both in their 20s and from Liverpool, have lost cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal, and had their case rejected by the Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights. Alfie Evans has been treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital since December 2016 The family told the BBC they had a private ambulance and jet on stand-by. They say the court order would end at the point the hospital removes ventilation from Alfie, at which moment they will take over and fly him to Rome. Alder Hey say they will not allow that to happen but speaking on Thursday evening Mr Evans said they were confident they would succeed. He said: ""There's no court order to say Alfie has to stay in this hospital right now. ""The truth behind the matter is that me and Kate hold full responsibility and we can take him to our transportation van with full equipment with the doctors who have got full duty of careâ¦ and they are not allowing us so we are hoping that my solicitor is going to spin the spoon and get us out."" Alfie's parents want him to be removed from Alder Hey and taken to the Bambino Gesu hospital - which has links to the Vatican.

In February, Mr Justice Hayden ruled doctors at Alder Hey could stop treating Alfie against the wishes of his parents following hearings in the Family Division of the High Court in London and Liverpool. On Wednesday, the judge said what had happened to Alfie was ""profoundly unfair"", as the court endorsed an end-of-life care plan drawn up by specialists.

"This video can not be played Chris Scott said an ""awful feeling"" came over him the final time he saw his wife alive A man believes his wife would still be alive if the probation service had acted on warnings and sent a convicted murderer back to prison. Simon Mellors, from Nottingham, murdered his former partner Pearl Black in 1999, then killed Janet Scott after being released from prison on licence. Her husband, Chris Scott, said Mellors threatened to kill them both and followed Janet to work before she died. The Ministry of Justice said a full review into the case is under way. ""If the probation service had done something and informed the police and had Mellors been arrested my wife would still be alive,"" said Mr Scott. Simon Mellors killed Pearl Black in 1999 and Janet Scott in 2018 Mellors was released from prison in 2014. He was in a relationship with Mrs Scott while she was temporarily separated from her husband in 2017, and killed her after she got back together with Mr Scott. Mellors stabbed the 51-year-old at her home in Nursery Road, Arnold, Nottinghamshire, on 29 January then drove her towards Nottingham city centre. East Midlands Live: Grieving families conman jail term cut; Boxer's shot at gold at first major tournament She escaped and ran towards a traffic officer for help, but Mellors drove his car into both of them, injuring the traffic officer and killing Mrs Scott instantly. Mellors died in prison after being charged with her murder and the attempted murder of the traffic officer. He is thought to have killed himself. Janet Scott had a short relationship with Simon Mellors in 2017 Mr Scott said his wife knew Mellors was going to kill her. ""She knew it was coming,"" he said. ""I said 'Look, you've got nothing to worry about, I'm here, I'm going to protect you, nothing is going to happen'."" ""This has hit me so hard it has just ripped my life apart."" Pearl Black's brother and sister, George and Mary Black, wrote to the Parole Board before Mellors was released from prison, to warn them that he would kill again. Ms Black said: ""The Parole Board have let us down totally. The justice system has let us down by not listening to us when we warned them this man would commit murder again."" Simon Mellors drove his car into Janet Scott in Peel Street, Nottingham, on 29 January Mr Black said: ""Two good women died by the hands of this monster. ""The different agencies should have picked up on this because he had been stalking Janet."" The families of both murdered woman are supporting each other and want the justice system held to account over Mrs Scott's death. They have started a petition for a register so that people can find out whether someone is a convicted murderer before getting into a relationship with them. Janet Scott, shown here with her sister Susan Thomson, had six children and was married four times Janet and her older sister, Susan Thomson, were at a pub in Nottingham just before Easter 2017 when she met Mellors. Mrs Thomson said Mellors did not tell her sister about the murder conviction for at least six to eight weeks. ""If she had knew this she would never have got involved with him,"" said Mrs Thomson. ""She was just a very caring person and she always said to me everybody deserves a second chance in life."" Janet's brother-in-law Keith Thomson, who had known her since she was 10 years old, said she had already ""formed an attachment"" to Mellors by the time she found out about his murder conviction. The Thomsons said Janet tried to end the relationship several times but Mellors would not accept it. They said that Janet complained to Mellors' probation officer about his behaviour. ""I knew that my sister sent texts to the probation officer because she rung me up when she did it and told me so,"" said Mrs Thomson. ""I feel that Simon should have been told, or pulled in, or something done about it, while he was stalking my sister."" Simon Mellors, then aged 38, killed Pearl Black, the mother of his nine-year-old daughter, in 1999 Mellors murdered 36-year-old Pearl Black on 6 May 1999 at her home in Ewe Lamb Lane, Bramcote, Nottinghamshire. He battered her head repeatedly with an iron bar then strangled her with cable ties. Mellors denied murder, claiming diminished responsibility because he was depressed at the time, but the jury rejected this and convicted him. How do judges decide sentences?

"People are angry over the brutal rape and murder of Asifa Bano The brutal gang rape and murder of an eight-year old girl has sparked outrage and anger across India. The body of Asifa Bano, who belonged to a Muslim nomadic tribe, was found in a forest on 17 January near Kathua city of Indian-administered Kashmir. The story made headlines this week when Hindu right-wing groups protested over the arrest of eight Hindu men. The case has become a religious flashpoint in an already polarised Indian region. The men the police have arrested include a retired government official, four police officers and a minor - all of them belong to a local Hindu community that has been involved in a land dispute with the Muslim nomads. Outrage grew after twoministers from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attended a rally in support of the accused men,external. The child rape and murder that has Kashmir on edge Was Delhi gang rape India's #Metoo moment? Anger not only over the grisly murder but also the support for the accused quickly gathered momentum on Twitter with the hashtags #Kathua and #justiceforAsifa trending since Thursday.

The crime took place in one of India's most restive regions. Since 1989, there has been an armed revolt in the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley against Indian rule - they valley is adjacent to Hindu-majority Jammu. Asifa's family belongs to a community of Muslim nomadic shepherds who crisscross the Himalayas with their livestock. In the winter, they often travel from the valley to Jammu, where they use public forest land for grazing - this has recently brought them into conflict with some Hindu residents in the region. Investigators believe that the accused men wished to force the nomads out of Jammu. After they were arrested,lawyers in Jammu city tried to stop police entering the court to file a charge sheet,external. The lawyers were believed to be supporting a Hindu right-wing group that has alleged that the accused men are innocent, and have demanded that the case be transferred to India's federal police. Rahul Gandhi, the chief of the main opposition Congress party, led a candlelight march in Delhi on Thursday night. More protests have been planned to bring attention to brutal crimes against women in India. Asifa Bano was eight years old The chief of Delhi Commission for Women, Swati Maliwal, has said she will be starting an indefinite fast from Friday to demand better security for women and children in the country. Several other activists and women have also planned protests in Delhi and other parts of the country over the weekend. Some people have also used the hashtag #Unnao to highlight anotherrape case in which a lawmaker is accused of raping a 16-year-old in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Kuldeep Singh Sengar, 50, from the ruling BJP allegedly raped the girl last year in Unnao district. But her case was registered only after she tried to kill herself last week in front of the chief minister's home. The brutal crime that has Kashmir on edge Was Delhi gang rape India's #Metoo moment?

"When a young woman was convicted of murdering her partner and sentenced to death, no-one could have imagined that she would study law and free not only herself but hundreds of others from death row. Now Susan Kigula wants to go further and set up the first legal chambers staffed by lawyers behind bars. What's about to happen next in a small, wooden panelled courtroom in Kampala, will be written up by the local press as a melodramatic confession to a gruesome murder. Standing in the dock one afternoon in November 2011, Susan Kigula is about to let the weight of the past 11 years on death row get to her as she turns to her stepson. ""Don't you know that I love you so much?"" she'll cry to the 14-year-old boy who is sitting with her late partner's family just feet away. The courtroom will be deadly silent as Kigula falls to her knees. ""You know that I do love you so much?"" she'll repeat. ""I'm your mother!"" And then, turning to the family of her late partner, Susan Kigula will say sorry. The local press in Uganda will write it up as if it was a scene in a soap opera. A hammy admittance of a horrific crime. Except that's not what she meant, she says. ""The press lied."" You didn't confess to the murder of your partner, Constantine Sseremba? ""No, dear,"" Kigula's voice is calm. She's been asked this question too many times to be offended. ""I'll tell you my truth."" Kigula was born in the Central Ugandan cattle-farming town of Masaka, about 134km (84 miles) south-west of Kampala. ""Growing up I was a daddy's girl,"" she says. ""I used to tell him that I wanted to work in a bank because I thought that was a good job and I would be strong and independent if I had a good job. I had a lot of dreams back then because my parents made me believe they could all come true."" She and her three brothers and five sisters enjoyed a sheltered middle-class upbringing, centred around a close-knit church community. The children played in the open fields into the evening and ate together with their parents every night. ""My happy childhood didn't prepare me for what was to come in adulthood,"" she says simply. 20-year-old Susan Kigula with her partner Constantine Sseremba and their child - she says they enjoyed a happy relationship Kigula had been working for a couple of years in a small gift shop in Kampala when she met Constantine Sseremba, who, at 28, was 10 years her senior. They moved in together. The apartment was small, just two rooms, but Kigula says it was ideal for the family, which included Sseremba's young son from a previous relationship. They soon had a daughter of their own. ""We loved each very much,"" says Kigula. ""We would go to the cinema and the park and people would tease us. They would call us twins because we were so in sync. We were not rich but we were happy that we had each other. ""We saw the best in our situation and we didn't dwell on the negative."" It's an outlook that, many years later, would save her life. The 9 July 2000 could have been another forgettable evening, says Kigula. The young family ate dinner together. They laughed. Kigula and Sseremba, his son and their daughter retired to bed. They slept all together in the only bedroom. Their housemaid, Patience Nansamba, was on a mattress in the living area next door. Kigula says that she was woken up around 2.30am by a piercing, flashing blow to the back of her neck. ""There was hot blood oozing from a wound there. The sheets were wet with blood. It wasn't just mine. ""Because the main lights were off I couldn't immediately take in the scene or see what was happening to us. I sat up dizzily on the bed in confusion. ""Then a small panel of light from the security lanterns outside came on and some of the room was lit. The children were unharmed. They were awake and distressed. ""Constantine was on the floor, groaning. His neck was cut. It was all happening so quickly. ""Our housemaid Patience ran into the room saying she had seen two people run out of the flat moments earlier. ""My vision was blurring and I was unsteady on my feet as I made my way outside to alert the neighbours to come help us. I saw a couple of figures running away, but they could have been anyone at this point, I can't be sure they were my attackers. ""I made it to a restaurant outside where I was given a blanket, I hadn't realised that I had run out of the house naked. ""I was still bleeding and then my vision started blurring. I passed out."" Constantine Sseremba and his daughter Namata Kigula woke up hours later in hospital, the wound to the back of her neck still throbbing, to hear that her partner had died. She was told that her family were looking after their one-year-old daughter Namata and Sseremba's relatives, with whom she had a frosty relationship, had taken his three-year-old son into their home. It dawned on her that up until that moment she had lived a happy life; a contented childhood, a successful relationship, a good job. That was all gone now, she thought. Kigula's father informed her that the families had arranged Sseremba's burial for the following day. ""My mind was a whirlwind. I couldn't understand what had happened or why. Whoever had come to attack us was targeting both of us. Who wanted me and Constantine dead? I thought about it a lot. It bothers me still."" There was no obvious motive for the attack. Nothing had been stolen. After Sseremba's funeral, Kigula was being driven back to the hospital when she heard an announcement on the radio that made her freeze. The news reader announced that Constantine Sseremba and his 21-year-old partner, Susan Kigula, had both been murdered in a bungled burglary. ""I thought, 'Oh my god, the person who tried to kill us both had arranged a joint obituary assuming we would both be dead by now. They thought they'd get us both.'"" Susan Kigula was 21 when she entered Luzira Women's Prison in Kampala Then, three days later, Kigula, still receiving treatment for her large neck wound, received a visit from the police. To her amazement, they charged her with murder and took her straight to a maximum security prison on the outskirts of Kampala, to await trial. Sseremba's family said that her three-year-old stepson had seen Kigula and the housemaid kill his father. ""I was naive in that moment,"" says Kigula. ""I thought, 'Obviously all of this is a mistake. The poor young boy is traumatised and confused. I'm innocent and of course people will see that.' I had no idea how the legal system worked."" She didn't hire a lawyer. She couldn't afford one and, anyway, she was confident in the justice system. But two years later, Susan Kigula and Patience Nansamba were found guilty of the murder of Constantine Sseremba - based on the testimony of Sseremba's now five-year-old son. Police also said that a blood-stained panga, a machete-like farming tool that was found in the doorway to the bedroom of the flat belonged to Kigula. The murder conviction came with a mandatory death sentence. The women were told the method would be hanging. Kigula looked at her now three-year-old daughter, sitting with her parents, and burst into tears. It was 2005 and 20-year-old British student Alexander McLean was taking a break from his studies, after obtaining a law degree. After finishing school, a few years earlier, McLean had volunteered at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, hoping to bolster his CV for university, and had been deeply disturbed by the dire conditions there. He saw patients lying on unswept floors, often in pools of vomit and blood. Their families were required to provide fresh sheets and towels, but when the patients were prisoners, relatives often left them to fend for themselves. McLean found himself drawn to these patients, some of whom were handcuffed to their beds. Curious about the conditions they faced in custody, he visited Luzira Upper Prison. ""I was struck by how massively overcrowded it was, how young the inmates were, how few had had decent legal representation,"" he says. A particularly gruesome, and avoidable, death of a young male prisoner in the jail prompted McLean, on his return to London, to raise money for healthcare facilities for prisoners in Uganda. He set up the African Prisons Project. When he returned to Uganda in 2005 to oversee the refurbishing of the sick bay at Luzira Women's Prison, Susan Kigula began to act as his translator. She made an instant impression on him. Alexander McLean was 18 when he first started working with prisoners in Uganda By this time Kigula had been in the prison for five years. ""Every day I would wake up and think, 'Is this the day that I will be hanged?'"" she says. But when asked what conditions were like her response is unemotional. ""Prison is prison,"" she says, without expanding. Kigula shared a cell built for one person with three other women. They used a bucket as toilet. A 2011 report into Ugandan prisons by Human Rights Watch said prisoners often slept on one shoulder, packed together so that they could only shift if an entire row agreed to roll at once. Inmates were sometimes confined in isolation cells, the report said, often naked, handcuffed, and sometimes denied food; the cells occasionally flooded with water up to ankle height. Kigula doesn't want to talk about such things. But she is keen to tell the story of how she obtained her freedom. For the first few weeks in prison Kigula, then aged 24, and the 50 or so women in her section would talk to each other about their impending death, about who would care for their children outside. ""As I got to know the women I began to learn that many of them, like me, had been wrongly accused of crimes. Some were guilty but none of them deserved to be sentenced to death because the crimes they had committed were crimes of passion, they told me. Some of the crimes were a result of years of sexual and physical abuse by partners. I became a leader among the prisoners. I decided, 'We have to do something. We have to change our attitudes.' So I started by forgiving the people who put me in prison. I encouraged the other women to do the same. Then I decided to get to work."" Susan Kigula in Luzira Women's Prison in 2013 Kigula mobilised a  choir, she wrote songs, she started playing netball and led the prison dance troupe. To keep her spirits up, she spent more time with positive thinking inmates. She learned that the men in the neighbouring wing had access to education whereas women prisoners did not. She asked the prison administration if a small group of them could take courses in History, Economics, Divinity and Management at secondary school level. The Acting Commissioner for Welfare and Rehabilitation asked Kigula how she planned to operate a school without teachers. ""Let me try and be the teacher to start with,"" she replied. They used textbooks donated by their families and the prison wardens connected them to the school in the men's prison, which started sending the women study notes to help them. They held their classes under trees. When the wardens saw the women were dedicated, they expanded the resources and allowed more classes, with Kigula and some of her friends playing a leading role. Kigula says the prison wardens would provide support and encouragement. Another motivating voice came from Alexander McLean, the young British founder of African Prisons Project, who had returned to oversee the refurbishment of the sick bay - a project that resulted in a sharp decline in deaths of inmates (from 114 the year before the refurbishment to 12 in the year of completion). ""I saw that Susan was dynamic, she mobilised and motivated people,"" says McLean. ""She had great humility - she would kneel down to speak to the prison wardens, which is the custom at that prison. She never tired of serving others."" McLean had been working with Ugandan authorities to improve conditions beyond the sick bay too. His organisation sponsored sports activities, ran mother-and-baby reading groups and adult literacy classes. Kigula acted as an intermediary between the charity and the prison authorities on a project to open a prison library. Susan Kigula arranged for the female prisoners in Luzira to have classes In 2011 Kigula and a group of other prisoners, supported by African Prisons Project, became the first Ugandan prisoners to take a correspondence course with the University of London, studying law. The project was a huge success. As time went on, prison staff would come to her for legal advice. Then Kigula started a legal clinic in prison to help fellow inmates with bail applications, writing memorandums of appeal for them, and teaching them how to represent themselves in court, if they couldn't afford a lawyer. She helped dozens of inmates get released from prison. Emboldened by her academic success, Kigula decided, even before she completed her University of London degree, to organise a petition challenging Uganda's mandatory death sentence. The process would take years. ""The Ugandan public is generally very conservative and reluctant to see what could be perceived as a softening of the law with respect to criminal justice matters,"" says McLean. Susan Kigula and 417 Others vs Attorney General is a landmark case. The petitioners, all on death row, aimed to abolish capital punishment by declaring it unconstitutional. When the Supreme Court of Uganda gave its ruling, on 21 January 2009, it did not abolish the death penalty. However it did rule that a sentence of death should not be mandatory in cases of murder, and that a condemned person should not be kept on death row indefinitely - if a convict is not executed within three years, the sentence is automatically turned into life imprisonment. And, in light of these changes, the Supreme Court ruled that death-row inmates could go back to the High Court for retrial. Kigula would have another day in court. It was at this moment, in November 2011, that she called out to her stepson, using the word ""sorry"". But Kigula says this was not a confession - as the press chose to interpret it - it was an expression of regret for what he had been through. She still proclaimed her innocence, pleading not-guilty to murder for a second time, but the court - and the media - were not convinced. The High Court reduced Kigula's sentence to 20 years, and with four taken off for her time in remand, Kigula was released from prison in 2016. To begin with, it felt like an alien, new world. ""It was like I was walking on the moon! I could not believe what was happening to me,"" she says. Her father had died while she was in prison and her mother had been killed in a road accident just two months before her release. Susan Kigula is now reunited with her 19-year-old daughter Kigula now has new goals. She wants authorities to reduce the sentence of the remaining 417 inmates from her petition - although dozens were released, like her, some are still behind bars. Working with Alexander McLean and African Prisons Project, Kigula plans to establish the world's first prison-based legal college and law firm, where prisoner lawyers would represent peers who can not afford legal help. ""The hope is to create a new generation of servant lawyers who follow in the footsteps of Susan and the others who pioneered this alongside her,"" says Alexander McLean. ""The legal system in Uganda is not like the UK's."" ""People can be put in prison for being gay, women are on death row for not being able to get care for a sick child in rural areas, or if their husbands commit crimes and can't be found. Of course there are guilty people in prison but we believe that everyone deserves due process. We believe everyone deserves a second chance to be of use to society. Susan has always maintained her innocence and she wants to serve her community."" Kigula now lives with her sister and her 19-year-old daughter. ""My daughter calls me her hero. That was all I needed to hear after 16 years away from her."" Life is good again, she says.

"This video can not be played Hundreds gathered outside Alder Hey Hospital on Thursday night Hundreds of people have staged a protest outside a hospital in Merseyside where a terminally ill toddler is being cared for. A date to switch off the life support for Alfie Evans has been set by a High Court judge following a legal battle. Alfie's parents' legal fight against the decision ultimately ended in March when theEuropean Court of Human Rights rejected their case. Merseyside Police had asked protesters at Alder Hey to be respectful. Officers said the ""large"" and ""peaceful"" protest in Liverpool on Thursday night ""did cause significant traffic disruption and inconvenience for other people trying to access the hospital"". Alfie has been at Alder Hey since December 2016 with an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease. His parents Tom Evans and Kate James, who are both in their 20s and from Liverpool, have lost cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal, and had their case rejected by the Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights. Alfie Evans has been treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital since December 2016 The family told the BBC they had a private ambulance and jet on stand-by. They say the court order would end at the point the hospital removes ventilation from Alfie, at which moment they will take over and fly him to Rome. Alder Hey say they will not allow that to happen but speaking on Thursday evening Mr Evans said they were confident they would succeed. He said: ""There's no court order to say Alfie has to stay in this hospital right now. ""The truth behind the matter is that me and Kate hold full responsibility and we can take him to our transportation van with full equipment with the doctors who have got full duty of careâ¦ and they are not allowing us so we are hoping that my solicitor is going to spin the spoon and get us out."" Alfie's parents want him to be removed from Alder Hey and taken to the Bambino Gesu hospital - which has links to the Vatican.

In February, Mr Justice Hayden ruled doctors at Alder Hey could stop treating Alfie against the wishes of his parents following hearings in the Family Division of the High Court in London and Liverpool. On Wednesday, the judge said what had happened to Alfie was ""profoundly unfair"", as the court endorsed an end-of-life care plan drawn up by specialists. He said details of that plan could not be revealed because Alfie was entitled to privacy at the end of his life.

"Songkran is known for its epic water fights and street parties When a Thai government official told women to dress carefully to prevent harassment at the Songkran festival, it brought back painful memories for model Cindy Sirinya Bishop. The Thai-American was just 17 when she was sexually harassed at the New Year celebrations. Dressed in a loose black t-shirt and three-quarter shorts, Ms Bishop found herself cornered by five men after she was separated from her friends. ""They surrounded me and tried touching me. I just ran and managed to get away from them. I haven't been to Songkran since,"" Ms Bishop told the BBC. The three-day festival, which begins on Friday, is marked by the pouring of water to symbolise washing away misfortune from the previous year. What is Songkran? Last month Sutthipong Chulcharoen, Thailand's director general of the department of local administration, encouraged women to dress appropriately to prevent sex crimes during the water festival. In response, Ms Bishop posted some clips on Instagram - along with the hashtags #DontTellMeHowToDress and #TellMenToRespect - and found plenty of people shared her dismay. The 39-year-old said the hashtags were ""targeting the idea that women are to blame for sexual harassment"". Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

It wasn't long before other women began sharing their own stories. ""I was out with a friend and a female cousin [during Songkran], wearing a turtle-necked top, sweat pants and a sweater because I get cold easily,"" said one user on Twitter. After losing track of her friends, she quickly found herself surrounded by a group of boys. ""They started to corner me... one of the guys grabbed my arm. I burst into tears. Thank god my cousin and friends came back so everything was alright. Since then, I've never gone out on Songkran."" The hidden dangers in Thailand's Songkran festival Thailand tones down Songkran Other Thai women began to share their experiences from everyday life that led to harassment. ""I once wore shorts to a 7-11 store near my house and a security guard looked at my legs and told his friend they were so appealing he wanted to touch them"" said a Thai twitter user. ""I was in junior high then. After that I've never worn shorts outside my house. Why do only women have to protect themselves? I'm sick of this."" Songkran takes place during one of Thailand's hottest months The act of washing away misfortune has seen Songkran evolve into one of the world's biggest water fights. ""Songkran is traditionally such a beautiful festival,"" said Ms Bishop. ""[But] for a lot of Thai women, it has become dangerous because they know they are going to be taken advantage of"". A 2016 survey conducted by Thailand's Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation,externalfound over half the women in a group of 1,650 had experienced some form of sexual harassment during the festival. Step outside during Songkran and you risk getting a thorough drenching Ms Bishop, who said she ""never expected"" her posts to attract so much attention, hopes to keep the conversation going beyond Songkran. ""A lot of times you hear people asking women what they were wearing when [sexual harassment occurs], not just during Songkran,"" said Ms Bishop. ""Across the globe, you have the feminist movement, the #MeToo movement, conversation on this topic is growing and in the same way, I hope in Thailand this movement continues beyond Songkran.""

"The Hellers purchased the painting, one of Chagall's early works from his time in Paris, in the 1920s A Marc Chagall painting stolen from a New York couple's home in 1988 will be returned to the family's estate after nearly 30 years, the FBI says. The 1911 painting, Othello and Desdemona, was taken from Ernest and Rose Heller's flat with more than a dozen other works of art and jewellery. The Chagall was recovered last year after a Washington, DC gallery owner twice refused to purchase the painting. He told the seller to contact the authorities for proof of ownership. ""We took the case from there,"" said Special Agent Marc Hess, a member of the FBI Art Crime Team. The Maryland man who tried to sell the work had stored it in his attic for years in a customised box he fashioned out of a door jamb and plywood, according to Mr Hess. He was given the painting in the late 1980s or early 1990s from another man who is suspected of taking it from the Upper East Side building where the Hellers lived, prosecutors said in a court filing on Thursday. The couple owned works of art by Renoir, Picasso, Hopper and Chagall, the bureau said. Mr Heller was a retired jewel importer who died in 1998 and his wife passed away in 2003. The Maryland man, who has not been named, said he planned to sell the stolen Chagall to a potential buyer, but the deal fell through after a dispute over his cut of the earnings, the FBI said. Instead, he kept the painting in his attic and attempted to sell it in 2011 and again in 2017. The painting, which depicts Shakespeare's Othello holding a sword as he gazes down at his bride, Desdemona, was still marked with the names of its owners, ""Mr + Mrs ES Heller, New York"", when the Maryland man tried to sell it, according to the Washington Post. The art gallery owner rebuffed his offer, noted that it required documents proving ownership and referred the man to the FBI, according to prosecutors. ""Well-documented and known art is very hard to move once it has been stolen,"" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Tim Carpenter. Mafia exposed as artful dodgers ""Gallery owners are our first line of defence in identifying pieces of art that do not have the appropriate documentation and should be brought to the attention of law enforcement."" Prosecutors asked a court on Thursday to approve the return of the painting to the family's estate to put up for auction. The proceeds will be given to the insurance company that paid the theft claim and to charities supported by the family estate. Statute of limitations laws on the robbery have expired, which means the suspected thief and the Maryland man will not face charges. The suspected thief was previously convicted in federal court and served a prison term in connection with selling other stolen property, the agency said. Alan Scott, an attorney for Mr Heller's estate and is the executor for Mrs Heller, told the Washington Post ""of all the works that could have been recovered, this is the one that would have pleased them the most"".

"Jeremy Hunt set up Mare Pond Properties with his wife Labour is set to refer Jeremy Hunt to the parliamentary commissioner for standards over an apparent delay in declaring his property interests. The health secretary has apologised after it was discovered he made errors over the purchase of luxury flats. Mr Hunt has a 50% interest in a firm - set up with his wife in October - but he did not declare it to Companies House until six months later. His spokesman said it was an ""honest administrative mistake"". The Telegraph,externalsaid Mr Hunt set up Mare Pond Properties in 2017 to buy seven flats in the Ocean Village development in Southampton. His spokesman said: ""Jeremy's accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight."" The minister did inform the Cabinet Office of his involvement with the company after it was set up, he added. The department has since said there was no breach of ministerial code. By BBC political reporter Jessica Parker It won't surprise anyone to know that legislation in this area is a little complicated. But essentially, in 2016, the 2006 Companies Act was amended. Companies must now register their persons of ""significant control"" - so-called PSCs - with Companies House. Initially the requirement was to update this information on an annual basis but then the law was further changed to within 28 days. What counts as a PSC? Well the conditions include someone who owns more than 25% of the shares in a company. And it's true to say that, technically, failure to stick to these rules could result in a fine or even up to two years in prison. But in reality, it seems very unlikely that Jeremy Hunt is going to face any serious legal consequences. Companies House have said their ""primary aim is to seek compliance"", suggesting that they are taking a relatively gentle approach in dealing with such oversights which, I'm told, are not uncommon. Jon Trickett, Labour's shadow secretary for the Cabinet Office, said Mr Hunt's behaviour was ""simply unacceptable"" and his party would be taking the matter further. ""Labour will today refer Jeremy Hunt to the standards commissioner to look into this serious breach,"" he said. ""He should have had the decency to refer himself rather than sweep this under the carpet."" Mr Hunt's spokesman said:  ""Although there was no personal gain involved, Jeremy accepts these mistakes are his responsibility and has apologised to the parliamentary authorities."" A Downing Street spokesman said it was right that the minister had apologised for the ""administrative oversight"", but agreed with the Cabinet Office that there was no breach of the ministerial code.

"People are angry over the brutal rape and murder of Asifa Bano The brutal gang rape and murder of an eight-year old girl has sparked outrage and anger across India.

"Russia is an ally of Syria and gives military backing to its government Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said a reported chemical attack in Syria was staged by foreign agents. A spokesman for Russia's defence ministry accused the UK of being involved in staging the attack. The US and France say they have proof it took place and, alongside the UK, are considering military retaliation. Russia, which has military forces deployed in Syria in support of the government, has warned that Western air strikes risk starting a war. During a press briefing on Friday, Mr Lavrov said he had ""irrefutable evidence"" that the attack was staged as part of a ""Russophobic campaign"" led by one country, which he did not name. Why is the West considering strikes? Firepower of key countries What can Western military intervention achieve? Are we heading for a third world war? General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia's defence ministry, said: ""We have... evidence that proves Britain was directly involved in  organising this provocation."" The UK's envoy to the UN has called this a ""grotesque, blatant lie"", Reuters news agency reports. The White House says it is continuing to assess intelligence and talk to its allies about how to respond. Meanwhile the UN's secretary general has said the Middle East is ""in chaos"" and the Cold War is ""back with a vengeance"". Antonio Guterres was speaking to a special meeting of the UN Security Council, called by Russia. He urged countries to ""act responsibly in these dangerous circumstances"". A delegation from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will arrive in Syria's Eastern Ghouta region on Saturday. Few details are expected to be released about the movements of the chemical weapons inspectors, for safety reasons. The suspected attack, denied by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, was carried out in the Eastern Ghouta town of Douma on Saturday, reportedly killing dozens of people. Control over the town has since passed from rebels to the Syrian and Russian military authorities. The Violations Documentation Center (VDC), a Syrian opposition network which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, said bodies were found foaming at the mouth, and with discoloured skin and cornea burns. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack On Thursday, unnamed US officials told NBC News they had obtained blood and urine samples from victims which had tested positive for chlorine and a nerve agent. Syria 'chemical attack': What we know The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, told the network: ""We definitely have enough proof but now we just have to be thoughtful in our action."" French President Emmanuel Macron also said he had ""proof"" that the Syrian government had attacked Doumawith chemical weapons but did not give further details. A UN report last year found the Syrian government responsible for a deadly chemical attackon the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, in which more than 80 people died. That attack was followed by a US cruise missile attack on a Syrian airbase. In the UK, cabinet ministers agreed it was ""highly likely"" the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for the alleged attack and said the use of chemical weapons must not ""go unchallenged"". During a phone call on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May and US President Donald Trump had agreed to ""keep working closely"" on the issue, Mrs May's office said. This video can not be played Trump: Decisions on Syria will be made ""fairly soon"" The US president has said Russian President Vladimir Putin bears responsibility for the alleged attack in Douma because of his support for the Syrian government. On Wednesday he warned Russia that missiles were ""coming"" but later tweeted that he had ""never said when"".It ""could be very soon or not so soon at all"", Mr Trump said,external. What can Macron and Trump do? The significance of Eastern Ghouta's fall Why is there a war in Syria? Russia has described the reports of a chemical attack as a ""provocation"" designed to justify Western intervention. Moscow's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused Washington of putting international peace at risk. ""The immediate priority is to avert the danger of war,""  he said on Thursday. Senior Russian figures, including the head of the military, have warned that US missiles will be shot down and their launch sites targeted if Russian personnel come under threat. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich criticised Mr Trump's rhetoric. ""We cannot depend on the mood of someone on the other side of the ocean when he wakes up,"" the Tass news agency quoted him as saying. After six weeks of heavy fighting and an estimated 1,700 civilian deaths in the Eastern Ghouta, rebels are now leaving the area. The final evacuations of about 4,000 remaining Islamist fighters and civilians were taking place on Friday, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring organisation.

"Sara Danius is the latest member of the Swedish Academy to step down The head of the Swedish Academy - the prestigious body that awards the Nobel Prize in Literature - has stepped down in the wake of a sexual abuse scandal. The organisation has been criticised for its handling of a probe into the alleged sexual misconduct of a man married to one of its members. ""It has already affected the Nobel Prize quite severely and that is quite a big problem,"" said Professor Sara Danius, as she stood down. The accused denies all the allegations. ""It was the wish of the Academy that I should leave my role as Permanent Secretary,"" Ms Danius told reporters on Thursday. ""I have made this decision with immediate effect."" Last November, inspired by the #MeToo campaign,18 women made allegations of sexual assault and harassment against Jean-Claude Arnault,external, the husband of Academy member Katarina Frostenson. After the Academy voted against removing Ms Frostenson last week, three of its members Klas Ostergren, Kjell Espmark and Peter Englund withdrew from the 18-person committee in protest, Swedish media reported. While they cannot technically resign from their positions, which are for life, they can stop participating in the Academy's activities. Is #meToo changing Hollywood? 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse The Nobel body had cut all ties and funding to Mr Arnault, who runs a cultural club in Stockholm, shortly after the allegations came to light. The Swedish Academy said at the time that it had potentially broken its own rules regulating conflict of interest and appointed a legal firm to investigate its committee members' links with Mr Arnault. His lawyer told Reuters that he rejected all the claims against him. Mr Arnault - a cultural figure in Sweden - did not attend last year's Nobel Prize banquet following the allegations against him ""Jean-Claude Arnault rejects all claims of criminal activity and he rejects other allegations that have been made against him,"" Bjorn Hurtig said in an email. None of the sexual misconduct allegations had been reported to the police when the scandal broke last year, but state prosecutors opened a preliminary investigation into the incidents. Last month, they said some parts of their probe had been shelved due to a lack of evidence and because the statute of limitations had passed for some of the allegations. However, the investigation related to some incidents was continuing, prosecutors confirmed. Is #meToo changing Hollywood?

"The Hellers purchased the painting, one of Chagall's early works from his time in Paris, in the 1920s A Marc Chagall painting stolen from a New York couple's home in 1988 will be returned to the family's estate after nearly 30 years, the FBI says. The 1911 painting, Othello and Desdemona, was taken from Ernest and Rose Heller's flat with more than a dozen other works of art and jewellery. The Chagall was recovered last year after a Washington, DC gallery owner twice refused to purchase the painting. He told the seller to contact the authorities for proof of ownership. ""We took the case from there,"" said Special Agent Marc Hess, a member of the FBI Art Crime Team. The Maryland man who tried to sell the work had stored it in his attic for years in a customised box he fashioned out of a door jamb and plywood, according to Mr Hess. He was given the painting in the late 1980s or early 1990s from another man who is suspected of taking it from the Upper East Side building where the Hellers lived, prosecutors said in a court filing on Thursday. The couple owned works of art by Renoir, Picasso, Hopper and Chagall, the bureau said. Mr Heller was a retired jewel importer who died in 1998 and his wife passed away in 2003. The Maryland man, who has not been named, said he planned to sell the stolen Chagall to a potential buyer, but the deal fell through after a dispute over his cut of the earnings, the FBI said. Instead, he kept the painting in his attic and attempted to sell it in 2011 and again in 2017. The painting, which depicts Shakespeare's Othello holding a sword as he gazes down at his bride, Desdemona, was still marked with the names of its owners, ""Mr + Mrs ES Heller, New York"", when the Maryland man tried to sell it, according to the Washington Post. The art gallery owner rebuffed his offer, noted that it required documents proving ownership and referred the man to the FBI, according to prosecutors. ""Well-documented and known art is very hard to move once it has been stolen,"" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Tim Carpenter. Mafia exposed as artful dodgers ""Gallery owners are our first line of defence in identifying pieces of art that do not have the appropriate documentation and should be brought to the attention of law enforcement."" Prosecutors asked a court on Thursday to approve the return of the painting to the family's estate to put up for auction. The proceeds will be given to the insurance company that paid the theft claim and to charities supported by the family estate. Statute of limitations laws on the robbery have expired, which means the suspected thief and the Maryland man will not face charges. The suspected thief was previously convicted in federal court and served a prison term in connection with selling other stolen property, the agency said. Alan Scott, an attorney for Mr Heller's estate and is the executor for Mrs Heller, told the Washington Post ""of all the works that could have been recovered, this is the one that would have pleased them the most"".

"Jeremy Hunt set up Mare Pond Properties with his wife Labour is set to refer Jeremy Hunt to the parliamentary commissioner for standards over an apparent delay in declaring his property interests. The health secretary has apologised after it was discovered he made errors over the purchase of luxury flats. Mr Hunt has a 50% interest in a firm - set up with his wife in October - but he did not declare it to Companies House until six months later. His spokesman said it was an ""honest administrative mistake"". The Telegraph,externalsaid Mr Hunt set up Mare Pond Properties in 2017 to buy seven flats in the Ocean Village development in Southampton. His spokesman said: ""Jeremy's accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight."" The minister did inform the Cabinet Office of his involvement with the company after it was set up, he added. The department has since said there was no breach of ministerial code. By BBC political reporter Jessica Parker It won't surprise anyone to know that legislation in this area is a little complicated. But essentially, in 2016, the 2006 Companies Act was amended. Companies must now register their persons of ""significant control"" - so-called PSCs - with Companies House. Initially the requirement was to update this information on an annual basis but then the law was further changed to within 28 days. What counts as a PSC? Well the conditions include someone who owns more than 25% of the shares in a company. And it's true to say that, technically, failure to stick to these rules could result in a fine or even up to two years in prison. But in reality, it seems very unlikely that Jeremy Hunt is going to face any serious legal consequences. Companies House have said their ""primary aim is to seek compliance"", suggesting that they are taking a relatively gentle approach in dealing with such oversights which, I'm told, are not uncommon. Jon Trickett, Labour's shadow secretary for the Cabinet Office, said Mr Hunt's behaviour was ""simply unacceptable"" and his party would be taking the matter further. ""Labour will today refer Jeremy Hunt to the standards commissioner to look into this serious breach,"" he said. ""He should have had the decency to refer himself rather than sweep this under the carpet."" Mr Hunt's spokesman said:  ""Although there was no personal gain involved, Jeremy accepts these mistakes are his responsibility and has apologised to the parliamentary authorities."" A Downing Street spokesman said it was right that the minister had apologised for the ""administrative oversight"", but agreed with the Cabinet Office that there was no breach of the ministerial code.

Transport for London (TfL) say the three incidents happened within 11 weeks. The driver is said to have agreed to being ""redeployed"" to a role on a station, but union Aslef dispute this. Passengers have been warned to expect some delays to the line on Friday. Nigel Holness, director of operations for London Underground, said: ""With so many incidents in a short space of time, despite several weeks of training and assistance, it was simply not safe for this employee to continue in a role as a driver."" TfL said the impact of the strike is ""expected to be minimal"" in central London, but there will be ""more time"" between trains on the western branch of the line and east of Tower Hill. There will be no services to Kensington (Olympia). Finn Brennan, of the train driver's union Aslef, claimed London Underground bosses ""threatened a disciplinary hearing to make the driver 'agree' to being redeployed"". ""Instead of recognising the concerns of our members, and reps, management are refusing to acknowledge that they have failed to follow their own procedures and now refuse to talk to this union."" The District Line is the fifth largest across the Tube network and serves 226 million passengers a year.

"The BBC has defended a decision to air Enoch Powell's 1968 ""Rivers of Blood"" speech on Radio 4. The Archive on 4 programme, presented by BBC media editor Amol Rajan, will on Saturday broadcast the right-wing MP's anti-immigration speech - voiced by an actor - in full, for the first time. The decision to do so was criticised as an ""incitement to racial hatred"". The BBC said there would be ""rigorous journalistic analysis"" and the show was not endorsing controversial views. Delivered to local Conservative Party members in Birmingham, days before the second reading of the 1968 Race Relations Bill, then MP Powell referenced observations made by his Wolverhampton constituents including ""in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man"". He ended with a quote from Virgil's Aeneid, when civil war in Italy is predicted with ""the River Tiber foaming with much blood"". The anti-immigration speech ended his career in Edward Heath's shadow cabinet. The Race Relations Act made it illegal to refuse housing, employment or public services to people because of their ethnic background. Allow Twitter content?

Marking 50 years since the speech, Archive on 4 plans to reflect its enduring influence and significance. The full text will be read by actor Ian McDiarmid, whoplayed Powell on stagein the play What Shadows but is probably best known for playing Emperor Palpatine in the Star Wars films. But Lord Adonis has called for the broadcast on Saturday to be cancelled, and has written to the regulator Ofcom. ""What is happening to our public service broadcaster?"" theLabour peer wrote,externalon Twitter. He said the speech was the ""worst incitement to racial violence by a public figure in modern Britain"". ""Obviously this matter will be raised in parliament"" should the broadcast go ahead, he wrote to Ofcom. Earlier this week,Remain supporter Lord Adonis wrote to the BBC,externalto make a formal complaint about its Brexit coverage, describing it as ""fundamentally corrupted"".

One contributor to the programme, Dr Shirin Hirsch from the University of Wolverhampton, has since tweeted that she ""made a mistake,external"" in being interviewed for it and was ""sick with worry since seeing the way this is being presented"". ""We can study racists without platforming and amplifying the racist things they say,""said another Twitter user,external. The BBC said: ""This is a rigorous journalistic analysis of a historical political speech. It's not an endorsement of the controversial views and people should wait to hear the programme before they judge it."" Ofcom said its position as a post-broadcast regulator meant it would not ""check or approve any broadcaster's editorial content before transmission"".

"Songkran is known for its epic water fights and street parties When a Thai government official told women to dress carefully to prevent harassment at the Songkran festival, it brought back painful memories for model Cindy Sirinya Bishop. The Thai-American was just 17 when she was sexually harassed at the New Year celebrations. Dressed in a loose black t-shirt and three-quarter shorts, Ms Bishop found herself cornered by five men after she was separated from her friends. ""They surrounded me and tried touching me. I just ran and managed to get away from them. I haven't been to Songkran since,"" Ms Bishop told the BBC. The three-day festival, which begins on Friday, is marked by the pouring of water to symbolise washing away misfortune from the previous year. What is Songkran? Last month Sutthipong Chulcharoen, Thailand's director general of the department of local administration, encouraged women to dress appropriately to prevent sex crimes during the water festival. In response, Ms Bishop posted some clips on Instagram - along with the hashtags #DontTellMeHowToDress and #TellMenToRespect - and found plenty of people shared her dismay. The 39-year-old said the hashtags were ""targeting the idea that women are to blame for sexual harassment"". Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

It wasn't long before other women began sharing their own stories. ""I was out with a friend and a female cousin [during Songkran], wearing a turtle-necked top, sweat pants and a sweater because I get cold easily,"" said one user on Twitter. After losing track of her friends, she quickly found herself surrounded by a group of boys. ""They started to corner me... one of the guys grabbed my arm. I burst into tears. Thank god my cousin and friends came back so everything was alright. Since then, I've never gone out on Songkran."" The hidden dangers in Thailand's Songkran festival Thailand tones down Songkran Other Thai women began to share their experiences from everyday life that led to harassment. ""I once wore shorts to a 7-11 store near my house and a security guard looked at my legs and told his friend they were so appealing he wanted to touch them"" said a Thai twitter user. ""I was in junior high then. After that I've never worn shorts outside my house. Why do only women have to protect themselves? I'm sick of this."" Songkran takes place during one of Thailand's hottest months The act of washing away misfortune has seen Songkran evolve into one of the world's biggest water fights. ""Songkran is traditionally such a beautiful festival,"" said Ms Bishop. ""[But] for a lot of Thai women, it has become dangerous because they know they are going to be taken advantage of"". A 2016 survey conducted by Thailand's Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation,externalfound over half the women in a group of 1,650 had experienced some form of sexual harassment during the festival. Step outside during Songkran and you risk getting a thorough drenching Ms Bishop, who said she ""never expected"" her posts to attract so much attention, hopes to keep the conversation going beyond Songkran. ""A lot of times you hear people asking women what they were wearing when [sexual harassment occurs], not just during Songkran,"" said Ms Bishop. ""Across the globe, you have the feminist movement, the #MeToo movement, conversation on this topic is growing and in the same way, I hope in Thailand this movement continues beyond Songkran.""
