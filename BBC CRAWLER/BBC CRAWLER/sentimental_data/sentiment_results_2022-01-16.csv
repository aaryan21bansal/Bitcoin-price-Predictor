"Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said the next announcement about the BBC licence fee will be the last - and it was time to discuss new ways to fund and sell ""great British content"". She said ""the days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on doors"" were over. Her comments come as unconfirmed reports say the government is expected to freeze the Â£159 fee for two years. A BBC source said there had been similar speculation before. The licence fee's existence is guaranteed until at least 31 December 2027 by the BBC's royal charter, which sets out the broadcaster's funding and purpose. The annual fee is then set by the government, which announced in 2016 that it would rise in line with inflation for five years from April 2017. Money raised from the licence fee pays for BBC shows and services - including TV, radio, the BBC website, podcasts, iPlayer and apps. Lengthy negotiations have already taken place between BBC bosses and the government over a future funding settlement, with the idea of freezing the licence fee discussed back in October.

A government source confirmed the BBC discussions over the licence fee were ongoing. But they said the culture secretary recognised pressure on people's wallets - and the licence fee was an ""important bill"" for people on low incomes and pensioners, which ministers could control. A BBC source said of the fee freeze: ""Anything less than inflation would put unacceptable pressure on the BBC finances after years of cuts."" They added there were ""very good reasons for investing in what the BBC can do for the British public, and the creative industries and the UK around the world"". Previously, Ms Dorries, who was appointed culture secretary last September, saidshe thought the BBC should exist, but it needed to be able to take on competitors such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. At the Conservative party conference in October, Ms Dorriessaid the broadcaster needed ""real change""in order to represent the entire UK and accused it of ""groupthink"". The BBC was ""a beacon for the world"", she said, but she thought people who had worked their way up had a similar background, a certain political bias and thought and talked the same. Do I need a TV licence and what does it pay for? PM: BBC must 'cough up' for over-75s TV licences Labour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell accused the prime minister and Ms Dorries of seeming ""hell-bent on attacking this great British institution because they don't like its journalism"". ""British broadcasting and our creative industries are renowned around the world and should be at the heart of global Britain,"" she said. Liberal Democrat culture spokesperson Jamie Stone said freezing the licence fee would be a ""stealth cut of almost Â£2bn"" that would put services at risk. ""The government must stop this reckless ideological crusade and back off our BBC,"" he added. In 2020, people over 75 began paying for their TV licence, which had previously been free. Funding for this had come from the government, but responsibility for this policy was handed to the BBC after the last funding settlement. In 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the BBC should ""cough up"" and pay for TV licences for all over-75s but the BBC said doing so would force ""unprecedented closures"" of services. Now, only over-75s on pension credit are eligible for a free licence, paid for by the BBC. TV licence evasion itself is not an imprisonable offence. However, the government says non-payment of the fine, following a criminal conviction, could lead to a risk of imprisonment - ""a last resort"" after other methods of enforcement have failed. Last year, the government decided not to move ahead with plans to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee, but said it would ""remain under active consideration"". And so as the BBC turns 100, a British government officially turns against the licence fee as the best way to fund it. Nadine Dorries is not arguing against the existence of the BBC, but is now formally opposed to a compulsory levy on households that watch TV. She argues that it potentially criminalises the vulnerable, including the elderly. Defenders of the licence fee argue it is the least bad mechanism, and moving to a Netflix-style subscription model would force the BBC to serve subscribers rather than be universal. It comes after lengthy negotiations between the government and the BBC over the future funding settlement. The actual negotiation over how the BBC is funded after 2027 is still several years away. Dorries tweeted a link to aMail on Sunday article,externalsuggesting that, amid a cost of living crisis, the fee would be held at Â£159 for two years - amounting to a real terms cut of hundreds of millions. The BBC is also under relentless financial and creative pressure from streaming giants such as Apple and Amazon. Its future depends above all on whether it can persuade young people to pay for it.

"Djokovic boarded a flight at Melbourne airport on Sunday Novak Djokovic has been deported from Australia after losing a last-ditch court bid to stay in the country. Judges rejected a challenge by the unvaccinated tennis star after theÂ government cancelledÂ his visa on ""health and good order"" grounds. Djokovic said he was ""extremely disappointed"" but accepted the ruling. He has left on a flight to Dubai. It marks the end of a 10-day saga, in which the Serb fought to stay to defend his title in the Australian Open. Djokovic's supporters fell silent outside the courtroom as the decision was announced on the eve of what would have been his opening match in the tournament. One fan told the BBC her summer would be ""empty"" without the 34-year-old playing at the Open. Supporters of the Serbian tennis star gathered outside the court on Sunday Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed ""the decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe"" but his government faces criticism at home and abroad for its handling of the affair. Djokovic launched his case after Immigration Minister Alex Hawke used his powers to cancel his visa, arguing his presence in the country risked fanning anti-vaccine sentiment. What next for Djokovic? The politics behind Australia's Djokovic decision Why Djokovic is a polarising player During Sunday's court hearing before a three-judge panel, Djokovic's defence unsuccessfully argued that the grounds given by the government were illogical because to deport the star also risked fanning anti-vaccine sentiment. Chief Justice James Allsop said the court ruling was based on the legality of the minister's decision, not on whether it was the right decision to make. This video can not be played Moment Djokovic learns his Australian Open fate He promised to release the full reasoning for the ruling in the coming days. There has been much public anger in Australia over the player's attempt to enter the country without being vaccinated against Covid-19. The federal government has repeatedly said people must comply with the strict laws in place to deal with the pandemic, and that no-one is ""above the law"". Djokovic was originally granted a medical exemption to enter Australia by two different independent health panels - one commissioned by Tennis Australia, the other by the state government of Victoria - after testing positive for coronavirus in mid-December. However, the Australian Border Force detained him on 5 January for not meeting federal coronavirus requirements, and his visa was revoked. Djokovic had been training in Melbourne for the Australian Open A judge overturned that decision but the government stepped in last Friday to revoke the visa again, saying it was in the public interest. Although Djokovic is not vaccinated against Covid-19, he has not actively promoted anti-vax disinformation. However,Â Australian anti-vaxxers have been using the hashtag #IStandWithDjokovic on social media. Mr Morrison said the centre-right government was ""prepared to take the decisions and actions necessary to protect the integrity"" of the country's borders. But Kristina Keneally, a senator for the opposition Labor Party, said Mr Morrison had made himself a ""laughing stock on the world stage"" by mishandling the Djokovic case. The government's ""litany of failures"",she tweeted,external, had ""undermined Australia's border security settings, & provided a lightning rod for the anti-vaccination movement"". A former Labor prime minister, Kevin Rudd,tweeted,externalthat the ""political circus"" could have been avoided had a visa not been issued in the first place. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic accused the Morrison government of conducting a ""witch hunt"". ""He [Djokovic] came to Australia with a medical exemption proposal and then you were mistreating him for 10 days,"" he said. ""Why did you do it? Doing a witch hunt against him? This is something that no one can understand."" The Australian Open could have seen Djokovic make history by winning his 21st Grand Slam. Italy's Salvatore Caruso,Â ranked 150th in the world, is the ""lucky loser"" who will now replace DjokovicÂ in his match against Serbia's Miomir Kecmanovic on Monday. Djokovic said he was ""uncomfortable"" with the focus placed on him as a result of the the visa row, adding: ""I hope that we can all now focus on the game and tournament I love."" He said he was ""taking some time to rest and to recuperate"" before commenting further. Deportation orders usually include a three-year ban on returning to Australia, though this can be waived in certain circumstances. The episode raises further questions for Djokovic, plus other tennis players who are reluctant to be vaccinated against Covid-19, for the season ahead. Any player eyeing tournaments in America, for instance, will be aware that non-US citizens must be fully vaccinated to travel to the country ""with only limited exceptions"". Former Swedish star Mats Wilander told Eurosport that Djokovic's career was ""on the line and he might have to do something that he doesn't really want to do"". The men's tennis governing body ATP called the saga a ""deeply regrettable series of events"", while British tennis star Andy Murray said the situation was  ""not good"" for anyone.

"The powerful storm uprooted trees, making some roads impassable in Charlotte, North Carolina A major winter storm has brought heavy snow and ice to parts of the US and Canada, putting more than 80 million people under weather warnings. More than 145,000 people are without power in some south-eastern states, and thousands of flights are cancelled. Virginia, Georgia, and North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency. The US National Weather Service (NWS) says more than 1ft (30cm) of snow is expected in some areas. Snow and ice could result in ""dangerous travel, power outages, and tree damage"", the NWS warned. Highway patrols reported hundreds of vehicle accidents, according to the Associated Press news agency. There were also forecasts of possible coastal flooding in some areas, including in New York City and parts of Connecticut, with warnings that roads and infrastructure could be affected. This video can not be played More disruption possible from US Storm In Canada's Ontario province, which shares a border with New York state, officials issued storm warnings on Sunday morning for much of the south. Toronto, the capital of the province and Canada's largest city, is forecast to get seven inches (20cm) of snow. More than 3,000 flights into and out of the US were cancelled on Sunday, according to the FlightAware data tracking website. Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina was among the worst hit, with almost 90% of flights scrapped, and a message on its website urged passengers to check with their airlines before travelling to the airport. How to stay safe in freezing weather In South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster called on residents to stay off the roads. ""This is going to be a pretty bad storm in the upper part of the state,"" he said, adding that it was ""good news"" that the storm was forecast to hit on a weekend and on a public holiday on Monday, when fewer people would need to travel. ""Hopefully, the storm will underdeliver, but it could overdeliver. We just don't know,"" Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said as he announced preparations for his state.

"Judith Criddle uses a volunteer-run community food store in Cardiff to do her weekly shopping Money has been so tight for grandmother Judith Criddle, she only ever puts her heating on when her six grandchildren visit - despite the cold weather. Even then, Judith can only afford to put it on for an hour so she wraps her grandchildren in a blanket on the sofa with hot water bottles to keep warm. ""To them it's a movie night, cuddling in to nan - but to me, I'm doing it to save the money,"" said the 51-year-old. Judith is one of the millions affected by the UK's cost of living crisis. Prices are rising at thefastest rate in more than 10 yearsandone think tank has warnedit could get worse with predictions that higher energy bills, stagnant wages and tax rises could leave households with an extra Â£1,200-a-year hit to their incomes. Judith, who is onuniversal credit, said she was trying to cut back on using energy as much as she can, but ""if it goes up any more I can't afford to live"". Five items that are going up in price and why Half of families Â£110 a year worse off since 2019 How can the government solve the energy crisis? Areport,externalfrom the Resolution Foundation also warned a rise in the energy price cap - where energy bills could more than double - and National Insurance contributions in April means families are facing a ""year of the squeeze"" in 2022. Even now Judith can't afford a haircut or to have an occasional social drink with friends in Cardiff. Judith says she can't afford a hair cut and worries every months about how to pay her bills She is one of the four in 10 families in Wales living below the poverty line, according to poverty campaigners Bevan Foundation. So while Judith's grandchildren think their movie night is a bit of fun with their nan, the actual reason is far from that. ""I'll put the heating on, say for an hour, to take the chill off,"" she said. ""But then I'll put blankets on because I couldn't afford to have it on all the time. ""I'm worried about the month ahead, never mind the year."" Judith does her weekly shopping at a community food store, run by a local charity, in the Caerau area of Cardiff. The community food store where Judith shops sells a food parcel with Â£20 worth of food for Â£5 Your Local Pantry - which helps families in Ely and Caerau, parts of which are among Wales' most deprived areas - relies on donations of groceries and food schemes to keep prices down. A weekly shop costs a fiver but its 132 members get around four times that price in food. Alex Withey has been volunteering at the Pantry and, like Judith, the 52-year-old receives universal credit. The Pantry in Cardiff is run by a local poverty charity Action Caerau and Ely ""This is 2022 and people are having to decide whether to put their heating on or have a meal,"" he said. ""Every month I'm thinking how much to pay for food, how much to pay for fuel. As it goes up, obviously it's going to have to be less for food and more for fuel. ""That's wrong. It's always the poor that get hit first."" Alex says he has Â£100 to spend on bills and he can't afford both food and electric or gas Inequality campaigners say people's health and living standards will suffer because of the cost of living rise, with the Bevan Foundation estimating a third of Welsh families are already cutting their energy use while a quarter are cutting back on food. The Bevan Foundation also claims the impact of the Covid pandemic is pushing more households - about 40,000 - into poverty. ""Around a quarter of families in Wales were living in poverty before the pandemic,"" said Dr Steffan Evans, the foundation's head of policy. Warning of UK cost of living 'squeeze' in 2022 Government discusses support for higher fuel bills Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too ""A lot of them were having to make these difficult decisions anyway, but more people have been affected."" Families are bracing themselves to pay more for their energy as industry experts predict those that were paying Â£850 on average last year will see their bills rise to more than Â£1,700. Fuel poverty charity National Energy Action is calling on the UK government to consider ""meaningful"" targeted financial support for the most vulnerable customers. This video can not be played Rising costs resulting in ""nerve-racking"" times for families on a budget ""That could include increasing thewarm home discount, it could mean extending the winter fuel payments to those who might not otherwise be eligible for that, or it could also mean helping clear energy debts,"" said Ben Saltmarsh, of National Energy Action. ""The key thing is we need targeted support to those who need it the most, and urgently. People simply will not be able to cope."" The Welsh government said it was aware households in Wales were under ""unprecedented financial pressure"" due to the cost of living ""crisis"" and the UK government's ""cruel"" decision toend the Universal Credit uplift. The Treasury said it had helped provide more than Â£4.2bn of support to families per year, on top of other support for living standards. ""We know people are facing pressure with the cost of living - which is why we're taking billions of pounds worth of decisive action to help,"" said a UK government spokesperson. ""Our support includes reducing theuniversal credit taper- a tax cut worth over Â£2bn - increasing the minimum wage and supporting households with their bills... as well as freezing alcohol and fuel duty.""

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: There has been ""industrial scale partying"" at Downing Street Sir Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of breaking Covid laws with parties held in Downing Street during lockdown. The Labour leader said the prime minister had ""lied"" about ""industrial scale partying"" in No 10. Six Tory MPs have now called on the PM to resign over gatherings held during restrictions. But Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden said the PM would take action over the ""underlying culture"" in Downing Street. Mr Dowden told the BBC the PM was ""committed"" to doing this when he responds to an official inquiry on events in government buildings. The internal investigation, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, is expected to be published as soon as the coming week. The Metropolitan Police said it had""ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office""over Ms Gray's inquiry. The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held How many No 10 lockdown parties do we know about? Will two Tory tribes go to war with the PM? However, Sir Keir told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme he did not need to wait for the report to conclude that Mr Johnson broke the rules. ""The facts speak for themselves, and the country has made up its mind,"" he said, adding it was ""blindingly obvious what's happened"". ""I think he broke the law, I think he's as good as admitted that he broke the law,"" he added. Speaking on the same programme, Mr Dowden said he shared the public's anger, but it was right to wait for Ms Gray to ""establish the full facts"". ""The task for us now is how we address the underlying culture in Downing Street,"" he said. ""We need to up our game, and that needs to be addressed, and I know the prime minister is committed to addressing that."" Sue Gray's report is a fact-finding mission but within government it is expected she will say whether various gatherings were appropriate or not. She will not say whether gatherings or parties broke the law - or what any punishments should be. There is no date scheduled for its publication yet. The hope is it can be published as soon as possible - possibly by the end of the week. However, I understand because some allegations have just come to light, it is possible it could be published the week after. Mr Dowden also appeared on Sky's Trevor Phillips On Sunday where the presenter held back tears recalling his daughter's death during the pandemic. Phillips said his daughter, who he said was very ill and had isolated for months, collapsed and later died on a weekend in April 2021 when it has emerged parties took place in Downing Street on the eve of Prince Phillip's funeral. ""She had stuck to the spirit and letter of the rules, and there are going to be thousands of people who have that story in their background,"" he said. ""And, if I may say so, you are in here telling me about a civil servant's inquiry, that will not answer that anger. ""Does the prime minister really understand why people are angry?"" Meanwhile, former minister Tim Loughton has become the sixth Tory MP to call on Mr Johnson to resign, calling his position ""untenable"". In a Facebook post, he added the public deserved ""clarity, honesty and contrition"" instead of ""obfuscation, prevarication and evasion"". ANALYSIS:What was really going on in No 10 during lockdown? LAURA KUENSSBERG:What next for Johnson after party apology? PROFILE:Party investigator Sue Gray TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings Pressure on Mr Johnson has been growing since he admitted he attended a gathering in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020, during the first Covid lockdown. As many as 100 people were invited to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" in an email on behalf of the prime minister's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson told MPs he had ""believed implicitly"" it was a work event, but admitted: ""With hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside"". But Labour has accused Mr Johnson of ""holding the British public in contempt"", after theSunday Times reported,externalhe had been warned to cancel the event after the email went out. In response to the report, a No 10 spokesperson said: ""It is untrue that the prime minister was warned about the event in advance."" On Friday, Downing Streetapologised to the Queenafter it emerged two staff parties were held at No 10 on the night before Prince Philip's funeral in April 2021. Mr Johnson was not at either event but his spokesman said it was ""deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning"". The parties have been added to a growing list of events in government buildings currently being investigated by Ms Gray. This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says she understands why ""people across the country are angry"" Speaking on Times Radio on Sunday, former Labour PM Tony Blair said he understood why people would feel ""enraged"" at the party revelations. ""I can also, from the perspective of Downing Street, understand how these things happen,"" he said. But he added: ""You can explain it, but not really excuse it."" During his BBC interview, Sir Keir also said a picture of him drinking beer in an office last spring did not show a breach of Covid rules in place at the time. The Labour leader said the picture, which first emerged last year, showed him in a constituency office in the run-up to the Hartlepool by-election. ""We were very busy. We were working in the office,"" he told presenter Sophie Raworth when challenged about the image. ""We stopped for something to eat and then we carried on working. No party, no breach of the rules and absolutely no comparison with the prime minister."" The government has faced intense pressure over events held in an around Downing Street. 10 May 2020 Boris Johnson announced a plan to take the “first careful steps"" out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to ""obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them”. Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, “those people were at work talking about work”. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” on behalf of the prime ministerâs principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had “gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes”. Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. 17 July 2020 Boris Johnson announced plans for a “significant return to normality"" in England by Christmas ""through targeted, local action” instead of national lockdowns. But he added that the timetable relied on “every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly”. 5 November 2020 With cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” as a new national lockdown began. He said people should only leave their homes “for work if you canât work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies”. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. 13 November 2020 Sources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. 2 December 2020 The second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with “tough tiers to keep this virus down”. London was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party. 15 December 2020 Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing. 16 December 2020 London moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important “everyone is cautious” ahead of the festive period. The Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it “inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment” by staff. 17 December 2020 A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions. Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was “truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result”. 18 December 2020 Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street. However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” 14 January 2021 A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries. 12 April 2021 Lockdown restrictions were eased in England, with pubs and restaurants allowed to reopen with outdoor service only. However, working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households. 16 April 2021 Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral. One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it “should not have happened at the time that it did”. Boris Johnson was not at either party. A DIAGNOSIS THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING:How do we cope when our bodies and minds no longer behave how we want them to?

"Cladding being removed from a tower block in Manchester Campaigners have urged Norway's giant state investment fund to pressure cladding firms and builders to fix fire safety issues. Grenfell survivors and leaseholders affected by the cladding crisis called on Norges Bank to pull Â£5.7bn of funds from companies if they fail to do so. Lucy Brown-Cortes of the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign said pressure from shareholders was ""overdue"". Norges said it had raised product safety with several of the companies. The cladding crisis has left many people with huge bills to fix unsafe homes. After the Grenfell fire, which killed 72 people in 2017, flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in hundreds of blocks of flats across the UK. Removing cladding can cost millions of pounds per block. The cost has often been passed on to flat owners under the leasehold system in England and Wales. Many leaseholders have also seen sharply increasing service charges, and some have had to pay for so-called ""waking watch"" fire wardens. Will flat owners be refunded for cladding costs? Unsafe cladding firms ordered to pay to fix homes Dangerous cladding: I feel 'trapped and helpless' A letter was sent to the boss of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) demanding action on Friday, as first reported bythe Sunday Times,external. Its signatories include End Our Cladding Scandal, UK Cladding Action Group, Grenfell United, Action for Fire Safety Justice, the National Leasehold Campaign, Leasehold Knowledge Partnership and Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley. ""This crisis has meant that at least 3,000,000 leaseholders are trapped in flammable flats they cannot sell, they are financing interim fire safety costs that they cannot afford to pay, and facing repossession/forfeiture over life-changing bills to make homes safe,"" the letter says. Nicolai Tangen, the chief executive of NBIM, should ""leverage its position as major shareholder"", it says, to push 11 firms to fix safety issues and provide compensation to victims of the Grenfell fire. NBIM should ""divest its holdings in these firms if they fail to do so"", the letter adds. The fund is an investor in three companies that were involved in producing materials used on Grenfell Tower: Kingspan, Arconic and Saint-Gobain. NBIM also has stakes in different housebuilders, as pointed out by the campaigners, such as Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley, Crest Nicholson, LendLease, Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Vistry. Ms Brown-Cortes told the BBC that campaigners wanted to see NBIM ""live up to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials and leverage their position"" as a major shareholder in some property developers. The biggest sovereign wealth fund in the world promotes itself as a ""responsible"" investor in more than 9,000 companies globally. It has previously cut tobacco companies from its portfolio, for example. In its response to the campaigners, NBIM said it had ""raised product safety with several of the companies mentioned in your letter"" and it was a topic it would continue to monitor. NBIM added: ""In accordance with the Fund's Ethical Guidelines, companies may be put under observation or be excluded if there is an unacceptable risk that the company contributes to or is responsible for serious or systemic violations of human rights. ""The independent Council on Ethics is responsible for assessing whether our investments are inconsistent with these guidelines. In line with our procedures, we have shared the information you have provided us with the Council of Ethics."" This video can not be played ""We are coming for you"" - Michael Gove's warning to firms that cut corners, sought to profiteer and mis-sold dangerous products Housing Secretary Michael Gove backed the campaigners' ""call to action"" on Sunday. ""Developers and cladding companies who caused these problems must pay to fix them. We want these companies to do the right thing and help end this scandal,"" he said. It was confirmed last week that firms would be given until March to agree how to help leaseholders trapped in ""unsellable homes"". Mr Gove warned those who had mis-sold unsafe cladding or cut corners on homes that the government was ""coming for you"". Residents in blocks 11-18m high had been ineligible for government support to remove unsafe cladding, but the Housing Secretary said earlier this week that the government was scrapping ""the proposal for loans and long-term debt for medium rise leaseholders"". Mr Gove said some building companies had shown leadership and covered the costs but others ""had not shouldered their responsibilities."" 'The risk of life-changing bills is still there' Who has to pay to remove unsafe cladding?

"This video can not be played MOTD analysis: 'Everton are a shambles and problems run deeper than Benitez' -  Shearer & Richards Rafael Benitez says he did not realise the ""magnitude of the task"" at Everton following his sacking on Sunday after less than seven months in charge. The Toffeesappointed the former Liverpool manager,61, as Carlo Ancelotti's successor in June. Everton have won only one of their past 13 Premier League games and are 16th in the table, six points above the relegation places. ""We knew it wouldn't be easy,"" Benitez said following his departure. ""It was a big challenge, both emotionally and in terms of sport. My love for this city, for Merseyside and its people, made me accept this challenge, but it is only when you are inside that you realise the magnitude of the task. ""From the very first day, my staff and myself worked as we always do, with commitment and full dedication. We didn't only have to get results, but we also had to win over people's hearts. ""However, the financial situation and then the injuries that followed made things even harder."" Everton, who say an update on a permanent replacement will be made in due course, held an emergency board meeting on Saturday to discuss Benitez's future following Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Norwich, which was a ninth loss in the club's past 12 league games.

"The volcano erupted for several days. This photo was taken a day before the eruption that caused the tsunami New Zealand has sent a plane to Tonga to assess the damage after a huge volcanic eruption triggered a tsunami. The eruption has covered the Pacific islands in ash, cut power and severed communications. Up to 80,000 people there could be affected, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) told the BBC. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the tsunami had wreaked ""significant damage"". No deaths have been reported so far. Information remains scarce, however, and New Zealand and Australia are sending surveillance flights to assess the extent of the damage. The New Zealand Defence Force tweeted that an aircraft had left to ""assist in an initial impact assessment of the area and low-lying islands"". ANALYSIS:Satellites key to understanding Pacific volcano Katie Greenwood of the IFRC in Fiji said that help was urgently needed. ""We suspect there could be up to 80,000 people throughout Tonga affected by either the eruption itself or from the tsunami wave and inundation as a result of the eruption,"" she said. ""That was a shock to people, so we do hold some concern for those outer islands and we're very keen to hear from people."" The underwater volcano erupted on Saturday, sending a plume of ash into the sky and triggering warnings of 1.2m (4ft) waves reaching Tonga. The eruption was so loud it could be heard in New Zealand, some 2,383km (1,481 miles) from Tonga. This video can not be played Watch: Satellite images capture eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai New Zealand's Acting High Commissioner in Tonga Peter Lund has said the island nation looks ""like a moonscape"" after it was coated in a layer of volcanic ash. The dust was reportedly contaminating water supplies and making fresh water a vital need, Ms Ardern said on Sunday. Aid charities said the ash had prompted authorities to tell people to drink bottled water and wear face masks to protect their lungs. As the sky darkened with ash, videos showed traffic jams as people fled low-lying areas by car. Hours later, Tonga's internet and phone lines went down, making the island's 105,000 residents almost entirely unreachable. Images on social media showed flooding as the tsunami waves began Prior to the largest eruption, the volcano had been erupting for several days. The Tonga Meteorological Agency had warned that the smell of sulphur and ammonia was being reported in some areas. Ms Ardern said power was being restored to some parts of the island and mobile phones were slowly starting to work again. But the situation in some coastal areas remained unknown. Unable to speak to their friends and family, many Tongans in Australia and New Zealand have grown concerned for their safety. Fatima said she had not heard anything from her colleague who runs a seafront restaurant in Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa. ""It's all very sad, we are hoping for the best,"" she told the BBC. ""This will hit them so hard as they have been in lockdown a long time with no tourists visiting and now this."" Satellite images suggest some outlying islands have been completely submerged by seawater. Experts say the eruption of the Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai volcano is one of the most violent in the region in decades. It triggeredtsunami warnings in several countries, including Japan and the US, where flooding hit some coastal parts of California and Alaska. UK Foreign Office minister Zac Goldsmith called the situation in Tonga ""shocking"" and said Britain stood ""ready to help and support our Commonwealth friend and partner in any way we can"". Scientists got their first look at Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai post-eruption on Saturday when the EU's Sentinel-1A satellite flew overhead. This spacecraft is a radar platform and can see through obscuring cloud and ash to the surface below. It showed clearly that much of the crater rim that stood above the ocean waters had been destroyed - a testament to the ferocity of the blast. Researchers will be keen to understand the cause of a tsunami that produced waves not just on nearby islands but at beaches right around the Pacific. To what extent was the explosion itself responsible? Pressure waves can make what are termed ""meteotsunami"". Or perhaps the displacement of water was the result of an unseen collapse of part of the volcano below the ocean surface. More data in the coming days and weeks will establish the facts.

The Toffeesappointed the former Liverpool manager,61, as Carlo Ancelotti's successor in June. Everton have won only one of their past 13 Premier League games and are 16th in the table, six points above the relegation places. ""We knew it wouldn't be easy,"" Benitez said following his departure. ""It was a big challenge, both emotionally and in terms of sport. My love for this city, for Merseyside and its people, made me accept this challenge, but it is only when you are inside that you realise the magnitude of the task. ""From the very first day, my staff and myself worked as we always do, with commitment and full dedication. We didn't only have to get results, but we also had to win over people's hearts. ""However, the financial situation and then the injuries that followed made things even harder."" Everton, who say an update on a permanent replacement will be made in due course, held an emergency board meeting on Saturday to discuss Benitez's future following Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Norwich, which was a ninth loss in the club's past 12 league games.

"No player has won more Australian Open men's titles than Novak Djokovic, who lifted the trophy for a ninth time in 2021 Novak Djokovic has never hidden how much he craves ending his career with the most Grand Slam men's titles of all time. But he has been denied the chance to win a record 21st major at next week's Australian Open after his visa was revoked by the country's government. The row stopped the 34-year-old Serb having a shot at making more tennis history - but also raises further questions for Djokovic, plus other players who are reluctant to be vaccinated against Covid-19, for the season ahead. Will other countries stop Djokovic entering if he is not vaccinated? Could it prevent him playing in the other Grand Slam tournaments? For how long? And what does it mean for the nine-time Australian Open champion's future? How tennis reacted to court's decision over Djokovic visa Australian Open day one preview: Norrie begins British bid After losing his bid to have his visa cancellation overturned, Djokovic will be denied the opportunity in Australia to become the man with the most Grand Slam titles. Level with Switzerland's Roger Federer and Spain's Rafael Nadal on 20, the world number one was aiming to move clear of his long-time rivals for the first time by winning his 10th title at Melbourne Park, although it seems extremely unlikely Djokovic will not play another Grand Slam. Nadal, 35, could move ahead by winning for the first time since his only triumph there in 2009, while 40-year-old Federer is missing with a long-term knee injury. The issue with Djokovic's entry into Australia also raises questions about whether he will face difficulty entering other countries. But,as Nadal pointed out,Djokovic would face no such problems if he decided to get the vaccination. Some governments have made vaccinations mandatory for foreign visitors, with others allowing unvaccinated travellers if they provide negative tests and spend time in isolation on arrival. Generally throughout his career, Djokovic has taken a few weeks off after the Australian Open before returning for the ATP Masters tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami in March. Non-US citizens must be fully vaccinated to travel to the United States, according to the US Department of State. ""Foreign national air travellers to the United States will be required to be fully vaccinated and to provide proof of vaccination status prior to boarding an airplane to fly to the United States, with only limited exceptions,"" it states. Limited exceptions include people with ""documented medical contraindications to receiving a Covid-19 vaccine"" and those whose entry would be in the national interest. After Miami, the season moves into the European clay-court swing. The first key tournament is in Monte Carlo, where Djokovic resumed his 2021 season after winning the Australian Open two months earlier. Current rules state unvaccinated people can enter the principality if they have proof of a positive PCR test more than 11 days ago and in the past six months, but must otherwise complete a quarantine period that can be cut short by tests. After Monte Carlo, there are two more Masters events in Rome and Madrid before the European clay-court season culminates with the French Open in Paris at the end of May - and fresh doubt has been thrown on Djokovic's participation in that event. Unvaccinated travellers have been able to enter Spain, France and Italy in various circumstances, enabled by PCR and antigen tests while, potentially, having to complete quarantine periods. However, on Monday, the French sports ministry said there would be no exemption from the country's new vaccine pass law. The law, passed by the French government on Sunday, will require all athletes wishing to compete in France to be vaccinated against Covid-19. ""The rule is simple. The vaccine pass will be imposed, as soon as the law is promulgated, in establishments that were already subject to the health pass,"" the ministry said. ""This will apply to everyone who is a spectator or a professional sportsperson. And this until further notice."" However, the ministry added that the situation may change before the French Open gets under way. ""Now, as far as Roland Garros is concerned, it's in May,"" it added. ""The situation may change between now and then and we hope that it will be more favourable. So we'll see, but clearly there's no exemption."" This video can not be played Wimbledon 2021: Novak Djokovic beats Matteo Berrettini to win sixth title - highlights Djokovic is the reigning Wimbledon champion after winning his sixth title at the All England Club last year. With just under six months until this year's tournament, it is too early to say exactly what restrictions - if any - players will face in order to participate. There will be many more developments in the pandemic which will have subsequent knock-on effects for travelling and major sporting events. The Australian Open said players would have to be vaccinated to enter - unless they successfully applied for an exemption -- but it is anticipated Wimbledon's entry requirements would be led by relevant government guidance. Currently, non-vaccinated people can enter England but they must complete 10 days of quarantine. They must also hold a negative pre-departure test and two more PCR tests - on day two and day eight - after arriving. The test-to-release scheme is still an option to those who want to shorten their isolation period. Asked if he would allow Djokovic to play at Wimbledon this summer, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""It's important for the Australian authorities to make their own dispositions. ""All I would say about Novak Djokovic is I believe in vaccination and I think it's a wonderful thing to do."" Djokovic has long spoken of his affection for Australia and the self-marketed 'Happy Slam' held there. Winning a record nine Australian Open men's titles is largely why. Last year he described Melbourne Park, where there is always a large band of Serbian support, as ""feeling like home"". After the visa cancellation was initially overturned in a court appeal on Monday, Djokovic said it was ""always an honour and privilege"" to play in Australia. But this has been a damaging episode and raises questions about whether he will ever return to play. Djokovic could, in theory, face a three-year ban after having his visa revoked. By that time he would be 37. ""I love you each year more and more. The love affair keeps going,"" he told the Rod Laver Arena crowd after winning the title last year. If Djokovic had avoided deportation and took to the court on Monday, it would have been fascinating to hear and see the reaction of the fans at Melbourne Park. There has been anger among the Australian public, who have endured some of the toughest lockdown rules in the world. Australian Open organisers and politicians have also been heavily criticised for their roles in the saga. Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley has built a strong relationship with Djokovic and, speaking before Djokovic landed in Melbourne, he denied accusations the governing body had helped the player obtain the exemption. There were claims Tennis Australia had been told by the Australian government in November that border officials would not accept a previous case of Covid as a valid exemption reason to be unvaccinated. Australian Open tournament director Tiley and Djokovic have long had a warm relationship Last week, Acting Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan claimed Tiley and Tennis Australia did not inform the state government about this guidance from the federal government. Amid criticism of his role in the saga, Tiley said the confusion had arisen from ""conflicting information"" in a ""changing environment"". He denied Tennis Australia had deliberately misled players seeking exemptions. David Prince, an Australian immigration lawyer, said there was ""egg on faces"" for the authorities. ""The handling of the affair looks collectively very bad from Tennis Australia, the Victorian government and Australian federal government,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Graham Reagan says he struggled to get an ambulance after suffering a heart attack An ambulance trust has apologised after a man having a heart attack said he was advised to get a lift to hospital or face a long wait. Graham Reagan said he was on the verge of collapsing when he finally got to York hospital after a lift from his son. Mr Reagan said he was concerned about the impact on patients with potentially life-threatening conditions. Yorkshire Ambulance Service said it was under ""significant pressure"". Speaking toBBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire's Politics North programme, Mr Reagan described his experience as ""scary"". ""I'd had indigestion, or so I thought, for a couple of days, and then on 17 December I went to bed early feeling rough,"" he said. In the early hours, Mr Reagan said the pains in his chest grew worse and he asked his wife to call for an ambulance. ""I couldn't take it any more,"" he said. Mr Reagan faced a second delay while waiting for an ambulance to transfer him from York to Hull for treatment Mr Reagan, from Malton in North Yorkshire, said his wife was asked ""can you get to hospital"" as the nearest ambulance was about 20 to 30 miles away. ""My wife doesn't drive, but fortunately my son was with us and he drove me to York hospital."" ""I'm in the back of the car - the pain is getting worse and I'm now getting quite upset,"" he said. On arrival Mr Reagan said they found the entrance to A&E had also been re-routed. ""So, we then had to walk out of the hospital grounds and back in - by which time I'm collapsing,"" he added. He said staff at the hospital were ""absolutely brilliant"" and arranged for him to be transferred to Hull for treatment after a heart attack was confirmed. However, he said he was faced with a further 35-minute delay while he waited for an ambulance to take him. Mr Reagan said he wanted to share his experience to raise awareness. ""Today might be the day when there aren't enough ambulances, and you might be the person who is waiting for one,"" he added. Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) said staff were doing their best to respond as quickly as possible to all emergencies A spokesperson for Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust said they were sorry to hear of Mr Reagan's concerns. They said, in common with other ambulance services, they had been under ""significant operational pressures for some time"" and, while staff did their best to respond quickly, they acknowledged ""some patients are having to wait longer for an ambulance response"". On Thursday, it was announced the service is toget support from military personnelamid pressure on staffing due to Covid-related absences.

"A community trust in Glasgow is having to choose between paying energy bills and paying staff, its manager said. Dramatic increases in the price of electricity have blown apart the budgets at Govanhill Baths Community Trust. Trust Manager Fatima Uygun said price increases meant it now costs the same to provide power to some areas as it did to pay for a staff member. Without help, she fears the charity will be forced to make more cuts. The community trust provides a range of mental health support as well as food and other services to people who need them. Like every household, it is affected by recent soaring energy costs. How to smooth over the energy price shock Energy firm failures will mean higher bills, says Scottish Power What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Ms Uygan toldBBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Show: ""Almost overnight, it has dramatically affected our work."" ""Our budgets are usually set at the start of the financial year and very quickly we have had to adjust to prioritising our energy bills over delivering services, sometimes quite vital services around mental health which has come as a bit of a shock to us."" Like many charities in the same position, the trust has been forced to make urgent adjustments. Ms Uygun said: ""In one venue our prices went up by 50% overnight because our energy provider went bankrupt. We were put on a different provider and  where we had been paying Â£200 a month it went to Â£400 a month. ""That is the equivalent to someone doing sessional work or part-time work to deliver mental health services."" Having to pay more in bills means the trust has had to cut back on fresh fruit and vegetables for its People's Pantry food bank. Mrs Uygun said the trust has had to cut back on fresh fruit and vegetables for its food bank Last week,British Gas owner Centrica warned that high energy bills could affect household bills for the next two years. Chief executive Chris O'Shea said there was ""no reason"" to expect gas prices would come down ""any time soon"". Households and businesses are not the only ones feeling the pinch. Charities and volunteer groups are also struggling. Those working out of old buildings which are not energy efficient are finding that heating them with increased prices puts a dent in the running costs. And volunteer and community services are already stretched due to Covid. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations told BBC Scotland that rising costs were already having a significant impact on the services its members could provide. It is likely to mean an increase in demand for things like money advice services and mental health support. Ms Uygun said: ""We'll have to make cuts if things don't change and that usually affects projects which are already a bit under-funded and are difficult to find funding for. ""So mental health support groups such as the local knitting club, or the lunch club, or cutting back on the variety of fresh fruit and vegetables for the People's Pantry, people will notice the difference unfortunately."" Mental health support groups such as the local knitting club are likely to be affected, Mrs Uygun said So far, Govanhill Baths Trust has had no support from the local council or the Scottish government. The charity feels it is something which will have to be addressed at a government level. ""The idea that energy companies are out of the goodness of their heart will cut profit - which is where this is all going - is not going to happen, Ms Uygun said. ""We are hoping the voluntary sector is putting enough pressure on the Scottish government to at least offer a price freeze or a reduction through some kind of exemption or subsidy. ""Without it, organisations like us at the coal face who provide these services are going to have to make difficult decisions and that is going to mean quite a lot more people are going to fall through the cracks."" Kirsten Hogg, Head of Policy at the SCVO said: ""It can be difficult for organisations to secure funding to cover overhead costs.Â Funding is often available for the direct costs of providing a project, but not the core costs of running the organisation, which could include heating and lighting of buildings. ""And it is common for voluntary sector contracts and grants not to be uplifted for inflation. We are aware of organisations that have received the same amount of money for up to six years, and have been expected to deliver the same service with no increase to cover rising costs. ""A dramatic increase in costs, such as we are currently seeing in relation to energy prices, is therefore unlikely to be covered by existing funders and will have a significant impact."" A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The third sector is a valued partner and we recognise the impact of rising fuel costs on our charities and voluntary organisations. ""Pricing in the gas and electricity markets is reserved, meaning the Scottish government's options to mitigate these costs are limited. Ministers have written to the UK government to call for urgent action to tackle rising energy costs.""

"Novak Djokovic has been deported from Australia after losing visa battle in court Judges dismissed his bid to have a government decision to cancel his visa overturned The tennis star earlier said he was ""extremely disappointed"" but accepted the decision Australian PM Scott Morrison welcomes ruling saying country committed to ""strong borders"" Immigration Minister Alex Hawke cancelled Djokovic's visa on Friday, saying his presence in the country risked fanning anti-vaccine sentiment Djokovic has not been vaccinated against Covid-19, which is a requirement for foreigners entering the country Djokovic now faces a possible three-year ban on returning to Australia Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now ending our live coverage of Novak Djokovic's whirlwind 24 hours. Thanks for joining us as we charted his doomed court bid to overturn deportation from Australia - and departure on an Emirates flight bound for Dubai. This page was edited and written by Jay Savage, Frances Mao, Ayeshea Perera, Yvette Tan, Jack Hunter, Jen Meierhans, Sophie Williams, Tim de Faramond and Rebecca Seales, with thanks to our news teams and sports reporters on the ground in Australia. Serbia's Olympic Committee has described the deportation of the tennis star as a ""great injustice"". In a statement, itsaid he is ""our winner"",external. ""We are proud of Novak Djokovic and the way he coped with these extremely difficult and unpleasant circumstances. Despite this scandalous decision, we believe Novak came out as the winner again,"" the committee said. It added that Djokovic had been deprived of the opportunity to become the greatest tennis player of all time - though few would bet against him winning a further grand slam on another occasion. Djokovic has represented Serbia at the Olympics Tracking site FlightRadar confirms Djokovic's plane is currently the most tracked flight on its website. Thousands of people are watching the player's journey across Australia towards Dubai. Djokovic will have a long time to think on his flight, with the journey to Dubai lasting 13 hours.

Djokovic pictured with his 2021 Australian Open trophy The absence of Djokovic means the Australian Open will have
a winner that isnât him or Roger Federer for the first time in eight years. Daniil Medvedev, winner of last yearâs US Open, is now said to
be the favourite. Federer is not attending while he recovers from
a knee injury. Djokovic has dominated the tournament in recent years, winning nine
titles, more than any other male player in the Australian Openâs history. Federer has won the Australian Open six times. The last time the men's tournament was won by a player other than
Djokovic and Federer was when Stan Wawrinka clinched the title in 2014, beating
Rafael Nadal. Nadal is now the only member of âthe big threeâ players to be at
this yearâs tournament. Djokovic has won the Australian Open title nine times Deportation from Australia usually comes with a three-year
ban from the country - so does this mean that Djokovic will skip the Australian Open until 2025? Not necessarily. According to Australian media, he could argue that hispresence at the Melbourne grand slam is in the national interest.,external âDjokovic can apply to the government to ask for the ban to
be waived on compelling and compassionate grounds,â Abul Rizvi, former deputy secretary
of the immigration department, told TV show The Project. âI suspect whoever is the minister would probably allow
that,â he added. The Australian Open is one of the biggest events in the
tennis calendar. Djokovic has won the tournament nine times, more than any
other male player in the tournament's history. Australia's Immigration Minister Alex Hawke has confirmed that Djokovic has left the country. In a statement he ""welcomed today's unanimous decision by the Federal Court of Australia"". Hawke used his ministerial powers to cancel the tennis star's visa, saying that Djokovicâs presence posed a risk to the ""health and good order"" of the Australian
community. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The Emirates flight EK409 containing Novak Djokovic has left Melbourne airport. Federal agents escorted him and his team from the business lounge to the gate. Before any of this week's craziness, Djokovic was already a divisive player. When the world men's number one faced Roger Federer in the 2019 Wimbledon final, his misses were clapped and he was jeered in a partisan atmosphere more commonly found at football stadiums. ""You cannot make people love you and that's been the situation a little bit,"" his former coach Boris Becker had told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. ""He's a fine young sportsman with the right attitude and the right character, he just has a different view on life. He has a different view how he eats, how he drinks, how he sleeps. That's where you can't criticise him. Maybe that's the reason he's so successful, but he's not for everybody - I get it."" Read more on Djokovic and why he's such a polarising player. Australian journalist Paul Sakkal, who has covered Novak Djokovic's visa saga on the ground for Melbourne paper The Age, says it has caused ""anger"" and ""embarrassment"" and cast a shadow over the tennis tournament. Sakkal was speaking to the BBC's Sunday Morning from Melbourne. He says the ""visceral reaction"" to Djokovic's arrival in the country without a vaccine is partly down to the ""really large Covid wave"" which has driven 35,000 daily cases in Victoria where the Australian Open will be held. ""There was a sense that Djokovic, a wealthy entitled person [...] had somehow found a loophole to get into Australia through a back door,"" he says. ""I think that fed a lot of the anger and that anger hasn't really dissipated, even though he had his first legal challenge that was successful. ""I think the government made the political calculation that they were still on quite popular political grounds in deporting him and they made that decision on Friday and a court has upheld it today."" He says there is ""no doubt this casts a significant shadow over the tournament"". It is ""an embarrassment for the organisers"" and makes ""our government and our federation... look like a bit of a farce"", he says. More images are now coming through of the tennis star at Melbourne's airport, where witnesses saw him board an Emirates flight from Melbourne to Dubai. Australian journalist Shane McInnes shared images of Djokovic in the Emirates lounge, saying he had been under escort by Australia's Federal Police. Allow Twitter content?

Pictures have emerged showing Djokovic in Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport before boarding his flight out of Australia. Novak Djokovic has been seen boarding a flight bound for Dubai, Reuters news agency reports. He was seen by a journalist boarding the flight at Melbourne airport. The plane is due to depart at 2230 local time (1130 GMT). It comes just hours after he lost his bid to overturn his visa cancellation. The Djokovic case comes as Australia experiences its highest Covid-19
figures on record. For the past five days, the country has recorded daily
infections of more than 100,000. Thursday saw a pandemic high of 150,000 cases. But on Sunday, the country saw a drop in cases with 85,824
reported. Australia had tried to limit the spread of the virus through
some of the worldâs toughest measures earlier in the pandemic. But it has now
shifted to a strategy of living with Covid. However, issues like a lack of rapid antigen tests â or lateral flow
tests â have plagued the country, with reports saying that people are offering
as much as A$100 (Â£73) in their search for a test. Read more about this here. Now that some time has passed since the ruling, a number of
tennis players are rallying round in support of Djokovic. US player John Isner wrote on Twitter: âNole always has and
always will be class. Heâs an absolute legend in my book that has brought so
much good to millions around the world. âThis isnât right,â he added. Reilly Opelka, who is due to play at the Australian Open tomorrow, hit back at criticism of Djokovic on the

Canadian Vasek Pospisil, who co-founded a new tennis playersâ association
with Djokovic, branded Australiaâs decision politically motivated. âThere was a political agenda at play here with the
elections coming up which couldnât be more obvious. This is not his fault. He
did not force his way into the countryand did not âmake his own rules,externalâ; he was
ready to stay home,"" he wrote on Twitter. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) says Novak Djokovic's absence from the Australian Open is a ""loss for the game"" but it continues to ""strongly recommend vaccination to all players"". A statement on the ATP website,externalsays today's decision to uphold Novak Djokovicâs Australian visa cancellation marks the end of a ""deeply regrettable series of events"". It says decisions of legal authorities regarding matters of public health must be respected and more time is needed to establish the facts and learn from what happened. ""Irrespective of how this point has been reached, Novak is one of our sportâs greatest champions and his absence from the Australian Open is a loss for the game,"" it says. ""We know how turbulent the recent days have been for Novak and how much he wanted to defend his title in Melbourne. We wish him well and look forward to seeing him back on court soon."" Face-palm reaction from Nick Kyrgios Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios, who has been supportive of Novak Djokovic during the past 10 days, reacted with a face-palm emoji on Twitter after the men's number one was stripped of his visa. Kyrgios has previouslycriticised his country's handling of Djokovic's visa dispute, calling it ""really bad"" and urging officials to ""do better"". Allow Twitter content?

Australian Open organisers Tennis Australia say they ""respect the decision"" of the court. They say a ""lucky loser"" - Italian player Salvatore Caruso - will replace Djokovic in the number one slot at the tournament. Caruso, ranked 175th in the world, failed to qualify for Melbourne - but will now take Djokovic's place in a first-round match tomorrow night. Guy DelauneyBBC News, Belgrade Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic believes the tennis star's nationality influenced his treatment Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has told the BBC Novak Djokovic was âtortured and tormentedâ by the Australian government and âtreated like a mass murdererâ. He said the decision taken today could have been made 10 days ago, and that he has âno doubtâ Djokovic would have been treated ""totally differently"" if he wasnât from Serbia. Vucic said: ""He came to Australia with a medical exemption proposal and then you were mistreating him for 10 days. Why did you do it? Doing a witch hunt against him? This is something that no one can understand."" He added: ""I believe that Novak is not humiliated. The people who are humiliated are those who organised this witch hunt process."" Djokovic will be leaving Australia tonight at 2230 local time (1130 GMT), some Australian media are reporting. Both Sky News and Melbourne paper The Age say he will be flying out of the country on an Emirates flight to Dubai.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: There has been ""industrial scale partying"" at Downing Street Sir Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of breaking Covid laws with parties held in Downing Street during lockdown. The Labour leader said the prime minister had ""lied"" about ""industrial scale partying"" in No 10. Six Tory MPs have now called on the PM to resign over gatherings held during restrictions. But Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden said the PM would take action over the ""underlying culture"" in Downing Street. Mr Dowden told the BBC the PM was ""committed"" to doing this when he responds to an official inquiry on events in government buildings. The internal investigation, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, is expected to be published as soon as the coming week. The Metropolitan Police said it had""ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office""over Ms Gray's inquiry. The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held How many No 10 lockdown parties do we know about? Will two Tory tribes go to war with the PM? However, Sir Keir told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme he did not need to wait for the report to conclude that Mr Johnson broke the rules. ""The facts speak for themselves, and the country has made up its mind,"" he said, adding it was ""blindingly obvious what's happened"". ""I think he broke the law, I think he's as good as admitted that he broke the law,"" he added. Speaking on the same programme, Mr Dowden said he shared the public's anger, but it was right to wait for Ms Gray to ""establish the full facts"". ""The task for us now is how we address the underlying culture in Downing Street,"" he said. ""We need to up our game, and that needs to be addressed, and I know the prime minister is committed to addressing that."" Sue Gray's report is a fact-finding mission but within government it is expected she will say whether various gatherings were appropriate or not. She will not say whether gatherings or parties broke the law - or what any punishments should be. There is no date scheduled for its publication yet. The hope is it can be published as soon as possible - possibly by the end of the week. However, I understand because some allegations have just come to light, it is possible it could be published the week after. Mr Dowden also appeared on Sky's Trevor Phillips On Sunday where the presenter held back tears recalling his daughter's death during the pandemic. Phillips said his daughter, who he said was very ill and had isolated for months, collapsed and later died on a weekend in April 2021 when it has emerged parties took place in Downing Street on the eve of Prince Phillip's funeral. ""She had stuck to the spirit and letter of the rules, and there are going to be thousands of people who have that story in their background,"" he said. ""And, if I may say so, you are in here telling me about a civil servant's inquiry, that will not answer that anger. ""Does the prime minister really understand why people are angry?"" Meanwhile, former minister Tim Loughton has become the sixth Tory MP to call on Mr Johnson to resign, calling his position ""untenable"". In a Facebook post, he added the public deserved ""clarity, honesty and contrition"" instead of ""obfuscation, prevarication and evasion"". ANALYSIS:What was really going on in No 10 during lockdown? LAURA KUENSSBERG:What next for Johnson after party apology? PROFILE:Party investigator Sue Gray TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings Pressure on Mr Johnson has been growing since he admitted he attended a gathering in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020, during the first Covid lockdown. As many as 100 people were invited to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" in an email on behalf of the prime minister's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson told MPs he had ""believed implicitly"" it was a work event, but admitted: ""With hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside"". But Labour has accused Mr Johnson of ""holding the British public in contempt"", after theSunday Times reported,externalhe had been warned to cancel the event after the email went out. In response to the report, a No 10 spokesperson said: ""It is untrue that the prime minister was warned about the event in advance."" On Friday, Downing Streetapologised to the Queenafter it emerged two staff parties were held at No 10 on the night before Prince Philip's funeral in April 2021. Mr Johnson was not at either event but his spokesman said it was ""deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning"". The parties have been added to a growing list of events in government buildings currently being investigated by Ms Gray. This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says she understands why ""people across the country are angry"" Speaking on Times Radio on Sunday, former Labour PM Tony Blair said he understood why people would feel ""enraged"" at the party revelations. ""I can also, from the perspective of Downing Street, understand how these things happen,"" he said. But he added: ""You can explain it, but not really excuse it."" During his BBC interview, Sir Keir also said a picture of him drinking beer in an office last spring did not show a breach of Covid rules in place at the time. The Labour leader said the picture, which first emerged last year, showed him in a constituency office in the run-up to the Hartlepool by-election. ""We were very busy. We were working in the office,"" he told presenter Sophie Raworth when challenged about the image. ""We stopped for something to eat and then we carried on working. No party, no breach of the rules and absolutely no comparison with the prime minister."" The government has faced intense pressure over events held in an around Downing Street. 10 May 2020 Boris Johnson announced a plan to take the “first careful steps"" out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to ""obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them”. Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, “those people were at work talking about work”. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” on behalf of the prime ministerâs principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had “gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes”. Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. 17 July 2020 Boris Johnson announced plans for a “significant return to normality"" in England by Christmas ""through targeted, local action” instead of national lockdowns. But he added that the timetable relied on “every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly”. 5 November 2020 With cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” as a new national lockdown began. He said people should only leave their homes “for work if you canât work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies”. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. 13 November 2020 Sources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. 2 December 2020 The second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with “tough tiers to keep this virus down”. London was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party. 15 December 2020 Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing. 16 December 2020 London moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important “everyone is cautious” ahead of the festive period. The Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it “inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment” by staff. 17 December 2020 A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions. Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was “truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result”. 18 December 2020 Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street. However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” 14 January 2021 A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries. 12 April 2021 Lockdown restrictions were eased in England, with pubs and restaurants allowed to reopen with outdoor service only. However, working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households. 16 April 2021 Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral. One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it “should not have happened at the time that it did”. Boris Johnson was not at either party. A DIAGNOSIS THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING:How do we cope when our bodies and minds no longer behave how we want them to?

"MPs have not been allowed to sit at Stormont since 2016 The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have said other parties should ""stop faking outrage"" over the proposed reintroduction of double jobbing. The plan would allow MPs to be elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly but keep their Westminster seats. Four of the five Stormont Executiveparties have said they are against the move. A DUP spokesman said the move would ""encourage stability at a time when devolution is deeply unstable"". Details of the plan wereoutlined in a letter from government peer Lord Caine to fellow lordson Friday. It will bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and is proposed to last until the next Westminster election, due in 2024. Double jobbing, also known as dual mandates, was banned in Northern Ireland in 2016, when a number of MPs were forced to give up their seats in the assembly. If the new proposal goes through, it would allow DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to stand for election to the assembly in May while retaining his seat at Westminster. Under existing rules if he was elected to Stormont he would have had to stand down as an MP, leading to a by-election in his Lagan Valley constituency. MPs to be able to sit in Stormont as MLAs Four executive parties oppose double jobbing return The SDLP and Alliance Party have said their three MPs will vote against the mandate when comes to the House of Commons. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill called it ""blatant and disgraceful interference"", while Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie tweeted that the Northern Ireland Office was ""now directly supporting DUP the election campaign"". The proposal would allow DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to stand for election to the assembly in May while retaining his seat at Westminster On Sunday, a DUP spokesman said other parties in Northern Ireland were ""throwing dust in the air"". ""This proposed step by the government would bring Northern Ireland into line with other parts of the United Kingdom and encourage stability at a time when devolution is deeply unstable because of a one-sided and undemocratic Protocol,"" he continued. ""It was first proposed by the SDLP's sister party in the House of Commons before Sir Jeffrey was Leader of the DUP. ""Therefore if parties are surprised, they were asleep at the wheel when this was being discussed in the House of Commons."" Multi-tasking has never been a problem for our politicians. Why have one job when you can have two, or maybe three? Ian Paisley and John Hume, for example, were for many years simultaneously members of the House of Commons, the European Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly. For a while in the 1980s, the North Down MP James Kilfedder was famously paid more than the prime minister when he was also speaker of the assembly. And for years after Stormont returned post-1998, the vast majority of Northern Ireland's 18 MPs also held seats in the assembly and some even had third roles as executive ministers. It was the political norm until theexpenses scandalhit Westminster and trust in politicians hit rock bottom. In the public outcry which followed, the acceptable dual mandate was re-labelled unacceptable double jobbing. Ironically, the man who helped draw up the rules ending the practice here, Lord Caine, is the same man who has laid out the plan to bring it back now in a time-limited way. Read more here. The plan was proposed by Lord Alderdice during a committee stage reading of the NI (Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern) Bill on Wednesday. Lord Alderdice, whoquit the Alliance Party in 2006,externaland is now a Liberal Democrat peer, argued that dual mandates would encourage easier transitions between serving in London and Belfast, and benefit the Northern Ireland Assembly. Former UUP leader Lord Trimble and former DUP deputy leader Lord Dodds spoke in favour of the move in the House of Lords. However, former SDLP leader Baroness Ritchie said that while there was a case to be made for the amendment, she was strongly opposed to double jobbing. In his letter, Lord Caine said he was opposed to the possibility of double jobbing remaining indefinitely so the amendment was reworked with a time limit. The Lords are due to consider the amended proposal this week. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the plan was ""out of touch with public opinion"" Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said the move was ""a backwards step"" and that the party's former leader Lord Alderdice made ""a fundamentally poor judgement call"" to propose the reintroduction of double jobbing. Mr Farry told BBC's Sunday Politics show that the move coming so close to an election amounted to ""interfering with democratic process"". The North Down MP said Lord Alderdice ""does not speak for the Alliance Party, does not represent them"". He said members of the House of Lords who supported the proposal were ""out of touch with public opinion here in Northern Ireland, which is very much against this move"". ""We've been told all along this legislation is about faithfully implementingthe New Decade, New Approach agreementand putting in place provisions for that new legislative provision,"" he said. ""There has not been any proper consultation with Northern Ireland parties on this particular development bar a few members of the House of Lords who do not represent mainstream views. ""The government has acted beyond their remit."" Ulster Unionist assembly member Mike Nesbitt said he was ""nearly speechless"" at the proposal which ""goes totally against [the] spirit of what we tried to do"" to share power in Stormont. The Strangford MLA accused the government of ""going out of its way to prop up and support the DUP"". ""Why did we stop it six years ago, why are we bringing it back now and why are we making it time limited? I think the answer is obvious, to help out the DUP,"" he said. ""There are five parties in government and the spirit of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement is that it is fair to all five. ""This is not fair to all five."" A spokesperson from the Northern Ireland Office said the proposals would be ""subject to the usual parliamentary scrutiny"". ""The government's proposal is for any dual mandates to be strictly time limited to the subsequent Westminster election. ""ItÂ will enable the smoother transition between legislatures should an MP wish to take a seat in the NI Assembly,Â and therefore supports the objectives of the bill in promoting greater stability,"" the spokesperson said.Â MPs to be able to sit in Stormont as MLAs Four executive parties oppose double jobbing return Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said the next announcement about the BBC licence fee will be the last - and it was time to discuss new ways to fund and sell ""great British content"". She said ""the days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on doors"" were over. Her comments come as unconfirmed reports say the government is expected to freeze the Â£159 fee for two years. A BBC source said there had been similar speculation before. The licence fee's existence is guaranteed until at least 31 December 2027 by the BBC's royal charter, which sets out the broadcaster's funding and purpose. The annual fee is then set by the government, which announced in 2016 that it would rise in line with inflation for five years from April 2017. Money raised from the licence fee pays for BBC shows and services - including TV, radio, the BBC website, podcasts, iPlayer and apps. Lengthy negotiations have already taken place between BBC bosses and the government over a future funding settlement, with the idea of freezing the licence fee discussed back in October.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. A government source confirmed the BBC discussions over the licence fee were ongoing. But they said the culture secretary recognised pressure on people's wallets - and the licence fee was an ""important bill"" for people on low incomes and pensioners, which ministers could control. A BBC source said of the fee freeze: ""Anything less than inflation would put unacceptable pressure on the BBC finances after years of cuts."" They added there were ""very good reasons for investing in what the BBC can do for the British public, and the creative industries and the UK around the world"". Previously, Ms Dorries, who was appointed culture secretary last September, saidshe thought the BBC should exist, but it needed to be able to take on competitors such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. At the Conservative party conference in October, Ms Dorriessaid the broadcaster needed ""real change""in order to represent the entire UK and accused it of ""groupthink"". The BBC was ""a beacon for the world"", she said, but she thought people who had worked their way up had a similar background, a certain political bias and thought and talked the same. Do I need a TV licence and what does it pay for? PM: BBC must 'cough up' for over-75s TV licences Labour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell accused the prime minister and Ms Dorries of seeming ""hell-bent on attacking this great British institution because they don't like its journalism"". ""British broadcasting and our creative industries are renowned around the world and should be at the heart of global Britain,"" she said. Liberal Democrat culture spokesperson Jamie Stone said freezing the licence fee would be a ""stealth cut of almost Â£2bn"" that would put services at risk. ""The government must stop this reckless ideological crusade and back off our BBC,"" he added. In 2020, people over 75 began paying for their TV licence, which had previously been free. Funding for this had come from the government, but responsibility for this policy was handed to the BBC after the last funding settlement. In 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the BBC should ""cough up"" and pay for TV licences for all over-75s but the BBC said doing so would force ""unprecedented closures"" of services. Now, only over-75s on pension credit are eligible for a free licence, paid for by the BBC. TV licence evasion itself is not an imprisonable offence. However, the government says non-payment of the fine, following a criminal conviction, could lead to a risk of imprisonment - ""a last resort"" after other methods of enforcement have failed. Last year, the government decided not to move ahead with plans to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee, but said it would ""remain under active consideration"". And so as the BBC turns 100, a British government officially turns against the licence fee as the best way to fund it. Nadine Dorries is not arguing against the existence of the BBC, but is now formally opposed to a compulsory levy on households that watch TV. She argues that it potentially criminalises the vulnerable, including the elderly. Defenders of the licence fee argue it is the least bad mechanism, and moving to a Netflix-style subscription model would force the BBC to serve subscribers rather than be universal. It comes after lengthy negotiations between the government and the BBC over the future funding settlement. The actual negotiation over how the BBC is funded after 2027 is still several years away. Dorries tweeted a link to aMail on Sunday article,externalsuggesting that, amid a cost of living crisis, the fee would be held at Â£159 for two years - amounting to a real terms cut of hundreds of millions. The BBC is also under relentless financial and creative pressure from streaming giants such as Apple and Amazon. Its future depends above all on whether it can persuade young people to pay for it.

"Shoppers could be tempted over the border for cheaper alcohol Travelling across the Irish border to bag a bargain is nothing new. It has been happening for as long as exchange rates have fluctuated or the economy on one side outperforms the other. But a new public health policy in the Republic of Ireland has some businesses in Northern Ireland hoping for a surge in cross-border customers. Earlier this month minimum unit pricing on alcoholcame into effect south of the border. The policy is similar to those in place inScotlandandWalesand is one the Irish government believes will change dangerous drinking patterns. But similar measures are not in place in Northern Ireland. A body representing Irish off-licences says that means many products now retail at twice the price in the Republic of Ireland compared to Northern Ireland. That has some border businesses readying for a spike in trade. One County Armagh off-licence hopes the policy will maintain the rise in trade seen during the pandemic Among them is the First and Last Off-Licence in Jonesborough, County Armagh. Located just off the main Belfast to Dublin motorway, few businesses can be as well situated to cash in. Manager Seamus McNamee told BBC News NI he is hopeful of ""a massive surge in cross-border business"". Enquiries have been made by potential customers from as far away as Limerick and Tipperary. But, he said, it is too early to note any tangible change in cross-border trade. ""It's just after Christmas, people will be getting the credit card bills in, but give it a few months and we will be in a good place,"" he says. Alcohol off-sales drop credited to minimum unit pricing Calls to raise minimum unit alcohol price Minimum unit alcohol price has 'lasting impact' In the meantime he is doing all he can to encourage customers from over the border. Plans to advertise in a number of Dublin-based newspapers are being finalised, a leaflet drop across the border too. He is hopeful those endeavours will reap rewards. He is in no doubt that ""once the politicians in the north get their act together"", minimum pricing will be introduced in Northern Ireland too. It makes sense in terms of public health, he said, but for now ""we'll try and make hay while the sun shines"". A can of beer cannot be sold for less than â¬1.70 (Â£1.40) in Ireland Under the new measures, a standard bottle of wine cannot be sold for less than â¬7.40 (Â£6.40) and a can of beer for less than â¬1.70 (Â£1.40). Spirits with 40% alcohol content cannot be sold for less than â¬20.70 (Â£17.30) and a 700ml bottle of whiskey for less than â¬22 (Â£18.40). The Irish government believes minimum pricing is a vital public health measure. The measure aims to change dangerous patterns of alcohol behaviour with the intention of deterring binge drinking and affects alcohol sold in off licences, shops and supermarkets. Scotland introduced minimum unit pricing in 2018 and the following year alcohol consumptionfell to its lowest level in more than two decades. Londonderry businessman Garvan O'Doherty agrees it is too early to assess the impact on his business. January is also the wrong month to gauge any increase in trade from across the border, he says. Derry off-licence owner Garvan O'Doherty He owns five Chill off-licences in Derry, some close to the border with County Donegal. ""January is normally a very slow period but we have noticed for last week's trade a 3% increase, which we are attributing to cross border shoppers. ""Most people have either stocked up or are fed up having a drink over the Christmas period,"" he adds. But he is also hopeful things change in the months ahead. Already he has noticed ""price-checkers"" come from the Republic. The chief executive of a trade body that represents many off-licences in the Republic of Ireland says it is only a matter of time before people start to travel to buy alcohol. Vincent Sweeney, who heads up the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, says people will ""save themselves very considerable amounts of money by going north of the border"". Some products are now twice the price in the Republic than they are in Northern Ireland, he adds. ""I think it has come as an enormous shock to people just how great the differential has been."" Paddy Malone beleives minimum pricing needed an all-island approach In Dundalk, the business community is concerned once shoppers travel for one product, their wider shopping habits will change too. ""People aren't necessarily going to travel across just to buy alcohol,"" says Paddy Malone of Dundalk Chamber. ""But what they might do is travel north for the big weekly shop so they can buy alcohol, they do that once or twice and it becomes habit. ""And people are creatures of habit, that's what we would worry about."" Border regions have always been at the mercy of economic conditions that favour one side over the other, he adds, and businesses have always found a way. But, he says, what should have happened, is ""this should have come in at the same time, on the same day in both the north and the south"". Moves to introduce minimum pricing in Northern Ireland have been talked aboutfor more than a decade., with the Department of Health saying plans are moving forward. Anall-island policy has also been discussed previously. A Department of Health spokeswoman said the policy has the ""potential to be a key population-level health measure to address the harms related to alcohol consumption"". She said a consultation on minimum unit pricing is being developed and that it is anticipated it will be issued early this year.

Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special A watershed moment might come in 18 months when they come to England and beat us at home for the first time in 20 years. That might wake us up. Sir Alastair CookFormer England captain on BT Sport When I lost 5-0 I still had that desire to be captain and drive the team forward, then I lost 4-0 in India and I felt done. Only Joe Root will know if he can take this team forward. Mark Wood does deserve praise. He was excellent today, as he has been throughout the series, and thoroughly deserved his six wickets. It is just fantastic to see him playing four Tests in such a short period of time too, considering all the injuries he's had over the years. Geoff LemonAustralian journalist on Test Match Special Australia have produced a side where everyone has contributed at some point. Not just in the starting XI but in the whole squad. England had Root and Malan show fight in the couple of Tests. Mark Wood trying his heart out and Broad and Anderson at times. But other than that, it's slim pickings. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special People care about Test cricket. They love Test cricket. They are entertained by one-day cricket, until it's a glut and it's too much and they have enough. People don't have enough of Test cricket. People are shattered by what's happened again. If this doesn't wake up administrators. to look at where the game it is and how unbalances the cricket structure is. If it doesn't ram home now then I don't think it ever will.

Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special A watershed moment might come in 18 months when they come to England and beat us at home for the first time in 20 years. That might wake us up. Sir Alastair CookFormer England captain on BT Sport When I lost 5-0 I still had that desire to be captain and drive the team forward, then I lost 4-0 in India and I felt done. Only Joe Root will know if he can take this team forward. Mark Wood does deserve praise. He was excellent today, as he has been throughout the series, and thoroughly deserved his six wickets. It is just fantastic to see him playing four Tests in such a short period of time too, considering all the injuries he's had over the years. Geoff LemonAustralian journalist on Test Match Special Australia have produced a side where everyone has contributed at some point. Not just in the starting XI but in the whole squad. England had Root and Malan show fight in the couple of Tests. Mark Wood trying his heart out and Broad and Anderson at times. But other than that, it's slim pickings. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special People care about Test cricket. They love Test cricket. They are entertained by one-day cricket, until it's a glut and it's too much and they have enough. People don't have enough of Test cricket. People are shattered by what's happened again. If this doesn't wake up administrators. to look at where the game it is and how unbalances the cricket structure is. If it doesn't ram home now then I don't think it ever will. Both of those posts go a long way to explaining why England have lost this Ashes series 4-0. Their players don't feature prominently enough at the top of those charts.

"The Beatrice field in the Moray Firth is the largest offshore wind farm in Scottish waters The ScotWind auction is the first time in a decade that plots of seabed in Scottish waters have been up for grabs. So when the successful bidders are announced on Monday could it power a long-awaited renewables revolution? Over the next decade these new offshore wind farm sites could supercharge renewable energy capacity, more than doubling everything currently built, or planned, in Scottish waters. At the moment the capacity of offshore wind in Scotland is about 2GW, a small fraction of overall renewables. The Moray East project, in the Outer Moray Firth, recently became Scotland's single largest source of renewable energy, with a capacity of 950MW from 100 offshore turbines, enough to power about 650,000 homes. Gas pressure builds further Offshore wind auction attracts dozens of bids Windfall: offshore power draws big players Scotland's largest offshore wind farm opened It will be eclipsed in the next year by Seagreen, located about 27km off the Angus coast, which will be slightly bigger at 1,000MW or 1GW. In total, projects which have consent and those already in the pipeline come to less than 10GW. The ScotWind auction, whose successful bidders will be announced on Monday, should see at least a further 10GW added to the Scottish market and maybe more as technology becomes more efficient. By industry calculations that has the potential to power seven million homes, almost one quarter of the total number in Britain. It is an auction of the rights to develop several sites in Scottish waters for offshore wind. The process is managed by Crown Estate Scotland (CES), which takes its lead from the Scottish government, which will receive the hundreds of millions of pounds in profits. The 15 Scotwind zones in this leasing round are on a much bigger scale than before and a total of 74 bids have been submitted. CES will make initial offers to successful applicants on Monday. Agreements will then be finalised before developers can move forward with detailed plans. The winning bidders will still have a lot of work to do - designing, getting planning permission, securing grid connections, the subsidy auction, getting billions of pounds lined up, and then procuring and installing. It is a long-term project. Many seabed areas off the Scottish coast could be developed for offshore wind The biggest zone in the auction is far to the east of Montrose, with several new big areas in the outer Moray Firth: one east of Shetland, three to the west of Orkney: a zone to the north-west of the isle of Lewis, and north-west of Islay. Currently, the thinking is that about 1,200 huge wind turbines will be required across the 15 zones but that could be reduced as the technology gets more efficient. ScotWind will also feature several floating wind arrays, being pioneered in Hywind, the world's first floating wind farm off Aberdeenshire. These are anchored to the seabed, and make it possible to put turbines into much deeper water or where piles cannot be installed. Like a conventional auction, it depends how much each bidder is prepared to pay but a similar process in England last year saw both industry and government astonished at how much firms were willing to bid to get the right to develop these sites. The ScotWind auction was halted last year when it was realised that the cap placed on Scottish bids was too low. Crown Estate Scotland raised the cap for the auction bids from Â£10,000 to Â£100,000 per square kilometre. If every bid is submitted up to that maximum cap, it could raise Â£860m. Once they start operating, Crown Estate Scotland will charge leasing fees, so more money will flow into the public purse. Despite the high investment costs, many firms see the potential of offshore wind energy They are typically in consortia, including those with deep pockets and much smaller companies with expertise in taking wind farms to the point where the billions are required. Despite the high investment costs, many firms see the potential of offshore wind energy. The bigger players include big investment funds in green energy, such as Australia's Macquarie Bank. The big utility companies are involved, as they are in existing projects, including SSE and Scottish Power. Big oil companies have turbocharged these auctions, eager to balance their hydrocarbons with green energy. TotalEnergies from France, ENI from Italy, Equinor from Norway and Shell have all bid.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: There has been ""industrial scale partying"" at Downing Street Sir Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of breaking Covid laws with parties held in Downing Street during lockdown. The Labour leader said the prime minister had ""lied"" about ""industrial scale partying"" in No 10. Six Tory MPs have now called on the PM to resign over gatherings held during restrictions. But Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden said the PM would take action over the ""underlying culture"" in Downing Street. Mr Dowden told the BBC the PM was ""committed"" to doing this when he responds to an official inquiry on events in government buildings. The internal investigation, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, is expected to be published as soon as the coming week. The Metropolitan Police said it had""ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office""over Ms Gray's inquiry. The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held How many No 10 lockdown parties do we know about? Will two Tory tribes go to war with the PM? However, Sir Keir told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme he did not need to wait for the report to conclude that Mr Johnson broke the rules. ""The facts speak for themselves, and the country has made up its mind,"" he said, adding it was ""blindingly obvious what's happened"". ""I think he broke the law, I think he's as good as admitted that he broke the law,"" he added. Speaking on the same programme, Mr Dowden said he shared the public's anger, but it was right to wait for Ms Gray to ""establish the full facts"". ""The task for us now is how we address the underlying culture in Downing Street,"" he said. ""We need to up our game, and that needs to be addressed, and I know the prime minister is committed to addressing that."" Sue Gray's report is a fact-finding mission but within government it is expected she will say whether various gatherings were appropriate or not. She will not say whether gatherings or parties broke the law - or what any punishments should be. There is no date scheduled for its publication yet. The hope is it can be published as soon as possible - possibly by the end of the week. However, I understand because some allegations have just come to light, it is possible it could be published the week after. Mr Dowden also appeared on Sky's Trevor Phillips On Sunday where the presenter held back tears recalling his daughter's death during the pandemic. Phillips said his daughter, who he said was very ill and had isolated for months, collapsed and later died on a weekend in April 2021 when it has emerged parties took place in Downing Street on the eve of Prince Phillip's funeral. ""She had stuck to the spirit and letter of the rules, and there are going to be thousands of people who have that story in their background,"" he said. ""And, if I may say so, you are in here telling me about a civil servant's inquiry, that will not answer that anger. ""Does the prime minister really understand why people are angry?"" Meanwhile, former minister Tim Loughton has become the sixth Tory MP to call on Mr Johnson to resign, calling his position ""untenable"". In a Facebook post, he added the public deserved ""clarity, honesty and contrition"" instead of ""obfuscation, prevarication and evasion"". ANALYSIS:What was really going on in No 10 during lockdown? LAURA KUENSSBERG:What next for Johnson after party apology? PROFILE:Party investigator Sue Gray TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings Pressure on Mr Johnson has been growing since he admitted he attended a gathering in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020, during the first Covid lockdown. As many as 100 people were invited to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" in an email on behalf of the prime minister's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson told MPs he had ""believed implicitly"" it was a work event, but admitted: ""With hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside"". But Labour has accused Mr Johnson of ""holding the British public in contempt"", after theSunday Times reported,externalhe had been warned to cancel the event after the email went out. In response to the report, a No 10 spokesperson said: ""It is untrue that the prime minister was warned about the event in advance."" On Friday, Downing Streetapologised to the Queenafter it emerged two staff parties were held at No 10 on the night before Prince Philip's funeral in April 2021. Mr Johnson was not at either event but his spokesman said it was ""deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning"". The parties have been added to a growing list of events in government buildings currently being investigated by Ms Gray. This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says she understands why ""people across the country are angry"" Speaking on Times Radio on Sunday, former Labour PM Tony Blair said he understood why people would feel ""enraged"" at the party revelations. ""I can also, from the perspective of Downing Street, understand how these things happen,"" he said. But he added: ""You can explain it, but not really excuse it."" During his BBC interview, Sir Keir also said a picture of him drinking beer in an office last spring did not show a breach of Covid rules in place at the time. The Labour leader said the picture, which first emerged last year, showed him in a constituency office in the run-up to the Hartlepool by-election. ""We were very busy. We were working in the office,"" he told presenter Sophie Raworth when challenged about the image. ""We stopped for something to eat and then we carried on working. No party, no breach of the rules and absolutely no comparison with the prime minister."" The government has faced intense pressure over events held in an around Downing Street. 10 May 2020 Boris Johnson announced a plan to take the “first careful steps"" out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to ""obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them”. Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, “those people were at work talking about work”. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” on behalf of the prime ministerâs principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had “gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes”. Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. 17 July 2020 Boris Johnson announced plans for a “significant return to normality"" in England by Christmas ""through targeted, local action” instead of national lockdowns. But he added that the timetable relied on “every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly”. 5 November 2020 With cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” as a new national lockdown began. He said people should only leave their homes “for work if you canât work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies”. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. 13 November 2020 Sources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. 2 December 2020 The second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with “tough tiers to keep this virus down”. London was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party. 15 December 2020 Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing. 16 December 2020 London moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important “everyone is cautious” ahead of the festive period. The Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it “inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment” by staff. 17 December 2020 A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions. Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was “truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result”. 18 December 2020 Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street. However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” 14 January 2021 A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries. 12 April 2021 Lockdown restrictions were eased in England, with pubs and restaurants allowed to reopen with outdoor service only. However, working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households. 16 April 2021 Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral. One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it “should not have happened at the time that it did”. Boris Johnson was not at either party. A DIAGNOSIS THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING:How do we cope when our bodies and minds no longer behave how we want them to?

"This video can not be played Graham Reagan says he struggled to get an ambulance after suffering a heart attack An ambulance trust has apologised after a man having a heart attack said he was advised to get a lift to hospital or face a long wait. Graham Reagan said he was on the verge of collapsing when he finally got to York hospital after a lift from his son. Mr Reagan said he was concerned about the impact on patients with potentially life-threatening conditions. Yorkshire Ambulance Service said it was under ""significant pressure"". Speaking toBBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire's Politics North programme, Mr Reagan described his experience as ""scary"". ""I'd had indigestion, or so I thought, for a couple of days, and then on 17 December I went to bed early feeling rough,"" he said. In the early hours, Mr Reagan said the pains in his chest grew worse and he asked his wife to call for an ambulance. ""I couldn't take it any more,"" he said. Mr Reagan faced a second delay while waiting for an ambulance to transfer him from York to Hull for treatment Mr Reagan, from Malton in North Yorkshire, said his wife was asked ""can you get to hospital"" as the nearest ambulance was about 20 to 30 miles away. ""My wife doesn't drive, but fortunately my son was with us and he drove me to York hospital."" ""I'm in the back of the car - the pain is getting worse and I'm now getting quite upset,"" he said. On arrival Mr Reagan said they found the entrance to A&E had also been re-routed. ""So, we then had to walk out of the hospital grounds and back in - by which time I'm collapsing,"" he added. He said staff at the hospital were ""absolutely brilliant"" and arranged for him to be transferred to Hull for treatment after a heart attack was confirmed. However, he said he was faced with a further 35-minute delay while he waited for an ambulance to take him. Mr Reagan said he wanted to share his experience to raise awareness. ""Today might be the day when there aren't enough ambulances, and you might be the person who is waiting for one,"" he added. Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) said staff were doing their best to respond as quickly as possible to all emergencies A spokesperson for Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust said they were sorry to hear of Mr Reagan's concerns. They said, in common with other ambulance services, they had been under ""significant operational pressures for some time"" and, while staff did their best to respond quickly, they acknowledged ""some patients are having to wait longer for an ambulance response"".

"Judith Criddle uses a volunteer-run community food store in Cardiff to do her weekly shopping Money has been so tight for grandmother Judith Criddle, she only ever puts her heating on when her six grandchildren visit - despite the cold weather. Even then, Judith can only afford to put it on for an hour so she wraps her grandchildren in a blanket on the sofa with hot water bottles to keep warm. ""To them it's a movie night, cuddling in to nan - but to me, I'm doing it to save the money,"" said the 51-year-old. Judith is one of the millions affected by the UK's cost of living crisis. Prices are rising at thefastest rate in more than 10 yearsandone think tank has warnedit could get worse with predictions that higher energy bills, stagnant wages and tax rises could leave households with an extra Â£1,200-a-year hit to their incomes. Judith, who is onuniversal credit, said she was trying to cut back on using energy as much as she can, but ""if it goes up any more I can't afford to live"". Five items that are going up in price and why Half of families Â£110 a year worse off since 2019 How can the government solve the energy crisis? Areport,externalfrom the Resolution Foundation also warned a rise in the energy price cap - where energy bills could more than double - and National Insurance contributions in April means families are facing a ""year of the squeeze"" in 2022. Even now Judith can't afford a haircut or to have an occasional social drink with friends in Cardiff. Judith says she can't afford a hair cut and worries every months about how to pay her bills She is one of the four in 10 families in Wales living below the poverty line, according to poverty campaigners Bevan Foundation. So while Judith's grandchildren think their movie night is a bit of fun with their nan, the actual reason is far from that. ""I'll put the heating on, say for an hour, to take the chill off,"" she said. ""But then I'll put blankets on because I couldn't afford to have it on all the time. ""I'm worried about the month ahead, never mind the year."" Judith does her weekly shopping at a community food store, run by a local charity, in the Caerau area of Cardiff. The community food store where Judith shops sells a food parcel with Â£20 worth of food for Â£5 Your Local Pantry - which helps families in Ely and Caerau, parts of which are among Wales' most deprived areas - relies on donations of groceries and food schemes to keep prices down. A weekly shop costs a fiver but its 132 members get around four times that price in food. Alex Withey has been volunteering at the Pantry and, like Judith, the 52-year-old receives universal credit. The Pantry in Cardiff is run by a local poverty charity Action Caerau and Ely ""This is 2022 and people are having to decide whether to put their heating on or have a meal,"" he said. ""Every month I'm thinking how much to pay for food, how much to pay for fuel. As it goes up, obviously it's going to have to be less for food and more for fuel. ""That's wrong. It's always the poor that get hit first."" Alex says he has Â£100 to spend on bills and he can't afford both food and electric or gas Inequality campaigners say people's health and living standards will suffer because of the cost of living rise, with the Bevan Foundation estimating a third of Welsh families are already cutting their energy use while a quarter are cutting back on food. The Bevan Foundation also claims the impact of the Covid pandemic is pushing more households - about 40,000 - into poverty. ""Around a quarter of families in Wales were living in poverty before the pandemic,"" said Dr Steffan Evans, the foundation's head of policy.

Families are bracing themselves to pay more for their energy as industry experts predict those that were paying Â£850 on average last year will see their bills rise to more than Â£1,700. Fuel poverty charity National Energy Action is calling on the UK government to consider ""meaningful"" targeted financial support for the most vulnerable customers.

""The key thing is we need targeted support to those who need it the most, and urgently. People simply will not be able to cope."" The Welsh government said it was aware households in Wales were under ""unprecedented financial pressure"" due to the cost of living ""crisis"" and the UK government's ""cruel"" decision toend the Universal Credit uplift. The Treasury said it had helped provide more than Â£4.2bn of support to families per year, on top of other support for living standards. ""We know people are facing pressure with the cost of living - which is why we're taking billions of pounds worth of decisive action to help,"" said a UK government spokesperson. ""Our support includes reducing theuniversal credit taper- a tax cut worth over Â£2bn - increasing the minimum wage and supporting households with their bills... as well as freezing alcohol and fuel duty.""

"Djokovic boarded a flight at Melbourne airport on Sunday Novak Djokovic has been deported from Australia after losing a last-ditch court bid to stay in the country. Judges rejected a challenge by the unvaccinated tennis star after theÂ government cancelledÂ his visa on ""health and good order"" grounds. Djokovic said he was ""extremely disappointed"" but accepted the ruling. He has left on a flight to Dubai. It marks the end of a 10-day saga, in which the Serb fought to stay to defend his title in the Australian Open. Djokovic's supporters fell silent outside the courtroom as the decision was announced on the eve of what would have been his opening match in the tournament. One fan told the BBC her summer would be ""empty"" without the 34-year-old playing at the Open. Supporters of the Serbian tennis star gathered outside the court on Sunday Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed ""the decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe"" but his government faces criticism at home and abroad for its handling of the affair. Djokovic launched his case after Immigration Minister Alex Hawke used his powers to cancel his visa, arguing his presence in the country risked fanning anti-vaccine sentiment. What next for Djokovic? The politics behind Australia's Djokovic decision Why Djokovic is a polarising player During Sunday's court hearing before a three-judge panel, Djokovic's defence unsuccessfully argued that the grounds given by the government were illogical because to deport the star also risked fanning anti-vaccine sentiment. Chief Justice James Allsop said the court ruling was based on the legality of the minister's decision, not on whether it was the right decision to make. This video can not be played Moment Djokovic learns his Australian Open fate He promised to release the full reasoning for the ruling in the coming days. There has been much public anger in Australia over the player's attempt to enter the country without being vaccinated against Covid-19. The federal government has repeatedly said people must comply with the strict laws in place to deal with the pandemic, and that no-one is ""above the law"". Djokovic was originally granted a medical exemption to enter Australia by two different independent health panels - one commissioned by Tennis Australia, the other by the state government of Victoria - after testing positive for coronavirus in mid-December. However, the Australian Border Force detained him on 5 January for not meeting federal coronavirus requirements, and his visa was revoked. Djokovic had been training in Melbourne for the Australian Open A judge overturned that decision but the government stepped in last Friday to revoke the visa again, saying it was in the public interest. Although Djokovic is not vaccinated against Covid-19, he has not actively promoted anti-vax disinformation. However,Â Australian anti-vaxxers have been using the hashtag #IStandWithDjokovic on social media. Mr Morrison said the centre-right government was ""prepared to take the decisions and actions necessary to protect the integrity"" of the country's borders. But Kristina Keneally, a senator for the opposition Labor Party, said Mr Morrison had made himself a ""laughing stock on the world stage"" by mishandling the Djokovic case. The government's ""litany of failures"",she tweeted,external, had ""undermined Australia's border security settings, & provided a lightning rod for the anti-vaccination movement"". A former Labor prime minister, Kevin Rudd,tweeted,externalthat the ""political circus"" could have been avoided had a visa not been issued in the first place. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic accused the Morrison government of conducting a ""witch hunt"". ""He [Djokovic] came to Australia with a medical exemption proposal and then you were mistreating him for 10 days,"" he said. ""Why did you do it? Doing a witch hunt against him? This is something that no one can understand."" The Australian Open could have seen Djokovic make history by winning his 21st Grand Slam. Italy's Salvatore Caruso,Â ranked 150th in the world, is the ""lucky loser"" who will now replace DjokovicÂ in his match against Serbia's Miomir Kecmanovic on Monday. Djokovic said he was ""uncomfortable"" with the focus placed on him as a result of the the visa row, adding: ""I hope that we can all now focus on the game and tournament I love."" He said he was ""taking some time to rest and to recuperate"" before commenting further. Deportation orders usually include a three-year ban on returning to Australia, though this can be waived in certain circumstances. The episode raises further questions for Djokovic, plus other tennis players who are reluctant to be vaccinated against Covid-19, for the season ahead. Any player eyeing tournaments in America, for instance, will be aware that non-US citizens must be fully vaccinated to travel to the country ""with only limited exceptions"". Former Swedish star Mats Wilander told Eurosport that Djokovic's career was ""on the line and he might have to do something that he doesn't really want to do"". The men's tennis governing body ATP called the saga a ""deeply regrettable series of events"", while British tennis star Andy Murray said the situation was  ""not good"" for anyone.
