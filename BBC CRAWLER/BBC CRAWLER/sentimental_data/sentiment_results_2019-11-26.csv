"Twitter said the accounts would start being deactivated from 11 December Twitter will begin deleting accounts that have been inactive for more than six months, unless they log in before an 11 December deadline. The cull will include users who stopped posting to the site because they died - unless someone with that person's account details is able to log-in. It is the first time Twitter has removed inactive accounts on such a large scale. The site said it was because users who do not log-in were unable to agree to its updated privacy policies. A spokeswoman also said it would improve credibility by removing dormant accounts from people's follower counts, something which may give a user an undue sense of importance. The first batch of deleted accounts will involve those registered outside of the US. The firm bases inactivity on whether or not a person has logged in at least once in the past six months. Twitter said the effort is not, as had been suggested by some users on the network, an attempt to free up usernames. That said, previously unavailable usernames will start coming up for grabs after the 11 December cut-off - though Twitter said it would be a gradual process, beginning with users outside of the US. In future, the firm said it would also look at accounts where people have logged in but don't ""do anything"" on the platform. A spokeswoman would not elaborate, other to say that the firm uses many signals to determine genuine human users - not just whether they interact with, or post, tweets. The site has sent out emails to users of accounts that will be affected by the deletions. The firm would not say how many current accounts fit the criteria, although it is expected to be in the many millions. It will send out more notice closures closer to the deadline. Affected users began receiving these emails from Tuesday The cull will not affect Twitter's reported user numbers, as the firm bases its usage level only on users who log-in at least once a day. According to its latest earnings report, from September, Twitter has 145m ""monetisable"" daily active users (users who come into contact with Twitter's advertising on a daily basis). ""As part of our commitment to serve the public conversation, weâre working to clean up inactive accounts to present more accurate, credible information people can trust across Twitter,"" the firm said about the upcoming account removals. ""Part of this effort is encouraging people to actively log-in and use Twitter when they register an account, as stated in our inactive accounts policy.â It means users who have died will have their accounts removed unless a loved one or other person is already in possession of their log-in details, and is able to sign in and accept Twitter's latest privacy policy. Twitter's current policy,externaloffers only deactivation of a dead person's account once a trusted third-party - a parent, for example - has proven their identity. However, the policy states that in no circumstances would Twitter grant access to the account, which would prevent deletion. The firm does not, unlike Facebook, offer a ""memorialisation"" option that freezes the account in place and disallows new interactions - a measure to prevent abuse. Since inactivity is based on logging in, not posting, bot accounts - such as those which automatically tweet news or alerts - would also come under the cull if the account owners do not log-in before the December deadline. So too would accounts set up specifically as an archive, such as@POTUS44,external, a collection of all the tweets made by President Barack Obama while in office. _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"It's the last day to register to vote - the deadline is at midnight The Chief Rabbi has attacked Labour's anti-Semitism record and asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" Jeremy Corbyn launches a race and faith manifesto, declaring anti-Semitism ""vile"" and ""wrong"" Boris Johnson launches the Tories' Scottish manifesto, warning of a Labour-SNP tie-up The Muslim Council of Britain, meanwhile, accuses the Tories of having a ""blind spot"" over Islamophobia Ex-Conservative deputy PM Lord Heseltine urges voters to back the Lib Dems, or former Tories standing as Independents SNP sets out plan to boost parental leave, especially for fathers Joseph Lee and Hamish Mackay Another frantic day on the campaign trail has come to an end. Here's a recap of the day's main headlines: Newsnight Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), tells Newsnight the chief rabbi was right to raise the ""unprecedented"" issue of anti-Semitism in Labour. He says there will have been ""immense pressure within the Jewish community to speak up on
the feeling that the Labour Party has not done what it should have done"". The Labour Party, which Mr Phillips belongs to, ""has failed the test"", he says, having been to slow to respond to allegations and ignoring ""some awful things"". Jeremy Corbyn's failure to apologise is ""inexplicable"", he says. But Mr Phillips defends the EHRC, which is investigating the Labour Party, against allegations uncovered by BBC Newsnight that its current chairman David Isaac is not impartial. The programme says the EHRC chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, wrote a letter to a civil servant complaining that Mr Isaac refused to take positions on some issues relating to equality and human rights, such as the government stripping of Shamima Begum of her British citizenship. But Mr Phillips says such allegations are common in this job. ""I've got no reason to think David Isaac is doing anything other than
an excellent job,"" he says. The Daily Mirror's front page story focuses on something different: allegations that a Conservative trade minister had secret talks with a US drug firm about a post-Brexit deal. The paper says it fuels fears that a trade deal with the US would push up NHS drug prices and undermine the health service. The Daily Express and Daily Mail both lead on the fallout from Jeremy Corbyn's BBC interview. The Express asks, ""Has Corbyn's horror show gifted Boris the keys to No 10?"" while the Mail says the Labour leader was ""torn apart"" on a pensions pledge and tax rises, as well as on anti-Semitism. The i newspaper also leads on Corbyn declining the opportunity to apologise, saying he struck a ""defiant stance"" after the chief rabbi's criticism. The paper also says Chancellor Sajid Javid refused to condemn Boris Johnson's 2018 comments about Muslim women wearing burkas looking like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"". The Times leads on the same story as the other papers, saying that Jeremy Corbyn refused four times to apologise to British Jews in his BBC interview. The paper says that the chief rabbi earlier put anti-Semitism allegations in Labour ""at the centre of the election campaign"". Emily Maitlis is in Belfast for tonight's Newsnight.

The Guardian also leads on Mr Corbyn and anti-Semitism claims, mentioning his decision not to apologise in the BBC interview and his insistence that anti-Semitism accusations have not risen under his leadership. The paper says it was a ""bruising day"" for the Labour leader, in which he also ""struggled"" with questions over funding a Â£58bn pledge to 1950s-born women over pensions and whether some people on low incomes would be affected by tax rises. Journalist and presenter Mehdi Hasan points out that Jeremy Corbyn has apologised to the Jewish community over anti-Semitism before. In March 2018, there were protests demanding action over anti-Jewish racism in the party, prompting Mr Corbyn to say: ""I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused, and pledge to redouble my efforts to bring this anxiety to an end."" Mr Hasan says it's not clear why Mr Corbyn couldn't say something similar in his BBC interview. He adds that Boris Johnson has never apologised over allegations of racism and Islamophobia against him and his party. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Daily Telegraph also leads on Mr Corbyn's BBC interview. Specifically, the paper focuses on the Labour leader's decision not to apologise to British Jews. In the interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Corbyn was asked four times whether he was going to apologise following the chief rabbi's claim that Labour was not doing enough to root out anti-Jewish racism. The first of tomorrow's newspaper front pages are beginning to arrive. The Metro leads with the headline ""Corbyn: Chief rabbi wrong"", covering the Labour leader's earlier BBC interview. In today's Times, the UK's chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, described Mr Corbyn's claim that Labour had ""investigated every single case"" of alleged anti-Semitism as a ""mendacious fiction"". But challenged about the rabbi's comment, Mr Corbyn said: ""No, he's not right. Because he would have to produce the evidence to say that's mendacious."" Shadow defence minister Nia Griffith was taking part in the BBC Wales election debate earlier. She took a different line to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying the party should apologise to the Jewish community over its handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Allow Twitter content?

BBC Radio 5 Live Earlier today, BBC Radio 5 Live reporter Rory Carson visited Patch, a Pembrokeshire charity that helps families with food and clothing. According toresearch by charities, Wales is the only country in the UK where child poverty has risen in the past year. Sian and her husband have five children; 18 months ago she was buying food for Patch, but she now relies on them to survive. Sian believes politicians need to visit communities like hers to see the challenges people are facing. âBefore I came to Patch, Iâd gone three or four days without
eating, just to ensure my children had food... I filled up on water so I didnât

"The Official Receiver will take control of Price's financial affairs and property Katie Price has been declared bankrupt in a hearing at the High Court, which was told she had failed to stick to a plan to repay her debts. The former model and reality TV star was not present at the London hearing. Last year, Price, 41, came to an arrangement with her creditors for a repayment plan known as an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA). But the insolvency practitioner overseeing her IVA said she had failed to keep to the terms of the agreement. Now that she's been made bankrupt, the Official Receiver will take control of her financial affairs and property. Price, who lives in West Sussex, found fame in the 1990s as a glamour model under the name Jordan and was once said to be worth more than Â£40m. Price promoting her book Being Jordan in 2004 As Jordan, she was famed for her breast enlargement surgery and was a frequent face on the front of lads' magazines. Modelling wasn't the only string to her bow. In 2001, she stood as an MP, offering free breast implants on the NHS - but that wasn't enough to persuade voters. She branched out into publishing, with books such as Being Jordan, and dabbled in fashion. She appeared in TV shows such as Footballers' Wives and starred in the 2004 series of I'm A Celebrityâ¦ Get Me Out of Here! It was on the ITV jungle show that she met her future husband, the pop star Peter Andre. After they split, she went on to marry Alex Reid in 2010, and then Kieran Hayler in 2013. She and Hayler are reported to be planning to divorce. Price called for online abuse to be made a criminal offence after her son Harvey suffered ""horrific"" bullying Price was crowned the winner of Celebrity Big Brother in 2015, and she has been praised forher work as an anti-bullying campaigner, which began when her son Harvey was targeted for his disabilities. But it has been a difficult couple of years for the star. She went into rehabilitation last year to tackle drug and alcohol abuse, and earlier this yearwas convicted of driving while nearly twice the legal alcohol limit. In the summer,she admitted shouting a ""tirade of abuse""at her ex-husband's new partner in a school playground and was fined Â£415. Last month, she was one of three celebrities whohad Instagram posts advertising diet products bannedby the Advertising Standards Authority. She is now seen on the reality show My Crazy Life on the Quest Red channel and has a clothing range named after her daughters Princess and Bunny. Someone can file for bankruptcy as a way of escaping overwhelming debt. An Official Receiver takes charge of their finances and assets, such as their house, and may use them to pay off their debts. The bankrupt person will be under certain restrictions, eg not being able to apply for credit of more than Â£500 without telling the lender about their bankruptcy. It usually ends after a year, after which most debts are written off and they can make a fresh start. As well as voluntarily filing for bankruptcy, a person can be made bankrupt if they have not paid their debts. An Individual Voluntary Agreement (IVA) - which freezes someone's debts and allows them to pay them back over a set period - is one alternative to bankruptcy. But one route to being made bankrupt is if a person has broken the terms of their IVA, as the High Court heard that Price had done. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Whole families perished in the quake hitting in the early hours of Tuesday Rescuers from several countries are scrambling to find survivors of the earthquake which hit Albania, killing 30 people and injuring hundreds more. Using sniffer dogs, they are sifting through rubble, 36 hours after the magnitude-6.4 tremor. Whole families have perished - and thousands are staying out in the open as powerful aftershocks hit. Most of the deaths occurred in the coastal city of Durres and the town of Thumane, close to the epicentre. Tuesday's earthquake was the strongest to hit Albania in decades. A tearful defence minister said three children were among those killed, and while homes could be rebuilt the 28 people killed could not be brought back. The quake struck 34km (21 miles) north-west of the capital, Tirana, as people slept in their beds during the early hours. The latest aftershock - a magnitude 5.6 - is said to have damaged a building in Durres next to one where intense rescue efforts are under way. People have been housed in a football stadium in Durres More than 45 people have been pulled from the rubble and Prime Minister Edi Rama has promised that rescuers will ""continue to search patiently and thoroughly to the end"". He said all those affected would be sheltered in hotels until the government rebuilds their homes. A day of mourning is being observed in Albania and neighbouring Kosovo. Tuesday's quake caused considerable damage in Thumane and Durres, where entire blocks of flats collapsed. Local media report that at least 20 people are buried under the rubble. Teams from Italy, Greece, Romania, France, Switzerland, Turkey, Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Israel are helping with the search efforts. Italian firefighters said they were working ""relentlessly"" at the site of a collapsed four-storey building in the Knet district of Durres, where six people are reported missing.

The largest deployment has come from the Kosovo Security Forces (KSF). Pictures show a large column of KSF vehicles arriving. The troops are specially trained to help with natural disasters. Kosovo has also sent police to Albania to help maintain law and order. This video can not be played Albania quake: Rescuers search for survivors In Thumane, rescuers are combing the rubble of a five-storey building. And in Durres, two three-year-old twin sisters are at the centre of one rescue effort - they are part of an extended family with many members missing. Hundreds of people spent the night in tents or cars, fearing another tremor. In Durres, a woman called Bukuri Morina and her family of 10 joined thousands of others to spend the night at the football stadium. ""We are afraid to go back to our apartment,"" she said. ""There are cracks all over and we are afraid that we will have the same destiny as people in Thumane."" All festivities coinciding with Albania's independence day on Thursday have been cancelled. The government has introduced a state of emergency - enabling more funds and security - in the worst affected areas. Thirty-year-old painter Diena Mecaj was pulled out alive from a six-storey block of flats in Durres, but could not survive her injuries. Two hours later the body of her daughter, aged eight, was brought out of the rubble. Diene Mecaj died in a six-storey building with her eight-year-old daughter Mecaj lost her husband in 2015, reports say. In Facebook posts she had described life without him as a challenge. Three members of the Gregu family perished in Thumane. Pellumb and Celike Gregu's bodies were recovered early on Wednesday, hours after their son, Saimir, died in hospital. Kristi Reci's body was recovered alongside that of her father, Eduart, in their collapsed apartment in Durres. She was a 25-year-old medical student in Tirana. Rescuers were still looking for her mother and brother. Two brothers from Kosovo are among the victims. Shemsedin Abazi, 32, and his 29-year-old brother Isa were staying Hotel Tropikal in Durres. When the earthquake struck, they phoned for help, but by the time rescuers pulled them out - some 15 hours later - they were already dead. The brothers had arrived in Durres only hours before the earthquake on a regular trip to put in a few days' work as mechanics. Like Albania, Kosovo was observing a day of mourning on Wednesday. Among the tragedies that took place as the quake struck, one man died in a car accident when the quake tore open parts of a road. Another man leapt from his balcony in panic but did not survive. As the rescue effort continued, a 31-year-old man from Thumane died in hospital on Wednesday and two other bodies were found in the rubble. The Balkans is in an area prone to seismic activity, lying close to a fault line between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates. Albania sits on a smaller, Adriatic tectonic plate. Tuesday's quake was Albania's worst for decades. In April 1979, a magnitude-6.9 quake hit Albania and northern neighbour Montenegro, leaving 136 dead and more than 1,000 injured. That was described as the strongest ever recorded in the Balkans, more powerful than a 6.1 magnitude earthquake in July 1963 that killed more than 1,000 people in the Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Three-quarters of the capital Skopje was destroyed and 200,000 people left homeless.

"It's the last day to register to vote - the deadline is at midnight The Chief Rabbi has attacked Labour's anti-Semitism record and asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" Jeremy Corbyn launches a race and faith manifesto, declaring anti-Semitism ""vile"" and ""wrong"" Boris Johnson launches the Tories' Scottish manifesto, warning of a Labour-SNP tie-up The Muslim Council of Britain, meanwhile, accuses the Tories of having a ""blind spot"" over Islamophobia Ex-Conservative deputy PM Lord Heseltine urges voters to back the Lib Dems, or former Tories standing as Independents SNP sets out plan to boost parental leave, especially for fathers Joseph Lee and Hamish Mackay Another frantic day on the campaign trail has come to an end. Here's a recap of the day's main headlines: Newsnight Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), tells Newsnight the chief rabbi was right to raise the ""unprecedented"" issue of anti-Semitism in Labour. He says there will have been ""immense pressure within the Jewish community to speak up on
the feeling that the Labour Party has not done what it should have done"". The Labour Party, which Mr Phillips belongs to, ""has failed the test"", he says, having been to slow to respond to allegations and ignoring ""some awful things"". Jeremy Corbyn's failure to apologise is ""inexplicable"", he says. But Mr Phillips defends the EHRC, which is investigating the Labour Party, against allegations uncovered by BBC Newsnight that its current chairman David Isaac is not impartial. The programme says the EHRC chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, wrote a letter to a civil servant complaining that Mr Isaac refused to take positions on some issues relating to equality and human rights, such as the government stripping of Shamima Begum of her British citizenship. But Mr Phillips says such allegations are common in this job. ""I've got no reason to think David Isaac is doing anything other than
an excellent job,"" he says. The Daily Mirror's front page story focuses on something different: allegations that a Conservative trade minister had secret talks with a US drug firm about a post-Brexit deal. The paper says it fuels fears that a trade deal with the US would push up NHS drug prices and undermine the health service. The Daily Express and Daily Mail both lead on the fallout from Jeremy Corbyn's BBC interview. The Express asks, ""Has Corbyn's horror show gifted Boris the keys to No 10?"" while the Mail says the Labour leader was ""torn apart"" on a pensions pledge and tax rises, as well as on anti-Semitism. The i newspaper also leads on Corbyn declining the opportunity to apologise, saying he struck a ""defiant stance"" after the chief rabbi's criticism. The paper also says Chancellor Sajid Javid refused to condemn Boris Johnson's 2018 comments about Muslim women wearing burkas looking like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"". The Times leads on the same story as the other papers, saying that Jeremy Corbyn refused four times to apologise to British Jews in his BBC interview. The paper says that the chief rabbi earlier put anti-Semitism allegations in Labour ""at the centre of the election campaign"". Emily Maitlis is in Belfast for tonight's Newsnight.

The Guardian also leads on Mr Corbyn and anti-Semitism claims, mentioning his decision not to apologise in the BBC interview and his insistence that anti-Semitism accusations have not risen under his leadership. The paper says it was a ""bruising day"" for the Labour leader, in which he also ""struggled"" with questions over funding a Â£58bn pledge to 1950s-born women over pensions and whether some people on low incomes would be affected by tax rises. Journalist and presenter Mehdi Hasan points out that Jeremy Corbyn has apologised to the Jewish community over anti-Semitism before. In March 2018, there were protests demanding action over anti-Jewish racism in the party, prompting Mr Corbyn to say: ""I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused, and pledge to redouble my efforts to bring this anxiety to an end."" Mr Hasan says it's not clear why Mr Corbyn couldn't say something similar in his BBC interview. He adds that Boris Johnson has never apologised over allegations of racism and Islamophobia against him and his party. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Daily Telegraph also leads on Mr Corbyn's BBC interview. Specifically, the paper focuses on the Labour leader's decision not to apologise to British Jews. In the interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Corbyn was asked four times whether he was going to apologise following the chief rabbi's claim that Labour was not doing enough to root out anti-Jewish racism. The first of tomorrow's newspaper front pages are beginning to arrive. The Metro leads with the headline ""Corbyn: Chief rabbi wrong"", covering the Labour leader's earlier BBC interview. In today's Times, the UK's chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, described Mr Corbyn's claim that Labour had ""investigated every single case"" of alleged anti-Semitism as a ""mendacious fiction"". But challenged about the rabbi's comment, Mr Corbyn said: ""No, he's not right. Because he would have to produce the evidence to say that's mendacious."" Shadow defence minister Nia Griffith was taking part in the BBC Wales election debate earlier. She took a different line to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying the party should apologise to the Jewish community over its handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Allow Twitter content?

BBC Radio 5 Live Earlier today, BBC Radio 5 Live reporter Rory Carson visited Patch, a Pembrokeshire charity that helps families with food and clothing. According toresearch by charities, Wales is the only country in the UK where child poverty has risen in the past year. Sian and her husband have five children; 18 months ago she was buying food for Patch, but she now relies on them to survive. Sian believes politicians need to visit communities like hers to see the challenges people are facing. âBefore I came to Patch, Iâd gone three or four days without
eating, just to ensure my children had food... I filled up on water so I didnât
feel it. I was dizzy but my children needed it more than me."" Sian adds: ""So many time politicians have promised things, and let everyone down. People go by what they say to vote for them, but I think itâs time they started coming into the communities and seeing the struggles."" What's happened today?

"McIntosh was convicted last year of the attempted murder of Linda McDonald There were no warning signs to predict that a convicted killer would carry out a brutal attack on a woman while on home leave, a review has found. Robbie McIntosh, 32,battered Linda McDonald with a dumbbellin Templeton Woods, Dundee, in August 2017. McIntosh had been jailed for life in 2002 for stabbing a dog walker to death on Dundee Law when he was 15 years old. He was being prepared for possible release on parole at the time of the 2017 attack. A multi-agency report,externalsaid McIntosh had not shown any ""violent behaviours or attitudes"" that would have suggested an attack was imminent or could have been predicted. However, it said there were flaws within the balance of information shared to assess risk, particularly from the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to Scottish Ministers when seeking approval for home leave. Linda McDonald sustained two skull fractures in the attack The report said that although McIntosh was subject to a number of standard and additional licence conditions, the level of monitoring was ""less than what might be considered reasonable"". It noted that a fiction book about a lone male who attacked females in wooded areas was found in McIntosh's cell after the crime. The report made 10 recommendations, including for the SPS to review the information which is ""available and considered"" during risk management team meetings. The review was carried out by the multi-agency public protection arrangements (Mappa), which includes members from the police, local authorities, health board and the SPS. It was commissioned to consider the circumstances of McIntosh's offence and identify ""any necessary improvements to public protection arrangements"". McIntosh was jailed for life in 2002 for stabbing Anne Nicoll to death The report said McIntosh's ""positive behaviour"" in prison and on community leave constituted ""relevant evidence"" that supported the decisions to increase his community access. It said there were subsequent flaws in the meeting structure that divided tasks between the SPS risk management team and Mappa. This resulted in neither of them being able to take full responsibility for compiling a ""structured and fully-defensible risk management plan."" The SPS said it accepted all the relevant recommendations ""without reservation"". The killer who twice traumatised a city At the time of the attack in 2017, McIntosh had been allowed home leave in preparation for being considered for parole. He had been sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in prison in 2002 after being found guilty of murder. McIntosh stabbed 34-year-old civil servant Anne Nicoll almost 30 times during the attack in Dundee in 2001. Linda McDonald had been walking her dog in Tempeton Woods in August 2017 when she was attacked by McIntosh. He fled after being disturbed by two dog walkers who had heard Mrs McDonald screaming. She sustained multiple injuries including two skull fractures. McIntosh admitted attempted murder and was given an Order for Lifelong Restriction (OLR), which means he will be supervised for the rest of his life. Mrs McDonald's husband Matthew has criticised the decision to grant McIntosh home leave and said the attack had ""turned our family's life upside down"".

"This video can not be played Muslim Council of Britainâs Miqdaad Versi says Islamophobia is ""endemic, institutional within the Conservative Partyâ The Muslim Council of Britain has accused the Conservative Party of ""denial, dismissal and deceit"" over the issue of Islamophobia. The MCB said the party had a ""blind spot for this type of racism"" and had failed to take steps to tackle it. The group was responding to criticism of Labour's handling of anti-Semitism by the chief rabbi. Conservative leader Boris Johnson said party members guilty of Islamophobia ""are out first bounce"". Inthe Times,external, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said Labour had not done enough to tackle anti-Semitism and urged people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the general election. He wrote that the ""overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety"" at the prospect of a Labour victory in the 12 December poll. Chief rabbi in election attack on Labour Tory candidate suspended over anti-Semitism Tories suspend members over Islamophobia claims In response, the MCB said British Muslims would ""listen to the chief rabbi and agree on the importance of voting with their conscience"". A spokesperson added that the ""unacceptable presence of anti-Semitism in Britain"" was a source of ""real fear"" for British Jews. They added the chief rabbi's comments ""highlighted the importance of speaking out on the racism we face, whilst maintaining our non-partisan stance."" ""It is abundantly clear to many Muslims that the Conservative Party tolerate Islamophobia, allow it to fester in society"". The spokesperson added that the issue was ""particularly acute"" within the party itself. The MCB is an umbrella organisation of various UK Muslim bodies, including mosques, schools, and charitable associations. It has previously called for allegations of Islamophobia in the Conservative Partyto be investigatedby the Equalities and Human Rights Commission - the body which is currently investigating allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Speaking to reporters, Mr Johnson said: ""If anybody is convicted, if anybody is done for Islamophobia, or any other prejudice or discrimination in the Conservative Party they are out first bounce."" But Mr Johnson has also faced accusations of Islamophobia himself, after hewrote in a newspaper columnlast year that Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"". Also speaking on Tuesday, Chancellor Sajid Javid refused to criticise the prime minister for these remarks, added he had ""explained why he's used that language"". He said the column  from which the quote was taken had defended the rights of Muslim women to ""wear what they like"", adding: ""He's explained that, and I think he's given a perfectly valid explanation."" The Conservatives have pledged to start an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party before the end of the year. The partysuspended a number of membersearlier this month after the Guardian supplied it with a dossier produced by an anonymous Twitter user containing examples of allegedly Islamophobic social media posts. A number of members were also suspended in September, after the BBC highlighted 20 cases to the party of members posting or endorsing Islamophobic material online.

"This video can not be played General election 2019: Boris Johnson urges end to ""divisive"" referendums Boris Johnson has ""guaranteed"" there will not be a Scottish independence referendum if the Conservatives win the forthcoming general election. The prime minister claimed Scotland had been ""paralysed"" by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP over the past decade. And he pledged that any request to hold indyref2 would be rejected with ""no negotiation"". He made the promise as he launched the Scottish Conservative manifesto ahead of the election on 12 December. Speaking at the event in Inverkeithing, Mr Johnson ruled out allowing either a second Brexit vote or a fresh Scottish independence referendum if the Conservatives are forced to seek support from other parties to stay in power after the election. Latest from the campaign trail At-a-glance: Scottish Conservatives manifesto Read the full manifesto,external The manifesto, entitled No To Indyref2, also outlines an oil and gas sector deal which the Conservatives say will help to protect more than 100,000 jobs in Scotland that rely on the industry. It also pledges: More than Â£3.1bn for Scottish public services as a result of the Barnett consequentials from Conservative commitments in England A review of alcohol duty to back Scottish whisky and gin producers A ""clear commitment"" to leave the Common Fisheries Policy in December 2020 and to ""take back control of our fishing waters as an independent coastal state"" Quadrupling the number of seasonal agricultural workers to 10,000 Permanent tax mitigation from having to pay the Scottish rate of income tax for armed forces personnel based in or resident in Scotland Writing in the foreword to the document, Mr Johnson argued that Scotland had been ""trapped like a lion in a cage"" for the past decade. And he said the country needed to move on from talk of a further referendum in order to ""restore confidence and certainty to businesses and families"" and to allow politicians to instead focus on improving public services. He added: ""You have been paralysed by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP who simply refuse to accept your decision to keep our United Kingdom together. And that is why this election is so essential. ""If the outcome of this election is a strong Conservative majority government, then I can guarantee that we will reject any request from the SNP government to hold an independence referendum. There will be no negotiation - we will mark that letter return to sender and be done with it. ""You already made your decision five years ago, when two million Scots said no to independence. Nicola Sturgeon promised you this was a once-in-a-generation decision and I will hold her to that."" Nicola Sturgeon argues that Scotland must have the right to determine its own future Mr Johnson also insisted that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was prepared to do a ""shady backroom deal with Nicola Sturgeon to get into government"" if there was a hung parliament after the election, and that ""the price of that deal will be an independence referendum in 2020"". And he claimed in his speech that he ""understood"" the SNP leader had confirmed in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil that she wanted an independent Scotland to ""rejoin the EU, to join the euro"".

However, the SNP wants Scotland to continue using the pound in the years after independence before establishing its own separate currency, and Ms Sturgeon did not say during the interview that she wanted to join the euro. Ms Sturgeon also told the interviewer that she was confident that an independent Scotland couldrejoin the EU on a ""relatively quick"" timescaleand insisted that it is ""not true to say we would have had to establish an independent currency before joining the European Union."" Nicola Sturgeon interview fact-checked Mr Corbyn has repeatedly denied that he would offer a referendum in return for SNP support - but Ms Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister and the SNP leader, says he would have little choice if he wants to be prime minister. Ms Sturgeon has said she wants to hold an independence referendum next year But she has also said that the formal consent of the UK government would be needed to ensure its legality was ""beyond doubt"" - as was the case ahead of the 2014 referendum, when Scottish voters opted to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%. Labour has said it would not seek to block a second referendum if there is a pro-independence majority after the next Holyrood election in 2021. The Liberal Democrats have proposed a federal United Kingdom, and have said they would not allow a second independence referendum during the next parliament.

"Supt Novlett Robyn Williams (right) was on trial with her sister Jennifer Hodge and Dido Massivi (left) A senior police officer convicted of possessing a child abuse video on her phone has been told she faces ""immense"" career consequences. A court heard Novlett Robyn Williams failed to report her sister for sending the ""disturbing"" clip last year. While jurors at the Old Bailey accepted Williams did not view the material, they rejected her claim she was unaware of its presence on her phone. She was ordered to carry out 200 hours' community service. Williams had denied the charge, saying she""zoned out""when she received the video. The jury was told she was one of 17 people to receive the 54-second clip via WhatsApp, and prosecutors had argued there was no way she could have missed its arrival in her inbox. They said a response sent to her older sister Jennifer Hodge, saying ""please call"", was evidence that she wanted to discuss the content. Judge Richard Marks QC, sentencing, told the Old Bailey her ""grave error of judgement"" was likely to have ""immense"" career consequences. Supt Williams, pictured with London mayor Sadiq Khan, was highly commended for her work helping families affected by the Grenfell Tower disaster The court heard Williams, who was commended for her work after the Grenfell Tower disaster, had an exemplary disciplinary record, was highly regarded for her work and was awarded the Queen's Policing Medal for distinguished service in 2003. Judge Marks told her it was ""completely tragic you found yourself in the position you now do"" considering her ""stellar career in the police force over 30 years"". She was cleared of a charge of corrupt or improper exercise of police powers in failing to report the distribution of an image. As the prosecuting barrister, Richard Wright QC, noted, this is a ""sad"" case for all those involved, particularly for Robyn Williams who could well lose the job she cherishes. She was the only one to be prosecuted of the 17 people who received the child abuse video. Two individuals reported it, but no action was taken against the other 14, raising concerns among her supporters that she's been unfairly targeted. Did it have to end up in a trial at the Old Bailey? Or could the superintendent have been dealt with through internal misconduct procedures, given her 36 years' distinguished service? There is also a wider question for all of us about our legal responsibilities when we're sent material on social media that we haven't asked for. This case has demonstrated the risks of not reporting and deleting footage that contains illegal content. Williams' sister Jennifer Hodge, 56, of Brent, was ordered to carry out 100 hours of community service having been found guilty of distributing an indecent image of a child. The social worker had denied sending the video, which she received from her partner and allegedly depicted a young girl performing a sex act on a man. Her barrister Andrea Brown also told the court the conviction had ""destroyed her relationship"" with her police officer sister, who is her only immediate family member. Supt Novlett Robyn Williams had denied all the charges Hodge's partner Dido Massivi, 61, was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment suspended for two years as well as 200 hours of community service. The bus driver had denied two counts of distributing indecent photos and one count of possessing an extreme pornographic image portraying a person having sex with a horse. Prosecutors said there was no suggestion the defendants derived any sexual gratification from the images but all three will be placed on the sex offenders' register - Hodge and Williams for five years, and Massivi for 10. Both Hodge and Massivi were also sacked from their jobs following their arrest, the court heard. Scotland Yard said Williams remains on restricted duties but that would be ""reviewed now criminal matters are complete"". Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matthew Horne said: ""The Independent Office for Police Conduct is carrying out an independent misconduct investigation into the actions of Supt Williams and we await the outcome."" The National Black Police Association said it was ""stunned and shocked"" by the 54-year-old's sentence, calling it ""institutional racism"". ""She receives this perverse outcome despite being the only one of 17 recipients of this vile video who did not view it"", it said. But Internet Watch Foundation, a UK charity responsible for finding and removing online child sexual abuse, described the officer's conviction as ""a salutary reminder of what people should do in these situations if they stumble across images or videos of child sexual abuse"". The Police Superintendents' Association said it had ""supported Supt Williams throughout this process and will continue to do so as her legal team considers an appeal"".

"Obama was served sushi at the restaurant in 2014 A world-renowned sushi restaurant where Barack Obama dined has been dropped from the Michelin gourmet guide. Sukiyabashi Jiro, focus of the 2011 documentary Jiro Dreams Of Sushi, has earned three Michelin stars every year since 2007. But the Tokyo restaurant has been dropped from the 2020 guide because it no longer accepts public reservations. To get a table you need to be a regular, have special connections, or go through a top hotel. It is run by sushi maestro Jiro Ono, who is in his 90s, and his eldest son, Yoshikazu. The restaurant can only take 10 guests at a time, with prices starting at around 40,000 yen (Â£285) for the chef's selection. It made headlines in 2014 when the then-US president and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dined there, with Mr Obama reportedly saying it was the best sushi he had ever tasted. Jiro Ono, left, and his son, Yoshikazu ""We recognise Sukiyabashi Jiro does not accept reservations from the general public, which makes it out of our scope,"" a spokeswoman from the Japanese branch of Michelin told the AFP news agency. ""Michelin's policy is to introduce restaurants where everybody can go to eat,"" she said. Allan Jenkins, editor of Observer Food Monthly, said the move would probably not faze the owners. ""Not sure they are bothered, though presume some tourists might be,"" he told the BBC. ""Truth is since the film and Obama he is the most famous Japanese sushi chef alive and he will be fine. He is ancient and only has to fill 10 spots anyway."" Andy Hayler, a restaurant critic for Elite Traveler magazine, pointed out that despite ""fascination"" within the press over the restaurant, it is only rated 66th best in Tokyo for sushi by themain local guide Tabelog,external. ""From 2008, when Michelin started covering Tokyo, it did not cover places like Mibu or Kyoaji, which are famous but are essentially private members clubs,"" he added. The dropping of Sukiyabashi Jiro comes after The Araki, a sushi restaurant in London's Mayfair, was stripped of all three of its Michelin stars this year after its chef went back to Tokyo. In 2017, French chef Sebastien Bras asked to be stripped of his three stars as itput him under ""huge pressure"".

"This video can not be played Nia Griffith said there was ""absolutely"" a need to apologise A senior member of Jeremy Corbyn's team has said he should apologise to the UK's Jewish community after the chief rabbi criticised how the party deals with anti-Semitism claims. Nia Griffith, Labour's defence spokeswoman, said the party's handling of the issue ""is a shame on us"". She told a BBC Wales election debate the party had not been effective as it should have been in dealing with it. Earlier, Mr Corbyn declined to apologise. Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis claimed ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root"" in Labour. In a BBC interview with Andrew Neil,the Labour leader was asked four times whether he would like to apologise. Mr Corbyn said his government would protect ""every community against the abuse they receive"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Griffith, asked in a TV debate in Pembrokeshire, said: ""Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to meet the chief rabbi. ""And I would say absolutely that we need to apologise to our colleagues in my own party who have been very upset but to the whole of the Jewish community as well, that we have not been as effective as we should have been in dealing with this problem. ""It is a shame on us, it really is, and it's something I'm very, very ashamed of and it's something we must absolutely put right."" A live BBC Wales debate was held in Haverfordwest on Tuesday night The BBC Wales Live debate, from Haverfordwest, also had questions from the audience on Brexit, poverty and struggling families, climate change and trust in politicians. James Wells MEP, for the Brexit Party, said 4,000 food parcels handed out to children doing school holidays in Wales showed there was a problem - and there needed to be review of universal credit and an end to delays.  ""The roll-out of the universal credit system has been a disaster. It needs to be reformed."" But he said talk of negative effects from a no-deal Brexit was ""scare-mongering"". Muslim Council criticises Tories over Islamophobia No place for anti-Semitism within Labour - Corbyn Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville-Roberts said Wales was at the bottom of too many league tables - and the party would like to ""get to grips"" with child poverty - and called for a Welsh children's allowance of Â£35 a week. David TC Davies for the Conservatives said he totally accepted that poverty existed and would never be complacent about it. ""The quickest way out of poverty is to ensure people have got work - and we have the lowest unemployment figures for 40 years and where we're looking to target tax cuts we're looking to target those who are the least well off."" Jane Dodds, for the Liberal Democrats, admitted her party could have done ""much more to stand up to the Conservative cuts when we were in coalition"" but nine years later we should be looking forward to a vision for the future, with more for schools and a look at universal credit and zero hours contracts. Ms Griffith said there needed to be a living wage of at least Â£10 per hour from the age of 16, ""so people get money to take home which is realistic,"" while universal credit needed to be completely reformed. Who is standing where in Wales Who gets your vote? 2019 policy guide General Election 2019 - a really simple guide David Davies said a Conservative vote was a 'sure way' of getting Brexit done ""Every candidate standing for parliament will support Boris's excellent deal, it will take us out of the European Union by the end of January, there'll be no tariffs, no disruption and we can respect the wish of the people of Wales and of the United Kingdom,"" said Mr Davies. Nia Griffith said the people needed to be given a chance to have a final say But Ms Griffith, who said she would be campaigning for Remain, said it was a bad deal and Labour would negotiate a deal within three months that was ""much better for our industry and our farmers"" and would be put back to the people within six months. ""We've already been having those talks in Brussels...you will be voting on that decision not just on a vague idea of Brexit."" Jane Dodds said she was most fearful of a divided country Ms Dodds said the Lib Dems were the party of Remain. ""We think that's best for Wales, best for our farmers in Wales, our business - we also think it's about being a country [that is] part of an international body...it's about playing in a bigger team"" James Wells said he got into politics because he was angry with politicians Mr Wells said Wales had voted to leave the EU and the decision had been ""frustrated"" by politicians in Westminster. ""Do we trust Boris to keep to his promises? If we can get MPs for the Brexit Party into Westminster to hold the Tories into account, we will work with Conservatives to help push through that deal, but we will hold him to account. We won't be whipped, we'll be there as independent voices, standing up for you, to make sure he keeps to his promises."" Liz Saville-Roberts said Boris Johnson's Brexit deal was Theresa May's deal 'with some of the good bits taken out' Ms Saville-Roberts said Plaid had argued consistently for remain. ""We all of us know way more about Brexit and the EU more than we did three years ago - it's been an unfortunate and difficult learning process. ""We are now proposing a second referendum to bring this to a close - and if you never want to talk about Brexit ever again, consider voting remain,"" she said. The election debate - as it happened A divided flock: Election battleground - Pembrokeshire General election 2019: The campaign in Wales so far Focus on Preseli Pembrokeshire On climate change, Ms Dodds said politicians needed to work with farmers and landowners to fight climate change and plant trees, as well as looking to invest in the Swansea Tidal Lagoon. Mr Davies said the Conservatives said they had put forward a plan to be carbon neutral by 2050. ""It might not be as ambitious as some people want but we don't want to create a loss of jobs."" Brexit Party representative Mr Wells says his colleague Nathan Gill was ""wrong"" in his personal view on whether the climate problem was man-made. He says we needed to work with the UN and to stop sending plastics overseas to be dealt with. Ms Saville-Roberts bemoaned the lack of electrified rail in Wales and a cancellation of the tidal lagoon but admitted nuclear was a difficult issue and its policy was ""no new sites"". Ms Griffiths said Labour had a ""very, very clear plan and we want to be very bold about tackling climate change"" with the use of natural resources to produce clean energy.

"Prince Andrew has previously said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein An air ambulance service has become the latest charity to withdraw its connection to the Duke of York. Yorkshire Air Ambulance (YAA) said ""staff, volunteer and donor opinion"" had led to the move by its trustee board. It follows Prince Andrew'sappearance on BBC Newsnightand the controversy over his ties to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The duke opened the air ambulance base at Nostell in 2015. For several months the duke had been facing questions over his ties to US financier Epstein, whotook his own life in Augustwhile awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The duke has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. BT and Barclays have joined universities and other charities in distancing themselves from the duke. YAA, which has become the latest charity to withdraw its connection, said: ""As a charity funded generously by public donations, we must seriously consider the opinions of our donors and supporters, and this has been a significant factor in reaching this decision."" More Yorkshire stories Prince Andrew, 59, announced on Wednesday he would step back from royal duties andall organisations he is patron ofbecause the Epstein scandal had become a ""major disruption"" to the Royal Family. Buckingham Palace had described it as ""a personal decision"" following discussions with the Queen and Prince Charles. Prince Andrew's resignation from all royal duties followed an interview on the BBC's Newsnight programme He is no longer patron of the Outward Bound Trust, the English National Ballet, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and London Metropolitan University. The University of Huddersfield has also said the prince wouldstep down as chancellor. The main role of a royal patron is to raise the profile and attract publicity for work done by charities. The prince will no longer carry out public engagements but will still attend Royal Family events such as Trooping the Colour and Remembrance Sunday. Standard Chartered Bank and KPMG also announced they were withdrawing support for the duke's business mentoring initiative Pitch@Palace, though sources told the BBC the decisions were made before the interview.

"This video can not be played The Maryland trio walk free after 36 years Three men falsely convicted of murder in the US state of Maryland have been set free after 36 years in prison. Alfred Chestnut, Andrew Stewart and Ransom Watkins had been sentenced to life in 1984 for killing a 14-year-old boy a year earlier. They were freed in Baltimore on Monday after a judge cleared their convictions following a review of their case. The case was reopened this year after Mr Chestnut sent a letter to Baltimore's Conviction Integrity Unit. He included evidence he had uncovered last year. Mr Chestnut, Mr Stewart and Mr Watkins were arrested as teenagers in November 1983 following the death of DeWitt Duckett, who was shot in the neck on his way to class at a Baltimore junior high school and had his Georgetown University jacket stolen. DeWitt's death received widespread press coverage. It was the first fatal shooting of a student in a Baltimore public school. ""These three men were convicted, as children, because of police and prosecutorial misconduct,"" Baltimore state attorney Marilyn Mosby said after the men were released. In a statement, her office said ""detectives targeted the three men, all 16-year-old black boys, using coaching and coercion of other teenage witnesses to make their case"". Alfred Chestnut embraced his mother following his release Prosecutors said during the initial investigation police ignored and withheld reports from multiple witnesses identifying another person as the killer, and that trial witnesses failed to identify the three teenagers in photo line-ups. All trial witness have now recanted evidence, Ms Mosby said. ""I don't think that today is a victory, it's a tragedy. And we need to own up to our responsibility for it,"" she said. The other suspect died in 2002. Locked up for 23 years - when the real killer had already been jailed 'How I survived 22 years on death row' Case documents had been sealed by a judge, but Mr Chestnut obtained them last year with a public records request. At a press conference, Mr Watkins said ""this should never have happened"". ""This fight is not over,"" he said. ""You all will hear from us again."" Ms Mosby also announced the launch of a new programme - Resurrection After Exoneration - to provide services to help exonerated people reintegrate into society, including support for education and mental and physical health. She said the state of Maryland did not have legislation that guided compensation for those falsely convicted of a crime, and that she would work to change that. Currently, the Board of Public Works has the authority to direct compensation. In October, the board awarded about $9m (Â£7m) in payments to five men who were wrongfully imprisoned for decades. Walter Lomax - who served 38 years for murder - received about $3m, the largest payout ever made by the state for a wrongful conviction. The Central Park Five were teenagers convicted of the rape and attempted murder of a New York City jogger in a highly publicised 1989 case. They served 6-13 years in prison before their release, and later were awarded nearly $45m in compensation Ricky Jackson received a death sentence and served 39 years in Ohio prisons until 2017, when a witness recanted, saying police had pressured him.

"Ms Aziz said she wanted to raise awareness about China's detainment of ""innocent Muslims"" A US teenager's TikTok video clip accusing China of putting Muslims into ""concentration camps"" has gone viral on the Chinese-owned social network. The post appears to be about beauty tips at its start - but the young woman then changes tack to ask her viewers to raise awareness of what she describes as a ""another Holocaust"". Feroza Aziz later tweeted that TikTok had blocked her from posting new content, as a result. TikTok has disputed this. ""TikTok does not moderate content due to political sensitivities,"" a spokesman told BBC News. Although, Douyin, the Chinese version of the app, on which Ms Aziz's posts would not have appeared, is politically censored. The company had permanently banned one of Ms Aziz's old TikTok accounts on, 15 November, for posting anunrelated video that had broken its rules on terrorism-related material,external, he said. As an additional measure, it had then blocked her smartphone, on 25 November, but that too had been unrelated to her posts about China. ""Her new account and its videos, including the eyelash video in question, were not affected and continue to receive views,"" the spokesman added. BBC News has contacted Ms Aziz and her family for comment. For its part, the Chinese government hasconsistently said the camps in question offer voluntary education and training, despite evidence to the contrary. Ms Aziz posted three videos about China's treatment of the Uighur Muslims, between Sunday and Monday. The first has been watched more than 1.4 million times and ""liked"" nearly 500,000 times on the app. A copy uploaded to Twitter by other TikTok usershas attracted,externalafurther five million views,external.

And further copies have been posted to YouTube and Instagram. Part of the videos' appeal is they are presented as a deliberate attempt to circumvent supposed censorship by TikTok's Beijing-based owner, Bytedance. Ms Aziz bookends her critical comments with talk about to make eyelashes look longer. ""I say that so TikTok doesn't take down my videos,"" she explains in one of the recordings. This video can not be played ""An electric baton to the back of the head"" - a former inmate described conditions at a secret camp to the BBC While the version of TikTok used in mainland China does censor criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, the company says it does not take the same action against posts to the separate library of user-generated content it offers elsewhere. And it notes other clips about themistreatment of Uighurs within Chinese camps,externalhave been allowed to remain on its international platform, although they do not tend to get anywhere close to the amount of attention Ms Aziz has generated. Should we be worried about TikTok? TikTok and Apple decline to testify over China TikTok hits back over China influence claims The 17-year-old's videos were posted the same weekBBC Panorama revealed how leaked documentsdetailed some of the measures used to brainwash hundreds of thousands of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang. They undermine China's claims attendance at the camps is voluntary and designed to counter extremism. China's UK ambassador has dismissed the documents as ""fake news"". This video can not be played Chinaâs UK ambassador: ""This is a pure fabrication"" Ms Aziz provides her own list of abuses. ""Spreading awareness does wonders,"" she says. ""We can reach millions across the world [and] reach those with the power to do something about it."" The BBC has also confirmed that Ms Aziz is in control of a Twitter account created earlier this month. She has tweeted that TikTok has given hera one-month suspension,externaland said that""China is terrified of the news [about the camps] spreading"",external. Others have picked up on her posts, including a member of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank, who called Ms Aziz's use of TikTok ""creatively subversive"". Any apps that operate within mainland China need to be approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Social networks recognise they are not allowed to operate unless they comply with local guidelines - and that means ensuring any content on their platform paints the government in a positive light. TikTok, known locally as Douyin, is heavily filtered. For example, in April 2018, it censored all mentions of British cartoon character Peppa Pig, concerned she was being used as a symbol of rebellion. But the Chinese government is not concerned about, and has less control over, filtering content on the version offered overseas. And in October this year, TikTok denied it screened anti-China content on its international app, saying all its US user data was stored in the United States, with a back-up in Singapore.

"This video can not be played Toni rushed into the bush to rescue a koala crying out for help A koala which drew wide attention after being rescued from an Australian bushfire has died, after failing to recover from his burns. The koala, dubbed Lewis, had been taken to an animal hospital last week after a woman plucked him from a tree in burning bushland in New South Wales. Video of the rescue - which shows Toni Doherty using her shirt to wrap up the koala - was viewed globally. Vets said the marsupial was put down because his burns were not improving. ""[Our] number one goal is animal welfare, so it was on those grounds that this decision was made,"" said Port Macquarie Koala Hospital. Why do koalas fare so badly in bushfires? Six people have died and more than 500 homes have been lost since a bushfire crisis began ravaging Australia in September. In the video, Ms Doherty is seen pouring water over the distressed animal in an attempt to cool it. This video can not be played Toni Doherty was reunited with Lewis before the decision was made to have him put down She told local news outlets she had been driving through the forest when she spotted the koala among the flames and heard its cries. ""I didn't realise they could cry out. It was just so heart-rending and I knew I needed to get him out of there as quickly as possible,"" Ms Doherty told Nine News. The 14-year-old koala had significant burns to its chest, feet and other parts of its body, vets said. The hospital has treated dozens of koalas injured from the bushfires which have burnt through more than a million hectares in New South Wales alone.

"Jo Swinson asked the court to stop the Royal Mail distributing the leaflet Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has succeeded in her bid to stop an SNP leaflet which accuses her of accepting a Â£14,000 donation from ""a fracking company"". Ms Swinson asked the Court of Session in Edinburgh to stop the Royal Mail from distributing the leaflet in her East Dunbartonshire constituency. The SNP's QC had argued there was no ""substantial untruth"" in the leaflet. But Lord Pentland said a statement on the leaflet was false in substance, materially inaccurate and defamatory. He said: ""I don't consider it would be right for an official election leaflet which contains a prima facie defamatory statement to be distributed by the Royal Mail."" Ruling in favour of Ms Swinson, Lord Pentland ordered the SNP and its candidate Amy Callaghan to pay Ms Swinson's costs. The SNP's legal team is considering an appeal. Ms Swinson's lawyers said the leaflet had accused her of hypocrisy because she had accepted a Â£14,000 donation ""from a fracking company."""" However, lawyers acting for Ms Swinson claimed the statement was defamatory. They also sought an order from judge Lord Pentland which would stop the Royal Mail from distributing the leaflet. Roddy Dunlop QC told the court earlier that a director of Warwick Energy, a renewable energy company which holds licences for fracking, had made the Â£14,000 donation in a personal capacity to Ms Swinson's constituency office. The QC said the donation had not been made to Ms Swinson personally and had not come from a fracking company, and that 80% of the company's output came from renewable energy sources. He said: ""It does have a fracking licence but it doesn't engage in shale gas fracking."" Mr Dunlop added: ""We are in the midst of a general election. It is unlawful for there to be made a false statement of fact in relation to the personal character or conduct of a character."" The leaflets were due to be distributed by the end of this week. The court heard that a number of them had already been distributed. For the SNP, Jonathan Mitchell QC said there was no ""substantial untruth"" in the leaflet. He said the money was from a ""fracking source."" He added: ""These are allegations, disgraceful allegations, made against her which have been out in the public domain since June. ""The criticism is of her voting record and her connection to frackers. ""There is no substantial falseness in any of this."" The claims contained in the leaflet did not meet the legal test for defamation, he added. He said the hypocrite remark was justified given Ms Swinson's past public statements in which she said she supported pro-environment government policies. He added: ""The allegation is not one regarding personal conduct or character. It is of her policies. ""The complaint is about her priorities; her record."" Following Lord Pentland's decision, Mr Mitchell said his clients would consider launching an appeal as a matter of ""urgency"". He said this was because voters in East Dunbartonshire casting postal votes would do so without receiving an electoral communication from the SNP.

"The traditional Christmas dinner is likely to make a bigger dent in your wallet this year, because supply issues have pushed up prices. Fewer turkeys have been hatched this year after high summer temperatures reduced the number of eggs, according to business consultancy CGA. Meanwhile, wet weather and floods have hit supplies of vegetables such as Brussels sprouts and potatoes. It said the risk was supermarkets could pass on the higher costs to consumers. ""Problems with production this year have accelerated inflation in the turkey market in particular,"" CGA said Most common Christmas delivery problems revealed Do Christmas adverts really work? Recipe: Budget Christmas dinner It said some former turkey producers had got out of the business altogether, preferring to rear chickens instead. ""From a turkey perspective, the vast majority of sales take place over Christmas, which has caused producers to move to a more profitable alternative in chicken,"" said Fiona Speakman, CGA's client director for food and retail. ""This has been compounded by bad weather impacting egg yield, meaning that turkeys are at a premium,"" she told the BBC. Prices of Brussels sprouts are also rising Christmas ham is expected to be more expensive as well, because large numbers of pigs have been culled in an effort to halt the global spread of African Swine Fever. ""The pressure on supply means whole-pig prices rose by more than 10% between March and October,"" CGA said. CGA, in association with procurement firm Prestige Purchasing, monitors wholesale food prices by compiling a monthly Foodservice Price Index. It says it has seen a ""relentless"" rise in food and drink inflation over the past three years. In the past 12 months alone, it says food and drink prices have gone up by 6.77% - more than four times the official Consumer Prices Index inflation rate of 1.5%, as measured by the Office for National Statistics. The difference suggests operators and retailers have largely absorbed the higher costs. Prestige Purchasing's chief executive, Shaun Allen, said the price rises for turkey and ham could lead to a surge in demand for other meats at Christmas, such as beef. He added: ""The increasing costs on a number of traditional Christmas dinner items will be extremely unwelcome and will put pressure on margins for both operators and retailers in order to keep the costs down for customers over the festive period."" Separate research by CGA indicates that more people are eating out during the Christmas period, with 70% of consumers visiting a restaurant over December. ""Set menus and Christmas promotions often add further value to meals,"" said Ms Speakman, ""not to mention the time saved on shopping, cooking and all that washing-up.""

"This video can not be played Footage of the moment Mohamud struck at Manchester Victoria A man who launched a frenzied knife attack at a railway station has admitted trying to kill three people, including a police officer. Mahdi Mohamud, 26, stabbed and slashed at a couple and then attacked Sgt Lee Valentine at Manchester Victoria railway station on New Year's Eve. The couple's injuries included a punctured lung and a skull fracture. Mohamud pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to three counts of attempted murder and a terror offence. He admitted possession of a document or record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism and will be sentenced on Wednesday. This video can not be played Manchester stabbing: Police restrain suspect The court heard Mohamud, of Cheetham Hill in Manchester, walked up behind a man and a woman in their 50s shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" and ""Long live the caliphate"" as they headed for a tram platform shortly before 21:00 GMT on 31 December. He stabbed the man repeatedly in the back, shoulders and head and then slashed the woman across the face after the couple randomly crossed his path. The man suffered 13 injuries including a skull fracture while the woman's right lung was punctured and she suffered a slash to her forehead that cut down to the bone. Four officers, including Sgt Valentine (second left) and two tram staff, received commendations following the attack British Transport Police officers and tram staff confronted Mohamud, who witnesses said was ""like an animal"" and was ""fixated"" on stabbing and slashing. Sgt Valentine, 31, shot Mohamud with his Taser but the barbs got stuck in the knifeman's coat and failed to paralyse him. The sergeant was stabbed in the shoulder before the suspect was wrestled to the ground and arrested. Sgt Valentine said Mohamud was ""dancing around, waving this knife around"" before he started to run at the officers. ""He probably closed a seven foot gap in half a second,"" he added. ""It was just like a dive, he flew, he probably jumped three or four foot off the ground and just sort of lunged, probably lunged at my head with his knife."" A woman and a man in their 50s and a police sergeant were stabbed A second kitchen knife was found in Mohamud's waistband. Greater Manchester Police said officers recovered a large amount of ""counter-terrorism mindset material"", including images and a document about how to carry out knife attacks. The defendant, a Dutch national from a Somali family, had arrived in the UK aged nine and became radicalised online, the force said. Mohamud was sectioned under the Mental Health Act following the attack and taken to a secure mental health facility where he is currently detained. Prosecutor Alison Morgan QC said: ""The prosecution's case is that the attack at Victoria Station was not simply a product of that mental illness. ""It was intended to be a lethal attack, carefully planned over a number of months, reflecting the defendant's extremist ideology and his desire to perform violent jihad. ""The defendant's actions may have been disinhibited by his mental illness, but they were driven by an entrenched desire to undertake jihad against the West."" The court heard how Mohamud has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and he will need treatment for the rest of his life. Mahdi Mohamud will be sentenced on Wednesday following the stabbing at Manchester Victoria railway station on New Year's Eve Rebecca Trowler QC, defending, said Mohamud had first been admitted to a UK mental health hospital in December 2015. He was also admitted to institutions in Somalia on three occasions in 2017 during which time he swung an axe at a nurse, stabbed a second nurse with a knife in a separate attack, and also stabbed his uncle, the court heard. His symptoms include hallucinations and ""complex persecutory delusional beliefs"" which led him to be believe his actions were being controlled as he followed by MI5 and the government. In a letter to the judge, Mohamud's father said he felt a ""terrible sense of guilt"" for not getting his son the right treatment earlier and thanked police and the emergency services. Ms Trowler said the defendant's family had slipped anti-psychotic drugs into his food in the days before the attack and made him a doctor's appointment.

"This video can not be played Muslim Council of Britainâs Miqdaad Versi says Islamophobia is ""endemic, institutional within the Conservative Partyâ The Muslim Council of Britain has accused the Conservative Party of ""denial, dismissal and deceit"" over the issue of Islamophobia. The MCB said the party had a ""blind spot for this type of racism"" and had failed to take steps to tackle it. The group was responding to criticism of Labour's handling of anti-Semitism by the chief rabbi. Conservative leader Boris Johnson said party members guilty of Islamophobia ""are out first bounce"". Inthe Times,external, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said Labour had not done enough to tackle anti-Semitism and urged people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the general election. He wrote that the ""overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety"" at the prospect of a Labour victory in the 12 December poll. Chief rabbi in election attack on Labour Tory candidate suspended over anti-Semitism Tories suspend members over Islamophobia claims In response, the MCB said British Muslims would ""listen to the chief rabbi and agree on the importance of voting with their conscience"". A spokesperson added that the ""unacceptable presence of anti-Semitism in Britain"" was a source of ""real fear"" for British Jews. They added the chief rabbi's comments ""highlighted the importance of speaking out on the racism we face, whilst maintaining our non-partisan stance."" ""It is abundantly clear to many Muslims that the Conservative Party tolerate Islamophobia, allow it to fester in society"". The spokesperson added that the issue was ""particularly acute"" within the party itself. The MCB is an umbrella organisation of various UK Muslim bodies, including mosques, schools, and charitable associations. It has previously called for allegations of Islamophobia in the Conservative Partyto be investigatedby the Equalities and Human Rights Commission - the body which is currently investigating allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Speaking to reporters, Mr Johnson said: ""If anybody is convicted, if anybody is done for Islamophobia, or any other prejudice or discrimination in the Conservative Party they are out first bounce."" But Mr Johnson has also faced accusations of Islamophobia himself, after hewrote in a newspaper columnlast year that Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"". Also speaking on Tuesday, Chancellor Sajid Javid refused to criticise the prime minister for these remarks, added he had ""explained why he's used that language"". He said the column  from which the quote was taken had defended the rights of Muslim women to ""wear what they like"", adding: ""He's explained that, and I think he's given a perfectly valid explanation."" The Conservatives have pledged to start an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party before the end of the year. The partysuspended a number of membersearlier this month after the Guardian supplied it with a dossier produced by an anonymous Twitter user containing examples of allegedly Islamophobic social media posts. A number of members were also suspended in September, after the BBC highlighted 20 cases to the party of members posting or endorsing Islamophobic material online.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""There is no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism in our society, our country or in my party."" Jeremy Corbyn has insisted there is no place for anti-Semitism within Labour and those guilty of anti-Jewish racism have been ""brought to book"". He urged the Jewish community to ""engage"" with him following outspoken criticism from the chief rabbi. Ephraim Mirvis had claimed ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - has taken root"" in the party. Mr Corbyn said anti-Semitism was ""vile"" and ""rapid and effective"" action had been taken against offenders. At the launch of the party's""race and faith manifesto"",he said anti-Semitism would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government. He said no community would be ""at risk because of its faith, identity, ethnicity or language"". Mr Mirvis, the Orthodox chief rabbi of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, earlier warned that ""the overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety"" at the prospect of a Labour victory in 12 December's general election. Chief rabbi in election attack on Labour Teach British Empire injustice in schools - Labour Live: Latest on campaign trail The chief rabbi, who is the spiritual leader of the United Synagogue, the largest umbrella group of Jewish communities in the country, said Labour's claim it had investigated all cases of anti-Semitism in its ranks was a ""mendacious fiction"". In an article for the Times,external, he asked people to ""vote with their conscience"" in the election. Asked if he regretted not doing enough to tackle the issue, Mr Corbyn said internal processes for dealing with anti-Semitism were ""constantly under review"" and his door would be open to Mr Mirvis and other faith leaders to discuss their concerns if he entered Downing Street. Ephraim Mirvis urged people to vote ""with their conscience"" ""Since I became leader, there are disciplinary procedures that didn't exist before. Where people have committed anti-Semitic acts they are brought to book and, if necessary, expelled from the party or suspended, or asked to be educated better about it. ""I want to live in a country where people respect each other's faiths and people feel secure to be Jewish, Muslim, Hindu or Christian. ""But be absolutely clear of this assurance from me: No community will be at risk because of its faith, identity, ethnicity or language. I have spent my life fighting racism. ""I ask those who think things have not been done correctly to talk to me about it but above all engage. I am very happy to engage."" Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The BBC's political editor said one of the Labour candidates present at the party's race and faith manifesto launch had herself been accused of making allegedly anti-Semitic comments.

A number of prominent Jewish Labour politicians, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, have quit the party after being the subject of anti-Semitic abuse on social media while others have accused Mr Corbyn ofpersonally endorsing anti-Semitic tropes and imagery. Ms Ellman said the chief rabbi had been right to speak out and his remarks highlighted the ""gravity of the situation"" facing British Jews. ""It is unprecedented for a major political party - a potential party of government - to be perpetuating anti-Semitism,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One. ""This is not just about Jewish people, it is about the whole of our society."" Any intervention like this from a significant religious leader would be damaging, but the timing is a nightmare - just two weeks from polling day and on the very day Labour launched its race and faith manifesto. And the language the chief rabbi used - it's all bad, bad, bad. Mr Corbyn didn't really take on the chief rabbi's comments. He talked about how anti-Semitism was vile and evil, how if he was PM he would want to ensure greater security and protection for synagogues and mosques. The nearest he actually got to directly addressing the chief rabbi's intervention was to say ""engage""- appealing to all religious groups to engage with him if they have concerns. I take it from that that Team Labour have decided there is not much they can say or do that is going to make any difference to how he is seen by many, many people in the Jewish community. Team Corbyn take the view that they have introduced new disciplinary procedures, fast-tracked them and, as a result, more people are getting turfed out of the party. Mr Corbyn has said again and again and again that he abhors anti-Semitism, and yet it doesn't really seem to have made any difference to his relationship with large sections of the Jewish community. They almost just had to take the hit, move on and hope this blows over and the election moves on to other issues. Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who had been due to lead an independent review into anti-Semitism before the equality watchdog intervened, urged the party to heed the chief rabbi's words. ""We deserved an attack that strong,"" he told the BBC. ""We need to deal with anti-Semitism properly."" He added: ""I really hope that the chief rabbi's absolutely extraordinary, but justified, intervention will be listened to by my party."" Rabbi Jonathan Romain said he had written ""to my own community"" to say there was ""a serious problem with Corbyn-led Labour"" and that they should vote for whichever party ""is most likely to defeat a Labour candidate"". And historian Simon Sebag Montefiore said the ""overwhelming majority of the Jewish community"" felt anti-Semitism was ""rife and unchecked"" in the Labour Party. But the Labour peer Lord Dubs, the child refugee campaigner who fled Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in the 1930s, said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the tone of the chief rabbi's remarks. He said he was reassured that Mr Corbyn - a longstanding campaigner for peace in the Middle East and the rights of the Palestinian people - was not personally an anti-Semite. He said where Labour had failed was in not acting ""a bit quicker"" in dealing with the issue. Muslim Council criticises Tories over Islamophobia The Labour leader faced criticism from Jewish groups when he said in last week's general election ITV leader's debate that the party had ""investigated every single case"" raised by complainants. He did not address the chief rabbi's claim that 130 cases were outstanding. Campaigning in Scotland, Conservative leader Boris Johnson said it was ""clearly a failure of leadership"" on Mr Corbyn's part that he ""has not been able to stamp out this virus in the Labour Party"". But he faced criticism of his own party's record on racism, afterthe Muslim Council of Britain accused the Conservative Party of ""denial, dismissal and deceit"" over the issue of Islamophobia. South-African born Mr Mirvis became chief rabbi in 2013. In a Facebook post in July, he congratulated Mr Johnson on his election as Conservative leader, describing the new prime minister as a ""long-standing friend and champion of the Jewish community"". According to the British Board of Deputies, there are between 260,000 and 300,000 Jews in England and Wales. Around half belong to the Central Orthodox denomination which includes the United Synagogue, led by the chief rabbi.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Jeremy Corbyn is pressed over his handling of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn has declined to apologise to the UK Jewish community after the chief rabbi criticised how the party deals with anti-Semitism claims. In aBBC interview with Andrew Neil, the Labour leader was asked four times whether he would like to apologise. Mr Corbyn said his government will protect ""every community against the abuse they receive"". Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis claimed ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top -has taken root"" in Labour. Following the interview, Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffithsaid Mr Corbyn should apologise, adding: ""We need to apologise to our colleagues in my own party who have been very upset and to the whole of the Jewish community."" Kuenssberg: Labour may struggle to move on from anti-Semitism row Muslim Council criticises Tories over Islamophobia No place for anti-Semitism within Labour - Corbyn Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. In an interview with Andrew Neil on BBC One, Mr Corbyn was asked four times whether he was going to apologise to the British Jewish community following the chief rabbi's claim that Labour was not doing enough to root out anti-Jewish racism. Mr Corbyn replied: ""What I'll say is this I am determined that our society is safe for people of all faiths. ""I don't want anyone to be feeling insecure, in our society and our government will protect every community against the abuse they receive on the streets, on the trains, or in any other form of life."" Mr Corbyn said racism ""is a total poison"", adding: ""I want to work with every community, to make sure it's eliminated. That is what my whole life has been about."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says restoring Waspi pensions would be be paid for from government reserves and long-term borrowing. Rabbi Mirvis described Mr Corbyn's claim that Labour had ""investigated every single case"" of alleged anti-Semitism as a ""mendacious fiction"". Challenged about the rabbi's comment, Mr Corbyn said: ""No, he's not right. Because he would have to produce the evidence to say that's mendacious."" The Labour leader said he was ""looking forward to having a discussion with him because I want to hear why he would say such a thing"". Mr Corbyn also insisted he had ""developed a much stronger process"" for dealing with allegations and had sanctioned and removed members who were judged to have made anti-Semitic statements. He added that anti-Semitism allegations ""didn't rise after I became leader"". ""Anti-Semitism is there in society, there are a very, very small number of people in the Labour Party that have been sanctioned as a result about their anti-Semitic behaviour,"" he told Andrew Neil. Speaking in the BBC Wales election TV debate, Ms Griffith, a senior member of Mr Corbyn's team, said the party's handling of anti-Semitism claims was ""a shame on us"" and ""we must absolutely put right"". She added: ""We have not been as effective as we should have been in dealing with this problem."" Mr Corbyn was also quizzed about his plan to get a ""credible"" Brexit deal with the EU and then be neutral in the referendum on the deal he has promised to hold within six months of taking power. Asked what he would do during the referendum campaign, he said: ""I will be the honest broker that will make sure the referendum is fair and make sure that the Leave deal is a credible one. ""That seems to me actually an adult and sensible way to go forward."" Mr Corbyn was also quizzed about Labour's plan to increase income tax on those earning more Â£85,000 a year to pay for better public services. He denied many of these people would leave the country under a Labour government, destroying the tax base the party would rely on to fund its plans. But he said they ""could and should"" pay more. ""They can see all around them the crumbling of public services and the terrible levels of child poverty that exist across Britain. ""There is no reason why they would have to leave the country and they shouldn't."" Mr Corbyn also said a Labour government would not borrow money ""willy-nilly"". ""What we are going to do is deal with the worst aspects of what's happened in austerity, the worst aspects of poverty in Britain,"" he said. On Labour's policy to compensate some of the women who lost out as a result of changes to the pension age, Mr Corbyn said the women were ""short-changed"" and a ""moral debt"" was owed. What is Labour offering to Waspi women? The campaign for compensation has been led by the group Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi). Labour says the policy would cost about Â£58bn, paid in instalments over five years. When pressed on where this money would come from, Mr Corbyn said it will be paid from government reserves and, if necessary, borrowing, ""over some years"". He conceded that there were not sufficient funds in the government's reserves to cover the bill, but insisted the women deserved to be repaid. ""We will make sure they are compensated,"" he said.

"The initial scope of the inquiry was to examine 23 cases but this has now grown to hundreds More than 200 new families have contacted an inquiry into mother and baby deaths at a hospital trust in Shropshire. Investigators were already looking at more than 600 cases where newborns and mothers died or were left injured while in the care of the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust. One expert says the scandal, spanning decades, may be the tip of the iceberg. Dr Bill Kirkup says it suggests failure might be more widespread in the NHS. The surge in new cases follows the leak of an interim report last week. Theleaked report, compiled by the maternity expert Donna Ockenden for NHS Improvement, outlined a catalogue of maternity failings from 1979 to the present day that led to avoidable deaths of mothers and babies at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust (SaTH). It revealed that some children were left disabled, staff got the names of some dead babies wrong and, in one case, referred to a child as ""it"". Sources say hundreds of new families have now come forward in the wake of the coverage of the leaked report. Kay Kelly, head of clinical negligence at the law firm Lanyon Bowdler, is a solicitor acting for some of the families involved. She says that since the leaked report was made public, her firm alone has had more than 80 new inquiries. Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was placed in special measures ""A lot of them aren't brand new stories. ""They're things that have happened many years ago and these people have been prompted to telephone us because of the story. ""Many of them are people who lost babies at the hospital and that worries me because I understood that the hospital had passed on the information to the Donna Ockenden inquiry."" One of those being represented by Kay Kelly is Chrissie, whose son, a twin, was left with cerebral palsy after birth. Chrissie's case against SaTH is continuing and she didn't want to be identified. But she told me she was furious that so many families have also had to go through the terrible events she experienced. ""Nobody learned any lessons from what happened to me. ""And to know now that there've been hundreds of cases, I'm angry. ""I am really angry. Angry at them for lying to me. ""I'm angry for all the poor families, the hundreds of families and that's thousands of people because they've got the grandparents, the aunts, the uncles. ""I just feel overwhelmed at the moment with anger, anger and just, I don't understand it."" There are concerns too that the failings seen at SaTH echo closely those at another maternity unit run by the Morecambe Bay Trust. The man who headed the inquiry intothat scandal where 11 babies and one mother diedis Dr Bill Kirkup, a respected expert on maternity care. ""These are not two separate one-offs, these point to underlying systemic failure that might be widespread. ""The notion that it could never happen here is one of the most dangerous ones an NHS Trust can have. ""The truth is, there are points of learning from all of these things that everybody should be looking at and learning from."" The investigation team is not expected to report until late next year. But with families still coming forward, its work may last much longer. Donna Ockenden, chair of independent review, said: ""I would like to thank the brave families who have come forward and shared their experiences - my team are now contacting families on a daily basis. If families would like to raise a concern I am asking them to please get in touch."" Shropshire baby deaths review: What do we know?

"This video can not be played Footage of the moment Mohamud struck at Manchester Victoria A man who launched a frenzied knife attack at a railway station has admitted trying to kill three people, including a police officer. Mahdi Mohamud, 26, stabbed and slashed at a couple and then attacked Sgt Lee Valentine at Manchester Victoria railway station on New Year's Eve. The couple's injuries included a punctured lung and a skull fracture. Mohamud pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to three counts of attempted murder and a terror offence. He admitted possession of a document or record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism and will be sentenced on Wednesday. This video can not be played Manchester stabbing: Police restrain suspect The court heard Mohamud, of Cheetham Hill in Manchester, walked up behind a man and a woman in their 50s shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" and ""Long live the caliphate"" as they headed for a tram platform shortly before 21:00 GMT on 31 December. He stabbed the man repeatedly in the back, shoulders and head and then slashed the woman across the face after the couple randomly crossed his path. The man suffered 13 injuries including a skull fracture while the woman's right lung was punctured and she suffered a slash to her forehead that cut down to the bone. Four officers, including Sgt Valentine (second left) and two tram staff, received commendations following the attack British Transport Police officers and tram staff confronted Mohamud, who witnesses said was ""like an animal"" and was ""fixated"" on stabbing and slashing. Sgt Valentine, 31, shot Mohamud with his Taser but the barbs got stuck in the knifeman's coat and failed to paralyse him. The sergeant was stabbed in the shoulder before the suspect was wrestled to the ground and arrested. Sgt Valentine said Mohamud was ""dancing around, waving this knife around"" before he started to run at the officers. ""He probably closed a seven foot gap in half a second,"" he added. ""It was just like a dive, he flew, he probably jumped three or four foot off the ground and just sort of lunged, probably lunged at my head with his knife."" A woman and a man in their 50s and a police sergeant were stabbed A second kitchen knife was found in Mohamud's waistband. Greater Manchester Police said officers recovered a large amount of ""counter-terrorism mindset material"", including images and a document about how to carry out knife attacks. The defendant, a Dutch national from a Somali family, had arrived in the UK aged nine and became radicalised online, the force said. Mohamud was sectioned under the Mental Health Act following the attack and taken to a secure mental health facility where he is currently detained. Prosecutor Alison Morgan QC said: ""The prosecution's case is that the attack at Victoria Station was not simply a product of that mental illness. ""It was intended to be a lethal attack, carefully planned over a number of months, reflecting the defendant's extremist ideology and his desire to perform violent jihad. ""The defendant's actions may have been disinhibited by his mental illness, but they were driven by an entrenched desire to undertake jihad against the West."" The court heard how Mohamud has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and he will need treatment for the rest of his life. Mahdi Mohamud will be sentenced on Wednesday following the stabbing at Manchester Victoria railway station on New Year's Eve Rebecca Trowler QC, defending, said Mohamud had first been admitted to a UK mental health hospital in December 2015. He was also admitted to institutions in Somalia on three occasions in 2017 during which time he swung an axe at a nurse, stabbed a second nurse with a knife in a separate attack, and also stabbed his uncle, the court heard. His symptoms include hallucinations and ""complex persecutory delusional beliefs"" which led him to be believe his actions were being controlled as he followed by MI5 and the government. In a letter to the judge, Mohamud's father said he felt a ""terrible sense of guilt"" for not getting his son the right treatment earlier and thanked police and the emergency services. Ms Trowler said the defendant's family had slipped anti-psychotic drugs into his food in the days before the attack and made him a doctor's appointment.

"This video can not be played Head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson was ""thrilled"" the school was not criticised by the judge Demonstrations against LGBT inclusive education have been permanently banned outside a primary school. A High Court judge ruled in favour of an exclusion zone to remain around Anderton Park, in Birmingham, which has been targeted by protesters for months. The protests had an averse effect on pupils, residents and staff, leading to 21 teachers being treated for stress, Mr Justice Warby said. Campaigners accused the city council of trying to silence debate. The protests at the school in Balsall Heath aimed to stop LGBT relationships education, with many parents and activists claiming it contradicts their Islamic faith and is not ""age appropriate"". Protesters were banned from the school gates in June October's five-day hearing at the city's Priory Courts heard there were further ""untrue"" and ""harmful"" allegations made about the school on social media, and how a visiting imam had claimed to parents there were ""paedophiles"" inside the school. Other false claims included that the school had a ""paedophile agenda"" and staff were ""teaching children how to masturbate"". ""None of this is true,"" Mr Justice Warby said as he handed down the ban at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre.

The lessons had been ""misrepresented by parents"", he said, adding the school does not promote homosexuality and seeks to weave the language of equality into everyday school life. This video can not be played Lead protester Shakeel Afsar is ""bitterly disappointed"" by the  ban Since June protesters have gathered just outside the exclusion zone. In the hearing last month, the city council argued an interim injunctionshould be extended beyond school gates and made permanent. Birmingham City Council said the noisy protests at the school gates were disrupting lessons and meant children were unable to use the playground. The council maintained the court action was in response to campaigners' behaviour, not the issue of the protests. The LGBT teaching row explained Birmingham LGBT row: The view from the school gates Latest news from the West Midlands The prior injunction named lead protester Shakeel Afsar, who does not have children at the school, his sister Rosina and Amir Ahmed, all of whom contested the need for a legal injunction. Mr Justice Warby directed that the three named defendants should be liable to 80% of those costs, which the court heard have yet to be calculated. The judge said the reason the award was not in full was because part of the council's claim - for an injunction on the making of abusive social media posts against teachers - had been unsuccessful. Teaching at the school had been ""grossly misrepresented"", Mr Justice Warby said Mr Afsar said he was ""bitterly disappointed with the decision of the court"". He branded the court ""one-sided"", pointing out that the judge, the council's barrister and key witnesses had been ""white"", compared with the ""diverse"" protest supporters. ""We can continue to protest in the same area that we have been protesting in since June this year,"" he added. ""These young children are not being taught the status of law."" Protests have continued outside an exclusion zone at Anderton Park Primary School Speaking after the ruling, head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson said staff would be ""over the moon"". ""We knew it was misrepresented and that was the frustration when you are trying to go about your daily business as educators and when people say things about you that are not true, that is very difficult,"" she said ""It has been awful, but my staff are unbelievable and parents are unbelievable and the children of Anderton Park are incredible human beings and we are a strong school and every single person is part of that strength."" By BBC correspondent Phil Mackie It's hard to see what the protesters can do now. One of the group's three leaders - Amir Ahmed - has said they would seek leave to appeal, but it's far from clear on what grounds they could do so. Only a handful of the people who regularly gathered outside the school were parents or had any direct connection with Anderton Park, but the demonstrators do reflect concern felt by some religious communities about equality teaching, and particularly lessons about same sex relationships. It won't matter to them that the judge has said their allegations about ""promoting"" homosexuality are false and that they have ""misrepresented"" what is being taught in the school. It will simply confirm their belief that they are the victims of bias against them by the establishment and the mainstream media. This video can not be played What is in the books that Parkfield parents are protesting about? Birmingham City Council said it was ""really pleased"" with Mr Justice Warby's decision. ""This was always about protecting the school and community from the escalating levels of anti-social behaviour of the protests,"" Dr Tim O'Neill, the council's director of education and skills, said. ""Birmingham is diverse and inclusive - these are its strengths - and we must all come together to ensure all children get the best education possible."" He said ""fringe elements"" had been attracted to the protests with the aim of ""stoking division and hatred"". Shakeel Afsar insisted the demonstrations were ""peaceful"" Christian campaigner John Allman, from Okehampton in Devon, had joined proceedings with a view to ""raising freedom of expression arguments"" in opposition to aspects of the injunction that sought to restrict statements on social media. Meanwhile, Mr Afsar had claimed the weekly protests were ""peaceful"" despite the use of megaphones and a sound-boosting PA system. The National Association of Head Teachers, which has supported the school, welcomed an end to the ""noisy and aggressive protests"". ""This judgement makes it abundantly clear that the school gate is no place to hold a protest,"" a spokesperson said. It was also welcomed by the Department for Education,which has previously faced criticism for a perceived lack of support for the school, but said it wanted to ""encourage positive dialogue"". Update 29 November 2019: This article has been updated to reflect that John Allman's part in proceedings was related to freedom of expression arguments and not the exclusion zone.

"This video can not be played Don't get left outside on polling day - here's how to register to vote More than 3.1m people have applied to register to vote since MPs agreed to an election at the end of October. The Electoral Reform Society says 875,300 more applications have been made in this period, compared to the 34 days between the calling of the election and polling day in 2017. It says the ""surge"" in registrations is ""highly encouraging"". People who want to take part in the general election on 12 December had until midnight to register. Those in England, Scotland or Wales who want to apply to vote by post had until 17:00 GMT on Tuesday to do so. People who want someone to vote on their behalf have until the same time on 4 December to apply. However the deadline for voters in Northern Ireland to apply for a postal or proxy vote has already passed. About 45.8m people were already registered to vote in UK parliamentary elections as of December 2018,according to the Office for National Statistics,external. How can I register to vote in 2019 election? Who should I vote for? Election policy guide Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? About two-thirds of those who have registered since the end of October are under the age of 35, and more than a million are under 25. There was a spike in registration among all age groups on 30 October, the day after MPs gave their backing to the pre-Christmas poll. Out of 177,000 registrations on that day, 115,400 were from people aged under 35, according to thegovernment website,externalthat tracks registration. The next big spike came on 12 November, which coincided with a Labour Party Facebook campaign aimed at getting young people to register. And another was on Friday, when nearly 308,000 registrations were recorded - the same day as BBC One's Question Time featured Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon in a two-hour special. The biggest spike in applications so far was on Monday, the day before the registration deadline, when there were more than 366,000 registrations recorded - 150,000 of these were from people aged under 25. An increase in applications is not firm evidence of an increase in the number of people able to vote - previous elections have seen voter registration applications from people who are already registered or who are below the voting age. By Tom Barton, political correspondent During the 50 days before voter registration deadline day, more than a third of applications, 1.3 million, were from under-25s. And while that is a significant increase on the 2017 figure of nearly 900,000, it should be seen in the context of an overall boost to the numbers of people applying to register. As a proportion of overall applications it is almost exactly the same as in 2017. However, there has been a fall in the proportion of applications coming from 25-34 year olds, a group that was seen by experts as key to Labour's result two years ago. In 2017 33% of applications were from this group, this year it's below 30%. Conversely, there's been an increase in the proportion of applications by voters over the age of 45, who make up nearly 20 percent of the total this year, compared with 16.5% in 2017. So - while nearly half a million young people applying to join the electoral register might initially look like good news for Labour, the detail suggests the figures might not be quite as helpful for them as they first appear. It comes as celebrities use their social media platforms to encourage people to register ahead of the deadline. On Instagram, a video by the Game of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke urging people to register had been viewed over 5.7m times by Tuesday morning. Allow Instagram content?

"Climate change is said to have increased the severity of recent wildfires in Australia Countries will have to increase their carbon-cutting ambitions five fold if the world is to avoid warming by more than 1.5C, the UN says. The annual emissions gap report shows that even if all current promises are met, the world will warm by more than double that amount by 2100. Richer countries have failed to cut emissions quickly enough, the authors say. Fifteen of the 20 wealthiest nations have no timeline for a net zero target. Greenhouse gas concentrations break records China coal surge threatens Paris climate targets BBC Briefing: Energy Hot on the heels of the World Meteorological Organization's report on greenhouse gas concentrations, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) has published its regular snapshot of how the world is doing in cutting levels of these pollutants. The emissions gap report looks at the difference between how much carbon needs to be cut to avoid dangerous warming  - and where we are likely to end up with the promises that countries have currently committed to, in the Paris climate agreement. The UN assessment is fairly blunt. ""The summary findings are bleak,"" it says. ""Countries collectively failed to stop the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required."" The report says that emissions have gone up by 1.5% per year in the last decade. In 2018, the total reached 55 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is putting the Earth on course to experience a temperature rise of 3.2C by the end of this century. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Just last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that allowing temperatures to rise more than 1.5 degrees this century would have hugely damaging effects for human, plant and animal life across the planet. This report says that to keep this target alive, the world needs to cut emissions by 7.6% every year for the next 10 years. ""Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions - over 7% each year, if we break it down evenly over the next decade,"" said Inger Andersen, Unep's executive director. The report pays particular attention to the actions of the richest countries. The group of the 20 wealthiest (G20) are responsible for 78% of all emissions. But so far, only the EU, the UK, Italy and France have committed to long-term net zero targets. Forest clearing in Asia has contributed significantly to carbon emissions over the past decade Seven G20 members need to take more action to achieve their current promises. These include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, South Africa and the US. For example, Brazil's plans were recently revised, ""reflecting the recent trend towards increased deforestation"". Three countries - India, Russia and Turkey - are all on track to over-achieve their plans by 15% but the authors of the report say this is because the targets they set themselves were too low in the first place. For three others - Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia - the researchers are uncertain as to whether they are meeting their targets or not. Flooding is one of the most damaging consequences of rising temperatures That leaves China, the EU and Mexico as three countries or regions that are set to meet their promises or nationally determined contributions (NDCs), as they are called, with their current policies. Without serious upgrades to most countries' plans, the UN says the 1.5C target will be missed by a significant amount. ""We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020, then stronger NDCs to kick-start the major transformations of economies and societies,"" says Inger Anderson. ""We need to catch up on the years in which we procrastinated,"" she added. ""If we don't do this, the 1.5C goal will be out of reach before 2030."" The report outlines some specific actions for different countries in the G20. There will have to be a huge increase in spending on renewable energy So for Argentina it's recommended that they work harder to shift the public towards widespread use of public transport in big cities. China is urged to ban all new coal-fired power plants, something that recent research casts doubt on. The biggest focus of action is the energy system. To get a sense of the massive scale of change that is needed, the study says the world will have to spend up to $3.8 trillion per year, every year between 2020 and 2050 to achieve the 1.5C target. The impression that time is running short is reinforced by the report - and UN negotiators gearing up to meet in Madrid next week at COP25 are feeling the pressure to increase their ambitions on carbon. ""This is a new and stark reminder by the Unep that we cannot delay climate action any longer,"" said Teresa Ribera, Spain's minister for the ecological transition. ""We need it at every level, by every national and subnational government, and by the rest of the economic and civil society actors. We urgently need to align with the Paris Agreement objectives and elevate climate ambition. ""It would be incomprehensible if countries who are committed to the United Nations system and multilateralism did not acknowledge that part of this commitment requires further climate action. Otherwise, there will only be more suffering, pain, and injustice."" Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"The jewellery was part of a ten-set collection featuring diamonds, sapphires, rubies and emeralds Diamond-encrusted swords and intricately designed brooches stolen from a former royal palace in Germany may never be seen again, experts warn. The items, part of a collection created in 1723 by Saxony's ruler, Augustus the Strong, are so recognisable that thieves are likely to break them up. Artworks taken from the Dresden Green Vault are described as ""priceless"". The head of Dresden state museums, Marion Ackermann, said destroying the artworks would be a ""terrible idea"". ""We are talking here about items of inestimable art-historical and cultural-historical value,"" she said. ""We cannot put an exact value on them because they are priceless."" Police have released a series of photos of the stolen jewels and appealed for witnesses. A sword encrusted with several large diamonds and dozens of smaller ones was taken The thieves broke into the vault, known in German as Dresden'sGrÃ¼nes GewÃ¶lbe, at dawn on Monday after a fire at the building's power distributor appears to have turned off the alarm system. An inspection of the museum afterwards revealed that a number of items within the three diamond jewellery sets reported stolen were still in place. Seven other sets that make up the collection were left untouched. Thieves had managed to gain access to a display case that contained about 100 objects, police said. Authorities have not put an official value on the items stolen Ms Ackermann told reporters she was ""shocked by the brutality of the break-in"", adding that criminals would have escaped with more jewellery had objects not been so well secured within their cases. Many of the objects contained diamonds from the 17th Century Saxony's art minister, Eva Maria, said the stolen items were ""to a certain extent the crown jewels of the Saxon kings"" and that ""they belong to Saxony"". A brooch displaying the Polish Order of the White Eagle was taken Art Recovery International, which describes itself as ""a behind the scenes force"" in the world of art, said museums like the Green Vault were ""under siege by barbarian criminal gangs who melt down gold and carve out precious stones with no regard to the importance of cultural heritage"". The founder of the company, Christopher Marinello, told the BBC that the robbery in Dresden was ""a theft of epic proportions"". The ""Great Breast Loop"" that belonged to 19th Century Queen of Saxony Amalie Auguste Popular German daily Bild saidthe thieves had grabbed jewels,externalworth â¬1bn (Â£855m). ""This is a major collection of jewels and intact designs containing gold, diamonds, precious gems and rubies,"" Mr Marinello said. ""I knew exactly what was going to happen once I heard what was taken - that we were not going to see these items remain intact."" A large diamond-encrusted breast bow Details of the robbery are still under investigation and the full value of the missing items has not yet been reported. The thieves - still on the run - removed part of an iron grille on a ground-floor window, then smashed the glass to gain access to the building. The area outside the Residenzschloss palace, which houses the Green Vault, has been cordoned off At about 05:00 (04:00 GMT) on Monday, firefighters were called to tackle a blaze in a nearby electricity junction box. Police believe the fire disabled the museum's alarm system. It put out some of the street lights. This video can not be played Security camera footage showed figures with torches and tools smashing one of the cabinets Police are examining CCTV footage which shows two suspects in the dark. But more people may have been involved in the robbery. A car found burning in Dresden early on Monday may have been the getaway vehicle used by the burglars, police say. Giant gold coin trial opens in Berlin The museum had guards on duty at night, Ms Ackermann said. The collection is housed in eight ornate rooms in the Residenzschloss - a former royal palace. Three rooms were destroyed by Allied bombing in World War Two, but after the war the museum was restored to its previous glory. It is called the Green Vault because some rooms were decorated with malachite-green paint. German Chancellor Angela Merkel visits the Gruenes Gewoelbe (Green Vault) museum in 2006 The most valuable items are in the palace's historic section on the ground floor. There are about 3,000 items of jewellery and other treasures decorated with gold, silver, ivory and pearl. They include a figure of a moor studded with emeralds and a 648-carat sapphire - a royal gift from Russia's Tsar Peter the Great. One of the most valuable jewels is a 41-carat green diamond currently on show in New York. The collection was founded by Augustus the Strong. He was Elector of Saxony - a German prince entitled to take part in the election of the emperor - and later king of Poland. Police at scene of Green Vault theft.

"Ms Aziz said she wanted to raise awareness about China's detainment of ""innocent Muslims"" A US teenager's TikTok video clip accusing China of putting Muslims into ""concentration camps"" has gone viral on the Chinese-owned social network. The post appears to be about beauty tips at its start - but the young woman then changes tack to ask her viewers to raise awareness of what she describes as a ""another Holocaust"". Feroza Aziz later tweeted that TikTok had blocked her from posting new content, as a result. TikTok has disputed this. ""TikTok does not moderate content due to political sensitivities,"" a spokesman told BBC News. Although, Douyin, the Chinese version of the app, on which Ms Aziz's posts would not have appeared, is politically censored. The company had permanently banned one of Ms Aziz's old TikTok accounts on, 15 November, for posting anunrelated video that had broken its rules on terrorism-related material,external, he said. As an additional measure, it had then blocked her smartphone, on 25 November, but that too had been unrelated to her posts about China. ""Her new account and its videos, including the eyelash video in question, were not affected and continue to receive views,"" the spokesman added. BBC News has contacted Ms Aziz and her family for comment. For its part, the Chinese government hasconsistently said the camps in question offer voluntary education and training, despite evidence to the contrary. Ms Aziz posted three videos about China's treatment of the Uighur Muslims, between Sunday and Monday. The first has been watched more than 1.4 million times and ""liked"" nearly 500,000 times on the app. A copy uploaded to Twitter by other TikTok usershas attracted,externalafurther five million views,external.

And further copies have been posted to YouTube and Instagram. Part of the videos' appeal is they are presented as a deliberate attempt to circumvent supposed censorship by TikTok's Beijing-based owner, Bytedance. Ms Aziz bookends her critical comments with talk about to make eyelashes look longer. ""I say that so TikTok doesn't take down my videos,"" she explains in one of the recordings. This video can not be played ""An electric baton to the back of the head"" - a former inmate described conditions at a secret camp to the BBC While the version of TikTok used in mainland China does censor criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, the company says it does not take the same action against posts to the separate library of user-generated content it offers elsewhere. And it notes other clips about themistreatment of Uighurs within Chinese camps,externalhave been allowed to remain on its international platform, although they do not tend to get anywhere close to the amount of attention Ms Aziz has generated. Should we be worried about TikTok? TikTok and Apple decline to testify over China TikTok hits back over China influence claims The 17-year-old's videos were posted the same weekBBC Panorama revealed how leaked documentsdetailed some of the measures used to brainwash hundreds of thousands of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang. They undermine China's claims attendance at the camps is voluntary and designed to counter extremism. China's UK ambassador has dismissed the documents as ""fake news"". This video can not be played Chinaâs UK ambassador: ""This is a pure fabrication"" Ms Aziz provides her own list of abuses. ""Spreading awareness does wonders,"" she says. ""We can reach millions across the world [and] reach those with the power to do something about it."" The BBC has also confirmed that Ms Aziz is in control of a Twitter account created earlier this month. She has tweeted that TikTok has given hera one-month suspension,externaland said that""China is terrified of the news [about the camps] spreading"",external. Others have picked up on her posts, including a member of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank, who called Ms Aziz's use of TikTok ""creatively subversive"". Any apps that operate within mainland China need to be approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Social networks recognise they are not allowed to operate unless they comply with local guidelines - and that means ensuring any content on their platform paints the government in a positive light. TikTok, known locally as Douyin, is heavily filtered. For example, in April 2018, it censored all mentions of British cartoon character Peppa Pig, concerned she was being used as a symbol of rebellion. But the Chinese government is not concerned about, and has less control over, filtering content on the version offered overseas. And in October this year, TikTok denied it screened anti-China content on its international app, saying all its US user data was stored in the United States, with a back-up in Singapore.

Many of the objects contained diamonds from the 17th Century Saxony's art minister, Eva Maria, said the stolen items were ""to a certain extent the crown jewels of the Saxon kings"" and that ""they belong to Saxony"". A brooch displaying the Polish Order of the White Eagle was taken Art Recovery International, which describes itself as ""a behind the scenes force"" in the world of art, said museums like the Green Vault were ""under siege by barbarian criminal gangs who melt down gold and carve out precious stones with no regard to the importance of cultural heritage"". The founder of the company, Christopher Marinello, told the BBC that the robbery in Dresden was ""a theft of epic proportions"". The ""Great Breast Loop"" that belonged to 19th Century Queen of Saxony Amalie Auguste Popular German daily Bild saidthe thieves had grabbed jewels,externalworth â¬1bn (Â£855m). ""This is a major collection of jewels and intact designs containing gold, diamonds, precious gems and rubies,"" Mr Marinello said. ""I knew exactly what was going to happen once I heard what was taken - that we were not going to see these items remain intact."" A large diamond-encrusted breast bow Details of the robbery are still under investigation and the full value of the missing items has not yet been reported. The thieves - still on the run - removed part of an iron grille on a ground-floor window, then smashed the glass to gain access to the building. The area outside the Residenzschloss palace, which houses the Green Vault, has been cordoned off At about 05:00 (04:00 GMT) on Monday, firefighters were called to tackle a blaze in a nearby electricity junction box. Police believe the fire disabled the museum's alarm system. It put out some of the street lights. This video can not be played Security camera footage showed figures with torches and tools smashing one of the cabinets Police are examining CCTV footage which shows two suspects in the dark. But more people may have been involved in the robbery. A car found burning in Dresden early on Monday may have been the getaway vehicle used by the burglars, police say. Giant gold coin trial opens in Berlin The museum had guards on duty at night, Ms Ackermann said. The collection is housed in eight ornate rooms in the Residenzschloss - a former royal palace. Three rooms were destroyed by Allied bombing in World War Two, but after the war the museum was restored to its previous glory. It is called the Green Vault because some rooms were decorated with malachite-green paint. German Chancellor Angela Merkel visits the Gruenes Gewoelbe (Green Vault) museum in 2006 The most valuable items are in the palace's historic section on the ground floor. There are about 3,000 items of jewellery and other treasures decorated with gold, silver, ivory and pearl. They include a figure of a moor studded with emeralds and a 648-carat sapphire - a royal gift from Russia's Tsar Peter the Great. One of the most valuable jewels is a 41-carat green diamond currently on show in New York. The collection was founded by Augustus the Strong. He was Elector of Saxony - a German prince entitled to take part in the election of the emperor - and later king of Poland. Police at scene of Green Vault theft.

" Election battleground: Pembrokeshire By Jon Kelly  By Jon Kelly Clare Johns strides into the field, yellow feed bucket swinging at her side, and the sheep quickly surround her like a litter of giant puppies. She has 40 of them in total, a mixture of Ryland and Shetland breeds, and Clare’s tweed coat is woven from their wool. Its colours were inspired by the Preseli Hills, the imposing range that gives its name to one of Wales’s tightest marginal seats. Growing up in a council house, Clare had two ambitions - to be a fashion designer and to own a horse. Back then, these seemed like impossible fantasies. “We didn’t have much,” says Clare, now 35. Her mum worked as a cleaner, a lollipop lady and in the staff kitchen at the local Tesco supermarket, on top of bringing up five children on her own. They lived in Pennar, a suburb of Pembroke Dock - now in the Carmarthen West & South Pembrokeshire constituency, held by the Conservatives by just over 3,000 votes in 2017. Across the Milford Haven waterway, you could see what is now the southernmost tip of the Preseli Pembrokeshire seat, last claimed by the Tories with a wafer-thin majority of 317 over Labour. There wasn’t much to do in Pennar, Clare recalls. “It’s rows and rows of housing, there’s no shops.” But there were always plenty of chores to keep her occupied. The children had to light the fire, clean up, help keep the household running. It was tough but it instilled in Clare and her siblings a fierce work ethic. Clare would watch her grandmother make clothes for the entire family on an old Singer sewing machine. It inspired Clare to do what she could with spare materials too. She didn’t enjoy school much, but a fashion textiles course at the local college changed everything. She loved being surrounded by creative people. Her tutor suggested she go to London to study for a fashion degree, but she couldn’t bring herself to do it. “As much as I love going to London, it was just too much of a jump for me,” she says. “I just felt I wasn’t confident enough to do that.” Instead she took her fashion degree at the University of South Wales in Newport. By the time she graduated she was pregnant, and she married her husband, Owain, a few months later. It was a budget ceremony - Clare made her own wedding dress as well as dresses for her mum and the bridesmaids. Then Clare’s husband was offered a job at a farm attached to a school in Pembroke, teaching vocational skills to children with behavioural and learning difficulties. Clare ended up teaching there too, and helping to run the farm. She was learning agricultural skills for herself - and there was the horse she’d always dreamed of. But she was also seeing a very different side of Pembrokeshire from the one on display to the four million tourists who pour in to the county each year. Many of the teenagers the school was looking after came from deeply troubled backgrounds. Clare recalls comforting one 15-year-old boy who was crying his eyes out “because he needed his fix”.  His parents were addicts too.   Other pupils relied on handouts for food and clothing. Some had been lured into working for drug dealers at the age of 12. It was against this grim backdrop that Clare took the surprising decision to launch her own luxury woollen collection. She’d kept up her garment-making skills - working as a seamstress, doing basic repairs, making the odd bridesmaid’s dress, selling her own designs at markets. She’d tried to start her own bridalwear company “but I didn’t enjoy it - bridezillas and everything”. Then she met a weaver who suggested working with tweed. She ordered 50m and made up a small collection of her own designs - jackets, skirts, blankets. She had some angora goats on the farm so there were sweaters, too. Clare set up a website to sell her range and offered items on a sale-or-return basis to local shops. It was quickly a success. Soon there was enough demand to start a shop in nearby Narberth with her mum and sister, and for Clare and her husband to start raising their own sheep on 12 acres of rented land. The reality TV show Made In Chelsea ordered 50 of her jackets for its cast. The Duchess of Cornwall had one, too. And then in 2016 the EU referendum was held. Clare voted Remain - she worried about what would happen if all the European funds currently being spent in Wales were taken away. She was angry when the result came through - both constituencies that cover Pembrokeshire voted to Leave by 55% to 45%. Wales as a whole voted for Leave by 52.5%. Clare noticed a sudden drop in trade, which she attributes to consumers’ uncertainty about the future. “Footfall was dramatically down,” she says. “And the footfall that was coming in - they weren’t spending.” The cost of fabrics, fusing, lining, trims, pattern grading - all of it went up. She had to close the shop. Without having to rent a retail unit, her business has recovered. But Clare thinks it took an unnecessary hit. She worries that Brexit will take years to resolve, and that will in turn mean years of further uncertainty - and in the meantime, no-one will tackle the deep-rooted rural poverty and deprivation that she saw at the school. “Because we’re in a smaller town, we get forgotten about,” she says. “Out of sight, out of mind.”  As a child, Mike Smith never thought he’d be a farmer. Even though his father and grandfather had farmed land near Haverfordwest since 1939, he’d intended to take a different path. As a teenager he planned to be an architect. And then, when it was time to apply to university, he started to have second thoughts. Why train for a job for seven years, only to possibly wind up unemployed at the end of it? Whereas if he worked for himself, he could do whatever he wanted. So he went off to study agriculture instead, returning to the farm in 1996 and taking it over, with his brother, a decade ago. They have 650 acres and milk 450 cows, but it’s been a difficult era for anyone trying to make a living out of agriculture. “Pretty much for the whole time I’ve been home it’s been tough, really,” he says. First there was BSE, then movement restrictions following the foot-and-mouth outbreak. Then in 2014 Vladimir Putin banned EU dairy products from Russia in retaliation for Western sanctions. This saw the price Mike could charge for milk drop from 30p per litre to less than 15p, taking £400,000 out of his annual turnover. It can be a lonely business, too. While there’s a strong community of farmers, it saddens Mike how many of his old school friends have left the area - many hope to come back to retire, but he says there’s a noticeable absence of people from his generation, in their 30s to their 50s. “If you ask most of my contemporaries, if they had a choice they’d stay here, they wouldn’t have moved,” he says. “It’s a shame because you’re losing your brightest people, who should be staying and starting their own businesses and generating income within the county.” In the 2016 referendum on EU membership, Mike voted Leave. He didn’t feel particularly fervent about it back then, but he took the view that there were opportunities as well as threats. Welsh dairy was a premium product, he reasoned, so people around the world would want to buy it - and anyway the EU hadn’t been much help when BSE had struck or Putin imposed his ban. In the aftermath of the vote he was shocked by how rancorous the debate became. “It has split opinions between friends and family,” he says. “I see social media and look at some of my school friends’ comments - we went through the same education, how can we think so differently?” Some told him he was stupid to have voted Leave, given the payments from Brussels that farmers receive. Mike doesn’t see it that way. “To be honest the subsidies from Europe I see more as a big stick that they use to beat us with,” he says. “It’s just the next set of hoops that the government want us to jump through for less and less money.” Over the last three years Mike’s opinion about Brexit has hardened, principally because of the manner in which Parliament has conducted itself. “I think it’s a disgrace the way it’s been handled,” he says. He suspects there’s been an effort by Remainer MPs to drag things out as long as possible so that everyone gets sick of it. He’d rather Brexit was over and done with so that the government could get on with the things he says really matter, like the NHS and jobs. But there’s a point of consensus with Clare. Like her, Mike says the county’s remoteness allows it to be ignored by those in power. “I’d say Pembrokeshire is so far out on a limb I think it just gets forgotten about, full stop.” At the foot of the Preseli hills is a small village called Maenclochog. It has a post office, a church, a general store, and two garages. There’s an art gallery and a school where lessons are taught in Welsh - if you visit the cafe or the pub, it’s likely you’ll hear the language spoken there too. And everyone will know who you’re talking about if you ask after Meg Cakes. That’s the nickname Megan Davies is known by. Megan is 25 and runs her own cake-baking business from her kitchen, in the village where she’s lived most of her life. “I can’t imagine my life anywhere else than here,” she says. “If I go down the shop, my auntie works there - I definitely will see someone I know. I think that’s what I missed when I lived in Cardiff.” After school, Megan moved to the Welsh capital to study graphic design. She’d visited before, but the scale and size of the place meant being there full-time was quite a radical change for her. She made lots of friends and it was a novelty being able to pop across the road to the shops, instead of driving for 20 minutes to the nearest town. But when she was on her way home at night from anywhere in Cardiff she’d ring her mum and dad, because it made her feel safer. Although she liked it there, ultimately the course wasn’t right for her. After two years she dropped out and moved back to live with her parents in Maenclochog. She didn’t have much to do there at first apart from go on Facebook and upload pictures of cupcakes she’d baked. A friend asked her to make a cake for her boyfriend; he was a builder, so Megan baked one with a little fondant icing construction worker on top, next to a pile of fondant icing bricks. It was fairly rudimentary by her later standards, but Megan was pleased with it. She posted a photo online, and more and more people started asking her to bake a cake for them, too - wedding cakes, birthday cakes, cakes with Disney heroines on top of them, or the logos of football teams, or Elvis. Word of mouth helped her build her business in a way that would never have been possible in a less tightly knitted environment - if you needed something baked for a special occasion, you’d ask around and someone would tell you about Meg Cakes. But social media - Instagram and Facebook in particular - was a peculiarly modern and effective way of promoting a rural business. When Megan posts a photo, 100 people might see it within 10 minutes. “You’re not going to have 100 people passing your shopfront in a place like this,” she says. Much as she loves Maenclochog, she knows it has its downsides. There’s only one bus service, to Haverfordwest. “Just one. That’s it,” she says. “I think it’s gone for five hours and then you’ve got to come back.” Friends who grew up in the village can find jobs readily enough if they train as a teacher or a nurse. But Megan’s older sister, who has a degree in fine art, had to move to Bristol in search of employment. She’d like to return one day. Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire Bishop Auckland Southampton Norwich  Support for the Welsh language is important to Megan, too. “I know this is going to sound silly now, but until I went to university, I never really realised that I spoke two languages,” she says. She’d absorbed both as a child and it always felt natural to switch between the two. She’d like her own children to speak the language, but she worries it’s dying out. For a while she worked in a pub a few miles away called the Tafarn Sinc, where Welsh is spoken at the bar. The community rallied round to save it when it was at risk of closure, and she appreciates living in a place where people make an effort, however small, to keep Welsh alive. “It’s good when you go places, even if it’s just ‘Welcome andcroeso’ - it’s something, isn’t it?” Community spirit notwithstanding, Megan steers away from talking about Brexit around the village. “I think around here people had made their mind up and they were totally for Leave or Remain,” she says. “You don’t want to ask people because you don’t want a lecture about it.” In 2016 she made sure to read up on the arguments for and against but ultimately didn’t feel well informed enough to adopt a strong set of opinions on the subject. “I know that might sound really bad but I didn’t know what to do,” she says. “So I just thought: ‘My life’s fine now, I’ll vote Remain.’” For now, her business hasn’t been affected by the Brexit vote, though she says some have. Through her work around weddings, she heard of a florist's that can’t take advance bookings because it can’t rely on the price of imported flowers staying the same in the event of a no-deal exit from the EU. For Megan the bigger issue is the uncertainty, not the relentless verbal war of attrition. She finds herself wondering what would happen if Brexit were somehow resolved, one way or the other. “What would they talk about on the news? It’s just everywhere - Brexit, Brexit, Brexit. The word’s getting on my nerves.” It’s a cold winter day and David Annis is looking ruefully at his market stall. Sales have plummeted since the end of the tourist season. “We’re struggling to get people to come because now that the visitors have gone it’s only locals who are left,” he says. And the locals aren’t buying. On Fridays, David, 69, sets up for business in Haverfordwest; on Saturdays, he’s in Fishguard, the coastal town at the northern end of Pembrokeshire, close to his home. Half of his stall is given over to handmade wooden crafts, glasswear, textiles. The other half is baked goods made by his wife - cakes, pies, fancies and so on. “Most of Fishguard’s regulars are older people at this time of year and if you have a day like today they’re not going to come out in this wind,” he says. “So it’s a struggle, really.” In the summer it’s a different story. Fishguard is linked by ferry with Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland. One day earlier this year, when a cruise ship disembarked, local people formed a welcoming committee, with stalls and music. While Clare, Mike and Megan were all born in Pembrokeshire, David made it his home. He’d been living in Essex and working in London, but an epileptic fit while he was driving 35 years ago put an end to his career. Charity work and the market stall have kept him occupied ever since. In 2016, David voted Leave. To him, the EU represented bureaucracy and snouts in the trough – unelected people “telling us what to do and filling their pockets”. Like Mike, he’s annoyed that Parliament has failed to carry out the instructions given by the electorate during the referendum. His family hosts African students who come to Wales to learn about agriculture, and it embarrasses him when these young people see British MPs acting like “a nursery class”, shouting at each other rather than getting on with the job. But since the prime minister returned with his latest Brexit deal - which effectively creates a customs border between Great Britain and the island of Ireland - David has started to worry what it will mean for Fishguard. The area enjoys strong cultural links with the Irish Republic. Each year, he takes his market stall to the Wexford Food Festival. He doesn’t make much money but it’s good PR for Pembrokeshire. “I am now more worried about it - about going out,” he says. “One of our few remaining industries is that ferry. Are the things we get from there going to be more expensive? Is it going to be harder to export things to there because of charges they’ll make for imports? We don’t know.” It doesn’t look to him like the government has handled the entire process well. There doesn’t seem to him to be anyone at the top with the wherewithal to make a go of it. But he’s still sure Brexit needs to happen. “The main thing is, the majority voted to leave the EU in 2016,” he says. “It’s now 2019 and we thought democracy was the rule of the majority. If they don’t listen to the majority then so many people are going to say: ‘Why bother voting?’” Outside, despite the bad weather, the ferry is leaving Fishguard for Rosslare on schedule. The wind howls around it, and the seas are choppy, but the vessel keeps inching ahead, upright, towards its destination.

"Harry Dunn's father Tim Dunn was left outside the hustings Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was called a ""coward"" by the friends and family of Harry Dunn as they were left outside constituency hustings. Mr Dunn, 19, died in a crash in Northamptonshire in August that led to the suspect leaving the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. His family had hoped to put pressure on Mr Raab at the event in Surrey. Mr Raab said he felt a ""constructive conversation"" would not have been possible due to crowds there. A member of staff at the church where the hustings were held said they were kept outside due to fire safety. Mr Dunn's parents havebegun legal actionagainst the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), alleging the granting of immunity by Mr Raab was ""wrong in law"". But the FCO has said it will ""seek costs"" for any judicial review brought and argue the family has not found ""any reasonably arguable ground of legal challenge"". It said an allegation that the foreign secretary had ""misused and/or abused his power"" was""entirely without foundation"". Dominic Raab (second from left) attended the event at East Molesey Methodist Church Signs calling for Harry's family and friends to be allowed to enter were held up against the East Molesey Methodist Church door, which was monitored by staff. There were chants of ""let us in"" from more than 50 people who were left outside on Monday night. As Mr Raab left the church in an official car, a crowd booed and branded him a ""coward"".

He reiterated his sympathy for the Dunn family and said he would ""like to see justice done"" but that he had ""no control over the case"". Harry's father Tim Dunn said he had hoped to call on voters to back another candidate to unseat Mr Raab at the Esher and Walton constituency hustings. Asked why he thought the foreign secretary did not speak to him, Mr Dunn said: ""I think he doesn't want to give me the answers I need. ""There's things going on, we're not quiet about it, we think the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) and the FCO are talking and delaying tactics."" Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Mr Dunn was fatally injured on 27 August, when his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Anne Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton, where her husband Jonathan was an intelligence officer.

"The traditional Christmas dinner is likely to make a bigger dent in your wallet this year, because supply issues have pushed up prices. Fewer turkeys have been hatched this year after high summer temperatures reduced the number of eggs, according to business consultancy CGA. Meanwhile, wet weather and floods have hit supplies of vegetables such as Brussels sprouts and potatoes. It said the risk was supermarkets could pass on the higher costs to consumers. ""Problems with production this year have accelerated inflation in the turkey market in particular,"" CGA said Most common Christmas delivery problems revealed Do Christmas adverts really work? Recipe: Budget Christmas dinner It said some former turkey producers had got out of the business altogether, preferring to rear chickens instead. ""From a turkey perspective, the vast majority of sales take place over Christmas, which has caused producers to move to a more profitable alternative in chicken,"" said Fiona Speakman, CGA's client director for food and retail. ""This has been compounded by bad weather impacting egg yield, meaning that turkeys are at a premium,"" she told the BBC. Prices of Brussels sprouts are also rising Christmas ham is expected to be more expensive as well, because large numbers of pigs have been culled in an effort to halt the global spread of African Swine Fever. ""The pressure on supply means whole-pig prices rose by more than 10% between March and October,"" CGA said. CGA, in association with procurement firm Prestige Purchasing, monitors wholesale food prices by compiling a monthly Foodservice Price Index. It says it has seen a ""relentless"" rise in food and drink inflation over the past three years. In the past 12 months alone, it says food and drink prices have gone up by 6.77% - more than four times the official Consumer Prices Index inflation rate of 1.5%, as measured by the Office for National Statistics. The difference suggests operators and retailers have largely absorbed the higher costs. Prestige Purchasing's chief executive, Shaun Allen, said the price rises for turkey and ham could lead to a surge in demand for other meats at Christmas, such as beef. He added: ""The increasing costs on a number of traditional Christmas dinner items will be extremely unwelcome and will put pressure on margins for both operators and retailers in order to keep the costs down for customers over the festive period."" Separate research by CGA indicates that more people are eating out during the Christmas period, with 70% of consumers visiting a restaurant over December. ""Set menus and Christmas promotions often add further value to meals,"" said Ms Speakman, ""not to mention the time saved on shopping, cooking and all that washing-up.""

"De La Rue, the company that prints the UK's banknotes, has said there is a risk that the firm will collapse if its turnaround plan fails to work. The announcement came as it suspended its dividend and reported a loss in the first half of its financial year. De La Rue said,externalits warning was based on a worst-case scenario. However, it concluded that there was ""a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt on the group's ability to operate as a going concern"". UK-based De La Rue prints cash for about 140 central banks and employs more than 2,500 people globally. All current Bank of England banknotes are printed by the firm at a site in Debden, Essex. It is unclear what would happen if the firm got into difficulties, but it is likely that a rival would take over its Bank of England contract. Its main competitors are all based outside the UK. The BBC understands that preparations have already been made for the launch of the new Â£20 note featuring artist JMW Turner, printed by De La Rue, which enters circulation on 20 February next year. Shares in De la Rue fell 20% on Tuesday morning. De La Rue has faced some big setbacks in the past two years, includingthe loss of the post-Brexit UK passport printing contractto a Franco-Dutch firm last year. In May last year, it had to write off Â£18m after Venezuela's central bank failed to pay its bills. The company is also under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with ""suspected corruption"" in South Sudan. It appointed a new chief executive, Clive Vacher, in October as part of a management shake-up. Around 11% of the 171 billion banknotes issued globally in 2017 were printed by a handful of commercial printers. De La Rue is now the largest of these firms. It began producing banknotes in 1860, first for Mauritius and then elsewhere. Today it produces enough notes each week that if stacked up would reach the peak of Everest twice. Its main competitor, German company Giesecke & Devrient, produces notes for roughly 100 central banks, while the Canadian Banknote Company and US-founded Crane Currency are also major players. Read more De La Rue reported a Â£12.1m pre-tax loss for the six months to 28 September, compared with a Â£7.1m profit in the same period last year. In its results statement, the company said it was accelerating its restructuring plan, including a reduction in overhead costs. It is also planning new banknote security feature products to bolster its position in the ""increasingly competitive"" banknote market. ""De La Rue is teetering on the brink,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. ""Bad management and decisions seems to be the main reason for the malaise."" Investors sometimes wonder whether a company's board of directors can, in the short term, have much sway over a company's trading. The scepticism is warranted: boards normally comprise a small number of executives and a larger number of non-executive directors, who have no involvement with day-to-day operations, and there are plenty of examples of companies going off the rails without the board suspecting anything was wrong. Today's results from De La Rue show, however, that boards are vital. The banknote and secure-printing company turned in a disastrous set of numbers - a Â£10m operating loss, a string of one-off charges and mounting debt - which it blamed on falling demand and too many companies chasing too few contracts. But it also admits that a period of unprecedented turmoil at the top has not helped, with the chairman, chief executive, finance director and most of the other directors changing in short order. ""The board believes that significant changes in the board and executive teams, along with a restructuring of the business, has contributed to the poor performance of the business in the period,"" the results statement says. ""This has contributed to a larger variance between forecasts and performance than has been experienced historically."" Management matters, and will matter even more in the next few months. The directors warn that if the revival plan put in place by (newish) chief executive Clive Vacher does not yield results, there is a threat to the company being able to continue as a going concern. In plain English, that means it will have to find more money, either by renegotiating the terms of its bank loans or by asking shareholders to stump up more cash.

"Aslan King went missing early on Saturday after suffering a suspected seizure Missing British man Aslan King has been found dead three days after he disappeared while camping, Australian police have confirmed. Mr King, 25, had been away with friends in a popular tourist region in Victoria when he was last seen on Saturday. His body was found about a kilometre (0.6 miles) away in a creek. Victoria Police said the cause of his death was under investigation. An illustrator from Brighton, Mr King relocated to Australia two weeks ago. His body was identified by two of his travelling partners, who were close friends, Victoria Police Sgt Danny Brown said. Authorities saidMr King had been with four friends when he hit his headon the ground about 02:00 local time on Saturday (15:00 GMT Friday) and suffered a suspected seizure. He then suddenly ran into surrounding bushland and may have been disoriented, police said. Search crews had scoured the coastal area near Princetown - not far from the Twelve Apostles tourist site - since Sunday. Officers searched for Mr King using a helicopter, horses, boats, motorcycles and sniffer dogs Police said Mr King's behaviour on Saturday had appeared to be out of character. ""This is why it made it so hard for us [to search] because there was no intelligence to suggest why he left or where he went,"" Sgt Danny Brown said on Tuesday, according toa report by the Herald Sun,external. ""His behaviour took everyone by surprise. By all accounts he was very fit, physically and mentally."" Officers said the search was difficult because of the thick vegetation, rocky clifftops and deep coastal waters in the region. Sgt Brown said Mr King's friends would be offered counselling. ""They have suffered a trauma as well by losing their friend in the beginning and the worry that goes with that,"" he said. ""And now to have two friends formally identify one of their own, one of their good close friends, and they have been friends for a lot of years, is traumatic on its own."" Neil Trotter, mayor of Corangamite Shire, said: ""We are deeply saddened by the death of Aslan. We feel for his family and friends."" He said his friends were ""understandably traumatised"", and that be believes Mr King's mother is en route to Australia. ""We feel for her having to do what no parent would ever wish to do,"" he added. The Foreign Office said it was in close contact with Australian police and was supporting Mr King's family. ""Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time,"" a spokeswoman said. Police said they would prepare a report for the coroner.

"This video can not be played Do you know when you're being manipulated? Black Friday sales offer few real deals with most goods cheaper or available for the same price at other times, according to consumer group Which?. It found that just four of 83 products they studied last year were cheaper during the Black Friday promotion. Among products cheaper outside of Black Friday were a tumble dryer, smart speaker, coffee maker and TV soundbar. Which? home products and services chief Natalie Hitchins said shoppers should do research and never impulse buy, The consumer group tracked the products on Black Friday last year - 23 November. The items, from retailers including Currys PC World, Amazon, and John Lewis, were monitored six months before the date and six months after. Just four products were cheaper on Black Friday than at other times of the year. Six in 10 items were cheaper or the same price on at least one day in the six months prior to last year's Black Friday event. When looking at the two-week period surrounding Black Friday itself - including sale prices in the week before and after - it was found that three quarters of products were cheaper or the same price in the six months after. Promotions included: A Samsung soundbar that Currys PC World offered at Â£299 on Black Friday, but which within a month dropped by Â£49 for at least five days A De'Longhi coffee machine priced at Â£399 by John Lewis on Black Friday. It was cheaper on at least 64 days in the six months after An Amazon Echo on offer at Â£54.99 on Amazon, but was cheaper on at least 13 occasions before Black Friday An Indesit tumble dryer from Currys PC World was Â£20 cheaper than its sale price of Â£199 just two weeks before Black Friday. While Which? did not find evidence that any of the retailers were breaking the law, the consumer group said it showed that so-called deals may not be all they are claimed. Ms Hitchins said: ""We have repeatedly shown that deals touted by retailers on Black Friday are not as good as they seem. Time-limited sales can be a good opportunity to bag a bargain, but don't fall for the pressure tactics around Black Friday. ""Our investigation indicates that this popular shopping event is all hype and there are few genuine discounts,"" she said. The shops can get very busy Retailers rejected suggestions consumers were being misled and said that shoppers were getting some of the best deals of the year. Amazon said: """"The claim from Which? with regard to Echo is false and we have made this clear in our response to them. Amazon.co.uk customers were not able to buy the Echo (2nd gen) device cheaper before Black Friday 2018."" It added that its Black Friday sale was about ""thousands of deals on a huge selection of products from every category across the site, at a time of year when we know saving money is important to our customers"". Currys PC World told Which?: ""Our customers tell us that they appreciate the increased choice during Black Friday where we have the most deals on at once. When we launched our Black Friday event last year, 40% of those products were the lowest price they had ever been."" And John Lewis said: ""In addition to the variety of offers we have in-store and online during the Black Friday period, our commitment to being 'Never Knowingly Undersold' means that we continuously monitor and match the prices of our high street competitors throughout the year."" Which?'s advice for consumers during this year's sales bonanza is: Don't impulse buy. Work out what you need or want to buy and how much you're prepared to spend before you start shopping in the sales Don't panic. Don't worry about missing out on a good offer as Which? research has revealed that you could be better off waiting until after Black Friday anyway Find out about offers in advance. Sign up to your favourite retailers' newsletters for inside tips, or check their social media pages ahead of the sales for any clues    or hints to what will be on offer Look at the price on previous days, using websites such as PriceRunner, to make sure you really are getting a good deal Don't always trust reviews you find online as a recent Which? investigation found shoppers risk being misled by fake online product reviews.

"A Tiger helicopter (file image) Thirteen French soldiers have been killed in a helicopter collision during an operation against jihadists in Mali, the French president's office says. President Emmanuel Macron expressed ""deep sadness"" over the biggest single loss of life for the French military since the 1980s. An investigation has begun into how the two helicopters hit each other. Thousands of French troops have been deployed in Mali since 2013 after militants overran parts of the north. Why France is focused on fighting jihadists in Mali Why the Sahara is terror's new front line Mali - the world's most dangerous peacekeeping mission Mali country profile Mali's army has since recaptured the territory but insecurity continues and the violence has spread to neighbouring countries. France now has 4,500 troops deployed to support the forces of Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad against the jihadists. French Defence Minister Florence Parly vowed that her country would not turn its back on the fight against terrorism after the deadly collision. ""We fight alongside our partners and brothers-in-arms from Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso to together give these countries the peace and stability to which their people aspire,"" she said. It happened in darkness around 19:40 local time (also GMT) on Monday near the borders of Burkina Faso and Niger where the aircraft were reinforcing ground troops who were pursuing militants, the French military says. A French Cougar helicopter (file image) A Tiger attack helicopter hit a Cougar military transport mid-air as it manoeuvred to engage the militants, who were fleeing on motorbikes and in pick-up trucks. The two aircraft crashed not far from each other, killing everyone on board including six commandos and an officer. Lt Pierre Bockel was killed in the incident Among the dead is the son of French Senator Jean-Marie Bockel, Pierre, who was a lieutenant. ""These 13 heroes had only one goal: to protect us,"" President Macron wrote in a tweet.,external""I bow my head to their loved ones and comrades."" A minute's silence was observed at the National Assembly in Paris. French MPs honoured the dead Condolences were sent to President Macron from his Malian counterpart Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and Burkina Faso's President Roch Marc Christian Kabore. ""The loss is heavy but the peoples of the Sahel share your bereavement,"" President Keita said. It is the heaviest toll in a single incident since 1986 when a French sea surveillance plane crashed into a mountain in northern Djibouti with the loss of 19 soldiers. In total, 41 French soldiers have been killed in Mali since the country first intervened. An officer, Brig Ronan Pointeau, was killed earlier this month after an explosive device detonated near his vehicle. The brunt of the violence though is faced by local forces and civilians. An attack on a northern military post this month left 53 Malian troops dead. Both the Islamic State (IS) group and a branch of al-Qaeda called Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) are active in the region. Under the name of its so-called West Africa Province, IS operates in Mali, Nigeria, Niger and Burkina Faso. This video can not be played What is behind Mali's massacres? It claimed major attacks on the Malian army this month as well as several small-scale attacks on French forces in Mali and Niger. JNIM, which operates mainly in Mali but also Burkina Faso, has claimed attacks on UN, French and Malian forces but singles out France as its main enemy. The helicopter accident that has killed 13 of its soldiers is more bad news for France from a combat mission already beset with questions over its efficacy and purpose. After initial successes in suppressing Islamist rebels in northern Mali in 2013, the French deployment was extended into a regional mandate under the operational name Barkhane. But recent months have seen a resurgence of groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda, with the focus of their activity shifting to the centre-east of Mali and the area bordering Niger and Burkina Faso. Writing recently in Le Monde, a former defence co-ordinator at the French foreign ministry warned Operation Barkhane was ""in an impasse"". ""On the ground the facts are plain. The rise in strength of the jihadists is a reality we can no longer deny. It is they who have the initiative,"" wrote Bruno ClÃ©ment-BollÃ©e.

"Don McGahn must testify in the impeachment inquiry, a judge has ruled A federal judge has ruled that White House staff can be made to testify before Congress, rejecting the Trump administration's claims of immunity. The ruling specifically compels former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify to an inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 US election. But it also has major implications for the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. The justice department says it will appeal against the ruling. The impeachment inquiry is trying to establish whether Mr Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. The Trump administration has refused to co-operate with the impeachment inquiry and other Democrat-led investigations, directing current and former White House officials to defy subpoenas for testimony and documents. Mr McGahn, who left his post in October 2018,was called to appear before the House Judiciary Committeein May to answer questions about the president's alleged attempts to impede the now-concluded Mueller investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election. But in her ruling, US District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said that ""no one is above the law"". This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? ""Executive branch officials are not absolutely immune from compulsory congressional process - no matter how many times the executive branch has asserted as much over the years - even if the president expressly directs such officials' noncompliance,"" she wrote. Fiona Hill: UK coal miner's daughter turned top US Russia expert Released records reveal Pompeo-Giuliani contacts Who's who in the Trump-Ukraine story? Judge Jackson also explicitly said the president ""does not have the power"" to stop his aides from responding to subpoenas from Congress - adding that ""presidents are not kings"". ""No one, not even the head of the Executive branch, is above the law,"" Judge Jackson said. But she did say that Mr McGahn could invoke executive privilege ""where appropriate"", to protect potentially sensitive information. Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said that he expects Mr McGahn to ""follow his legal obligations and promptly appear before the Committee"". By Jonathan Turley, law professor at George Washington University ""Presidents are not kings."" Those words from a 120-page decision  by US District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson are likely to be repeated like a mantra by Democrats in Congress.  With members seeking to impeach President Trump for obstructing their impeachment inquiry by blocking witnesses and discovery, the timing and language of the opinion could not have been better. Ms Jackson at times allowed the rhetoric to outpace the analysis in declaring, for example, that ""presidents are not kings"" and ""this means that they do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control. Rather, in this land of liberty, it is indisputable that current and former employees of the White House work for the people of the United States..."" I am not sure that seeking review on a claim of immunity is the same as a president declaring oneself king or former presidential aides effective vassals. However, while Republicans are attacking Jackson as a liberal Obama appointee, the ultimate holding is clearly correct.  I have written previously that the White House was wrong in claiming that it can block even the appearance of such witnesses - as opposed to allowing an appearance while instructing the witness not to answer certain questions on privileged matter. It is the difference between immunity and privilege. Nevertheless, I fail to see the good-faith basis for the extreme position stated by the White House - a criticism that I have had with a number of current cases moving through the courts.  These cases seem crafted with a greater interest in the ultimate delay rather than the decision in the litigation. That strategy however continues to pile up losses for the White House - precedent that will bind future presidents. Jonathan Turley is a legal analyst for the BBC. He testified as a constitutional expert during the Clinton impeachment. Monday's ruling could have an effect on who testifies during the current impeachment hearings in Congress. Democrats may use it to summon figures such as former National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The impeachment case centres on whether President Trump used the threat of withholding US military aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating a domestic political rival. At the heart of the impeachment inquiry is a phone call on 25 July this year between Mr Trump and Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky. A phone call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky is at the centre of the impeachment inquiry During the call, Mr Trump urged his counterpart to look into unsubstantiated corruption claims against Democratic White House contender Joe Biden. Mr Trump's critics say this alleged political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounted to abuse of power. The president has denied any wrongdoing and has called the inquiry a ""witch hunt"". The Judiciary Committee is expected to begin drafting articles of impeachment - which are the charges of wrongdoing against the president - in early December. After a vote in the Democratic-controlled House, a trial would be held in the Republican-run Senate. If Mr Trump was convicted by a two-thirds majority - an outcome deemed highly unlikely - he would become the first US president to be removed from office through impeachment. The White House and some Republicans want the trial to be limited to two weeks.

"This video can not be played Head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson was ""thrilled"" the school was not criticised by the judge Demonstrations against LGBT inclusive education have been permanently banned outside a primary school. A High Court judge ruled in favour of an exclusion zone to remain around Anderton Park, in Birmingham, which has been targeted by protesters for months. The protests had an averse effect on pupils, residents and staff, leading to 21 teachers being treated for stress, Mr Justice Warby said. Campaigners accused the city council of trying to silence debate. The protests at the school in Balsall Heath aimed to stop LGBT relationships education, with many parents and activists claiming it contradicts their Islamic faith and is not ""age appropriate"". Protesters were banned from the school gates in June October's five-day hearing at the city's Priory Courts heard there were further ""untrue"" and ""harmful"" allegations made about the school on social media, and how a visiting imam had claimed to parents there were ""paedophiles"" inside the school. Other false claims included that the school had a ""paedophile agenda"" and staff were ""teaching children how to masturbate"". ""None of this is true,"" Mr Justice Warby said as he handed down the ban at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre. ""None of the defendants have suggested it was true and the council has proved it is not true."" The lessons had been ""misrepresented by parents"", he said, adding the school does not promote homosexuality and seeks to weave the language of equality into everyday school life. This video can not be played Lead protester Shakeel Afsar is ""bitterly disappointed"" by the  ban Since June protesters have gathered just outside the exclusion zone. In the hearing last month, the city council argued an interim injunctionshould be extended beyond school gates and made permanent. Birmingham City Council said the noisy protests at the school gates were disrupting lessons and meant children were unable to use the playground. The council maintained the court action was in response to campaigners' behaviour, not the issue of the protests. The LGBT teaching row explained Birmingham LGBT row: The view from the school gates Latest news from the West Midlands The prior injunction named lead protester Shakeel Afsar, who does not have children at the school, his sister Rosina and Amir Ahmed, all of whom contested the need for a legal injunction. Mr Justice Warby directed that the three named defendants should be liable to 80% of those costs, which the court heard have yet to be calculated. The judge said the reason the award was not in full was because part of the council's claim - for an injunction on the making of abusive social media posts against teachers - had been unsuccessful. Teaching at the school had been ""grossly misrepresented"", Mr Justice Warby said Mr Afsar said he was ""bitterly disappointed with the decision of the court"". He branded the court ""one-sided"", pointing out that the judge, the council's barrister and key witnesses had been ""white"", compared with the ""diverse"" protest supporters. ""We can continue to protest in the same area that we have been protesting in since June this year,"" he added. ""These young children are not being taught the status of law."" Protests have continued outside an exclusion zone at Anderton Park Primary School Speaking after the ruling, head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson said staff would be ""over the moon"". ""We knew it was misrepresented and that was the frustration when you are trying to go about your daily business as educators and when people say things about you that are not true, that is very difficult,"" she said ""It has been awful, but my staff are unbelievable and parents are unbelievable and the children of Anderton Park are incredible human beings and we are a strong school and every single person is part of that strength."" By BBC correspondent Phil Mackie It's hard to see what the protesters can do now. One of the group's three leaders - Amir Ahmed - has said they would seek leave to appeal, but it's far from clear on what grounds they could do so. Only a handful of the people who regularly gathered outside the school were parents or had any direct connection with Anderton Park, but the demonstrators do reflect concern felt by some religious communities about equality teaching, and particularly lessons about same sex relationships. It won't matter to them that the judge has said their allegations about ""promoting"" homosexuality are false and that they have ""misrepresented"" what is being taught in the school. It will simply confirm their belief that they are the victims of bias against them by the establishment and the mainstream media. This video can not be played What is in the books that Parkfield parents are protesting about? Birmingham City Council said it was ""really pleased"" with Mr Justice Warby's decision. ""This was always about protecting the school and community from the escalating levels of anti-social behaviour of the protests,"" Dr Tim O'Neill, the council's director of education and skills, said. ""Birmingham is diverse and inclusive - these are its strengths - and we must all come together to ensure all children get the best education possible."" He said ""fringe elements"" had been attracted to the protests with the aim of ""stoking division and hatred"". Shakeel Afsar insisted the demonstrations were ""peaceful"" Christian campaigner John Allman, from Okehampton in Devon, had joined proceedings with a view to ""raising freedom of expression arguments"" in opposition to aspects of the injunction that sought to restrict statements on social media. Meanwhile, Mr Afsar had claimed the weekly protests were ""peaceful"" despite the use of megaphones and a sound-boosting PA system. The National Association of Head Teachers, which has supported the school, welcomed an end to the ""noisy and aggressive protests"". ""This judgement makes it abundantly clear that the school gate is no place to hold a protest,"" a spokesperson said. It was also welcomed by the Department for Education,which has previously faced criticism for a perceived lack of support for the school, but said it wanted to ""encourage positive dialogue"". Update 29 November 2019: This article has been updated to reflect that John Allman's part in proceedings was related to freedom of expression arguments and not the exclusion zone.

"Child poverty risks reaching a record high under the Conservatives, according to a Resolution Foundation report. The party's manifesto does not propose changes to existing benefit policy and, as a result, relative child poverty would reach a 60-year high of 34% by 2023-4, the think tank said. But none of the three main party manifestos would reduce child poverty from its current rate of 29.6% by then. The Tories said they were committed to tackling child poverty. The report,which was published on Tuesday,,externalsaid: ""It is notable that both the Labour and Liberal Democrat approaches could be expected to halt potential increases in relative child poverty over the next Parliament. ""We forecast that under current policy plans (ie the Conservative package) child poverty will rise from 29.6% in 2017-18 to 34.4% in 2023-24."" Under Labour's plans, which include around Â£9bn of extra social security spending, the foundation forecast there would be some 550,000 fewer children in poverty compared to Conservative plans. Labour's plans would see child poverty remain roughly the same, with a rate of around 30.2% in 2023-4. The 20-year child poverty promise that proved impossible What do we mean when we talk about poverty? That figure under Lib Dems' plans, meanwhile, would be 29.7% in 2023-4. Their social security pledges are slightly more progressive than Labour's and would see 600,000 fewer children in poverty than there would be under Conservative plans, the foundation said. ""However, this would not do enough to see child poverty fall from today's already high levels,"" the Resolution Foundation's Laura Gardiner said. Ms Gardiner added: ""Policy choices since 2010 have reduced the generosity of support for working age families by Â£34bn. ""Against the backdrop of major cuts, the parties' manifestos do offer big choices on social security."" The foundation - a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes - defined relative child poverty as those living in households with incomes below 60% of the median in a given year. In 2017-18, that figure was Â£304 a week,according to the Department for Work and Pensions.,external Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""Our reforms to social security, including scrapping Universal Credit, the Two-Child Limit and the Benefit Cap, will stop child poverty increasing, as this report rightly acknowledges."" He added that other pledges would seek to tackle the root cause of child poverty, including free school meals for all primary school pupils and an expansion of free childcare. Key policies in the Labour manifesto Key policies in the Lib Dem manifesto Key policies in the Conservative manifesto A Conservative spokesman defended the Tories' actions on tackling poverty. ""We are committed to tackling child poverty and have made progress since we came into government - with 730,000 fewer children in workless households,"" a spokeswoman said. ""But we know that we must continue to make every effort on this issue and our manifesto sets out how we will use the tax and benefits system to do this. ""The prime minister has committed to giving every child in the country the opportunities to make the most of their talents."" The report said that while workless households were in decline, one of the new challenges was ""in-work poverty"". Correction 5 December 2019: An earlier version of this article included a Conservative Party spokesman's claim that there were 750,000 fewer children in poverty since the party came into government.

"Indian doctors have removed a kidney weighing 7.4kg (16.3lbs) - as much as two newborn babies - from a patient. It's believed to be the largest kidney ever removed in India - a kidney usually weighs between 120-150g. The patient was suffering from a condition called Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease, which causes cysts to grow all over the organ. One doctor involved in the operation said large kidneys were common in patients with the disease. However Dr Sachin Kathuria, from Sir Ganga Ram hospital in Delhi, said doctors generally would not remove the organ unless there were symptoms of infection and internal bleeding, as they were performing at least some filtering functions in the body. ""This patient had contracted a bad infection that was not responding to antibiotics, and the kidney's massive size was causing the patient breathing difficulties, so we had no choice but to remove it,"" he said. India doctors remove 232 teeth from boy's mouth Dr Kathuria added that doctors were expecting a large kidney when they operated, but the size of this organ had still surprised them. ""His other kidney is even bigger"", he told the BBC. He said the heaviest kidney according to the Guinness World Records is 4.5kg, although urology journals had records of kidneys that were even heavier than this one. One from the US weighed 9kg while another from the Netherlands was 8.7kg. Dr Kathuria said doctors had not decided whether to submit their findings to the Guinness commission as a world record, but they were ""considering it"". According to the NHS website,Polycystic kidney disease is a common hereditary condition,external, which causes problems when patients are between 30 and 60 years old. It causes kidney function to deteriorate until it finally culminates in kidney failure.

"This video can not be played Footage of the moment Mohamud struck at Manchester Victoria A man who launched a frenzied knife attack at a railway station has admitted trying to kill three people, including a police officer. Mahdi Mohamud, 26, stabbed and slashed at a couple and then attacked Sgt Lee Valentine at Manchester Victoria railway station on New Year's Eve. The couple's injuries included a punctured lung and a skull fracture. Mohamud pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to three counts of attempted murder and a terror offence. He admitted possession of a document or record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism and will be sentenced on Wednesday. This video can not be played Manchester stabbing: Police restrain suspect The court heard Mohamud, of Cheetham Hill in Manchester, walked up behind a man and a woman in their 50s shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" and ""Long live the caliphate"" as they headed for a tram platform shortly before 21:00 GMT on 31 December. He stabbed the man repeatedly in the back, shoulders and head and then slashed the woman across the face after the couple randomly crossed his path. The man suffered 13 injuries including a skull fracture while the woman's right lung was punctured and she suffered a slash to her forehead that cut down to the bone. Four officers, including Sgt Valentine (second left) and two tram staff, received commendations following the attack British Transport Police officers and tram staff confronted Mohamud, who witnesses said was ""like an animal"" and was ""fixated"" on stabbing and slashing. Sgt Valentine, 31, shot Mohamud with his Taser but the barbs got stuck in the knifeman's coat and failed to paralyse him. The sergeant was stabbed in the shoulder before the suspect was wrestled to the ground and arrested. Sgt Valentine said Mohamud was ""dancing around, waving this knife around"" before he started to run at the officers. ""He probably closed a seven foot gap in half a second,"" he added. ""It was just like a dive, he flew, he probably jumped three or four foot off the ground and just sort of lunged, probably lunged at my head with his knife."" A woman and a man in their 50s and a police sergeant were stabbed A second kitchen knife was found in Mohamud's waistband. Greater Manchester Police said officers recovered a large amount of ""counter-terrorism mindset material"", including images and a document about how to carry out knife attacks. The defendant, a Dutch national from a Somali family, had arrived in the UK aged nine and became radicalised online, the force said. Mohamud was sectioned under the Mental Health Act following the attack and taken to a secure mental health facility where he is currently detained. Prosecutor Alison Morgan QC said: ""The prosecution's case is that the attack at Victoria Station was not simply a product of that mental illness. ""It was intended to be a lethal attack, carefully planned over a number of months, reflecting the defendant's extremist ideology and his desire to perform violent jihad. ""The defendant's actions may have been disinhibited by his mental illness, but they were driven by an entrenched desire to undertake jihad against the West."" The court heard how Mohamud has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and he will need treatment for the rest of his life. Mahdi Mohamud will be sentenced on Wednesday following the stabbing at Manchester Victoria railway station on New Year's Eve Rebecca Trowler QC, defending, said Mohamud had first been admitted to a UK mental health hospital in December 2015. He was also admitted to institutions in Somalia on three occasions in 2017 during which time he swung an axe at a nurse, stabbed a second nurse with a knife in a separate attack, and also stabbed his uncle, the court heard. His symptoms include hallucinations and ""complex persecutory delusional beliefs"" which led him to be believe his actions were being controlled as he followed by MI5 and the government. In a letter to the judge, Mohamud's father said he felt a ""terrible sense of guilt"" for not getting his son the right treatment earlier and thanked police and the emergency services. Ms Trowler said the defendant's family had slipped anti-psychotic drugs into his food in the days before the attack and made him a doctor's appointment.

"Employee activism has been a major disruption for Google over the past two years Google has fired four employees in what activists within the company describe as an attempt to ""crush"" workers' attempts to organise. The people, who have been dubbed the ""Thanksgiving Four"", had their contracts terminated on Monday. Staff were told via an internal memo that the firings were related to data security and employee safety. But those who lost their jobs have said they were being punished for ""speaking out"". The sackings followed a demonstration at Google's San Francisco office on Friday, attended by more than 200 Google employees. Two of the four fired employees, Rebecca Rivers and Laurence Berland, spoke at the protest. The Silicon Valley giant has confirmed the authenticity of the memo,first published by Bloomberg,external, but would not comment further. Google's Security and Investigations team said the employees were routinely accessing information about other projects and employees inappropriately. ""Our thorough investigation found the individuals were involved in systematic searches for other employeesâ materials and work,â the memo read. ""This includes searching for, accessing, and distributing business information outside the scope of their jobs - repeating this conduct even after they were met with and reminded about our data security policies. ""This information, along with details of internal emails and inaccurate descriptions about Googlersâ work, was subsequently shared externally."" At Friday's protest, Ms Rivers told the crowd she had been put on administrative leave for accessing confidential documents. She tweeted on Monday that her contract had been terminated. ""Four of our colleagues took a stand and organised for a better workplace,"" a statement representing the Four, and other organising employees, read. The confirmed Mr Berland was among the four. The other two employeesâ identities have not been made public. The statement continued: ""This is explicitly condoned in Google's Code of Conduct, which ends: 'And rememberâ¦ donât be evil, and if you see something that you think isnât right â speak upâ. ""When they did, Google retaliated against them. Today, after putting two of them on sudden and unexplained leave, the company fired all four in an attempt to crush worker organising.â Among the issues causing discomfort among Google employees is the firm's work with the US Border Patrol. More than 1,500 workers have signed a petition demanding Google backs down from its bid to provide the agency with cloud computing services. But the workers point to Google's hiring of IRI Consultants, a firm which bills itself as a leader in helping major firms avoid ""union vulnerabilityâ, as a sign of the search giantâs growing unease at internal activism. The row has caught the attention of Washington. ""This type of union busting is unacceptable,"" tweeted presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders. ""I say to Google: it is time to address the racism, harassment, and harmful contracts at your company and treat your workers with the respect and dignity they deserve."" Observers see the move as heralding the end of Google's famously open working culture. Executives have locked down the degree to which employees can access information on projects they are not involved with, while earlier this month Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai told staff its weekly ""all-hands"" meeting would no longer take place. The open forum, which used to take place every Friday, will be replaced by a monthly meeting that focused only on ""product and business strategy"", according to tech news site The Verge, referencing an internal memo sent at the time. No longer allowed at the meetings: free-flowing questions on Google's political controversy, such as its role in China, dealings with the military, and co-operation with US Immigrations, Customs and Enforcement - known as Ice. ""They think this will crush our efforts, but it won't,"" the Google workers statement distributed on Monday added. ""For every one they retaliate against, there are hundreds of us who will fight, and together we will win. One of the most powerful companies in the world wouldn't be retaliating against us if collective action didn't work."" _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Blue Story is the tale of two friends who become rivals A cinema chain has reversed its decision to pull the film Blue Story after a brawl. Showcase said it had reinstated screenings of the film on Monday night after ""careful consideration"". It comes after youths, some armed with machetes, sparked a police operation at Vue's multiplex cinema at Star City in Birmingham. A ban is still in place at Vue cinemas' 91 UK and Ireland venues, it said, after multiple ""significant incidents"". The move has prompted a backlash on social media with somelabelling the ban as ""racist"". Cinema firm Showcase had initially stopped showing the film, but reinstated screenings on Monday night after ""careful consideration and discussions with the distributor"".

Five teenagers, including a 13-year-old girl, were arrested in connection with the disturbance, which involved up to 100 young people in a public area of the multiplex, on Saturday night. In a statement, Vue said the film opened in 60 of its sites across the UK and Ireland on Friday. ""But during the first 24 hours of the film over 25 significant incidents were reported and escalated to senior management in 16 separate cinemas,"" it said. ""This is the biggest number we have ever seen for any film in a such a short time frame."" This video can not be played Several arrests were made at a multiplex in Birmingham on Saturday (Courtesy Rachael Allison) A spokeswoman for Vue confirmed police had been called to some of the incidents, but could not confirm exactly how many times. The chain has stressed the decision to pull the film was prompted only because of the risk of further violence. A spokeswoman for Vue said a ""significant incident"" was ""any incident that has a risk to audience members"", adding that they were awaiting clarification of the details of individual cases. The Odeon chain says it is not withdrawing the film, but ""a number of security measures are in place"" for Blue Story screenings, though it refused to elaborate on what they are. In Birmingham, a note on the door of the Odeon cinema at the Broadway Plaza said staff would be carrying out bag searches throughout the day. This video can not be played Andrew Onwubolu, known as Rapman, wrote and directed the film Blue Story Blue Story's writer and director, Andrew Onwubolu known as Rapman, said Saturday's disturbance in Birmingham was ""truly unfortunate"". In an Instagram post on Sunday, the rapper-turned-filmmaker wrote: ""Sending love to all those involved in yesterday's violence at Star City in Birmingham. ""It's truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. ""Blue Story is a film about love not violence."" On Monday, he tweeted: ""We lost nearly half of our screens on the third day but we still made history with Â£1.3m in 3 days. Blue Story is number three in the UK box office. Thank you."" An online petition calling for the film to be reinstated at Vue cinemas has attracted more than 13,000 signatures. The film was released last Friday On Saturday, West Midlands Police officers drew Tasers and used a dispersal order to clear the Star City venue. Footage from inside the multiplex appeared to show fights and people on the floor screaming. The five teenagers - two girls aged 13 and 14 and three 14-year-old boys - have all now been bailed alongside a 19-year-old man. Four were held on suspicion of assaulting police and one of the boys was detained on suspicion of obstructing police. Another of the boys was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after an image circulated on social media showing a number of youths, with one carrying a machete. Police were called to the complex, in Nechells, at about 17:30 GMT and cleared the area by 21:00. The officers hurt during the disorder suffered minor facial injuries. 'Institutionally racist': Blue Story ban faces backlash Rapman: 'When I was at school, I focused on surviving' Girl, 13, among 'machete' brawl cinema arrests The film focuses on two friends from different south London postcodes on rival sides of a street war. It is rated 15 for strong language, strong violence, threat, sex and drug misuse. Distributor Paramount Pictures said it was ""saddened"" by events at Star City but said the movie had had an ""incredibly positive reaction and fantastic reviews"". In Sheffield on Sunday evening, there was an increased police presence around Centertainment in Broughton Lane ahead of the showing of the film after disorder was reported outside the Cineworld within the complex on Saturday. ""Officers carried out patrols of the area to ensure everyone's safety,"" police said in a statement, adding that they would ""be liaising with Cineworld over the coming week to discuss further screenings of this film"".

""Four of our colleagues took a stand and organised for a better workplace,"" a statement representing the Four, and other organising employees, read. The confirmed Mr Berland was among the four. The other two employeesâ identities have not been made public. The statement continued: ""This is explicitly condoned in Google's Code of Conduct, which ends: 'And rememberâ¦ donât be evil, and if you see something that you think isnât right â speak upâ. ""When they did, Google retaliated against them. Today, after putting two of them on sudden and unexplained leave, the company fired all four in an attempt to crush worker organising.â Among the issues causing discomfort among Google employees is the firm's work with the US Border Patrol. More than 1,500 workers have signed a petition demanding Google backs down from its bid to provide the agency with cloud computing services. But the workers point to Google's hiring of IRI Consultants, a firm which bills itself as a leader in helping major firms avoid ""union vulnerabilityâ, as a sign of the search giantâs growing unease at internal activism. The row has caught the attention of Washington. ""This type of union busting is unacceptable,"" tweeted presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders. ""I say to Google: it is time to address the racism, harassment, and harmful contracts at your company and treat your workers with the respect and dignity they deserve."" Observers see the move as heralding the end of Google's famously open working culture. Executives have locked down the degree to which employees can access information on projects they are not involved with, while earlier this month Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai told staff its weekly ""all-hands"" meeting would no longer take place. The open forum, which used to take place every Friday, will be replaced by a monthly meeting that focused only on ""product and business strategy"", according to tech news site The Verge, referencing an internal memo sent at the time. No longer allowed at the meetings: free-flowing questions on Google's political controversy, such as its role in China, dealings with the military, and co-operation with US Immigrations, Customs and Enforcement - known as Ice. ""They think this will crush our efforts, but it won't,"" the Google workers statement distributed on Monday added. ""For every one they retaliate against, there are hundreds of us who will fight, and together we will win. One of the most powerful companies in the world wouldn't be retaliating against us if collective action didn't work."" _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Alibaba chairman Daniel Zhang (centre) flanked by company executives and a Chinese official at the Hong Kong stock exchange Shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba have surged in its Hong Kong trading debut in one of the year's most anticipated stock offerings. The firm, which is already traded in the US, raised around $11.3bn (Â£8.8bn) in its secondary listing. At the launch, Chairman Daniel Zhang cheered Alibaba's return to Hong Kong. The move is seen as a boost for the city amid fears long-running protests have tarnished its reputation as a financial hub. In opening moves on Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index on Tuesday, Alibaba's stock jumped more than 6%. The company was met with strong appetite for its shares, priced at HK$176 each. Mr Zhang struck the gong at the ceremony at the city's exchange and welcomed the firm's return ""home"" to Hong Kong. He was joined by the territory's Financial Secretary Paul Chan and former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa. The Hangzhou-based firm had originally considered a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) in 2013, but opted for New York after failing to secure regulatory approval in the Asian territory. Why Alibaba is listing in Hong Kong now Alibaba Singles' Day shopping frenzy breaks record Over the years, Alibaba has grown from an online marketplace into an e-commerce giant with interests ranging from financial services to artificial intelligence. Ahead of its Hong Kong debut, the company said the listing would allow investors across Asia to ""participate in Alibaba's growth,"" as it seeks to tap ""substantial new capital pools"" in the region. Alibaba has been listed in New York since 2014 The share sale has knocked Uber off the top spot as this year's biggest IPO, according to Dealogic data. The ride-sharing firm raised $8.1bn in its New York float in May. The move to go ahead with the Hong Kong listing comes after Alibaba delayed plans to do so earlier this year, amid ongoing unrest and the US-China trade war. The long-running protests havehurt the economy, which has fallen into recession, and knocked business confidence in the city. The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms. Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights. A quick guide to the Hong Kong protests While the extradition plans were withdrawn in September, the demonstrations have continued, with protesters calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform.

"Climate change is said to have increased the severity of recent wildfires in Australia Countries will have to increase their carbon-cutting ambitions five fold if the world is to avoid warming by more than 1.5C, the UN says. The annual emissions gap report shows that even if all current promises are met, the world will warm by more than double that amount by 2100. Richer countries have failed to cut emissions quickly enough, the authors say. Fifteen of the 20 wealthiest nations have no timeline for a net zero target. Greenhouse gas concentrations break records China coal surge threatens Paris climate targets BBC Briefing: Energy Hot on the heels of the World Meteorological Organization's report on greenhouse gas concentrations, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) has published its regular snapshot of how the world is doing in cutting levels of these pollutants. The emissions gap report looks at the difference between how much carbon needs to be cut to avoid dangerous warming  - and where we are likely to end up with the promises that countries have currently committed to, in the Paris climate agreement. The UN assessment is fairly blunt. ""The summary findings are bleak,"" it says. ""Countries collectively failed to stop the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required."" The report says that emissions have gone up by 1.5% per year in the last decade. In 2018, the total reached 55 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is putting the Earth on course to experience a temperature rise of 3.2C by the end of this century. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Just last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that allowing temperatures to rise more than 1.5 degrees this century would have hugely damaging effects for human, plant and animal life across the planet. This report says that to keep this target alive, the world needs to cut emissions by 7.6% every year for the next 10 years. ""Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions - over 7% each year, if we break it down evenly over the next decade,"" said Inger Andersen, Unep's executive director. The report pays particular attention to the actions of the richest countries. The group of the 20 wealthiest (G20) are responsible for 78% of all emissions. But so far, only the EU, the UK, Italy and France have committed to long-term net zero targets. Forest clearing in Asia has contributed significantly to carbon emissions over the past decade Seven G20 members need to take more action to achieve their current promises. These include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, South Africa and the US. For example, Brazil's plans were recently revised, ""reflecting the recent trend towards increased deforestation"". Three countries - India, Russia and Turkey - are all on track to over-achieve their plans by 15% but the authors of the report say this is because the targets they set themselves were too low in the first place. For three others - Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia - the researchers are uncertain as to whether they are meeting their targets or not. Flooding is one of the most damaging consequences of rising temperatures That leaves China, the EU and Mexico as three countries or regions that are set to meet their promises or nationally determined contributions (NDCs), as they are called, with their current policies. Without serious upgrades to most countries' plans, the UN says the 1.5C target will be missed by a significant amount. ""We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020, then stronger NDCs to kick-start the major transformations of economies and societies,"" says Inger Anderson. ""We need to catch up on the years in which we procrastinated,"" she added. ""If we don't do this, the 1.5C goal will be out of reach before 2030."" The report outlines some specific actions for different countries in the G20. There will have to be a huge increase in spending on renewable energy So for Argentina it's recommended that they work harder to shift the public towards widespread use of public transport in big cities. China is urged to ban all new coal-fired power plants, something that recent research casts doubt on. The biggest focus of action is the energy system. To get a sense of the massive scale of change that is needed, the study says the world will have to spend up to $3.8 trillion per year, every year between 2020 and 2050 to achieve the 1.5C target. The impression that time is running short is reinforced by the report - and UN negotiators gearing up to meet in Madrid next week at COP25 are feeling the pressure to increase their ambitions on carbon. ""This is a new and stark reminder by the Unep that we cannot delay climate action any longer,"" said Teresa Ribera, Spain's minister for the ecological transition. ""We need it at every level, by every national and subnational government, and by the rest of the economic and civil society actors. We urgently need to align with the Paris Agreement objectives and elevate climate ambition. ""It would be incomprehensible if countries who are committed to the United Nations system and multilateralism did not acknowledge that part of this commitment requires further climate action. Otherwise, there will only be more suffering, pain, and injustice."" Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"Child poverty risks reaching a record high under the Conservatives, according to a Resolution Foundation report. The party's manifesto does not propose changes to existing benefit policy and, as a result, relative child poverty would reach a 60-year high of 34% by 2023-4, the think tank said. But none of the three main party manifestos would reduce child poverty from its current rate of 29.6% by then. The Tories said they were committed to tackling child poverty. The report,which was published on Tuesday,,externalsaid: ""It is notable that both the Labour and Liberal Democrat approaches could be expected to halt potential increases in relative child poverty over the next Parliament. ""We forecast that under current policy plans (ie the Conservative package) child poverty will rise from 29.6% in 2017-18 to 34.4% in 2023-24."" Under Labour's plans, which include around Â£9bn of extra social security spending, the foundation forecast there would be some 550,000 fewer children in poverty compared to Conservative plans. Labour's plans would see child poverty remain roughly the same, with a rate of around 30.2% in 2023-4. The 20-year child poverty promise that proved impossible What do we mean when we talk about poverty? That figure under Lib Dems' plans, meanwhile, would be 29.7% in 2023-4. Their social security pledges are slightly more progressive than Labour's and would see 600,000 fewer children in poverty than there would be under Conservative plans, the foundation said. ""However, this would not do enough to see child poverty fall from today's already high levels,"" the Resolution Foundation's Laura Gardiner said. Ms Gardiner added: ""Policy choices since 2010 have reduced the generosity of support for working age families by Â£34bn. ""Against the backdrop of major cuts, the parties' manifestos do offer big choices on social security."" The foundation - a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes - defined relative child poverty as those living in households with incomes below 60% of the median in a given year. In 2017-18, that figure was Â£304 a week,according to the Department for Work and Pensions.,external Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""Our reforms to social security, including scrapping Universal Credit, the Two-Child Limit and the Benefit Cap, will stop child poverty increasing, as this report rightly acknowledges."" He added that other pledges would seek to tackle the root cause of child poverty, including free school meals for all primary school pupils and an expansion of free childcare. Key policies in the Labour manifesto Key policies in the Lib Dem manifesto Key policies in the Conservative manifesto A Conservative spokesman defended the Tories' actions on tackling poverty. ""We are committed to tackling child poverty and have made progress since we came into government - with 730,000 fewer children in workless households,"" a spokeswoman said. ""But we know that we must continue to make every effort on this issue and our manifesto sets out how we will use the tax and benefits system to do this. ""The prime minister has committed to giving every child in the country the opportunities to make the most of their talents."" The report said that while workless households were in decline, one of the new challenges was ""in-work poverty"". Correction 5 December 2019: An earlier version of this article included a Conservative Party spokesman's claim that there were 750,000 fewer children in poverty since the party came into government.

"The district elections took place over the weekend Chinese state media outlets have attempted to downplay the results of Hong Kong's district elections, which saw the pro-democracy camp score a landslide victory. The government had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"" opposed to the protests. Instead, it saw some significant pro-Beijing candidates lose council seats. Chief Executive Carrie Lam has acknowledged public ""unhappiness"". In her first public appearance since the results, she said she recognised that people were concerned over ""deficiencies in governance, including unhappiness with the time taken to deal with the unstable environment"". However, she offered no new concessions. Reaction from state media outlets has ranged from making no reference at all to election results to overt claims that ""tampering"" had taken place. Hong Kong's young winners and the veterans they toppled HK leader will 'reflect' after election rout State broadcaster CCTV's daily news programme Xinwen Lianbo stayed silent on the results, instead accusing the US of interference. Xinhua, the state's press agency, made some allusion to the fact that elections had taken place over the weekend but pivoted back to the violence of recent weeks, stressing the need to restore order. News outlet the Global Times did cover the elections in detail,concluding in an English-language article that the pan-democrats had ""scored a big win"".,external However, the report also said there was ""no need to over-interpret the victory of pan-democrats"". The Global Times' editor Hu Xijin, known for his outspoken comments, mentioned on Chinese social media site Weibo that the pro-Beijing camp had failed, but added that the district council elections were on a very ""local level"". The China Daily made no reference to the pro-democracy camp's victory English-language paper China Daily reported that the elections had concluded,but made no reference to the pro-democracy camp's victory.,external China Daily separately posted a picture on Twitter,externalwith the caption: ""That's how the oppositions [sic] tampers with a fair election."" The picture accuses protesters - without evidence - of taking citizens' ID cards to stop them from casting their votes, and of misleading the elderly to vote for pro-democracy councillors. Stephen McDonnell, BBC News, Hong Kong For Beijing, for Carrie Lam's administration and even Hong Kong's police force, the district council elections have just punched a large hole in their ""silent majority"" narrative. The message from the establishment had been that most residents were fed up with protesters and wanted the government to crack down hard on them. The problem with that line now is that district council elections didn't pan out that way and in fact revealed sentiments overwhelmingly in the opposite direction. Hong Kong's leader is already being criticised over her first public appearance since the election, when she said people wanted to ""go back to their normal lives"" and could ""no longer tolerate the chaos"" of demonstrations. It's hard to see how this argument can be sustained given that the electorate has overwhelmingly voted for a rejection of the way things were, and winning pro-democracy candidates saying that a return to the status quo is not an option. The central government in Beijing has chosen a much more blunt instrument by stopping virtually all television, radio and newspaper coverage from mentioning the actual election result and hoping that not too many people on the Chinese mainland hear about it via social media. After all this is a pretty hard one to explain given that, prior to this weekend, story after story in China's state-run media had been portraying the protest movement as a bunch of fringe vandals making life miserable for most in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's district councillors have only limited political influence - they most deal with very local issues like transport and amenities. But Sunday's election drew particular attention because it was the first vote to take place since anti-government protests first began in June. Supporters of the protest movement hope election wins will help their cause Some of the councillors will also play a role in choosing the next chief executive, Hong Kong's leader. A record 4.1 million people had registered to vote - more than half the population - and more than 1,000 candidates ran for 452 electable seats. Candidates sympathetic to the pro-democracy cause won a total of 347 seats and according to local media, now control 17 of the 18 councils. Huge gains for pro-democracy groups in HK polls Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words How is Hong Kong run? The protests were triggered bya bill which would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainlandChina. This bill prompted fears that China was increasingly encroaching on the city's autonomy, including its right to judicial independence. It was eventually withdrawn but the movement has now evolved into a broader protest against the way the city is run. This video can not be played A winner and a loser in Hong Kong's historic poll result Earlier last week, US lawmakers overwhelminglypassed legislation in support of Hong Kong's protesters. On Monday, China's foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador to protest against the passing of the bill, accusing the US of ""meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China's internal matters"".

" Election battleground: Pembrokeshire By Jon Kelly  By Jon Kelly Clare Johns strides into the field, yellow feed bucket swinging at her side, and the sheep quickly surround her like a litter of giant puppies. She has 40 of them in total, a mixture of Ryland and Shetland breeds, and Clare’s tweed coat is woven from their wool. Its colours were inspired by the Preseli Hills, the imposing range that gives its name to one of Wales’s tightest marginal seats. Growing up in a council house, Clare had two ambitions - to be a fashion designer and to own a horse. Back then, these seemed like impossible fantasies. “We didn’t have much,” says Clare, now 35. Her mum worked as a cleaner, a lollipop lady and in the staff kitchen at the local Tesco supermarket, on top of bringing up five children on her own. They lived in Pennar, a suburb of Pembroke Dock - now in the Carmarthen West & South Pembrokeshire constituency, held by the Conservatives by just over 3,000 votes in 2017. Across the Milford Haven waterway, you could see what is now the southernmost tip of the Preseli Pembrokeshire seat, last claimed by the Tories with a wafer-thin majority of 317 over Labour. There wasn’t much to do in Pennar, Clare recalls. “It’s rows and rows of housing, there’s no shops.” But there were always plenty of chores to keep her occupied. The children had to light the fire, clean up, help keep the household running. It was tough but it instilled in Clare and her siblings a fierce work ethic. Clare would watch her grandmother make clothes for the entire family on an old Singer sewing machine. It inspired Clare to do what she could with spare materials too. She didn’t enjoy school much, but a fashion textiles course at the local college changed everything. She loved being surrounded by creative people. Her tutor suggested she go to London to study for a fashion degree, but she couldn’t bring herself to do it. “As much as I love going to London, it was just too much of a jump for me,” she says. “I just felt I wasn’t confident enough to do that.” Instead she took her fashion degree at the University of South Wales in Newport. By the time she graduated she was pregnant, and she married her husband, Owain, a few months later. It was a budget ceremony - Clare made her own wedding dress as well as dresses for her mum and the bridesmaids. Then Clare’s husband was offered a job at a farm attached to a school in Pembroke, teaching vocational skills to children with behavioural and learning difficulties. Clare ended up teaching there too, and helping to run the farm. She was learning agricultural skills for herself - and there was the horse she’d always dreamed of. But she was also seeing a very different side of Pembrokeshire from the one on display to the four million tourists who pour in to the county each year. Many of the teenagers the school was looking after came from deeply troubled backgrounds. Clare recalls comforting one 15-year-old boy who was crying his eyes out “because he needed his fix”.  His parents were addicts too.   Other pupils relied on handouts for food and clothing. Some had been lured into working for drug dealers at the age of 12. It was against this grim backdrop that Clare took the surprising decision to launch her own luxury woollen collection. She’d kept up her garment-making skills - working as a seamstress, doing basic repairs, making the odd bridesmaid’s dress, selling her own designs at markets. She’d tried to start her own bridalwear company “but I didn’t enjoy it - bridezillas and everything”. Then she met a weaver who suggested working with tweed. She ordered 50m and made up a small collection of her own designs - jackets, skirts, blankets. She had some angora goats on the farm so there were sweaters, too. Clare set up a website to sell her range and offered items on a sale-or-return basis to local shops. It was quickly a success. Soon there was enough demand to start a shop in nearby Narberth with her mum and sister, and for Clare and her husband to start raising their own sheep on 12 acres of rented land. The reality TV show Made In Chelsea ordered 50 of her jackets for its cast. The Duchess of Cornwall had one, too. And then in 2016 the EU referendum was held. Clare voted Remain - she worried about what would happen if all the European funds currently being spent in Wales were taken away. She was angry when the result came through - both constituencies that cover Pembrokeshire voted to Leave by 55% to 45%. Wales as a whole voted for Leave by 52.5%. Clare noticed a sudden drop in trade, which she attributes to consumers’ uncertainty about the future. “Footfall was dramatically down,” she says. “And the footfall that was coming in - they weren’t spending.” The cost of fabrics, fusing, lining, trims, pattern grading - all of it went up. She had to close the shop. Without having to rent a retail unit, her business has recovered. But Clare thinks it took an unnecessary hit. She worries that Brexit will take years to resolve, and that will in turn mean years of further uncertainty - and in the meantime, no-one will tackle the deep-rooted rural poverty and deprivation that she saw at the school. “Because we’re in a smaller town, we get forgotten about,” she says. “Out of sight, out of mind.”  As a child, Mike Smith never thought he’d be a farmer. Even though his father and grandfather had farmed land near Haverfordwest since 1939, he’d intended to take a different path. As a teenager he planned to be an architect. And then, when it was time to apply to university, he started to have second thoughts. Why train for a job for seven years, only to possibly wind up unemployed at the end of it? Whereas if he worked for himself, he could do whatever he wanted. So he went off to study agriculture instead, returning to the farm in 1996 and taking it over, with his brother, a decade ago. They have 650 acres and milk 450 cows, but it’s been a difficult era for anyone trying to make a living out of agriculture. “Pretty much for the whole time I’ve been home it’s been tough, really,” he says. First there was BSE, then movement restrictions following the foot-and-mouth outbreak. Then in 2014 Vladimir Putin banned EU dairy products from Russia in retaliation for Western sanctions. This saw the price Mike could charge for milk drop from 30p per litre to less than 15p, taking £400,000 out of his annual turnover. It can be a lonely business, too. While there’s a strong community of farmers, it saddens Mike how many of his old school friends have left the area - many hope to come back to retire, but he says there’s a noticeable absence of people from his generation, in their 30s to their 50s. “If you ask most of my contemporaries, if they had a choice they’d stay here, they wouldn’t have moved,” he says. “It’s a shame because you’re losing your brightest people, who should be staying and starting their own businesses and generating income within the county.” In the 2016 referendum on EU membership, Mike voted Leave. He didn’t feel particularly fervent about it back then, but he took the view that there were opportunities as well as threats. Welsh dairy was a premium product, he reasoned, so people around the world would want to buy it - and anyway the EU hadn’t been much help when BSE had struck or Putin imposed his ban. In the aftermath of the vote he was shocked by how rancorous the debate became. “It has split opinions between friends and family,” he says. “I see social media and look at some of my school friends’ comments - we went through the same education, how can we think so differently?” Some told him he was stupid to have voted Leave, given the payments from Brussels that farmers receive. Mike doesn’t see it that way. “To be honest the subsidies from Europe I see more as a big stick that they use to beat us with,” he says. “It’s just the next set of hoops that the government want us to jump through for less and less money.” Over the last three years Mike’s opinion about Brexit has hardened, principally because of the manner in which Parliament has conducted itself. “I think it’s a disgrace the way it’s been handled,” he says. He suspects there’s been an effort by Remainer MPs to drag things out as long as possible so that everyone gets sick of it. He’d rather Brexit was over and done with so that the government could get on with the things he says really matter, like the NHS and jobs. But there’s a point of consensus with Clare. Like her, Mike says the county’s remoteness allows it to be ignored by those in power. “I’d say Pembrokeshire is so far out on a limb I think it just gets forgotten about, full stop.” At the foot of the Preseli hills is a small village called Maenclochog. It has a post office, a church, a general store, and two garages. There’s an art gallery and a school where lessons are taught in Welsh - if you visit the cafe or the pub, it’s likely you’ll hear the language spoken there too. And everyone will know who you’re talking about if you ask after Meg Cakes. That’s the nickname Megan Davies is known by. Megan is 25 and runs her own cake-baking business from her kitchen, in the village where she’s lived most of her life. “I can’t imagine my life anywhere else than here,” she says. “If I go down the shop, my auntie works there - I definitely will see someone I know. I think that’s what I missed when I lived in Cardiff.” After school, Megan moved to the Welsh capital to study graphic design. She’d visited before, but the scale and size of the place meant being there full-time was quite a radical change for her. She made lots of friends and it was a novelty being able to pop across the road to the shops, instead of driving for 20 minutes to the nearest town. But when she was on her way home at night from anywhere in Cardiff she’d ring her mum and dad, because it made her feel safer. Although she liked it there, ultimately the course wasn’t right for her. After two years she dropped out and moved back to live with her parents in Maenclochog. She didn’t have much to do there at first apart from go on Facebook and upload pictures of cupcakes she’d baked. A friend asked her to make a cake for her boyfriend; he was a builder, so Megan baked one with a little fondant icing construction worker on top, next to a pile of fondant icing bricks. It was fairly rudimentary by her later standards, but Megan was pleased with it. She posted a photo online, and more and more people started asking her to bake a cake for them, too - wedding cakes, birthday cakes, cakes with Disney heroines on top of them, or the logos of football teams, or Elvis. Word of mouth helped her build her business in a way that would never have been possible in a less tightly knitted environment - if you needed something baked for a special occasion, you’d ask around and someone would tell you about Meg Cakes. But social media - Instagram and Facebook in particular - was a peculiarly modern and effective way of promoting a rural business. When Megan posts a photo, 100 people might see it within 10 minutes. “You’re not going to have 100 people passing your shopfront in a place like this,” she says. Much as she loves Maenclochog, she knows it has its downsides. There’s only one bus service, to Haverfordwest. “Just one. That’s it,” she says. “I think it’s gone for five hours and then you’ve got to come back.” Friends who grew up in the village can find jobs readily enough if they train as a teacher or a nurse. But Megan’s older sister, who has a degree in fine art, had to move to Bristol in search of employment. She’d like to return one day. Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire Bishop Auckland Southampton Norwich  Support for the Welsh language is important to Megan, too. “I know this is going to sound silly now, but until I went to university, I never really realised that I spoke two languages,” she says. She’d absorbed both as a child and it always felt natural to switch between the two. She’d like her own children to speak the language, but she worries it’s dying out. For a while she worked in a pub a few miles away called the Tafarn Sinc, where Welsh is spoken at the bar. The community rallied round to save it when it was at risk of closure, and she appreciates living in a place where people make an effort, however small, to keep Welsh alive. “It’s good when you go places, even if it’s just ‘Welcome andcroeso’ - it’s something, isn’t it?” Community spirit notwithstanding, Megan steers away from talking about Brexit around the village. “I think around here people had made their mind up and they were totally for Leave or Remain,” she says. “You don’t want to ask people because you don’t want a lecture about it.” In 2016 she made sure to read up on the arguments for and against but ultimately didn’t feel well informed enough to adopt a strong set of opinions on the subject. “I know that might sound really bad but I didn’t know what to do,” she says. “So I just thought: ‘My life’s fine now, I’ll vote Remain.’” For now, her business hasn’t been affected by the Brexit vote, though she says some have. Through her work around weddings, she heard of a florist's that can’t take advance bookings because it can’t rely on the price of imported flowers staying the same in the event of a no-deal exit from the EU. For Megan the bigger issue is the uncertainty, not the relentless verbal war of attrition. She finds herself wondering what would happen if Brexit were somehow resolved, one way or the other. “What would they talk about on the news? It’s just everywhere - Brexit, Brexit, Brexit. The word’s getting on my nerves.” It’s a cold winter day and David Annis is looking ruefully at his market stall. Sales have plummeted since the end of the tourist season. “We’re struggling to get people to come because now that the visitors have gone it’s only locals who are left,” he says. And the locals aren’t buying. On Fridays, David, 69, sets up for business in Haverfordwest; on Saturdays, he’s in Fishguard, the coastal town at the northern end of Pembrokeshire, close to his home. Half of his stall is given over to handmade wooden crafts, glasswear, textiles. The other half is baked goods made by his wife - cakes, pies, fancies and so on. “Most of Fishguard’s regulars are older people at this time of year and if you have a day like today they’re not going to come out in this wind,” he says. “So it’s a struggle, really.” In the summer it’s a different story. Fishguard is linked by ferry with Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland. One day earlier this year, when a cruise ship disembarked, local people formed a welcoming committee, with stalls and music. While Clare, Mike and Megan were all born in Pembrokeshire, David made it his home. He’d been living in Essex and working in London, but an epileptic fit while he was driving 35 years ago put an end to his career. Charity work and the market stall have kept him occupied ever since. In 2016, David voted Leave. To him, the EU represented bureaucracy and snouts in the trough – unelected people “telling us what to do and filling their pockets”. Like Mike, he’s annoyed that Parliament has failed to carry out the instructions given by the electorate during the referendum. His family hosts African students who come to Wales to learn about agriculture, and it embarrasses him when these young people see British MPs acting like “a nursery class”, shouting at each other rather than getting on with the job. But since the prime minister returned with his latest Brexit deal - which effectively creates a customs border between Great Britain and the island of Ireland - David has started to worry what it will mean for Fishguard. The area enjoys strong cultural links with the Irish Republic. Each year, he takes his market stall to the Wexford Food Festival. He doesn’t make much money but it’s good PR for Pembrokeshire. “I am now more worried about it - about going out,” he says. “One of our few remaining industries is that ferry. Are the things we get from there going to be more expensive? Is it going to be harder to export things to there because of charges they’ll make for imports? We don’t know.” It doesn’t look to him like the government has handled the entire process well. There doesn’t seem to him to be anyone at the top with the wherewithal to make a go of it. But he’s still sure Brexit needs to happen. “The main thing is, the majority voted to leave the EU in 2016,” he says. “It’s now 2019 and we thought democracy was the rule of the majority. If they don’t listen to the majority then so many people are going to say: ‘Why bother voting?’” Outside, despite the bad weather, the ferry is leaving Fishguard for Rosslare on schedule. The wind howls around it, and the seas are choppy, but the vessel keeps inching ahead, upright, towards its destination.

"Aslan King went missing early on Saturday after suffering a suspected seizure Missing British man Aslan King has been found dead three days after he disappeared while camping, Australian police have confirmed. Mr King, 25, had been away with friends in a popular tourist region in Victoria when he was last seen on Saturday. His body was found about a kilometre (0.6 miles) away in a creek. Victoria Police said the cause of his death was under investigation. An illustrator from Brighton, Mr King relocated to Australia two weeks ago. His body was identified by two of his travelling partners, who were close friends, Victoria Police Sgt Danny Brown said. Authorities saidMr King had been with four friends when he hit his headon the ground about 02:00 local time on Saturday (15:00 GMT Friday) and suffered a suspected seizure. He then suddenly ran into surrounding bushland and may have been disoriented, police said. Search crews had scoured the coastal area near Princetown - not far from the Twelve Apostles tourist site - since Sunday. Officers searched for Mr King using a helicopter, horses, boats, motorcycles and sniffer dogs Police said Mr King's behaviour on Saturday had appeared to be out of character. ""This is why it made it so hard for us [to search] because there was no intelligence to suggest why he left or where he went,"" Sgt Danny Brown said on Tuesday, according toa report by the Herald Sun,external. ""His behaviour took everyone by surprise. By all accounts he was very fit, physically and mentally."" Officers said the search was difficult because of the thick vegetation, rocky clifftops and deep coastal waters in the region. Sgt Brown said Mr King's friends would be offered counselling. ""They have suffered a trauma as well by losing their friend in the beginning and the worry that goes with that,"" he said. ""And now to have two friends formally identify one of their own, one of their good close friends, and they have been friends for a lot of years, is traumatic on its own."" Neil Trotter, mayor of Corangamite Shire, said: ""We are deeply saddened by the death of Aslan. We feel for his family and friends."" He said his friends were ""understandably traumatised"", and that be believes Mr King's mother is en route to Australia. ""We feel for her having to do what no parent would ever wish to do,"" he added. The Foreign Office said it was in close contact with Australian police and was supporting Mr King's family. ""Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time,"" a spokeswoman said. Police said they would prepare a report for the coroner.

"Zoe Wanamaker has said too much of today's television is ""violent and nasty"". The actress appears in a new adaptation of Worzel Gummidge, which airs on BBC One over Christmas. ""I learnt on My Family how great it is when kids and adults can watch TV together,"" she told The Radio Times. ""It's very unusual and I think it's missed now. Something that catches everybody's imagination is to be lauded."" She continued: ""If you think of Harry Potter, for instance, it goes on forever and can be enjoyed by different generations. Too much television is violent and nasty. ""We've got that surrounding us in the world, so why should we have it on our televisions all the time as well? To have joy is always important, and to be desired."" The character of Worzel Gummidge was originally invented by Barbara Euphan Todd in her series of books that began in 1936. Jon Pertwee became famous for playing the straw-haired version in the ITV series which aired from 1979 to 1981. Mackenzie Crook writes, directs and stars in the new adaptation of Worzel Gummidge Mackenzie Crook, who writes, directs and stars in the new two-part adaptation of Worzel Gummidge, has kept many original elements from both the books and the TV series. The adaptation focuses on a walking, talking scarecrow, who lives on Scatterbrook Farm and makes friends with children called Susan and John. But Crook has invented his own adventures for them and the characters look entirely different. Thanks to prosthetics and CGI, the actor and director has designed a Worzel Gummidge who has a turnip for a head and butterflies living in his beard. ""I came from one of those BBC-centric households that frowned upon commercial TV, so I didn't watch it,"" Crook told The Radio Times, adding it was helpful not to have seen any previous versions of the character. ""I wanted to adapt the books without having the old series in my mind at all. The books are from the 1930s and are very dated, so there was a lot of room to do something completely fresh with it."" Michael Palin, Steve Pemberton, Rosie Cavaliero and Vicki Pepperdine also appear in the new adaptation alongside Crook and Wanamaker.

"This video can not be played Episode six sees him travelling at the request of the Queen to learn Welsh before the ceremony The prominence of Welsh in The Crown's new series is ""incredibly useful"" for the promotion of the language, a veteran campaigner has said. The latest series puts Welsh at the forefront of the Prince of Wales' time in Aberystwyth and Caernarfon ahead of his investiture in 1969. It also includes an episode focusing on the Queen's reaction to the Aberfan disaster. The Crownis one of Netflix's most successful series. ""Millions of people are going to be aware of the existence of the language, as a living language, for the first time ever,"" said Dafydd Iwan. Episode six, which covers the investiture, is called Tywysog Cymru - Welsh for Prince of Wales - and the Prince, portrayed by actor Josh O'Connor, is seen travelling to Aberystwyth at the request of the Queen to learn the language before the big ceremony. Mark Lewis Jones plays Dr Tedi Millward, who taught Welsh to the Prince of Wales On arrival at the university he meets his tutor Dr Tedi Millward, played by actor Mark Lewis Jones. Nia Roberts plays the role of Dr Millward's wife, Silvia Millward. The husband and wife are shown speaking naturally in Welsh in scenes at their home, with English subtitles on screen. Jones said the Prince and Dr Millward developed ""a respect for each other during this time even though they came from different worlds"". He said having Welsh spoken in the series ""means a massive amount"". ""This is so important, I think, that this language is heard throughout the world, with subtitles and no apology for that,"" he said. Charles' 50 years as Prince of Wales 'Not sensible' to replicate investiture Roberts said she hoped ""people will be pleased about how much Welsh there is in the episode"". ""I don't say anything in English in this episode and I think that was a really brave decision by The Crown producers,"" she added. Mark Lewis Jones and Tedi Millward on the set of The Crown in Aberystwyth Mr Iwan said: ""I didn't feel uncomfortable at all about the way they treated the Welsh language. Unfortunately, we have become used to an English treatment of the Welsh language - which has often been done in either a patronising or ignorant fashion."" He said the episode gave a ""fairly fair treatment of the language as a living language"". The Crown producers approached him to ask permission to use his song, Carlo, and to collect ""ephemera and posters"" for the episode. Olivia Colman plays the Queen in the series Posters of language pressure group Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg and one advertising Mr Iwan can be seen in the background of some scenes, something he admitted was ""a little strange"". ""They work within a historical, factual framework, and then use a bit of license to use their imagination,"" he said. While the historical opposition to the Prince's presence is shown as Charles arrives in Aberystwyth, and as his coach travels through Caernarfon on its way to the castle, Mr Iwan said he had expected to see more. But he added that Dr Millward's character did convey the dissatisfaction effectively. ""I would expect to see more of the conflict, and crowds protesting against the investiture. But they chose to focus on the language, which is interesting and a good thing for the Welsh language."" Nia Roberts said she hoped ""people will be pleased about how much Welsh there is in this episode"" The Prince of Wales met Dafydd Iwan earlier this year during his week-long visit to Wales Mr Iwan said he liked the series, which was released on Netflix on November 17. ""They could have focused on the great success of the investiture and portrayed the opposition as some kind of crazy bunch of students. But by portraying the other side in the character of Tedi Millward they have given it a bit more strength. ""In other words, it could have been a lot worse."" In real life thelanguage campaigner met Prince Charlesearlier this year. ""It is true to say that he was very, very aware of the Welsh language and the importance of the Welsh language, and the aspirations of Welsh nationalists,"" he said.

"The crash happened on Saturday A woman says she only discovered a car had crashed into the front of her house and was on fire when a police officer told her. Sylvia Walden, 61, slept through the early morning smash before being woken by the sound of shouting. Three people suffered serious injuries in the incident on the A857 at Barvas in Lewis on Saturday. The car was involved in a police chase. A 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with road traffic offences. He is due to appear in court next month. Sylvia Walden said her first concern was for her dog Ms Walden, 61, was not injured in the incident. She said: ""I believe it was about 01:30. I was fast asleep and didn't hear the car go into the house. People think it rather funny I didn't get woken up by that."" Ms Walden added: ""I could hear shouting. I got up, opened the door and there was a police officer with a torch saying 'hello, hello this is the police. You need to get out of the house'."" She said her first concern was for her dog, but was told by the police officer that it was fine before adding that there was a car on fire in her garden. ""It was up against the house on fire,"" she said. The car had ended up upright on its bonnet, leaning against Ms Walden's property. Three people were seriously injured in the crash The driver and two passengers of the blue Vauxhall Zafira were taken to Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway for treatment to serious injuries. The incident has been referred to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) by Police Scotland. It is thought the actions of officers in the lead-up to the crash will be looked into. A Pirc spokesman said: ""As is standard procedure, Police Scotland have referred to the Pirc the circumstances of an incident in the early hours of Saturday 23 November 2019 on the Isle of Lewis.

"A tweet from a US academic calling Indian food ""terrible"" has sparked a hot debate about cultural intolerance and racism in international cuisine. ""Indian food is terrible and we pretend it isn't,"" said international affairs professor Tom Nichols. Critics called his comment a tasteless generalisation. The remark led to a wider discussion of the immigrant experience and how many in the US have experienced racism in relation to food. Mr Nichols - who teaches at the US Naval War College in Rhode Island - posted his opinion after another Twitter user had asked for ""controversial food opinions"". Allow Twitter content?

"Yujing Zhang was arrested at Mar-a-Lago resort with multiple electronic devices A Chinese national has been sentenced to eight months in prison for trespassing at US President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. It was feared Yujing Zhang, a 33-year-old businesswoman from Shanghai, was a spy when she was arrested on 30 March. Initial tests showed she was carrying malware - but prosecutors later said this may have been a ""false positive"". Zhang, who maintains her innocence, has already served seven-and-a-half months in pre-trial detention. Chinese trespasser at Mar-a-Lago found guilty Woman 'with malware' held at Trump resort Trump switches residence from New York to Florida District Judge Roy Altman also sentenced her to two years of supervised release. Mr Trump was staying at Mar-a-Lago that weekend, but was elsewhere at the time of the incident. Zhang was convicted in September of bluffing her way into a restricted zone and lying to a federal officer. Because she was deemed a flight risk, she was remanded in custody until her sentencing. When Zhang entered Mar-a-Lago on 30 March, she told the resort's security staff she was there to use the swimming pool. Moments later, she changed her story and told club staff she was there to attend a United Nations event that it later transpired had been cancelled. A receptionist who knew the event was off then flagged her to Secret Service agents. Yujing Zhang At the time of her arrest, she was carrying multiple electronic devices, prompting fears that she was a spy. During the two-day trial in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Zhang dismissed her public counsel and  instead chose to represent herself - despite the judge's attempts to persuade her otherwise. Zhang often appeared uncomfortable speaking in English, and was also accused of pretending not to understand proceedings. But she insisted she was just trying to meet President Trump. ""I came to the property and just followed the instructions and asked where to go,"" she told the court. ""I don't think I am lying. I came to meet the president and family to just make friends.""

"This video can not be played Do you know when you're being manipulated? Black Friday sales offer few real deals with most goods cheaper or available for the same price at other times, according to consumer group Which?. It found that just four of 83 products they studied last year were cheaper during the Black Friday promotion. Among products cheaper outside of Black Friday were a tumble dryer, smart speaker, coffee maker and TV soundbar. Which? home products and services chief Natalie Hitchins said shoppers should do research and never impulse buy, The consumer group tracked the products on Black Friday last year - 23 November. The items, from retailers including Currys PC World, Amazon, and John Lewis, were monitored six months before the date and six months after. Just four products were cheaper on Black Friday than at other times of the year. Six in 10 items were cheaper or the same price on at least one day in the six months prior to last year's Black Friday event. When looking at the two-week period surrounding Black Friday itself - including sale prices in the week before and after - it was found that three quarters of products were cheaper or the same price in the six months after. Promotions included: A Samsung soundbar that Currys PC World offered at Â£299 on Black Friday, but which within a month dropped by Â£49 for at least five days A De'Longhi coffee machine priced at Â£399 by John Lewis on Black Friday. It was cheaper on at least 64 days in the six months after An Amazon Echo on offer at Â£54.99 on Amazon, but was cheaper on at least 13 occasions before Black Friday An Indesit tumble dryer from Currys PC World was Â£20 cheaper than its sale price of Â£199 just two weeks before Black Friday. While Which? did not find evidence that any of the retailers were breaking the law, the consumer group said it showed that so-called deals may not be all they are claimed. Ms Hitchins said: ""We have repeatedly shown that deals touted by retailers on Black Friday are not as good as they seem. Time-limited sales can be a good opportunity to bag a bargain, but don't fall for the pressure tactics around Black Friday. ""Our investigation indicates that this popular shopping event is all hype and there are few genuine discounts,"" she said. The shops can get very busy Retailers rejected suggestions consumers were being misled and said that shoppers were getting some of the best deals of the year. Amazon said: """"The claim from Which? with regard to Echo is false and we have made this clear in our response to them. Amazon.co.uk customers were not able to buy the Echo (2nd gen) device cheaper before Black Friday 2018."" It added that its Black Friday sale was about ""thousands of deals on a huge selection of products from every category across the site, at a time of year when we know saving money is important to our customers"". Currys PC World told Which?: ""Our customers tell us that they appreciate the increased choice during Black Friday where we have the most deals on at once. When we launched our Black Friday event last year, 40% of those products were the lowest price they had ever been."" And John Lewis said: ""In addition to the variety of offers we have in-store and online during the Black Friday period, our commitment to being 'Never Knowingly Undersold' means that we continuously monitor and match the prices of our high street competitors throughout the year."" Which?'s advice for consumers during this year's sales bonanza is: Don't impulse buy. Work out what you need or want to buy and how much you're prepared to spend before you start shopping in the sales Don't panic. Don't worry about missing out on a good offer as Which? research has revealed that you could be better off waiting until after Black Friday anyway Find out about offers in advance. Sign up to your favourite retailers' newsletters for inside tips, or check their social media pages ahead of the sales for any clues    or hints to what will be on offer Look at the price on previous days, using websites such as PriceRunner, to make sure you really are getting a good deal Don't always trust reviews you find online as a recent Which? investigation found shoppers risk being misled by fake online product reviews.
