"A car was parked across the pavement in the street where the bodies were found A woman aged 28 and a four-year-old boy have been found dead in a house in Suffolk. A member of the public reported finding the bodies at the property on Park Avenue, Newmarket, at 18:00 BST on Friday. An eyewitness told theNewmarket Journal,externala woman came out of a property ""in tears"". Detectives continue to investigate the circumstances of the deaths and said the next of kin had been informed. The force has appealed for anyone who may have seen or heard anything in the area during the day to contact them. Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths, a spokesman for Suffolk Constabulary added. Police were alerted when a member of the public found the bodies A semi-detached two-storey house was cordoned off and a Volkswagen Golf hatchback was left parked across the pavement behind police tape. One neighbour, who lives opposite, said: ""I came home last night about 20:00 BST and there were feds (police) everywhere. ""They were here all night, I think, and forensics were going in and out."" He said he knew the woman by sight but had only spoken to her once. ""She, like everyone I suppose, kept herself to herself,"" adding that the boy ""was always smiling every time I saw him."" Police carried out a forensic search after they were alerted about the deaths Another couple, who also live on Park Avenue, said they had seen the boy playing in the nearby park. ""There are a lot of rented houses on this street, so a lot of people come and go,"" they said. An elderly resident added: ""I've been here for 60 years and it's quite a quiet street. ""Very sad though, isn't it. Tragic."" The street remains cordoned off by police.

"England's top doctor says practitioners offering cosmetic procedures should have training to help them protect vulnerable clients from ""quick fixes"". Prof Stephen Powis believes providers should be officially registered and trained to spot people with body-image or other mental-health issues. NHS England says only 100 out of 1,000 practitioners are currently registered. And a charity says procedures such as Botox can have a damaging effect on the mental health of young people. Prof Powis, medical director at NHS England, wants professionals who provide procedures such as fillers and injections to join the newJoint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners,external. He says too many providers are ""operating as a law unto themselves"". He welcomed the move by some practitioners to undertake training on how suitable their customers are for cosmetic anti-aging treatments, calling it a ""major step forward"". But he said the numbers were still too low. And he warned clients that they still needed to vet firms properly before havingcosmetic procedures,external, which include botulinum toxin injections - such as Botox - fillers, skin peels, lasers and hair restoration surgery. Prof Powis said: ""We know that appearance is the one of the things that matters most to young people, and the bombardment of idealised images and availability of quick-fix procedures is helping fuel a mental-health and anxiety epidemic."" But the NHS could not be ""left to pick up the pieces"", he added. ""We need all parts of society to show a duty of care and take action to prevent avoidable harm."" By registering with the council, a new professional body, practitioners will agree to undergo online training on: recognising the signs and symptoms of vulnerability and mental ill health the psychology of appearance telling customers where to get help if they show signs of being vulnerable More mental health checks before Superdrug botox Surgeons warn over Botox on High Street Campaign to tackle 'botched' cosmetic care 'I had daily offers of free cosmetic procedures' Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental-health condition which can cause people extreme distress over their appearance and make them more likely to turn to quick-fix procedures, which do not help the underlying psychological condition. It affects around one in 50 people. Kitty Wallace, from the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, said: ""Cosmetic procedures like Botox are now widely available on the high street, are putting people at risk and can have a damaging effect on the mental health of young people. ""It's great to see the NHS and professionals leading the sea change but we now need all parts of society to change their attitudes and take action to protect vulnerable individuals.""

According to the country's interior minister, a Libyan court has agreed to return Hashem Abedi to the UK. Mr Abedi - who is wanted in relation to the deaths of 22 people - was taken into custody in Tripoli shortly after the May 2017 terror attack. But fighting on the outskirts has been blamed for delays in the process. The Interior Minister of Libya's UN-backed government, Fathi Bashagha, told the BBC the court had agreed to extradite Mr Abedi to the UK because he is a British citizen. But a week after the ruling, he said, the capital came under attack by forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar, a commander from Eastern Libya. Hashem Abedi's extradition has been delayed. Mr Bashaga said Libya was ""awaiting the procedure"" which would allow it to hand Mr Abedi over to the UK. But ""because of the war, everything is stopped"", he said, and the extradition would not happen until fighting had ended. ""We are paying all our attention to how to push back Haftar's militia attacking Tripoli. This is important for us now."" Orla Guerin, BBC News, in Tripoli The sound of distant shelling and artillery fire has become familiar in Tripoli once again.  For the past three weeks forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar have been blocked at the outskirts of the city.  The military strongman from Eastern Libya has not been strong enough to take the capital. But there are fears that his offensive could deteriorate into all-out war, and allow the so-called Islamic State to regroup in Libya. Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha, shares these concerns. He said the attack on Tripoli was ""the ignition of a civil war"" and that IS fighters from Iraq and Syria could take advantage of the chaos to enter Libya. ""This is the best time,"" he told the BBC. ""ISIS always look for any conflicts or fighting and they come immediately.  It will be very difficult to fight them again."" About 700 Libyan fighters were killed in the operation to drive IS from its coastal stronghold in the city of Sirt, in 2016. The minister warned that if IS fighters can re establish themselves in Libya they can travel with ease to their target - Europe. The minister insisted that the prison where Abedi is being held is secure, despite the conflict threatening the capital. More than 250 people have been killed since the offensive began on 4 April . The Manchester Arena was attacked on 22 May 2017 He accused the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, of abandoning Tripoli in its hour of need by withdrawing British military and embassy staff from the city when it came under attack. Relations between the countries had been ""damaged"" by this, he said, and it would be difficult to rebuild them in a short space of time. The Foreign Office has confirmed all remaining British staff were withdrawn from Tripoli due to the worsening violence. It said it maintains full diplomatic relations with Libya and is in contact with the government. British staff have been withdrawn from Tripoli due to the worsening violence.

"Elon Musk has not hidden his contempt for the markets regulator in the US The US financial markets regulator has resolved its row with Tesla chief executive Elon Musk over his use of Twitter. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Mr Musk of breaching a court order to not share information which could impact the financial markets, without pre-approval. Earlier this month a judge ordered the SEC, Tesla and Mr Musk to come to an agreement, rather than sending the matter through the courts. That agreement,made public today by the SEC,external, adds greater clarity to the restrictions on Mr Muskâs communications, on Twitter or elsewhere. It states that Mr Musk may not, without approval of Teslaâs legal team, share information about: The company's financial condition, statements, or results, including company earnings or guidance on its financial future; Any potential or proposed mergers, acquisitions or related business deals; Production numbers or sales or delivery numbers that differ from what the companyâs official statements have already stated; Or new or proposed business lines that differ from what the firm does already, which the SEC characterized as ""vehicles, transportation, and sustainable energy productsâ; Details on regulatory findings that have not already been made public. Neither Mr Musk, nor Tesla, has yet commented on the agreement. Mr Musk found himself the subject of the SECâs ire after tweeting, last August, that he planned to make Tesla a private company and that he had the âfunding securedâ to do so. That message - later characterised as being a joke - ended up being extremely costly. US authorities ordered Tesla and Mr Musk to each pay a $20m (Â£15.2m) fine and forced Mr Musk to relinquish his role as chairman for three years. Mr Musk and Tesla also agreed to implement new oversight on the 47-year-oldâs Twitter habit. However, in February he tweeted that Tesla would make âmake around 500kâ cars in 2019. The SEC argued that this constituted a previously undisclosed projection in breach of the agreement. Mr Musk later added a clarification, and argued that the numbers were already public. He then said: ""Something is broken with SEC oversight."" It was not the first time Mr Musk has displayed his disapproval of the regulator. ""I want to be clear,â he told CBS 60 Minutes in December. ""I do not respect the SEC."" News of the latest settlement saw Teslaâs stock rise modestly in after-hours trading on Friday. However, the price has dropped sharply this week due to Tesla postingworse-than-expected earnings on Thursday. _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Apple Watch was the most accurate, according to the Which? study Some fitness trackers are inaccurately measuring running distance, according to research from the consumer watchdog Which? It tested 118 trackers using a treadmill to complete the distance of a marathon  - 26.2 miles (42km). It found that the least reliable was the Garmin Vivosmart 4, which underestimated the distance by 10.8 miles â meaning the researcher actually ran 37 miles. Garmin said it was because that particular tracker did not contain GPS. It described the Vivosmart 4 as an âall-round smart fitness trackerâ and suggested that marathon runners use its Forerunner range which is GPS-enabled. Of the eight Apple models involved in the test, the Apple Watch series 1 was the most accurate, over-estimating the distance by 1%, while the series 3 overestimated by 13% - stating that the runner had completed the marathon distance after 22.8 miles. âOur tests have found a number of models from big-name brands that canât be trusted when it comes to measuring distance, so before you buy, make sure you do your research to find a model that you can rely on,â said Natalie Hitchins, head of home product and services at Which? Other results for the number of miles reached before the tracker recorded the official marathon distance included: Samsung Gear S2 â 36.2 miles Xiaomi Amazfit Bip â 34 miles Huawei Watch 2 Sport â 18.9 miles A Huawei spokesman told the BBC âindividual runner variancesâ could have affected the test results. âWith regards to running indoors, as this particular test was carried out on a treadmill,"" he said. ""The algorithm of Huawei Watch 2 Sport calculates the userâs stride length from the acceleration sensor data while running at different speeds."" Testing devices in the real world, rather than on treadmills, would provide more accurate results, experts said In January 2019 researchers at Aberystwyth University foundthat all the trackers they tested overestimated the number of calories burned during activity. Gavin Taitt is a regular middle-distance runner from Earlston, in the Scottish Borders, who also coaches others. He said he and his group use a combination of Garmin Forerunner watches and the social fitness network Strava to measure and share results. âThe watches are quite expensive but have good feedback,â he said. âAccuracy is very important.â Another expert agreed that the calibrated treadmill test was not the best method because all the devices would have had to rely on step-counting algorithms rather than GPS (for those which had it) to calculate distance. ""This is a real shame as a real world (on-road) test would have been more useful for consumers,""  said Dr Dale Esliger, senior lecturer in physical activity and health at Loughborough University. He added that when investing in a tracker, people should think about which metric is going to be most useful to them in terms of measuring their progress. ""Step-counting has become a key metric for many; however, devices are now coming with heart-rate monitoring capability which relates to activity intensity and provides insight into cardiovascular health,"" he explained. ""In our research, this [heart rate] is the metric that seems to be the potent driver for behaviour change.""

"Bolton Wanderers were relegated from the Championship on 19 April Bolton's game against Brentford on Saturday has been called off by the English Football League after Bolton's players said they would not play until they receive the wages they are owed. The match was called off 16 hours before it was scheduled to kick off. None of the March wages owed to the Wanderers' players have been paid. ""As a result of these disappointing developments, the league has been forced to suspend Saturday's fixture,"" an EFL statement said. ""The club [Bolton] is now deemed to be guilty of misconduct and will be referred to an Independent Disciplinary Commission. ""The EFL Board will now consider the matter of determining whether the fixture will be played or not."" In a club statement, Bolton said they ""would like to apologise for the inconvenience this will cause"". Brentford's squad travelled north from London on Friday in preparation for the Championship game, which was due to be played at the University of Bolton Stadium. Bolton's relegation to League One was confirmed on 19 April when they lost to Aston Villa. Earlier on Friday, Wanderers' squad had issued a joint statement, saying the financial situation was ""creating mental, emotional and financial burdens for people through no fault of their own"". They added that it was ""placing great strain on ourselves and our families"". The players also apologised to supporters for what ""may be seen as drastic action"" but stressed the decision had ""not been taken lightly"" and that they had taken the stance ""with deep regret"". The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said on Friday afternoon that it supported the players' actions, adding they had shown ""great patience and loyalty"" to the club, but had ""reached a point where action is necessary"". ""The PFA has been working with the club since the beginning of the season and we have done all we can to resolve this issue, including giving Bolton Wanderers a substantial loan to cover players' salaries in December,"" the statement added. Earlier this month, Bolton's players refused to train for 48 hours in support of club staff after March wages went unpaid. Full-time non-playing staff eventually received their March wages after a delay. On Friday night - before the EFL called the game off -prospective new owner Laurence Bassinihad said he would work to ensure Saturday's fixture went ahead. He told Sky Sports News that the players' wages would be paid and that he would speak to the EFL in an attempt to find a resolution.

"The victims, both in their 20s, managed to escape their captor following a struggle in Osborne Road, Watford Two women were dragged into a car and raped after being ""randomly selected"" by the same attacker, police have said. The first victim was abducted from a street in Chingford, north London, early on Thursday, while the second was captured 12 hours later in Edgware - more than 10 miles away. Both women, who are in their 20s, managed to escape their captor following a struggle in Osborne Road, Watford, the Metropolitan Police said. The Met has appealed for information. It said the women made their escape from the attacker, described as a white man of muscular build, at about 14:30 BST on Thursday. Det Ch Insp Katherine Goodwin said: ""This was a terrifying ordeal for both women. At this stage there is nothing to suggest either victims were specifically targeted for any reason, but both appear to have been selected at random. ""A number of active leads are being followed up urgently including reviewing CCTV footage and forensic analysis."" Ms Goodwin said her team was also working closely with officers in Hertfordshire to establish potential links the suspect might have to the area. She added: ""Stranger attacks like this are extremely rare. That being said, I would urge everyone in these areas to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to police immediately via 999.""

"This video can not be played Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke to the BBC Sri Lanka's prime minister has told the BBC he was ""out of the loop"" when it came to intelligence warnings ahead of the deadly Easter Sunday bombings. Ranil Wickremesinghe said that crucial information about any potential danger in the country was not passed to him. The subsequent attacks, which claimed at least 250 lives, exposed a massive intelligence failure by Sri Lanka. The country's police chief and top defence ministry official have both resigned over the bombings. But Mr Wickremesinghe argued the fact that he was unaware of the warnings meant he did not need to step down from his position. ""If we had any inkling, and we had not taken action, I would have handed in my resignation immediately,"" he said, adding: ""But what do you do when you are out of the loop?"" The apparent lapse in communication has refocused attention on the infighting between the country's two most powerful men, Mr Wickremesinghe and the president, Maithripala Sirisena. Relations deteriorated to such an extent that last October,Mr Sirisena sacked Mr Wickremesinghe. He was reinstated in December following rulings by Sri Lanka's highest courts. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? The victims of the Easter Sunday bombings US woman wrongly identified as suspect President Sirisena, meanwhile, has told reporters that Sri Lankan intelligence services believed around 130 suspects linked to the Islamic State (IS) group were in the country and that police were hunting 70 who were still at large. Police later discovered what they believed was the attackers' safe house in the eastern city of Sammanthurai. An ""Islamic State banner [and] IS uniform similar to the video that was released by alleged suicide bombers"" were found inside the building, a police spokesman told the BBC. About 150 sticks of dynamite and 100,000 ball bearings were also found during the raid. There have also been reports of a shootout between security forces and a group of alleged suspects in a separate location. Sri Lankan authorities have blamed a local Islamist extremist group, National Tawheed Jamath, for the attacks, although IS has also said it was behind them. Mr Sirisena also confirmed that the attackers' alleged ringleader, Zahran Hashim, a radical preacher, died at the Shangri-La hotel in the capital, Colombo. He said Hashim led the attack on the popular tourist hotel, accompanied by a second bomber identified as ""Ilham"". It was one of six hotels and churches targeted by the group. This video can not be played Zahran Hashim's sister condemns his actions Hashim appeared in a video released by IS in which seven men - thought to be some of the bombers - pledged allegiance to the group. Hashim was the only one to show his face. It is not clear whether Hashim had been in direct contact with IS or if he had simply pledged allegiance to the group. Sister of 'ringleader' deplores attack Sri Lankan officials revised the death toll from the bombings down by about 100 on Thursday, to 253, blaming the difficulty in identifying body parts at bomb scenes. But the move raised questions over how the previous estimate could have been so inaccurate. The country's Catholic Church has announced the suspension of all church services.

Rights activists say the Ahmadi community, as foreign Muslims, could face reprisal attacks. The Sri Lankan government has said it will search schools, in one of a series of announcements designed to address public anxiety in the aftermath of the attacks. A state of emergency, declared on Monday, has continued, allowing police to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders. Sri Lanka's finance minister, Mangala Samaraweera said on Friday there were fears the country's lucrative tourism industry could see a fall in arrivals of up to 30% this year - resulting in a loss of $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn). Nine people are suspected of carrying out the attacks. Two of the bombers are said to have been the sons of spice trader Mohammad Yusuf Ibrahim, one of Sri Lanka's richest men. Mr Ibrahim was detained and questioned after the attacks. One of his sons was reportedly the bomber at the city's Shangri-La hotel - alongside Hashim, according to President Sirisena. The other son reportedly targeted the restaurant at the high-end Cinnamon Grand hotel, a short distance away. A CCTV image shows a bomber approaching St Sebastian's church in Negombo A woman said to be a wife of one of Mr Ibrahim's sons detonated explosives during a police raid at the family's villa on Sunday. Several people, including children and three police officers, were reportedly killed in that blast. According to the Sri Lankan government, most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and had come from ""middle- or upper middle-class"" families. Sri Lanka attacks: Who were the bombers?

"This video can not be played Debenhams chief financial officer Rachel Osborne Debenhams has named 22 of the 50 stores it plans to close as part of a plan by new owners to revive the department store chain. The retailer says the store closures will start next year and 1,200 staff will be affected by the first phase. Stores in Canterbury, Guildford, Wolverhampton and Kirkcaldy are among those earmarked for closure. Earlier this month lenders to Debenhams took control in a deal which wiped out the investments of shareholders. Debenhams: What went wrong? Debenhams boss steps down Debenhams: 'New' Wolverhampton branch to shut Once the 50 store closures are complete Debenhams will have around 116 stores in the UK. Debenhams also reported results for the 26 weeks to March. Sales at its UK stores fell 7.4%, which it blamed on fewer shoppers heading to the High Street. Debenhams is the UK's biggest department store chain and its origins can be traced back to 1778 and a drapers store in central London. However, industry experts said the retailer expanded the number of its stores at the wrong time - in the 2000s when customers were switching to online sales. The expansion left the company with debts and expensive leases. The firm's financial situation deteriorated and last month Debenhams agreed a deal with its lenders, who provided Â£200m of fresh funding. Those lenders then took control of Debenhams earlier this month by buying it out of administration. That deal wiped out the investments of shareholders, including the stake of Mike Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct. Mr Ashley had wanted to buy Debenhams and become chief executive, but his approaches were turned down. The new owners have now announced their store closure programme under a process known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which also allows them to renegotiate rents at stores that remain open. Of the department stores which remain open, 39 will stick to their current rental rates for the duration of their leases. For the other stores the company is aiming to secure rental reductions of between 25% and 50%. Terry Duddy, Debenhams executive chairman, said: ""Debenhams has a clear strategy and a bright future, but in order for the business to prosper, we need to restructure the group's store portfolio and its balance sheet, which are not appropriate for today's much changed retail environment. ""Our priority is to save as many stores and as many jobs as we can, while making the business fit for the future."" Debenhams is just one of many High Street chains to run into trouble in recent years. The collapse of BHS in 2016 resulted in more than 160 stores closing, and House of Fraser has been shutting stores after being bought out of administration last year. Marks and Spencer is in the process of closing 100 stores by 2020. Crowds gathered in October 2017 when Debenhams opened in Wolverhampton's Mander Centre In October 2017, locals in Wolverhampton queued up for Debenhams' grand opening in their city's refurbished Mander shopping centre. Today, less than 18 months later, it was on the list of stores to shut by 2020. Debenhams became a replacement anchor tenant for the Mander Centre following BHS' demise. Now it will shut up shop too. Debenhams' arrival at the refurbished shopping centre came a decade after it set its sights on the West Midlands city. An attempt in 2006 to set up in a Â£300m mall was eventually sunk by the global financial crisis. For Wolverhampton it isanother blow for a city centrethat has been at the mercy of changes in retail all over the country, with the loss of the likes of BHS and Woolworths. Rob Young, business reporter The plan to shut 22 stores and reduce the rent bill on dozens more is likely to prove contentious. Many of those stores could see reductions of 50% - that will be extremely painful for landlords. They are being asked to back the move. But we can expect many of them to come out fighting. After a series of these restructurings on the high street, commercial landlords have had enough. The use of so-called company voluntary arrangements is increasingly controversial. Landlords argue other creditors do not take their fair share of the pain. Three-quarters of the retailer's creditors will have to approve the plan. People close to the process say it's by no means a done deal. Are you employed at one of the Debenhams stores set to close in 2020?

"Demonstrators attended a vigil in memory of the victims of the serial killer Cyprus has been left stunned after a man confessed to killing seven women and girls, all of foreign descent, in what is thought to be the island's first serial killing. The authorities are facing accusations of not fully investigating when the women were first reported missing. So far, the bodies of three Filipino women have been found and two lakes are being combed for further victims. The suspect, a 35-year-old Greek-Cypriot army officer, is in custody. Crime rates are low in Cyprus and violence against women on this scale has not been seen outside of wartime. It has a population of about 890,000. The Mediterranean island is split between a northern part run by a Turkish Cypriot government and the internationally recognised government in the south run by Greek Cypriots. The search is focused southwest of the capital of Nicosia. Cyprus country profile In a statement, President Nicos Anastasiades said he was ""shocked by the revelation of so many shameful murders against innocent foreign women and young children"". News website Kathimerini Cyprus issued a letter of apology to the victims' families and said it was a ""crime against the country, carried out by an assassin"" but ""perpetrated by a state and society constantly developing xenophobic tendencies and racist behaviours"". Earlier this month, the bodies of two women, Marry Rose Tiburcio, 38, and Arian Palanas Lozano, 28, both from the Philippines, were discovered. They had been reported missing last year. After tracking Ms Tiburcio's online messages, an army officer was arrested on suspicion of murder. Fire-fighters and investigators are searching the Red Lake in Mitsero using robotic equipment to navigate its toxic water He at first denied killing a third Filipino woman, Maricar Valtez Arquiola, 31, who has been missing since late 2017, but then changed his testimony and confessed to the murder of seven women and girls over the past three years. Following the arrest, the suspected murderer showed investigators to a well at an army firing range where the unidentified body of a woman of Nepalese or Indian descent was discovered. Authorities are now scouring two lakes in the south for the bodies of a Romanian mother and her young daughter. A search is also underway for Ms Tiburcio' six-year-old daughter, who the suspect has also confessed to killing. The authorities have been accused of not taking the cases seriously due to the women being of foreign descent. The main opposition party, AKEL, called on the police chief and justice minister to resign. ""Unprecedented indifference was shown simply because these people were not of Cypriot origin but came from foreign countries,"" said AKEL leader Andros Kyprianou. Doros Polycarpou, the director of Kisa, a migrant and refugee support group, told Reuters that Cyprus operated a ""two-tier system"" in which ""some non-Cypriots did not enjoy the same rights as locals"". Migrant workers in Cyprus stand in solidarity, holding a banner that reads ""Where are you?"" ""We had repeatedly said that migrants and refugees to our country are particularly vulnerable,"" she said. Cypriot police have said they will investigate the handling of the case. Maria Mappouridou, a Cypriot chemical engineer, set up a Facebook event for the vigil in response to the killings. She said 1500 attended. The organiser said the women's deaths have ""come as a shock"" and brought the plight of migrant women into the public consciousness. ""I'm afraid to say we didn't notice these women who lived here and work for us and came here for a better life,"" she said. ""We haven't heard anything about them, but the question is have we asked?"" Two women hug at the public vigil in memory of the serial killer's victims ""They have always been dismissed as lower rank because of the jobs they commonly have,"" one protester said, pointing out that neither the government nor the church had organised any days of mourning dedicated to the victims. Christina Skarpari said she was at the protest because she was angry about being governed by a system which failed to protect women and society as a whole. ""The lack of justice, coupled with the lack of accountability and insufficient answers of the government for these persons' deaths, make people in my community feel exasperated,"" she said. ""The lack of systemic approach when it comes to local investigations, women's rights, profound racism, sexism and lack of social justice as a whole, is representative of a greater loophole in Cyprus and a corrupt mentality which is very much part of the norm,"" Ms Skarpari added.

"Flybmi had a fleet of Embraer jets The regional airline FlyBMI owed Â£37m when it collapsed. Most creditors, including passengers and suppliers who have lost out, may receive only 1%  of their claims, say administrators. The airline cancelled all flights and filed for administration in February, blaming spikes in fuel and carbon costs and uncertainty over Brexit. Many of the airline's routes, aircraft and former staff have been taken on by its sister airline company, LoganAir. When FlyBMI filed for administration, passengers were due Â£3.8m under EU compensation rules, according to a statement of affairs from the company's directors. Passengers whose flights were cancelled were told to contact their travel agents or insurance or credit card companies for a refund. Rolls Royce was owed Â£2.25m for a servicing contract, the statement of affairs says. FlyBMI ran services for mainly business passengers between UK regional airports and continental European cities, including Munich, Frankfurt and Brussels. Stansted Airport and Bristol Airport were owed money by FlyBMI, according to a list of unsecured creditors to the airline. The carrier operated 17 aircraft, 14 of which were ""detained"" after the administration ""due to unpaid navigation service charges,"" according to the administrators. Parent company Airline Investments Limited (AIL) said the company made a loss of Â£6.8m in the year to 31 March 2018 and losses deepened during the rest of 2018. ""The company was also becoming increasingly concerned about the potential impact of Brexit and the ability to conduct intra-European flying whilst operating under a UK Operators Certificate,"" say the administrators BDO. BDO said FlyBMI's trading was worse than forecast at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019 when FlyBMI's ultimate owners, the aviation entrepreneurs Peter and Stephen Bond, said they would stop funding FlyBMI. AIL said more than Â£40m had been invested in FlyBMI in the six years before its collapse. Many of FlyBMI's former routes, including those from Newcastle and Aberdeen, are now operated by LoganAir. The Scottish airline has also taken over several ""key"" contracts that FlyBMI used to operate, including one for Airbus and the route between Derry and London Stansted. ""Any airline is free to start routes as they see fit, and indeed one other airline has already announced services on a former BMI route too"", LoganAir's managing director Jonathan Hinkles told the BBC in February. Fifteen aircraft which carried FlyBMI livery are currently, or will soon be, operated by LoganAir. About 130 former FlyBMI pilots and cabin crew now work for LoganAir. Airport landing slots controlled by FlyBMI were ""transferred"" to LoganAir before administrators were appointed ""preventing the airports seeking to cancel them"", BDO says, adding that LoganAir is trying to sell the slots. The two airlines used to ""trade as sister airlines with their own management teams and brand identities but taking advantage of commercial, operational and procurement synergies"", according to AIL.

"This video can not be played Sturgeon: 'Scotland needs protection from Brexit and Boris' Nicola Sturgeon has refused to say whether she would call off her push for a second independence referendum by 2021 if Brexit does not take place. The first minister is seeking a vote on independence before the next Scottish election if the UK leaves the EU. Asked on Friday what would happen if Brexit was halted, she said she would set out her views at that stage. Ms Sturgeon said she would not ""narrow Scotland's options"" because the country needed ""maximum flexibility"". She suggested that ""the way Scotland has been treated"" could be grounds for another independence referendum - as could Boris Johnson becoming prime minister. Ms Sturgeon was speaking to BBC Scotland ahead of the SNP's conference, which opens in Edinburgh on Saturday. UK government 'will not grant indyref2 consent' Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021 The UK government has already ruled out granting permission for a referendum before the next Holyrood election in May 2021. And the Scottish Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon's latest comments showed that she ""wants to press on with her break-up plans come hell or high water"". The SNP's manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood election stated that another vote on independence should be held if there was a ""material change of circumstance"", such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. However, Ms Sturgeon told the Good Morning Scotland programme that ""many people would say there's been a big material change of circumstances already in the way Scotland has been treated over the past few years"". Boris Johnson is seen by many as the favourite to succeed Theresa May as prime minister The first minister, who has also called for another Brexit referendum, said she could only currently make plans on the basis that the UK is still going to leave the EU. She added: ""If that doesn't happen then I guess we'll be having another discussion and I'll give my views on what we do then."" She later told BBC Scotland's political editor, Brian Taylor, that she was ""not going to narrow Scotland's options"" because ""we could be facing Boris Johnson as prime minister within the next few months"". ""Scotland needs to have maximum flexibility and maximum room for manoeuvre to get itself onto the right path,"" the first minister argued. ""I think Boris Johnson as prime minister would send not just people in Scotland, but many people across the whole of the UK, into utter despair. ""Boris Johnson, not single-handedly but largely, is responsible for the complete mess the UK finds itself in."" David Lidington has ruled out permission for an independence referendum being granted in the next two years Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the country is taken out of the EU. The first minister intends to have Scottish Parliament legislation that could pave the way for a referendum in place by the end of this year. But she has also made clear that Westminster's approval would be needed before any referendum is actually held to ensure its legal status is ""beyond doubt"". Ms Sturgeon has not yet made a fresh request for this consent - but has indicated that she plans to do so either at the end of this year or the beginning of 2020. Will indyref2 happen before May 2021? Theresa May's deputy, David Lidington,explicitly ruled out that requestbeing granted when he spoke to the media during a visit to Glasgow on Thursday. Mr Lidington said there was ""no evidence"" of a surge in support for independence since the last referendum in 2014, which he argued had settled the issue for a generation. Ms Sturgeon responded by saying Mr Lidington was a member of a UK government which might not be in office ""in a matter of weeks"". She added: ""They're not exactly known for consistency. This is the UK government who said the UK would definitely be out of the the EU on 29 March. ""They are also a government frankly that it is impossible to have a meaningful negotiation with. They have zero authority and zero credibility which is why I decided not to bother trying to negotiate with them at the moment."" Some pro-independence campaigners have been calling on Ms Sturgeon to press ahead with a new referendum Responding to her comments, Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins said: ""This is proof that Nicola Sturgeon wants to press on with her break-up plans come hell or high water. ""Whether there's a hard Brexit, a soft Brexit or no Brexit at all - the first minister will make this all about independence. ""The voting public saw through this scam last time and will do so again. It's a shameless approach - Nicola Sturgeon isn't even pretending to care about Brexit any more."" Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45% in the 2014 referendum - with opinion polls suggesting support for independence remains largely unchanged five years later. Ms Sturgeon initially called for a second referendum after the Brexit vote in 2016, butput her plans on holdafter the SNP lost 21 seats in the general election the following year. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum will need a transfer of power from Westminster The first minister said she wants to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the country is taken out of the EU. She hopes a ""framework Bill"" - Scottish Parliament legislation setting the rules for any future referendum - will be in place by the end of this year. She told the Scottish Parliament: ""We do not need a transfer of power such as a Section 30 order to pass such a framework Bill, though we would need it to put beyond doubt or challenge our ability to apply the bill to an independence referendum."" The first minister also predicted: ""If we are successful in further growing the support and the demand for independence, then no UK government will be able to stop the will of the people or stop that will being expressed."" She announced she wants cross-party talks with opposition leaders about Holyrood's powers, while a Citizens' Assembly will be set up to examine wider questions on Scotland's future. Writing in the Scotsman newspaper after Ms Sturgeon's announcement, SNP veteran Kenny MacAskill - the former justice secretary - claimed that independence supporters who now expect an immediate referendum are ""delusional"". He also accused the SNP of ""fiddling while Rome burns"" and argued that Ms Sturgeon's ""heavily caveated"" statement ""confirmed what many have long thought, which is that she's not planning to try for independence before 2021"". But Ms Sturgeon denies that her statement was an attempt to appease independence activists who want a referendum sooner rather than later, and has insisted that: ""The timing is not to do with the SNP conference.""

McKee funeral priest confronts politicians During the funeral service, Fr Magill had commended Northern Ireland's political leaders for ""standing together"" in the Creggan area of Londonderry on Good Friday to attend a vigil for Ms McKee. However, he then added: ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" The British and Irish governments announced on Friday a new talks process, aimed at restoring devolution in Northern Ireland, would begin on 7 May. Sinn FÃ©in collapsed the coalition government in January 2017 in protest at the DUP's handling of a green energy scandal. Since then, several rounds of talks have failed, with the two parties failing to find a compromise on a number of outstanding issues including Irish language rights and the legalisation of same-sex marriage. This video can not be played ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" Fr Magill said politicians were slow to stand up when his words were applauded in Belfast's St Anne's Cathedral. ""The people, in a sense, really put the pressure on in the cathedral to stand,"" the priest said. ""Obviously the politicians realised; 'Oh goodness, everybody behind us is standing, we need to move,' and they literally moved because people had moved."" DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was ""a moment of great clarity during the service"", but acknowledged there were difficult issues to be discussed. Speaking on the Today programme, Mrs Foster repeated her call for a parallel talks process. ""We have been wanting an Assembly up and running since its collapse and we have said again this week that we want the Assembly set up immediately,"" she said. ""We haven't blocked anything. We have been engaging in talks but what I'm saying is that these are difficult issues - and they are for people in Northern Ireland."" Politicians from across the UK and Ireland, including Arlene Foster, Mary-Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill, attended the funeral of Lyra McKee Sinn FÃ©in MLA Conor Murphy said the British government had to come forward with ""rigorous impartiality, to try and get a process together which can address the outstanding issues"". He also said a parallel talks process was ""unlikely to work"". ""We had a 10-year parallel process, if you like, where issues like same sex marriage, Irish language and legacy rights were being presented and pressed and the DUP used various devices to block those,"" he said. The British and Irish governments are to review progress in the negotiations at the end of May. Fr Magill's interview will be broadcast as part ofThe Andrew Marr Showon BBC One at 09:00 BST on Sunday, 28 April. McKee priest says politicians had to listen.

"Sadio Mane has scored 10 goals in his last 10 appearances for Liverpool at Anfield Liverpool once again put the pressure back on Manchester City as they returned to the top of the Premier League with an emphatic win over Huddersfield at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp's side are now two points clear of the reigning champions, who have a game in hand, with Naby Keita's goal after 15 seconds setting the tone for a dominant display. Winning possession high in Huddersfield territory, the Guinea midfielder swept a close-range effort into the bottom left corner from Mohamed Salah's pass to record the Reds' quickest goal in a Premier League match. It was also Liverpool's 100th goal in all competitions this term, and they doubled their lead when Sadio Mane glanced Andrew Robertson's superb cross into the bottom right corner. Salah then lobbed Town goalkeeper Jonas Lossl on the stroke of half-time to deliver a third after running on to Trent Alexander-Arnold's ball forward. While Huddersfield twice went close to scoring through Juninho Bacuna and Karlan Grant, it remained largely one-way traffic after the break. Salah and Keita both went close to their second goals of the evening before Mane headed in his second from Jordan Henderson's cross to briefly become the Premier League's joint-top scorer, on 20 goals. However his Egyptian team-mate Salah regained that honour, converting from another Robertson delivery in the closing stages to move on to 21 goals, sealing a fine team performance. Liverpool have now amassed more points than Arsenal's unbeaten ""Invincibles"" team of 2003-04 and have 12 points more than the Manchester United Treble-winning team of 1998-99. No team has ever reached this number of points (91) and not gone on to win the title. Manchester City, though, can regain top spot if they win their game in hand at Burnley on Sunday (14:05 BST), after which both teams have two games left. Race for the Premier League title Date Liverpool fixtures Date Man City fixtures 28 April Burnley (A) 4 May Newcastle (A) 6 May Leicester (H) 12 May Wolves (H) 12 May Brighton (A) Salah's goals tally is a bigger achievement this season - Klopp If there were fears this could turn into a nervy occasion, they were quickly dispelled by a lightning-fast start in which visiting midfielder Jon Gorenc Stankovic was robbed of possession for Keita's opener. Liverpool's high press was hardly unexpected but it did the early damage before the usual suspects took over. Robertson displayed the form that has seen him rewarded with a place in the PFA'sPremier League Team of the Year,driving forward from left-back at every opportunity. His contribution to Mane's first goal and Salah's second saw him equal a Premier League record of 11 assists from a defender in a season. Mane, who was also endorsed by his contemporaries and is a contender for the main PFA Player of the Year award on Sunday, showcased his ability to find space between defenders, directing two excellent headers past Lossl to record his 19th and 20th league goals of a prolific season. That ensured Liverpool became the first club to have two players score 20 goals or more in a Premier League season since Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge accomplished the same feat in 2013-14, also for the Reds. This video can not be played Klopp dismisses Firmino and Salah rumours after big win Salah's two-goal return also saw him become only the third Liverpool player to pass 20 or more Premier League goals in consecutive seasons for the club, placing him in the same company as Robbie Fowler (1994-95 and 1995-96) and Luis Suarez (2012-13 and 2013-14). His overall tally of 69 goals in 100 games does, however, separate him from those former heroes and is the highest number of goals managed by any Liverpool player after a century of appearances. Klopp will have also been satisfied with his team's fluency in attack even without Roberto Firmino, who was nursing a thigh injury. The Brazilian is expected to be fit for Wednesday's Champions League semi-final first leg at Barcelona, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who returned from injury to make his first appearance since April 2018, will also bolster his options. At the same stage last term, Huddersfield were still embroiled in a fight for Premier League survival - but this campaign has struck an entirely different tone. David Wagner - the architect of that triumph and the Terriers' first promotion to the top flight since 1972 - left in January and his successor Jan Siewert has been unable to recalibrate their fortunes. This thumping defeat leaves Town with just four points from the last 69 available and a compendium of unwanted records loom. The 77-point difference between them and Liverpool represents the biggest gap between the top and bottom club since the Premier League was formed. And this loss - their 28th of the season - moved them within one of the Premier League record for the most defeats, which is currently shared by Ipswich, Sunderland and Derby. This video can not be played Liverpool 5-0 Huddersfield: Jan Siewert hails Terriers' spirit despite heavy loss With two games to go against Manchester United and at Southampton, there is now the realistic prospect they could end up as the sole owners of that undesirable tag. Their failings here were symptomatic of their season; albeit the quality of their opponents only exacerbated them. Stankovic - a defender deployed in midfield - lacked the awareness to shift the ball away from Keita, giving the visitors an early mountain to climb. And both of Mane's headers were too easily dispatched against a side that has now conceded 74 goals in 36 games. While endeavour was not absent - Huddersfield covered more ground than their opponents (111.97km to 110.34km) - the visitors' failure to capitalise on promising situations made for a comfortable night for the hosts. Sadio Mane converted two of his four chances to record his best ever return in front of goal in a single season Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""We are happy with the points we have and now we are focused on the next game. We have a mindset that works and we try to create problems for each opponent by working hard. ""It's obviously an outstanding group of players, who did well against a Huddersfield side who are much better than the result shows. They had proper counter-attacks so we needed to be patient and we scored wonderful goals."" Huddersfield manager Jan Siewart:""I feel for the player who made the mistake and everyone felt sorry for him. I have to take care of my player because he is a fantastic character. He was outstanding against Wolves but today he made a mistake and we all have to back him. ""No-one expected us to be brave and we could easily have put on our helmets and sit on the back foot but we put them under pressure. This is how I want to continue with my work because I know it will deliver results. ""Jurgen Klopp has proved that at Liverpool where he came in and changed the system. We all knew they could punish us but I am proud of the way we created chances."" Liverpool have accrued 91 points in the Premier League this season, their second-highest ever total in a single league season (converting to three for a win) in their history, behind only 98 points in 1978-79, which was a 42-game season. Liverpool have won 10 consecutive matches in all competitions, their best winning run since May 2006 when they won 11 on the bounce. Huddersfield have now lost 28 Premier League matches this season - they have never lost more league matches in a single campaign in their history (also 28 in 1987-88 in the second tier). Liverpool are now unbeaten in 19 matches across all competitions (W14, D5), their longest such streak since a run of 20 without defeat between December 1995 and March 1996. This victory means Liverpool will end Friday top of the Premier League - it is the 29th time that the lead has changed hands at the end of a day this season, the outright post-war top-flight record, overtaking 28 times in 2001-02. Huddersfield have now failed to score in each of their last nine meetings with Liverpool in all competitions; this is Liverpool's joint-second longest run of clean sheets against an opponent in their history, behind only a 10-match streak against West Brom in August 2010 (also nine v Everton in April 1976). Liverpool have now earned 50 points at Anfield this season, their best ever tally at home in a Premier League season (previously 49 in 2013-14), with this the first top-flight season they have reached 50 points at home since 1987-88 (also 50). No defender in Premier League history has assisted more goals in a single season in the competition than Liverpool's Andrew Robertson (11), moving level with Leighton Baines in 2010-11 and Andy Hinchcliffe in 1994-95. Liverpool travel to Barcelona for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on 1 May (20:00 BST) before resuming their Premier League duties on Saturday, 4 May at Newcastle (19:45 BST). Huddersfield host Manchester United in their next Premier League game on Sunday, 5 May (14:00 BST).

"This video can not be played Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke to the BBC Sri Lanka's prime minister has told the BBC he was ""out of the loop"" when it came to intelligence warnings ahead of the deadly Easter Sunday bombings. Ranil Wickremesinghe said that crucial information about any potential danger in the country was not passed to him. The subsequent attacks, which claimed at least 250 lives, exposed a massive intelligence failure by Sri Lanka. The country's police chief and top defence ministry official have both resigned over the bombings. But Mr Wickremesinghe argued the fact that he was unaware of the warnings meant he did not need to step down from his position. ""If we had any inkling, and we had not taken action, I would have handed in my resignation immediately,"" he said, adding: ""But what do you do when you are out of the loop?"" The apparent lapse in communication has refocused attention on the infighting between the country's two most powerful men, Mr Wickremesinghe and the president, Maithripala Sirisena. Relations deteriorated to such an extent that last October,Mr Sirisena sacked Mr Wickremesinghe. He was reinstated in December following rulings by Sri Lanka's highest courts. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? The victims of the Easter Sunday bombings US woman wrongly identified as suspect President Sirisena, meanwhile, has told reporters that Sri Lankan intelligence services believed around 130 suspects linked to the Islamic State (IS) group were in the country and that police were hunting 70 who were still at large. Police later discovered what they believed was the attackers' safe house in the eastern city of Sammanthurai. An ""Islamic State banner [and] IS uniform similar to the video that was released by alleged suicide bombers"" were found inside the building, a police spokesman told the BBC. About 150 sticks of dynamite and 100,000 ball bearings were also found during the raid. There have also been reports of a shootout between security forces and a group of alleged suspects in a separate location. Sri Lankan authorities have blamed a local Islamist extremist group, National Tawheed Jamath, for the attacks, although IS has also said it was behind them. Mr Sirisena also confirmed that the attackers' alleged ringleader, Zahran Hashim, a radical preacher, died at the Shangri-La hotel in the capital, Colombo. He said Hashim led the attack on the popular tourist hotel, accompanied by a second bomber identified as ""Ilham"". It was one of six hotels and churches targeted by the group. This video can not be played Zahran Hashim's sister condemns his actions Hashim appeared in a video released by IS in which seven men - thought to be some of the bombers - pledged allegiance to the group. Hashim was the only one to show his face. It is not clear whether Hashim had been in direct contact with IS or if he had simply pledged allegiance to the group. Sister of 'ringleader' deplores attack Sri Lankan officials revised the death toll from the bombings down by about 100 on Thursday, to 253, blaming the difficulty in identifying body parts at bomb scenes.

Mr Ibrahim was detained and questioned after the attacks. One of his sons was reportedly the bomber at the city's Shangri-La hotel - alongside Hashim, according to President Sirisena.

"People in the poll were asked about emotions such as feeling stressed or happy People around the world are becoming more angry, stressed and worried, according to a new global survey. Of some 150,000 people interviewed in over 140 countries, a third said they suffered stress, while at least one in five experienced sadness or anger. The annualGallup Global Emotions Report,externalasked people about their positive and negative experiences. The most negative country was Chad, followed by Niger. The most positive country was Paraguay, the report said. The US was the 39th most positive country, the UK was 46th and India ranked 93rd. Researchers focused on the experiences of participants the day before the survey took place. Interviewees were asked questions such as ""did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?"" and ""were you treated with respect?"" in a bid to gain an insight into people's daily experiences. Finland 'world's happiest place' in 2018 Can we be as happy as Scandinavians? Around 71% of people said they experienced a considerable amount of enjoyment the day before the survey. The poll found that levels of stress were at a new high, while levels of worry and sadness also increased. Some 39% of those polled said they had been worried the day before the survey, and 35% were stressed. Paraguay Panama Guatemala Mexico El Salvador Chad Niger Sierra Leone Iraq Iran Latin American countries including Paraguay, Panama and Guatemala topped the list of positive experiences, where people reported ""feeling a lot of positive emotions each day."" The poll claims it is reflective of the cultural tendency in Latin America to ""focus on life's positives"". Chad had the highest score for negative experiences. More than seven in 10 Chadians said they had struggled to afford food at some point in the past year. As many as 61% of people in the country said they had experienced physical pain. The country suffers from inadequate infrastructure and internal conflict, while health and social conditions compare unfavourably with those elsewhere in the region. Despite Chad's high score for negative experiences, people in the US and Greece were more stressed than Chadians. Greece had the most stressed population in the world with 59% saying they experienced stress on the day before the poll. Around 55% of US adults said they were stressed.

"The RSPB has parodied The Beatles' iconic Abbey Road image to promote the song The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has released a charity song to highlight Britain's declining bird numbers. Let Nature Sing features the song of 25 different threatened and endangered UK birds. Currently there are 67 species on the charity's ""red list"" of globally threatened species in severe decline. Among those most at risk are corncrakes, turtle doves, cuckoos, skylarks and nightingales. The RSPB says Britain has lost 40 million birds in the last 50 years and 56% of wildlife species in the UK are in decline. But a recent YouGov survey for the RSPB found only 15% of people in the UK believed nature was in crisis and more than a quarter thought nature was doing well. Allow YouTube content?

The RSPB hopes the two-minute track, which was released on Friday, will raise awareness about Britain's declining bird population. The conservation charity hopes the song will enter the UK charts in time for International Dawn Chorus Day on 5 May. If successful it will become the first track featuring just birdsong to make the charts. Famous songs which feature birdsong include Minnie Riperton's Lovin' You, which hit number two on the UK charts in 1975, and The Beatles' Blackbird which was released in 1968. Big Garden Birdwatch: Smallest birds 'hit by Beast from East' RSPB says Norfolk cliff netting 'will save sand martins from suffocating' Netting to stop birds nesting: Call for new safeguards Eight in 10 of the 2,083 British adults surveyed said they believed the government should be doing more to save nature. The survey also revealed young people were unaware of the crisis facing Britain's birds. The YouGov survey also found one in three 13 to 17-year-olds had no idea the UK had lost so many birds over the past half century. But after being told the statistics, more than a third of the 505 teenagers surveyed said they wanted to do something to save nature. Allow Twitter content?

Nightingales are on the RSPB's red at risk list ""We all need to start talking about this, and the Let Nature Sing track is a good starting point as it perfectly highlights the music we risk losing. ""Wildlife and our natural world can recover, it can be saved for future generations, but we need more people to talk about the issue and how much something as simple and wonderful as bird song means to each of us.

"This video can not be played Horacio Sala said he wanted justice over his son's death The father of Premier League footballer Emiliano Sala, who was killed in a plane crash earlier this year, has died three months after his son. Horacio Sala, 58, suffered a heart attack on Friday, his friend and president of his local club confirmed.

Emiliano Sala was due to be Cardiff City's record signing Progreso mayor Julio Muller led the tributes to Mr Sala, telling La Red radio station: ""Horacio could not overcome Emi, we thought that after the discovery he would be able to close that circle."" In a statement, Cardiff City said the club offered its ""deepest condolences"" to Mr Sala's friends and family. ""They are very much in the thoughts of us all at this difficult time,"" a spokesman said. The Piper Malibu N264DB plane carrying Sala and pilot David Ibbotson went missing over waters near the Channel Islands on 21 January and it took rescuers two weeks to find the wreckage. Thefootball star's body was recoveredon 8 February after aprivate rescue team took over the searchfor the missing plane. The father-of-three, a long-distance lorry driver, spoke to the BBC two weeks ago and pleaded ""that justice be done"" for his son. The location of where the plane carrying Emiliano Sala disappeared He told theBBC Wales Investigatesprogramme he wanted to ""continue investigating all the things that we have to know and that we can know."" ""That is all I can ask,"" added Mr Sala, who had split-up from his son's mother Mercedes. Air accident investigators are still looking into why the Piper Malibu plane carrying Sala to Cardiff for his first training session crashed. The light aircraft was piloted by Mr Ibbotson, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, whose body has not been found. Sala's father Horacio was seen crying at the vigil for his son Air accident investigators' photo showing the rear left side of the fuselage on the seabed The legality of Sala's flight has not yet been established, buta preliminary report from air accident investigatorsin February said the pilot was not licensed to carry fee-paying passengers and the plane was not registered for commercial flights. Cardiff City have said the club ""wholeheartedly"" backs the Air Charter Association's (BACA) calls ""to secure a review of illegal flights"". In the three months since the crash, BACA said it had received reports of illegal flights happening in the UK at a rate of almost one per day. Sala started his career at his hometown club San MartÃ­n de Progreso - in Argentina's Santa Fe region, about 350 miles (563km) from the capital Buenos Aires - and his father retained close links with the club. A wake was held at the club before his funeral in Progreso in February.

"Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not attend the state banquet at Buckingham Palace in honour of Donald Trump. The Labour leader argued it would be wrong to ""roll out the red carpet"" for the US president, whom he accused of using ""racist and misogynist rhetoric"". The US-UK relationship did not need ""the pomp and ceremony"" of June's state visit, he added. Prime Minister Theresa May promised Mr Trump the honour after he was elected in 2016. Commons Speaker John Bercow and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable have already declined to attend the dinner. Trump 'should address UK Parliament' State visit: What can we expect? In a statement, Mr Corbyn said: ""Theresa May should not be rolling out the red carpet for a state visit to honour a president who rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric. ""Maintaining an important relationship with the United States does not require the pomp and ceremony of a state visit. It is disappointing that the prime minister has again opted to kowtow to this US administration. ""I would welcome a meeting with President Trump to discuss all matters of interest."" This video can not be played Remember President Trump's last UK visit in July 2018? A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow, who has been critical of Mr Trump's record in office, said he had been ""invited to the banquet, but he will not be attending"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford is also boycotting the meal, saying Mrs May ""should instead be holding meetings to challenge the US administration and raise key issues"". But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the UK should offer ""the best possible welcome"" to the president. And Mrs May's spokesman said the prime minister was ""looking forward to welcoming the president here to build on our special relationship"". The banquet is scheduled to take place on the first evening of the state visit, which will last from 3 to 5 June. About 150 guests are expected to be invited, including political leaders and other public figures with cultural, diplomatic and economic links to the US. During their visit, the president and First Lady Melania Trump will be guests of the Queen and attend a ceremony in Portsmouth to mark 75 years since the D-Day landings. Mr Trump will also have official talks with the prime minister at Downing Street, although it is not yet clear whether he will address Parliament - as predecessors Barack Obama and Bill Clinton did - amid opposition from many MPs to the idea. Last July, Mr Trump's first visit to the UK since he became president in 2017 led to huge protests. He met the Queen and Mrs May hosted a banquet for him at Blenheim Palace.

"This video can not be played President Trump tells Americans to get vaccinations President Trump has told Americans to ""get their shots"" as measles cases spread across the country. ""The vaccinations are so important,"" he told reporters outside the White House. Nearly 700 cases have been reported across 22 states amid a resurgence of the highly infectious disease, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says. Mr Trump has previously appeared to link vaccines and autism. Public health experts say there is no link. US county declares measles emergency US teen highlights 'anti-vax fake news' Vaccination rates have dropped steadily in the US with many parents objecting for philosophical or religious reasons. Others, known as ""anti-vaxxers"", believe discredited information that vaccines cause autism in children. The CDC says measles cases have reached a level not seen since 2000, when the disease was eliminated from the US. Mr Trump's warning comes as hundreds of staff and students at universities in the Californian city of Los Angeles have been quarantined over fears they may have contracted measles. Those who were at risk of being infected were asked to stay at home unless they could prove their immunity. Global measles resurging, WHO warns Measles - the disease that returned from the past As of Thursday, 82 people at the University of California (UCLA) were unable to provide vaccination records, the university says. At California State University, 156 people - including library employees and students - could not provide records and remain in quarantine, AP news agency reported. Mr Trump's latest comments contrast markedly from his previous public statements about vaccinations. During a Republican primary debate in 2015, he suggested vaccines were responsible for what he called an ""epidemic"" of autism. He said he was in favour of vaccines, but wanted ""smaller doses over a longer period of time"". He also held meetings with several prominent anti-vaccine campaigners ahead of the 2016 election. He has also linked vaccinations to autism in earlier social media posts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Measles is a highly infectious disease and can cause serious health complications, including damage to the lungs and brain. But despite the dangers, vaccination rates are declining in many countries. There have been more than 110,000 measles cases worldwide in the first three months of 2019 - a rise of 300% compared to last year, World Health Organization figures show. The increase in measles cases in the US ""is part of a global trend seen over the past few years as other countries struggle with declining vaccination rates"" the CDC says.

"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable launches the Liberal Democrat European election campaign The Liberal Democrats have launched their European election campaign with an ""unambiguous"" pledge to stop Brexit. Leader Sir Vince Cable accused the Conservatives and Labour of a ""stitch-up"" and said a ""people's vote"" was the only way to end the Brexit ""paralysis"". He added it was ""a pity"" that fellow Remain-backing party Change UK had not agreed to running a combined campaign. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, after Brexit was delayed, amid continuing parliamentary deadlock. It means the UK must now hold European elections on 23 May, or leave on 1 June without a deal. European elections: Party-by-party UK guide How do European elections work? But if agreement can be reached among MPs before 22 May, the UK could cancel its participation in the European parliamentary elections. However, cross-party talks aimed at reaching consensus have yet to make significant progress. Speaking in Wapping, east London, Sir Vince said his ""exit from Brexit"" catchphrase had been regarded as a ""bit wacky"" when he first used it in July 2017 but was now ""the mainstream"". He likened the party's stance on Brexit to its opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq - backed by the Conservatives and Labour at the time. ""At the time we were regarded as way out on a limb, unpatriotic - and we were vindicated, we were proved right. And that's why I believe we will be right about Europe."" But he said he regretted that the Liberal Democrats were not standing on a common platform with other Remain-backing parties to stop Brexit. ""The Liberal Democrats made it very clear we were happy to work with others. It wasn't reciprocated and we are going our own way."" He describedreports of a leaked document,externalwhich suggests that newly formed Change UK will seek to ""win over"" Liberal Democrat supporters, as ""unfortunate"". Chris Leslie, the former Labour MP who quit the party to join Change UK,told Business Insider,externalan alliance between anti-Brexit parties ""wasn't ever on the agenda"", adding: ""They [the Lib Dems] have fallen below a critical mass and haven't had the drive to get out of that for a long time. We are starting afresh and don't come with that baggage."" Asked about the interview, Sir Vince said: ""There are millions of people out there willing us to work together and they will feel angry and betrayed if they find petty tribalism is trumping that - that's the old politics."" He said he expected the party to do well but added: ""It is a pity and I regret that we are not doing a combined campaign."" At the end of March, Prime Minister Theresa May said the public would find it ""unacceptable"" to have to elect a new group of 73 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU. But earlier this month, she agreed a Brexit delay to 31 October with the EU, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament.

"This video can not be played Zahran Hashim's sister condemns his actions The alleged ringleader behind Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday bombings was killed in the attacks, President Maithripala Sirisena said. Mr Sirisena said Zahran Hashim, a radical preacher, died at the Shangri-La hotel in the capital, Colombo. He said Hashim led the attack on the popular tourist hotel, accompanied by a second bomber identified as ""Ilham"". At least 250 people died in the wave of bombings on Sunday, which targeted churches and hotels in Colombo. Mr Sirisena also said that Sri Lankan intelligence services believed around 130 suspects linked to Islamic State (IS) group were in the country and that police were hunting 70 who were still at large. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? The victims of the Easter Sunday bombings US woman wrongly identified as suspect The president did not clarify what role Hashim took in the Shangri-La bombing - one of six attacks on Sunday that terrorised Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan authorities have blamed a local Islamist extremist group, National Tawheed Jamath, for the attacks. A previously little-known domestic radical, Hashim gained some local notoriety a few years ago as part of a group which defaced Buddhist statues. He subsequently found a following on YouTube, where he posted videos calling for violence against non-Muslims. In the days after the Easter Sunday attacks, he appeared in a video released by IS in which seven men - thought to be some of the bombers - pledged allegiance to the group. Hashim was the only one to show his face. But it was not clear whether Hashim had been in direct contact with IS or if he had simply pledged allegiance to the group, which has claimed it was behind the attacks. Damage at the Shangri-La hotel, where Zahran Hashim is said to have died Hashim was from the coastal Sri Lankan town of Kattankudy. There, earlier this week, his sister told the BBC she was horrified by what her brother had done. ""Even if he is my brother, I cannot accept this. I don't care about him any more,"" she said, adding that Hashim had been in contact with her until about two years ago, when he went quiet. Sister of 'ringleader' deplores attack President Sirisena told reporters that police were still hunting a number of IS suspects, but it was not clear if others believed to be linked to the attacks had been detained or had fled the country. A shootout between police and alleged suspects during one search operation was reported in the eastern town of Sainthamaruthu on Friday evening. The president also said that Sri Lanka's police chief, Pujith Jayasundara, had resigned over the bombings. His departure follows the resignation of the country's top defence ministry official, Hemasiri Fernando. Sri Lanka has begun to bury the dead, many in mass graves The bombings exposed a massive intelligence failure by Sri Lankan authorities after it emerged police and some government departments had received detailed warnings about possible attacks on churches. However, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the BBC that the warnings had failed to reach him - and as a result, he was not prepared to stand down from his role as he could not be held accountable. ""If we had any inkling, and we had not taken action, I would have handed in my resignation immediately,"" he said, adding: ""But what do you do when you are out of the loop?"" Sri Lankan officials have also revised the death toll from the bombings down by about 100 on Thursday, to 253, blaming the difficulty in identifying body parts at bomb scenes. But the move raised questions over how the previous estimate could have been so inaccurate. The country's Catholic Church has announced the suspension of all church services. In Negombo, a community of Ahmadi Muslims from Pakistan as well as some Christians and Afghan nationals have been ejected from their homes by landlords. Rights activists say the Ahmadi community, as foreign Muslims, could face reprisal attacks. This video can not be played Father and brother of teenager victims pay tribute to lost loved ones The Sri Lankan government has said it will search schools, in one of a series of announcements designed to address public anxiety in the aftermath of the attacks. Emergency powers announced declared on Monday continued, allowing police to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders. Sri Lanka's finance minister, Mangala Samaraweera said on Friday there were fears the country's lucrative tourism industry could see a fall in arrivals of up to 30% this year - a loss of $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn). Nine people are suspected of carrying out the attacks. Two of the bombers are said to have been the sons of spice trader Mohammad Yusuf Ibrahim, one of Sri Lanka's richest men. Mr Ibrahim was detained and questioned after the attacks. One of his sons was reportedly the bomber at the city's Shangri-La hotel - alongside Hashim, according to President Sirisena. The other son reportedly targeted the restaurant at the high-end Cinnamon Grand hotel, a short distance away. A CCTV image shows a bomber approaching St Sebastian's church in Negombo A woman said to be a wife of one of Mr Ibrahim's sons detonated explosives during a police raid at the family's villa on Sunday. Several people, including children and three police officers, were reportedly killed in that blast. According to the Sri Lankan government, most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and had come from ""middle- or upper middle-class"" families. Sri Lanka attacks: Who were the bombers? Another of the alleged bombers studied in the UK, a senior Whitehall official told the BBC. Abdul Latif Jamil Mohammed studied aerospace engineering at Kingston University in 2006-7 but did not complete a full degree.

"Lyra McKee was shot dead in Londonderry ""Where now? What are we going to do after today?"" That's the question many have been asking since the funeral of journalist Lyra McKee was held. Anyone watching the service will have heardthe words of Father Martin Magill, as he addressed those gathered in St Anne's Cathedral. He asked: ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman, with her whole life in front of her, to get to this point?"" In pictures: Mourners pay respects Call for Irish border fix after McKee death He knew exactly where he was directing his criticism - right at the Stormont politicians sitting in front of him, who have been at odds over how to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland. This video can not be played ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" He welcomed the symbolism of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in leaders standing together in the Creggan last week - but pointed out how rare it is to see in these strained political times. There are some who now feel Lyra McKee's death could be the turning point, a wake-up call for the political parties to resolve their differences. Many hope it will be. But sometimes optimism needs to be supported with a dose of realism. Colum Eastwood, Naomi Long, Mary Lou McDonald and Arlene Foster were among political leaders at a vigil in Derry The Reverend Harold Good, who played a key role in the peace process, knows this better than most. He told the Stephen Nolan Show there had been other moments - including the aftermath ofthe Omagh bombing in 1998- where ""our hopes were that this would bring some kind of a turning of the tide"". He said Fr Magill's comments were a ""moment of opportunity to challenge"" the political leaders. Already, DUP MP Sammy Wilson has said he's not convinced that Ms McKee's murder is the beginning of real change. His party leader Arlene Foster insists the DUP is ready to go back into government immediately - and wants the issues holding things up to be addressed alongside a return to power-sharing in a parallel talks process. But that isn't a new idea andSinn FÃ©in rejected it when the DUP first suggested it in 2017. Their view is that a deal was firmly on the table in February 2018, which the DUP walked away from. The DUP has always said it was merely a draft proposal, and that they were not close to signing anything on the dotted line. And so we return to much of what has already been heard over the past two years, with neither party budging on its respective positions. Mrs Foster summed up the DUP view on Good Morning Ulster. ""It's not a balanced discussion if Sinn FÃ©in get everything they want and my community is left with nothing, it can't be a five-nil situation,"" she said. Sinn FÃ©in negotiator Conor Murphy followed that by saying that restoration of the assembly could not be a ""quick fix"" and that ""certain conditions"" must be met first before his party will go back into government with the DUP. The other parties at Stormont have been making their own attempts to push for all-party talks. But ultimately every party, and the British and Irish governments, need to buy back into the process. The problems at Stormont are not merely about resolving matters of culture and language. It is also about two parties rebuilding the trust that's needed to share power. That point was raised by victims' campaigner Alan McBride on BBC radio on Thursday morning. He said that, having listened to the politicians' latest remarks, he believes ""the whole concept of being a good neighbour in this society is gone"". The parties will be aware that public opinion could swiftly turn against them if they do not take some kind of action. But, for the moment, there are elections to fight in Northern Ireland - and in fierce campaign battles, there are not too many moments of compromise. Politicians have been told to stop blaming each other and sort it out now. But with the assembly now down for two years and counting, that challenge may be easier said than done.

"The law professor says Biden needs to apologise to other women and the public Top White House candidate Joe Biden has denied treating a woman badly when she accused a Supreme Court nominee of harassment before Congress in 1991. Anita Hill had testified against Clarence Thomas to a committee chaired by Mr Biden. His handling of her evidence has long been criticised. Speaking on ABC's the View on Friday, Mr Biden also said that he was ""sorry for the way she got treated"". Ms Hill on Thursdaytold the New York Times,externalshe would not endorse Mr Biden. The former US vice-president under Barack Obama tried to tamp down the controversy a day after formally launching his White House bid. Mr Biden has shot to the tip of a crowded field of 20 contenders who are vying to become the Democratic standard-bearer in next year's election against Republican President Donald Trump. Ms Hill said that Mr Biden had called her before announcing his presidential bid and expressed his ""regret for what she endured"" during the hearing. But she said that apology was not enough without ""real change"". ""I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, 'I'm sorry for what happened to you,'"" Ms Hill, a law professor, told the newspaper. She added that she could not support Mr Biden unless he showed ""real accountability"" for his handling of her testimony before Congress in 1991. During his Friday appearance on The View, Mr Biden - who raised a whopping $6.3m (Â£4.8m) on the first day of his campaign - was asked about offering a personal apology to Ms Hill. ""I'm sorry for the way she got treated,"" Mr Biden responded. ""If you go back and look at what I said or didn't say, I don't think I treated her badly."" This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career In 1991, Ms Hill was called to testify at Mr Thomas' confirmation hearing after an FBI interview with her was leaked to the press. The hearing was conducted by an all-white, all-male panel, and several women apparently willing to corroborate Ms Hill's account were not called to testify by Mr Biden. Both Ms Hill and Justice Thomas are African-American. Mr Biden voted to send Justice Thomas' nomination out of the committee to the Senate floor, then voted against him in the full confirmation vote. Decades on, the event is considered a political embarrassment for Mr Biden, who remains a favourite to secure the Democratic nomination. Biden stumbles in age of #MeToo Joe Biden launches presidential bid Which Democrat will take on Trump? Earlier this month, the former vice-president pledged to be ""more mindful"" about physical contact with women after seven women accused him of unwelcome physical contact. Clarence Thomas was Anita Hill's supervisor Mr Biden has also been reproached by the mother of an anti-racism protester who was killed during a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. Susan Bro told the Daily Beast the presidential hopeful had not notified her that he planned to invoke Heather Heyer's death during his campaign launch video on Thursday. ""Most people do that sort of thing,"" she told the Daily Beast. ""They capitalise on whatever situation is handy. ""He didn't reach out to me, and didn't mention her by name specifically, and he probably knew we don't endorse candidates."" In a later interview with CNN, Ms Bro softened her tone, saying she was not particularly upset because ""the issue is about the hate, it's not about Heather"". Ms Bro added that she had told Mr Biden his video could have traumatised for some Charlottesville survivors. A reckoning in Charlottesville 'A battle for the soul of America' This video can not be played What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter Mr Biden raised the issue of Charlottesville again while on The View, where he said President Trump's much-pilloried response to the violent protest in part inspired his decision to run. He accused Mr Trump of comparing ""neo-Nazis"" to ""genuinely decent Americans"". Days after the Unite the Right rally, Mr Trump provoked uproar for saying there ""were very fine people on both sides"" in Charlottesville. Although he also said neo-Nazis and white nationalists should be ""condemned totally"", it was not enough to contain the political fallout. The president revisited those remarks on Friday. ""If you look at what I said, you will see that question was answered perfectly, and I was talking about people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E Lee, a great general,"" he told reporters outside the White House. The Charlottesville unrest began when a number of racist groups gathered to protest against plans to remove a statue of Lee, who commanded pro-slavery Confederacy forces during the American Civil War. Meanwhile, an unnamed Republican strategist told Politico that Mr Trump is concerned about Mr Biden's candidacy. According to the report,external, the source said Mr Trump asked his advisers last fall: ""How are we gonna beat Biden?"" When his aides predicted Mr Biden would not win the Democratic nomination, the president pressed: ""But what if he does?"" Speaking to reporters on Friday, however, Mr Trump projected confidence that he could beat Mr Biden ""easily"". Mr Trump, 72, also said he is being made to ""look very young"" next to the Democratic candidates, who range in age from 37 to Mr Biden's 76.

"This video can not be played President Trump tells Americans to get vaccinations President Trump has told Americans to ""get their shots"" as measles cases spread across the country. ""The vaccinations are so important,"" he told reporters outside the White House. Nearly 700 cases have been reported across 22 states amid a resurgence of the highly infectious disease, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says. Mr Trump has previously appeared to link vaccines and autism. Public health experts say there is no link. US county declares measles emergency US teen highlights 'anti-vax fake news' Vaccination rates have dropped steadily in the US with many parents objecting for philosophical or religious reasons. Others, known as ""anti-vaxxers"", believe discredited information that vaccines cause autism in children. The CDC says measles cases have reached a level not seen since 2000, when the disease was eliminated from the US. Mr Trump's warning comes as hundreds of staff and students at universities in the Californian city of Los Angeles have been quarantined over fears they may have contracted measles. Those who were at risk of being infected were asked to stay at home unless they could prove their immunity. Global measles resurging, WHO warns Measles - the disease that returned from the past As of Thursday, 82 people at the University of California (UCLA) were unable to provide vaccination records, the university says. At California State University, 156 people - including library employees and students - could not provide records and remain in quarantine, AP news agency reported. Mr Trump's latest comments contrast markedly from his previous public statements about vaccinations. During a Republican primary debate in 2015, he suggested vaccines were responsible for what he called an ""epidemic"" of autism. He said he was in favour of vaccines, but wanted ""smaller doses over a longer period of time"". He also held meetings with several prominent anti-vaccine campaigners ahead of the 2016 election. He has also linked vaccinations to autism in earlier social media posts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Measles is a highly infectious disease and can cause serious health complications, including damage to the lungs and brain. But despite the dangers, vaccination rates are declining in many countries. There have been more than 110,000 measles cases worldwide in the first three months of 2019 - a rise of 300% compared to last year, World Health Organization figures show. The increase in measles cases in the US ""is part of a global trend seen over the past few years as other countries struggle with declining vaccination rates"" the CDC says.

"Inspectors found a string of environmental breaches at the HES site in Shotts. Clinical waste firm Healthcare Environmental Services (HES) has gone into liquidation four months after all of its staff were made redundant. Accountants BDO have been appointed tothe Lanarkshire-based company which lost multi-million pound contracts with NHS Scotland and 17 trusts in England. About 150 jobs were lost at its Shotts HQ last year and staff have been pursuing legal action to recover wages. Lawyers acting for the workers believe they could be owed more than Â£1m. The liquidators are now seeking access to the company's books and records. Staff take HES to court over unpaid wages HES staff appeal to employer for lost wages Unpaid HES staff 'turning to food banks' Q&A: What has happened at clinical waste firm HES? HES had managed all of Scotland's clinical waste disposal before it was embroiled in a waste stockpiling scandal. Following the loss of the contracts, contingency measures had to be put in place across the whole of NHS Scotland. Company owner Garry Pettigrew had previously refused to put the company into administration and insisted he was not liable for the wages of former staff. David Martyn, of Thompsons Solicitors who have been acting on behalf of some former employees, said the latest move was a ""starting point"" towards getting the money they are owed. He toldthe BBC's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""Normally what happens when a company goes into administration is the employees can get their notice pay, any unpaid wages, holiday pay and things like that, from the government Insolvency Service. ""Of course, when the company doesn't got into administration, this puts the employees in a terrible situation. ""They have now had four or five months where they have not had their last month's wages and the notice periods they are entitled to. ""We have had terrible stories of people having to rely on food banks just to see them through."" HES owner Garry Pettigrew insisted he was not liable for money owed to staff Mr Martin added: ""We estimate that payments of over Â£1m are owed to these workers. Obviously that is a huge boost to the workers. ""We call on Mr Pettigrew to allow access to the books and the records, and that will allow these payments to be expedited. ""It will still be a couple of weeks before the applications will be made, but this is certainly the starting point in the workers finally getting the money they are owed."" James Stephen, a Glasgow-based partner at BDO, said HES had gone into liquidation at the request of one of its creditors. The petition was granted at Hamilton Sheriff Court on Thursday and was not opposed. Mr Stephen said: ""BDO have been appointed as liquidators by the court. We are now assessing the company's asset base. ""We will be working with all the relevant government agencies to make sure any health and safety issues at the site are taken into account. We'll be heavily involved in taking guidance from them."" A statement from HES said it was ""very sad to announce that we believe the company was placed into administration"". The firm said the ongoing medical waste crisis ""has been caused by a severe lack of high-temperature incineration capacity in the UK combined with more waste being sent for incineration by the NHS"". The statement added: ""The directors would like to thank our true loyal staff, friends, colleagues, suppliers, & loyal customers for 22 years, they know who they are."" The HES staff were made redundant after the company was caught up in a UK-wide waste stockpiling scandal. Healthcare Environmental Services (HES) inspectors found a string of environmental breaches at its Dundee and Shotts sites. They said both were failing to comply with enforcement notices over the proper storage of waste. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) confirmed it had been in contact with the liquidators, ""to whom environmental obligations under the environmental licences for both sites now fall"". A spokesman said: ""All contingency measures will ensure that environmental and human health are appropriately protected and, to date, our inspections have not identified any current risk of pollution from the waste stored on these sites.""

"This video can not be played Sturgeon: 'Scotland needs protection from Brexit and Boris' Nicola Sturgeon has refused to say whether she would call off her push for a second independence referendum by 2021 if Brexit does not take place. The first minister is seeking a vote on independence before the next Scottish election if the UK leaves the EU. Asked on Friday what would happen if Brexit was halted, she said she would set out her views at that stage. Ms Sturgeon said she would not ""narrow Scotland's options"" because the country needed ""maximum flexibility"". She suggested that ""the way Scotland has been treated"" could be grounds for another independence referendum - as could Boris Johnson becoming prime minister. Ms Sturgeon was speaking to BBC Scotland ahead of the SNP's conference, which opens in Edinburgh on Saturday. UK government 'will not grant indyref2 consent' Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021 The UK government has already ruled out granting permission for a referendum before the next Holyrood election in May 2021. And the Scottish Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon's latest comments showed that she ""wants to press on with her break-up plans come hell or high water"". The SNP's manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood election stated that another vote on independence should be held if there was a ""material change of circumstance"", such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. However, Ms Sturgeon told the Good Morning Scotland programme that ""many people would say there's been a big material change of circumstances already in the way Scotland has been treated over the past few years"". Boris Johnson is seen by many as the favourite to succeed Theresa May as prime minister The first minister, who has also called for another Brexit referendum, said she could only currently make plans on the basis that the UK is still going to leave the EU. She added: ""If that doesn't happen then I guess we'll be having another discussion and I'll give my views on what we do then."" She later told BBC Scotland's political editor, Brian Taylor, that she was ""not going to narrow Scotland's options"" because ""we could be facing Boris Johnson as prime minister within the next few months"". ""Scotland needs to have maximum flexibility and maximum room for manoeuvre to get itself onto the right path,"" the first minister argued. ""I think Boris Johnson as prime minister would send not just people in Scotland, but many people across the whole of the UK, into utter despair. ""Boris Johnson, not single-handedly but largely, is responsible for the complete mess the UK finds itself in."" David Lidington has ruled out permission for an independence referendum being granted in the next two years Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the country is taken out of the EU. The first minister intends to have Scottish Parliament legislation that could pave the way for a referendum in place by the end of this year. But she has also made clear that Westminster's approval would be needed before any referendum is actually held to ensure its legal status is ""beyond doubt"". Ms Sturgeon has not yet made a fresh request for this consent - but has indicated that she plans to do so either at the end of this year or the beginning of 2020. Will indyref2 happen before May 2021? Theresa May's deputy, David Lidington,explicitly ruled out that requestbeing granted when he spoke to the media during a visit to Glasgow on Thursday. Mr Lidington said there was ""no evidence"" of a surge in support for independence since the last referendum in 2014, which he argued had settled the issue for a generation. Ms Sturgeon responded by saying Mr Lidington was a member of a UK government which might not be in office ""in a matter of weeks"". She added: ""They're not exactly known for consistency. This is the UK government who said the UK would definitely be out of the the EU on 29 March. ""They are also a government frankly that it is impossible to have a meaningful negotiation with. They have zero authority and zero credibility which is why I decided not to bother trying to negotiate with them at the moment."" Some pro-independence campaigners have been calling on Ms Sturgeon to press ahead with a new referendum Responding to her comments, Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins said: ""This is proof that Nicola Sturgeon wants to press on with her break-up plans come hell or high water. ""Whether there's a hard Brexit, a soft Brexit or no Brexit at all - the first minister will make this all about independence. ""The voting public saw through this scam last time and will do so again. It's a shameless approach - Nicola Sturgeon isn't even pretending to care about Brexit any more."" Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45% in the 2014 referendum - with opinion polls suggesting support for independence remains largely unchanged five years later. Ms Sturgeon initially called for a second referendum after the Brexit vote in 2016, butput her plans on holdafter the SNP lost 21 seats in the general election the following year. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says a second independence referendum will need a transfer of power from Westminster The first minister said she wants to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the country is taken out of the EU. She hopes a ""framework Bill"" - Scottish Parliament legislation setting the rules for any future referendum - will be in place by the end of this year. She told the Scottish Parliament: ""We do not need a transfer of power such as a Section 30 order to pass such a framework Bill, though we would need it to put beyond doubt or challenge our ability to apply the bill to an independence referendum."" The first minister also predicted: ""If we are successful in further growing the support and the demand for independence, then no UK government will be able to stop the will of the people or stop that will being expressed."" She announced she wants cross-party talks with opposition leaders about Holyrood's powers, while a Citizens' Assembly will be set up to examine wider questions on Scotland's future. Writing in the Scotsman newspaper after Ms Sturgeon's announcement, SNP veteran Kenny MacAskill - the former justice secretary - claimed that independence supporters who now expect an immediate referendum are ""delusional"". He also accused the SNP of ""fiddling while Rome burns"" and argued that Ms Sturgeon's ""heavily caveated"" statement ""confirmed what many have long thought, which is that she's not planning to try for independence before 2021"". But Ms Sturgeon denies that her statement was an attempt to appease independence activists who want a referendum sooner rather than later, and has insisted that: ""The timing is not to do with the SNP conference.""

"With no ministers in place, civil servants have been making the decisions on running public services There have been a year's headlines about deadlines to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland. It has been without an executive since January 2017, when the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in -split in a bitter row. Northern Ireland's biggest political crisis for more than a decade has left Stormont in limbo. The latest round of talks began at Stormont on 24 January. Head of the NI Civil Service David Sterling has said there needs to be clarity about a budget by 8 February. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley is to update the House of Commons on progress later this week. Ms Bradley was appointed Secretary of State in Januaryafter theresignation of James Brokenshiredue to health reasons. So, what are the chances of settlement any time soon, and what will happen if the parties can only agree to disagree? It has been a long year in Northern Ireland politics. In a strange sort of way, a lot has changed while much has stayed the same. The first of two elections saw Sinn FÃ©in strengthen its hand in the Northern Ireland Assembly in March, while the DUP did the same in the House of Commons after June's Westminster poll. But in spite of days, weeks and months of talks, the relationship between the two powerhouses has remained a cold one. In November, when some informed onlookers were predicting that a deal between the two parties was close, the prospect was punctured again. With the talks collapsing again, Mr Brokenshire moved to introduce a budget bill to keep money flowing into Northern Ireland's public services. In December, an official review of MLAs' salaries recommended a 13% pay cut. Talks resumed in late January, with Ms Bradley declaring that ""time is short"" but saying there was one last opportunity to restore the executive. While some of the issues that led to the demise of the Stormont institutions appear to have been resolved, or at least lessened in significance for either party, the split remains as wide as ever on others. Take the big sticking point ofSinn FÃ©in's demand for legislation to give official status to the Irish languagein Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in wants an Irish language act but the DUP is opposed to that demand The party has been frank and forthright in its insistence that Stormont won't get up and running again until a standalone act to allow that is agreed. The DUP has made moves to open itself to the Irish language, meeting campaign groups and leaderArlene Foster even publicly spoke a few words of it. But its suggestion of a culture bill, encompassing legislation for Irish and Ulster Scots, falls short of what Sinn FÃ©in wants. Other issues, including rights for same-sex couples to marry and measures to deal with investigations into killings during the Troubles, also feature high on the talks agenda. With no ministers in place at Stormont, civil servants have been making the day-to-day calls on running public services, but their hands are largely tied. Major decisions - many involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of pounds of public money - need to be approved by an executive. Karen Bradley has said there is one last opportunity to restore the executive Take the reform of Northern Ireland's health service as one example. With the system at breaking point, an ambitious plan was unveiled almost exactly 12 months ago. But with no health minister and no executive in place, no changes can be implemented and the difficulties remain. That's one way of putting it. Business leaders, public service workers, those relying on the health service and many others have voiced their frustration and anger about the situation at Stormont. If power were to transfer to Westminster, the Conservative government would make the big decisions in areas such as health, education and justice. The pressure has increased steadily on the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in the longer their stalemate has gone on. The question remains - is either side ready to make the compromises required to do a deal?

Earlier reports said that the US had been billed $2m (Â£1.5m) for the student's medical care. North Korea had allegedly demanded the bill be paid before he was allowed to return home.

On Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders refused to comment on the claim. In a statement to CBS, she said: ""We do not comment on hostage negotiations, which is why they have been so successful during this administration."" The main US representative sent to retrieve Warmbier signed a pledge,externalto pay the medical bill on the orders of President Trump, the Washington Post newspaper said, citing two people familiar with the situation. Trump defends Kim over US student's death North Korea: Otto Warmbier's family sues over son's death Inside the North Korean place that âdoesnât existâ The bill for Warmbier's care was then reportedly sent to the US Department of Treasury. A former Department of State official told CBS News that the US never paid or intended to pay the $2m, though Joseph Yun, the department's North Korea lead at the time, did accept the bill. The former official noted that the acceptance of the bill happened under Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was keen on opening up a dialogue with North Korea. Mr Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for attempting to steal a propaganda sign The unnamed source said Mr Tillerson's awareness of Warmbier's critical condition, or his lack of political experience may have contributed to the decision. The Washington Post was the first to report the bill. Warmbier was accused of stealing a sign from the hotel where he and fellow students had been staying in the capital, and was sentenced to 15 years' hard labour. By the time he returned to the US after 17 months in detention, the Ohio native was comatose and suffered from brain damage. Warmbier was returned to the US in a coma North Korea says he fell into a coma after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill. US doctors found no evidence of botulism and said that the student had suffered a ""severe neurological injury"", probably caused by a cardiopulmonary arrest. Though North Korea has denied mistreating the 22-year-old student, his parents insist that his death in July 2017 was the consequence of torture. Was Kim really clueless about US student death?

Mrs Bradley with the Lord Mayor of Londonderry John Boyle Mrs Bradley made a private visit to Londonderry on Saturday to sign a book of condolence for Ms McKee. She said it was with ""great sadness"" that she had to raise the killing of the 29-year-old in the Commons. ""We will continue to strive for peace in Northern Ireland,"" she said. ""We are behind you in rejecting those who seek to undermine peace with terror. They have no place in our society."" Mrs Bradley said to those responsible for the death of Ms McKee: ""We have heard your excuses and apologies. ""No-one buys it. This was no accident."" She also urged anyone with information about the murder to contact the police, and said that Northern Ireland politicians needed to take charge. Lyra McKee was shot while observing rioting in Londonderry Mrs Bradley is due to attend Ms McKee's funeral on Wednesday, along with a number of people from Labour's shadow Northern Ireland team. Shadow NI secretary Tony Lloyd told the Commons he welcomed the fact that all the Stormont leaders had signed a joint statement on Friday, condemning the murder of Ms McKee. The Irish government will have representatives at the funeral, including Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar and Irish President Michael D Higgins. Mr Coveney will also be in attendance.

"This video can not be played The moment of the blast was caught on CCTV Two workers suffered burns in an early hours explosion at Tata's biggest steelworks plant in the UK. Residents living near the Port Talbot plant heard a ""massive"" blast shortly after 03:30 BST. Images and footage posted on social media showed a huge mushroom cloud and plumes of smoke rising above the plant. Tata Steel said the explosion came from a train carrying molten metal. It said the workers had received treatment for minor injuries. ""The spillage led to a number of fires which were extinguished by our own emergency services supported by members of the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service,"" it said in a statement. Why is Port Talbot steelworks important? 18 years since steel site's fatal blast BBC Wales understands the explosion happened on a stretch of railway track between the engineering shops and the locomotive repair shops. Stephen Davies from the Unite union believed a train - carrying a ""torpedo"" which holds the molten metal - derailed, leading to the metal coming into contact with cold water. He said: ""They [the men] were both on the train. One of them is close to retirement and the other is younger."" One of them had a burn to the head and the other to the chest, he added. The site reopened by 07:00 although production at blast furnaces four and five have been halted until all checks had been completed, Mr Davies said. Pictures show ""torpedo"" which was carrying the molten metal, ended up on its side Lance Davies, 36, who lives at the highest point in the town overlooking it and the steelworks, said it was a ""miracle"" no-one was killed. ""I was woken up this morning by what sounded like thunder. I went to the window and could see the results of the first explosion, then I called my partner and saw the other two,"" he added. ""That was all you could see - it was like a scene from Independence Day - a big ball of flame, followed by a massive mushroom of smoke. It was unbelievable."" Sharon Freeguard, a Neath Port Talbot councillor, said: ""I thought I heard about two to three explosions. It was extremely frightening. This video can not be played Tata Steel said the explosion came from a train used to carry molten metal ""The house just shook, so it was quite alarming. Once it was over, I did wonder what it was and just did think about the works. ""We're just all relieved that there are no fatalities."" Local resident Craig Williams said he heard ""an almighty bang"", adding: ""It's very unusual to hear something of that magnitude. ""The house shook a little. It's not something we are accustomed to."" CCTV footage from a house captured the explosion Some of the buildings near where the blast took place Mr Williams said Port Talbot ""revolves around this plant"" and it helps to ""bring the community together"". The steelworks is the largest in the UK and employs more than 4,000 people. Helicopters were circling overhead and South Wales Police said it received ""numerous calls"" shortly after 03:30 ""reporting an explosion"" which, they said, had caused damage to some buildings on the site. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said 10 appliances it sent to the scene had left by 08:40. The Health and Safety Executive added it would be making contact with the emergency services. An investigation into the cause of the explosion has begun The explosion was heard as far away as Bridgend, 14 miles (22km) from the blast, and the National Police Air Service's St Athan wing confirmed a helicopter had been scrambled to the scene. Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said safety at the plant had improved ""massively"" since 2001, when three workers were killed in a blast. He said he had spoken with Tata bosses,externalon Friday and was told a review was under way into the cause. ""We've got to understand why it happened and make sure it doesn't happen again,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable launches the Liberal Democrat European election campaign The Liberal Democrats have launched their European election campaign with an ""unambiguous"" pledge to stop Brexit. Leader Sir Vince Cable accused the Conservatives and Labour of a ""stitch-up"" and said a ""people's vote"" was the only way to end the Brexit ""paralysis"". He added it was ""a pity"" that fellow Remain-backing party Change UK had not agreed to running a combined campaign. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, after Brexit was delayed, amid continuing parliamentary deadlock. It means the UK must now hold European elections on 23 May, or leave on 1 June without a deal. European elections: Party-by-party UK guide How do European elections work? But if agreement can be reached among MPs before 22 May, the UK could cancel its participation in the European parliamentary elections. However, cross-party talks aimed at reaching consensus have yet to make significant progress. Speaking in Wapping, east London, Sir Vince said his ""exit from Brexit"" catchphrase had been regarded as a ""bit wacky"" when he first used it in July 2017 but was now ""the mainstream"". He likened the party's stance on Brexit to its opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq - backed by the Conservatives and Labour at the time. ""At the time we were regarded as way out on a limb, unpatriotic - and we were vindicated, we were proved right. And that's why I believe we will be right about Europe."" But he said he regretted that the Liberal Democrats were not standing on a common platform with other Remain-backing parties to stop Brexit. ""The Liberal Democrats made it very clear we were happy to work with others. It wasn't reciprocated and we are going our own way."" He describedreports of a leaked document,externalwhich suggests that newly formed Change UK will seek to ""win over"" Liberal Democrat supporters, as ""unfortunate"". Chris Leslie, the former Labour MP who quit the party to join Change UK,told Business Insider,externalan alliance between anti-Brexit parties ""wasn't ever on the agenda"", adding: ""They [the Lib Dems] have fallen below a critical mass and haven't had the drive to get out of that for a long time. We are starting afresh and don't come with that baggage."" Asked about the interview, Sir Vince said: ""There are millions of people out there willing us to work together and they will feel angry and betrayed if they find petty tribalism is trumping that - that's the old politics."" He said he expected the party to do well but added: ""It is a pity and I regret that we are not doing a combined campaign."" At the end of March, Prime Minister Theresa May said the public would find it ""unacceptable"" to have to elect a new group of 73 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU. But earlier this month, she agreed a Brexit delay to 31 October with the EU, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament.

"This video can not be played Footage released by police shows suspected gunman New footage showing the suspected killer of journalist Lyra McKee moments before she was shot has been released by police. The 29-year-old was hit by a bullet while observing a riot in the Creggan area in Londonderry. Det Supt Jason Murphy said he believed the man in the images to be in his late teens, relatively short in height and with a stocky build. The gunman is one of three men seen in the footage. He first appears on the left of the screen, walking with another masked man. In one of the images, the man appears to have a gun in his right hand. In pictures: Mourners pay respects Profile: Lyra McKee Reward offered in Lyra McKee murder appeal Earlier this week,the New IRA said its members had carried out the killing. Areward of up to Â£10,000has been offered for information by the charity, Crimestoppers. On Friday, Det Supt Murphy appealed for anyone who recognises the men in the images to come forward and tell police. ""I believe the community has the information to help me unlock the key to Lyra McKee's murder,"" he said. ""I recognise people living in Creggan may feel it's difficult to come forward to speak to police. ""I want to provide a personal reassurance that we are able to deal with these concerns sensitively."" One week into the police investigation, detectives still have not recovered the weapon used in the attack. They are pleased that more than 140 people have provided them with information, but they need more. Forensic tests on the bullets fired suggest a weapon of similar calibre had been used in previous paramilitary-style attacks in the area. What detectives are doing now is piecing together the scientific and visual evidence, comparing it with witness statements, and seeing where it leads. The killing of Lyra McKee has kick-started Stormont talks which could potentially break the political deadlock. Police have their own job to do. And like the politicians, they have a long way to go. They are relying on the public for more information. Pictures of two other men, seen walking alongside the gunman shortly before the shooting, were also released. Police are appealing to anyone who recognises the man in the image, seen carrying a crate of petrol bombs One is seen carrying a crate of petrol bombs, while the other is described as wearing dark skinny jeans, blue Nike trainers with a white tick and a white sole. He is also seen wearing a camouflage scarf or other covering across his face.

"Leo Varadkar and Theresa May attended the funeral of journalist Lyra McKee in Belfast on Wednesday Prime Minister Theresa May and Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar have issued a joint statement setting up a new talks process aimed at restoring devolution in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley confirmed fresh talks would begin on 7 May. Earlier this week,the two premiers attended the funeral of Lyra McKee. At the funeral, priest Fr Martin Magill asked why it had taken her killing to unite politicians in Northern Ireland. This was followed by a series of calls for a fresh round of talks, aimed at reviving the power-sharing government at Stormont. Northern Ireland has been without devolution since January 2017 whenSinn FÃ©in collapsed the coalition government in protest at the DUP's handling of a green energy scandal. Since then, several rounds of talks aimed at restoring the Northern Ireland Assembly have failed, with the two parties failing to find a compromise on a number of outstanding issues including Irish language rights and the legalisation of same-sex marriage. NI politicians 'pressured by people power' Standing ovation as priest challenges politicians Lyra McKee: What's next for NI? In their statement, Mrs May and Mr Varadkar said: ""In coming together with other political leaders in St Anne's Cathedral to pay tribute to Lyra McKee, we gave expression to the clear will and determination of all of the people of these islands to reject violence and to support peace and a better future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" It added: ""The aim of these talks is quickly to re-establish to full operation the democratic institutions of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement - the NI executive, assembly and North-South Ministerial Council - so that they can effectively serve all of the people for the future."" By Gareth Gordon, BBC News NI Political Correspondent Simon Coveney and Karen Bradley held a joint press conference Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley had already said she planned to hold talks about Stormont after the local government elections on 2 May. But several parties wrote urging her to convene discussions urgently in the wake of the killing of journalist Lyra McKee. Speaking alongside Mrs Bradley, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said: ""The next few days belong to Lyra McKee."" And there's no doubt without her death this announcement of a new talks process would not have happened. Mr Coveney showed his frustration with the Northern Irish parties saying ""in my experience it is never the right time"" for talks about restoring devolution. And in no other circumstances would a process be beginning in the three-week run up to what will be a hotly contested European election. Mr Coveney insisted this process must be different, but what he didn't tell us was how. There is no plan for an outside mediator and smaller parties - the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and Alliance - will have a bigger role. The process is to be finished by mid-summer, which Mr Coveney clarified did not mean mid-July (the height of the marching season). So now the hard part. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in can come together at a vigil or a funeral. Can they come together again in government? Maybe, but how they do it is far from clear. During a joint press conference with Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, Mrs Bradley said Ms McKee's ""tragic death cannot be in vain"". ""All of us must take inspiration from what Lyra achieved in her life and work even harder to make Northern Ireland a brighter, more peaceful and prosperous place for everyone."" Mrs Bradley added that Fr Magill's words during Wednesday's funeral had resonated ""across the world."" This video can not be played ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" Mr Coveney said: ""I think what every decent-thinking person in Northern Ireland wants now is to see us take that spark of determination that I think we have all felt in the last few days and to see if we can build a momentum from that to do something real and positive."" He also confirmed that the British-Irish Council would convene on 8 May, one day after the new talks process begins. Irish language act:Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP were thought to be close to a deal last year, buttalks broke down on St Valentine's Day 2018 due to a disagreement over a ""standalone"" Irish language act. Same-sex marriage:Sinn FÃ©in has campaigned for its legalisation but the DUP remains opposed.  The last time MLAs voted on the issue, support for same-sex marriage achieved a narrow majority, butthe DUP used a Stormont veto to block any change in the law. RHI scandal:Sinn FÃ©in walked out Stormont's power-sharing government in January 2017 in protest over the DUP's handling of a green energy initiativeknown as the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme.  Failure to control costs led to a huge projected overspend and the scheme became the subject of a public inquiry which is yet to release its final report. The council meeting will consider East/West relations, security cooperation, and political stability in Northern Ireland. The Irish foreign minister added that there was an ""urgent"" need for the latest negotiations to succeed. DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party welcomed the new round of negotiations and added that they would ""enter into these talks with a willingness to find a solution for everybody in Northern Ireland and to get a balanced deal for all of the people"". Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (centre) welcomed the talks but said they would be ""a test"" Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the new talks would be ""a test"" but said her party would ""not acquiesce in the denial of rights"". ""We have said that in the event of the DUP being unwilling or unable to deliver on the issue of marriage equality; on the issue of language rights; women's rights; victims' rights, then the intergovernmental conference should meet and it should actually remove those obstacles and that in itself would pave a way for the institutions to be restored."" In a statement, the White House expressed support for the talks and sympathy over Ms McKee's death. ""The United States welcomes the initiative today of the British and Irish governments to convene political talks in Northern Ireland,"" it said. ""We encourage Northern Ireland's political leaders to return to the negotiating table to restore the region's local government. ""We were shocked and saddened over the death of journalist Lyra McKee last week and reiterate our firm support for the Northern Ireland peace process."" The British and Irish governments are to review progress in the negotiations at the end of May.

"Ailing department store chain Debenhams has been rescued by its lenders after falling into administration. Three years ago, the 166-strong chain was worth Â£900m, compared with Â£20m as of this week. It's been one of the main draws of High Streets - and later, shopping centres - for years, and it has a venerable history. Its origins go back to 1778, when King George III was on the throne, when it opened as a drapers' store in central London. It expanded over the years and became a global business, with offices in South Africa, Australia, Canada and China. At one point, it owned upmarket department store Harvey Nichols. By 1950, Debenhams was the largest department store group in the UK, with 110 stores.Debenhams: Three things that went wrong Debenhams joined the stock market, for the third time, in 2006, with a worth of Â£1.7bn. Its share price hit 207p one day later - a level that it has never bettered since. We take a look at the key factors behind its demise. With hindsight, Debenhams' timing could hardly have been worse. Fashion is cyclical, but a new trend was beginning that turned out to be a game-changer. Laith Kalif at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown (HL) points out that a year after Debenhams floated in 2006, the iPhone was launched. That was a key element in the transformation of the way we shop for goods, helping the rush to online shopping with the extra ease and functionality of the app. Debenhams, of course, isn't alone in failing to see the future. Robert Hayton, from property adviser Altus Group, says that since 2010, almost a third of department stores in England and Wales have disappeared. They have ended up being converted for other types of use, split into smaller units or even demolished as the sector adapts to this fundamental structural change. As the shift to online grew and became entrenched, Debenhams remained a laggard compared with others, notably arch-rival John Lewis. Although not the only retail chain to fail to predict the future, the consistent lack of response to the unfolding trends eventually did for Debenhams, says Richard Lim from analysts Retail Economics. He says: ""Put simply, the business has been outmanoeuvred by more nimble competitors, failed to embrace change and was left with a tiring proposition. The industry is evolving fast and it paid the ultimate price."" On top of that, management failed to maintain the historic brand itself, says Simon Reynolds from branding consultancy Landor: ""It's a case of 'another one bites the dust' as the 240-year-old business falls into the hands of its lenders. ""Ultimately, Debenhams failed to establish a clear brand proposition for its customers. It couldn't demonstrate what made it different to its competitors and it lacked relevance to younger customers."" In 2006, Debenhams stuck fast to its expansion plans, seemingly unaware of changing trends. At that time, it had 120 stores and planned to double the number, piling on the costs as it became increasingly out of step with shoppers' buying habits. Hargreaves Lansdown says it managed to keep shoppers interested by eye-catching promotions, including its Blue Cross days, which featured generous discounting. Richard Hyman: ""The fundamental fact is its lack of relevance."" But the stockbroker says that came at the expense of profits: ""The problem with regular discounting is it becomes a self-propagating strategy. ""If customers are used to getting goods at a knock-down price, they hold off buying until there's a sale on."" Veteran independent retail consultant Richard Hyman says the heart of the matter is lack of relevance: ""It simply doesn't sell enough product. It's not sufficiently relevant. It isn't clear who it is targeting. That is the key issue - its relevance as a business. ""If you solved the immediate property problems, you'd still be left with the fundamental fact: it doesn't have enough sales. Its sales are static."" The weakening pound in the wake of the EU referendum also didn't help matters, increasing the cost of stocking the shelves with overseas goods. This physical expansion brought with it the soaring costs that have unhorsed so many other bricks-and-mortar retailers. Altus says these prime-sited large properties came with big rents, high rates and onerous lease liabilities, as well as large staffing needs and leases that were difficult to give up, All that ""conspired to create a beast that was unable to adapt in a fast-changing retail environment"". Altus says the revaluation of business rates in 2017 has seen the average rates bill for a large department store rise to Â£642,852 this year. That's up 26.9%, or Â£132,378, compared with the year before the revaluation came into effect. Hargreaves Lansdown says Debenhams stores have an average lease term of 18 years, while the department store currently has Â£4.3bn of minimum lease payments over the next 20-plus years under current arrangements. All these costs were rising while footfall through the shops and profit margins were falling, almost halving from 19% in 2006 to 10% today, according to Hargreaves Lansdown. Although revenues were higher than in 2011, when profit before tax peaked at Â£160.3m, last year Debenhams posted a pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m.

"Sergio Bucher joined Debenhams from Amazon Debenhams boss Sergio Bucher has stepped down following the recent takeover of the struggling department store chain by its lenders. Theretailer was taken over earlier this monthas part of an administration process. Mr Bucher's departure had been signalled over the weekend and he said on Thursday it was ""time to move on, knowing the company is in good hands"". Terry Duddy, non-executive chairman, will become interim executive chairman. Debenhams is the biggest department store chain in the UK with 166 stores. It employs about 25,000 people. Mr Bucher said: ""Now that our new financing facilities are in place, it is time to move on, knowing the company is in good hands with a plan that will deliver a sustainable future. ""I would like to wholeheartedly thank all of my colleagues for their efforts and dedication during such a turbulent time, as well as our suppliers, partners and of course customers for their continued support."" The group of lenders that now owns Debenhams - including banks such as Barclays and US hedge funds such as Silver Point and Golden Tree - have provided the retailer with Â£200m in funding. Debenhams: Three things that went wrong Unlikely stars bucking the High Street slump Mr Bucherhad already been voted off the retailer's boardafter major shareholders, Mike Ashley's Sports Direct and Landmark Group, had voted against his re-election in January. At the same time, Debenhams chairmanSir Ian Cheshire was voted off the boardand replaced by Mr Duddy, who was the senior independent director until then. As the search for a new chief executive began, Mr Duddy said: ""Debenhams now has a clear path towards a viable and sustainable future and we have Sergio and his team to thank for that."" Mr Duddy is an experienced retailer having been chief executive of the business that used to own Argos and Homebase until 2014. Debenhams said the new leadership would carry through the restructuring and turnaround of the business, whichhad reported record annual losses last year. Its stores will continue to trade as normal during the initial restructuring process, although some are expected to close in the future. The lenders took control after Sports Direct - which held a near 30% stake in Debenhams -made several offers to take it over. However, the final offer of Â£200m was rejected because it was conditional on Mr Ashley becoming chief executive. Mr Ashley subsequently described the Debenhams takeover by its lenders as a ""national scandal"" and called for the administration process to be reversed.

"Lloyds is repaying customers millions of pounds after finding administrative errors dating back to 2012. Nearly 200,000 current and former customers are receiving a share of repayments, thought to total about Â£6m. That means an average payment of Â£30. The banking group is writing to those affected - most of whom were not told about interest rate changes to their savings or current accounts. These customers may have missed out on better deals elsewhere as a result. The payments are calculated to put them in the position they would have found themselves had the rate not changed. As a result, payments will be different reflecting the amount people had in these accounts. Lloyds boss Horta-Osorio gives up final salary pension perk The blunder,revealed by MarketWatch,external, has been corrected, but was thought to have continued for some time. Customers of the various Lloyds Banking Group brands - the Halifax, Lloyds Bank, and Bank of Scotland - were affected. Those affected have been sent letters in April. Anyone who had left the bank, or who has moved home, would be traced, the bank said. A spokesman said that customers did not need to do anything at this stage, but they were free to complain subsequently if they remained unhappy with the situation. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has been informed by the bank of the situation and the remedy.

ESB Networks said power has been restored to more than 30,000 customers. The areas most affected were County Clare, west and north Kerry, west Limerick and parts of Tipperary. The damage was mainly due to trees falling on overhead lines. Thirty-three thousand customers were without power at one stage. Red weather warnings in place for some counties have been removed. Met Ãireann had also issued a gale warning for Saturday evening on Irish coastal waters, from Malin Head to Carlingford Lough to Wicklow Head and on the Irish Sea.

"The RSPB has parodied The Beatles' iconic Abbey Road image to promote the song The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has released a charity song to highlight Britain's declining bird numbers. Let Nature Sing features the song of 25 different threatened and endangered UK birds. Currently there are 67 species on the charity's ""red list"" of globally threatened species in severe decline. Among those most at risk are corncrakes, turtle doves, cuckoos, skylarks and nightingales. The RSPB says Britain has lost 40 million birds in the last 50 years and 56% of wildlife species in the UK are in decline. But a recent YouGov survey for the RSPB found only 15% of people in the UK believed nature was in crisis and more than a quarter thought nature was doing well. Allow YouTube content?

The RSPB hopes the two-minute track, which was released on Friday, will raise awareness about Britain's declining bird population. The conservation charity hopes the song will enter the UK charts in time for International Dawn Chorus Day on 5 May. If successful it will become the first track featuring just birdsong to make the charts. Famous songs which feature birdsong include Minnie Riperton's Lovin' You, which hit number two on the UK charts in 1975, and The Beatles' Blackbird which was released in 1968. Big Garden Birdwatch: Smallest birds 'hit by Beast from East' RSPB says Norfolk cliff netting 'will save sand martins from suffocating' Netting to stop birds nesting: Call for new safeguards Eight in 10 of the 2,083 British adults surveyed said they believed the government should be doing more to save nature. The survey also revealed young people were unaware of the crisis facing Britain's birds. The YouGov survey also found one in three 13 to 17-year-olds had no idea the UK had lost so many birds over the past half century. But after being told the statistics, more than a third of the 505 teenagers surveyed said they wanted to do something to save nature. Allow Twitter content?

Nightingales are on the RSPB's red at risk list ""We all need to start talking about this, and the Let Nature Sing track is a good starting point as it perfectly highlights the music we risk losing. ""Wildlife and our natural world can recover, it can be saved for future generations, but we need more people to talk about the issue and how much something as simple and wonderful as bird song means to each of us.

"This video can not be played Footage released by police shows suspected gunman New footage showing the suspected killer of journalist Lyra McKee moments before she was shot has been released by police. The 29-year-old was hit by a bullet while observing a riot in the Creggan area in Londonderry. Det Supt Jason Murphy said he believed the man in the images to be in his late teens, relatively short in height and with a stocky build. The gunman is one of three men seen in the footage. He first appears on the left of the screen, walking with another masked man. In one of the images, the man appears to have a gun in his right hand. In pictures: Mourners pay respects Profile: Lyra McKee Reward offered in Lyra McKee murder appeal Earlier this week,the New IRA said its members had carried out the killing. Areward of up to Â£10,000has been offered for information by the charity, Crimestoppers. On Friday, Det Supt Murphy appealed for anyone who recognises the men in the images to come forward and tell police. ""I believe the community has the information to help me unlock the key to Lyra McKee's murder,"" he said. ""I recognise people living in Creggan may feel it's difficult to come forward to speak to police. ""I want to provide a personal reassurance that we are able to deal with these concerns sensitively."" One week into the police investigation, detectives still have not recovered the weapon used in the attack. They are pleased that more than 140 people have provided them with information, but they need more. Forensic tests on the bullets fired suggest a weapon of similar calibre had been used in previous paramilitary-style attacks in the area. What detectives are doing now is piecing together the scientific and visual evidence, comparing it with witness statements, and seeing where it leads. The killing of Lyra McKee has kick-started Stormont talks which could potentially break the political deadlock. Police have their own job to do. And like the politicians, they have a long way to go. They are relying on the public for more information. Pictures of two other men, seen walking alongside the gunman shortly before the shooting, were also released. Police are appealing to anyone who recognises the man in the image, seen carrying a crate of petrol bombs One is seen carrying a crate of petrol bombs, while the other is described as wearing dark skinny jeans, blue Nike trainers with a white tick and a white sole. He is also seen wearing a camouflage scarf or other covering across his face.

"The area altered by the explosion is larger than expected The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft has sent back images of the crater made when it detonated an explosive charge next to the asteroid it is investigating. On 5 April, the Japanese probe released a 14kg device packed with plastic explosive towards the asteroid Ryugu. The blast drove a copper projectile into the surface, hoping to create a 10m-wide depression. Scientists want to get a ""fresh"" sample of rock to help them better understand how Earth and the other planets formed. Hayabusa-2 has now taken pictures of the area below where the ""small carry-on impactor"" (SCI) device was to have detonated, and identified a dark disturbance in which fresh material has been excavated from beneath the surface.

Scientists working on the Japanese Aerospace Agency (Jaxa) mission said the blast area on the surface measures about 20m in diameter - twice the size of the crater they expected to see. The mission's official account tweeted: ""We did not expect such a big alteration, so a lively debate has been initiated in the project!"" Because of the debris that would have been thrown up in this  event, Hayabusa-2 manoeuvred itself before the detonation to the far side of 800m-wide Ryugu - out of harm's way and out of sight. But the probe left a small camera behind called DCAM3 to observe the explosion. Artwork: Scientists want to retrieve a fresh sample of material from the crater Hayabusa-2 later returned to its ""home position"" about 20km above the asteroid's surface. From here, it conducted a search for the crater produced in the explosion. In coming weeks, scientists will command the probe to descend into the crater to collect its fresh samples. Because they will come from within the asteroid, they will be less altered by the harsh environment of space. Bombardment with cosmic radiation over the aeons is thought to change the surfaces of these planetary building blocks. Ryugu belongs to a particularly primitive type of space rock known as a C-type asteroid. It's a relic left over from the early days of our Solar System, and therefore records the conditions and chemistry of that time - some 4.5 billion years ago.

"Wildfires in Scotland are to be tackled by controlled burning for the first time. The increasing threat of wildfires has forced the fire service to begin training staff in the fire management method common in hot countries. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) issued 21 wildfire danger warnings last year. The service has warned climate change means wildfires are likely to be become more common in Scotland. Area manager Bruce Farquharson, who helped to coordinate the response this week to amajor wildfire in Moray, one of the largest in the UK for years, said: ""What we have seen over the last week is not surprising. ""When we have a cold winter, combined with easterly winds and then a warm spring - that is an ideal storm for wildfires to happen. ""Climate change is a factor, we are going to see drier winters and warmer springs so we are going to need to change the way we deal with wildfires."" The SFRS last year issued 21 fire danger warnings, which combine data about ground and weather conditions to predict the likelihood of wildfires. In 2017 only six warnings were issued and the year before there were only two. So far this year four warnings have been issued by the service, which has dealt with eight major wildfires since 18 April alone. Satellite images showed the large areas affected by the fire in Moray this week A wildfire around Knockando, Moray was thought to be out but six appliances had to return to the area when fresh fires were spotted on Thursday Mr Farquharson said the gravity of the threat now meant firefighters were being trained in controlled burning with a view to formally starting the practice next spring, most likely in the worst affected areas of the Highlands and Aberdeenshire. Controlled burning involves creating fires to remove the fuel, typically heather or grass, which keeps wildfires burning and forcing them to burn out. It is a technique that is used in countries that have severe wildfires, such as Australia or the United States, which haddevastating fires in California last year. In the UK, the South Wales Fire and Rescue servicestarting using the method last yearand was called in to help with the majorSaddleworth Moor firewhich occurred during the 2018 heatwave. A firefighter watches a controlled burn in the Sequoia National Forest, California, where the method of trying to stop the advance of wildfires has been used for decades Mr Farquharson tried the method himself in Spain last year where he and local firefighters put out a blaze covering several acres of scrubland on a remote hill without using a single drop of water. He explained: ""It might sound a bit odd to some but what we are aiming to do is to teach some of our key stations how to use fire to fight wildfires. ""You clear a strip of vegetation as a base using hand tools and you slowly burn back from that to create an ever widening area of what we call a black strip so that when the fire reaches this strip, it burns out itself. ""Gamekeepers have traditionally done it but the fire service has never done it in Scotland before."" Up to 80 firefighters were in attendance at the Moray blaze at its peak Working smarter to try and reduce the amount of ""back breaking work""  needed to deal with wildfires has also thrown up a perhaps unlikely new ally for firefighters- the leaf blower. Mr Farquharson, who is also chairman of the Scottish Wildfire Forum, continued:  ""The firefighters coming off the hill at Moray looked like they have been at war. ""That is why we are keen to get the controlled fire approach working but there are other methods, industrial standard leaf blowers are an awesome tool. ""Not on all fuel types, but certainly on heather and some types of grass, a leaf blower does the same job as beating a fire. ""Think about a birthday cake and blowing the candles out, a leaf blower does the same job and two people with leaf blowers can do same job as ten people with traditional beaters, in a fraction of the time."" SFRS area manager Bruce Farquharson is hopeful the controlled burning approach will reduce the impact of wildfires and make the work safer for firefighters The fire service is keen to increase public awareness of the dangers of wildfires and would also like to see a network of signs erected at popular countryside spots which tell people the current status of the wildfire threat. Mr Farquharson said better education of visitors to the countryside was also needed. He said: ""Disposable barbeques remain a problem but also the increase in wild camping can create issues, such as what appears to be a decrease in the knowledge of how to build and run a safe camp fire.""

But while the US-born duchess's background would be relevant to many across the globe, she also stressed she was not the first mixed-race member of the British monarchy. Baroness Scotland, who was herself born in the Commonwealth country of Dominica and brought up in the UK, was being interviewed by the Press Association to mark the family of nations' 70th anniversary. It is thought Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, was of African descent andshe has been described as Britain's first black queen. Meghan, who is due to give birth to her first child in the next few weeks, has taken on the role of patron of the Association of Commonwealth Universities and is vice president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust. Prince Harry is the trust's president and the Commonwealth's youth ambassador. Reality Check: Things you might not know about the Commonwealth Royal baby: What do we know? Who lived in Harry and Meghan's house? The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited Tonga as part of their first official tour last year About 2.4bn people live in theCommonwealth,external, which includes the UK, Canada, India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Rwanda, Mozambique, Nigeria, Malaysia, Singapore, Jamaica and Cyprus. About 60% of its citizens are aged 29 or under. The Queen heads the Commonwealth and Baroness Scotland said she had been a passionate supporter, adding that it had benefited from ""her wisdom, her support, and her total lifelong commitment"". Queen Charlotte was born in the German duchy of Mecklenberg-Strelitz in 1744. Married to King George III in 1761, she was the mother of two British monarchs - George IV and William IV. The City of Charlotte in North Carolina was named in her honour in 1768 and she died at Kew Palace in London in 1818. Historians have suggested she had African ancestry. They say this can be traced back to King Afonso III of Portugal, who in the 13th Century conquered Faro from the Moors and was thought to have had three children with the city governor's daughter. One of their sons, Martim Afonso Chichorro, is also said to have married into a family with black ethnicity. He and his wife, Ines Lourenco de Sousa de Valadares, founded the Portuguese house of Sousa-Chichorro, which had many descendents, including Queen Charlotte.

"Lloyds is repaying customers millions of pounds after finding administrative errors dating back to 2012. Nearly 200,000 current and former customers are receiving a share of repayments, thought to total about Â£6m. That means an average payment of Â£30. The banking group is writing to those affected - most of whom were not told about interest rate changes to their savings or current accounts. These customers may have missed out on better deals elsewhere as a result. The payments are calculated to put them in the position they would have found themselves had the rate not changed. As a result, payments will be different reflecting the amount people had in these accounts. Lloyds boss Horta-Osorio gives up final salary pension perk The blunder,revealed by MarketWatch,external, has been corrected, but was thought to have continued for some time. Customers of the various Lloyds Banking Group brands - the Halifax, Lloyds Bank, and Bank of Scotland - were affected. Those affected have been sent letters in April. Anyone who had left the bank, or who has moved home, would be traced, the bank said. A spokesman said that customers did not need to do anything at this stage, but they were free to complain subsequently if they remained unhappy with the situation. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has been informed by the bank of the situation and the remedy.

Sources close to International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt also denied they had been involved in the leak. Chancellor Philip Hammond said it was important to ""get to the bottom"" of what had happened and to protect the principle that the content of NSC meetings ""must never be repeated outside the room"". In February, a defence and security think tankwarned it would be ""naive"" and ""irresponsible""to allow Huawei to access the UK's telecommunications system - a claim dismissed by the Chinese embassy as ""scaremongering"". The Royal United Services Institute report said that if the Chinese tech giant was allowed to participate in the rollout of the new 5G mobile networks it could install a ""hidden backdoor"", giving the Chinese government access to the system. Butaccording to the Daily Telegraph,external, it was agreed at Tuesday's meeting of the National Security Council that Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" parts of the UK's 5G network, such as antennas. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and Downing Street said a final decision would be made at the end of spring.

"Lloyds is repaying customers millions of pounds after finding administrative errors dating back to 2012. Nearly 200,000 current and former customers are receiving a share of repayments, thought to total about Â£6m. That means an average payment of Â£30. The banking group is writing to those affected - most of whom were not told about interest rate changes to their savings or current accounts. These customers may have missed out on better deals elsewhere as a result. The payments are calculated to put them in the position they would have found themselves had the rate not changed. As a result, payments will be different reflecting the amount people had in these accounts. Lloyds boss Horta-Osorio gives up final salary pension perk The blunder,revealed by MarketWatch,external, has been corrected, but was thought to have continued for some time. Customers of the various Lloyds Banking Group brands - the Halifax, Lloyds Bank, and Bank of Scotland - were affected. Those affected have been sent letters in April. Anyone who had left the bank, or who has moved home, would be traced, the bank said. A spokesman said that customers did not need to do anything at this stage, but they were free to complain subsequently if they remained unhappy with the situation. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has been informed by the bank of the situation and the remedy.

"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable launches the Liberal Democrat European election campaign The Liberal Democrats have launched their European election campaign with an ""unambiguous"" pledge to stop Brexit. Leader Sir Vince Cable accused the Conservatives and Labour of a ""stitch-up"" and said a ""people's vote"" was the only way to end the Brexit ""paralysis"". He added it was ""a pity"" that fellow Remain-backing party Change UK had not agreed to running a combined campaign. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, after Brexit was delayed, amid continuing parliamentary deadlock. It means the UK must now hold European elections on 23 May, or leave on 1 June without a deal. European elections: Party-by-party UK guide How do European elections work? But if agreement can be reached among MPs before 22 May, the UK could cancel its participation in the European parliamentary elections. However, cross-party talks aimed at reaching consensus have yet to make significant progress. Speaking in Wapping, east London, Sir Vince said his ""exit from Brexit"" catchphrase had been regarded as a ""bit wacky"" when he first used it in July 2017 but was now ""the mainstream"". He likened the party's stance on Brexit to its opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq - backed by the Conservatives and Labour at the time. ""At the time we were regarded as way out on a limb, unpatriotic - and we were vindicated, we were proved right. And that's why I believe we will be right about Europe."" But he said he regretted that the Liberal Democrats were not standing on a common platform with other Remain-backing parties to stop Brexit. ""The Liberal Democrats made it very clear we were happy to work with others. It wasn't reciprocated and we are going our own way."" He describedreports of a leaked document,externalwhich suggests that newly formed Change UK will seek to ""win over"" Liberal Democrat supporters, as ""unfortunate"". Chris Leslie, the former Labour MP who quit the party to join Change UK,told Business Insider,externalan alliance between anti-Brexit parties ""wasn't ever on the agenda"", adding: ""They [the Lib Dems] have fallen below a critical mass and haven't had the drive to get out of that for a long time. We are starting afresh and don't come with that baggage."" Asked about the interview, Sir Vince said: ""There are millions of people out there willing us to work together and they will feel angry and betrayed if they find petty tribalism is trumping that - that's the old politics."" He said he expected the party to do well but added: ""It is a pity and I regret that we are not doing a combined campaign."" At the end of March, Prime Minister Theresa May said the public would find it ""unacceptable"" to have to elect a new group of 73 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU. But earlier this month, she agreed a Brexit delay to 31 October with the EU, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament.

Baroness Scotland, who was herself born in the Commonwealth country of Dominica and brought up in the UK, was being interviewed by the Press Association to mark the family of nations' 70th anniversary.

The Queen heads the Commonwealth and Baroness Scotland said she had been a passionate supporter, adding that it had benefited from ""her wisdom, her support, and her total lifelong commitment"". Queen Charlotte was born in the German duchy of Mecklenberg-Strelitz in 1744. Married to King George III in 1761, she was the mother of two British monarchs - George IV and William IV. The City of Charlotte in North Carolina was named in her honour in 1768 and she died at Kew Palace in London in 1818. Historians have suggested she had African ancestry. They say this can be traced back to King Afonso III of Portugal, who in the 13th Century conquered Faro from the Moors and was thought to have had three children with the city governor's daughter. One of their sons, Martim Afonso Chichorro, is also said to have married into a family with black ethnicity.

"The stencilled street art appeared at Marble Arch where climate activists had been based Speculation is mounting that Banksy was at Extinction Rebellion's London protests after the appearance of a mural at the group's Marble Arch base. The stencilled street art of a girl along with the words ""From this moment despair ends and tactics begin"" was found on a wall overnight. The site had been occupied by climate activists for nearly two weeks until protests ended on Thursday. Banksy has not confirmed if he was behind the work.

"Inspectors found a string of environmental breaches at the HES site in Shotts. Clinical waste firm Healthcare Environmental Services (HES) has gone into liquidation four months after all of its staff were made redundant. Accountants BDO have been appointed tothe Lanarkshire-based company which lost multi-million pound contracts with NHS Scotland and 17 trusts in England. About 150 jobs were lost at its Shotts HQ last year and staff have been pursuing legal action to recover wages. Lawyers acting for the workers believe they could be owed more than Â£1m. The liquidators are now seeking access to the company's books and records. Staff take HES to court over unpaid wages HES staff appeal to employer for lost wages Unpaid HES staff 'turning to food banks' Q&A: What has happened at clinical waste firm HES? HES had managed all of Scotland's clinical waste disposal before it was embroiled in a waste stockpiling scandal. Following the loss of the contracts, contingency measures had to be put in place across the whole of NHS Scotland. Company owner Garry Pettigrew had previously refused to put the company into administration and insisted he was not liable for the wages of former staff. David Martyn, of Thompsons Solicitors who have been acting on behalf of some former employees, said the latest move was a ""starting point"" towards getting the money they are owed. He toldthe BBC's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""Normally what happens when a company goes into administration is the employees can get their notice pay, any unpaid wages, holiday pay and things like that, from the government Insolvency Service. ""Of course, when the company doesn't got into administration, this puts the employees in a terrible situation. ""They have now had four or five months where they have not had their last month's wages and the notice periods they are entitled to. ""We have had terrible stories of people having to rely on food banks just to see them through."" HES owner Garry Pettigrew insisted he was not liable for money owed to staff Mr Martin added: ""We estimate that payments of over Â£1m are owed to these workers. Obviously that is a huge boost to the workers. ""We call on Mr Pettigrew to allow access to the books and the records, and that will allow these payments to be expedited. ""It will still be a couple of weeks before the applications will be made, but this is certainly the starting point in the workers finally getting the money they are owed."" James Stephen, a Glasgow-based partner at BDO, said HES had gone into liquidation at the request of one of its creditors. The petition was granted at Hamilton Sheriff Court on Thursday and was not opposed. Mr Stephen said: ""BDO have been appointed as liquidators by the court. We are now assessing the company's asset base. ""We will be working with all the relevant government agencies to make sure any health and safety issues at the site are taken into account. We'll be heavily involved in taking guidance from them."" A statement from HES said it was ""very sad to announce that we believe the company was placed into administration"". The firm said the ongoing medical waste crisis ""has been caused by a severe lack of high-temperature incineration capacity in the UK combined with more waste being sent for incineration by the NHS"". The statement added: ""The directors would like to thank our true loyal staff, friends, colleagues, suppliers, & loyal customers for 22 years, they know who they are."" The HES staff were made redundant after the company was caught up in a UK-wide waste stockpiling scandal. Healthcare Environmental Services (HES) inspectors found a string of environmental breaches at its Dundee and Shotts sites. They said both were failing to comply with enforcement notices over the proper storage of waste. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) confirmed it had been in contact with the liquidators, ""to whom environmental obligations under the environmental licences for both sites now fall"". A spokesman said: ""All contingency measures will ensure that environmental and human health are appropriately protected and, to date, our inspections have not identified any current risk of pollution from the waste stored on these sites.""

"This video can not be played London Marathon accused of discrimination London Marathon organisers have been accused of discrimination over their policy of excluding assisted runners. David and Sandra Kerr from County Down have run 35 marathons pushing their son, Aaron, in his adapted wheelchair. The Kerr family had asked London Marathon organisers if they could compete but were told it would be against the rules. ""An individual cannot be considered unless they are participating under their own power,"" said organisers. Aaron Kerr, 21, from Annahilt, does not speak, communicating solely through body language. He has a series of complex needs including cerebral palsy, epilepsy and a chromosome disorder which means he uses a wheelchair. Aaron was also born with chronic renal failure which resulted in a kidney transplant at the age of 13; his dad David was the donor. David and Sandra are Aaron's full time carers and in 2015 they caught the running bug. The family has completed in almost 150 running events, including 35 full marathons ""We started running in 2015 with a few park runs and we haven't looked back since, we haven't stopped running since,"" said David. The family has completed in almost 150 running events, including 35 full marathons, such as Manchester, Belfast and Dublin. They couple try to promote inclusivity and say their slogan is ""running and rolling together"". ""We just love spending time together as a family, it's quality time for us,"" said Sandra. ""It's great seeing Aaron about in the fresh air. Listen to Team Kerr on BBC Sounds here. ""For kids with complex needs, as they get older, stuff gets taken away from them, and it's hard to find things that as a family you can enjoy. ""The only thing that doesn't go away is disability."" The family has wanted to take part in the London Marathon, but so far that hasn't been possible. ""It's incredibly frustrating, the reason that they are giving to us is that Aaron can't complete the marathon on his own,"" said David. IAAF rules state: ""A competitor can be helped to an upright position, but that they cannot be helped in a forward motion."" The Kerrs say they have taken part in other IAAF events and aren't bothered about being competitors - they just want to take part. ""We've spoken to the IAAF ourselves and they have said that Aaron can take part as a non-participant (meaning his time would not be counted) at London's discretion,"" said David. The Kerr family is continuing to train for marathons that they are able to part in - starting with the Belfast City Marathon next weekend ""We just see it as discrimination against Aaron and it's very upsetting."" The family had hoped to run in a charity place with the Mae Murray Foundation, but when it found out that the Kerr family would not be allowed to enter the charity declined their offer to take part. The group's director, Alix Crawford, called on London Marathon organisers to explain ""why it is lagging behind other major marathons by continuing to exclude certain disadvantaged groups of people from within society from taking part. ""It is astonishing that the London Marathon, one of the UK's flagship sporting events, should take a stance against the inclusion of those with profound and lifelong disability,"" she said. The charity has protested by giving up its space and has asked London mayor Sadiq Khan to intervene. Nick Bitel, Chief Executive of London Marathon Events Ltd, said organisers had explained the rules to the family ""in some detail"". ""An individual cannot be considered a competitor in the London Marathon unless they are participating in the event under their own power,"" he said. ""Some races do permit non-competitors to be pushed or carried. Every race is different. The London Marathon has high runner density, some very narrow roads on the course and some steep hills. ""This is a combination that other events may not have. ""London Marathon Events is proud of all it has done to develop and promote para-sport and always works to encourage participation in our events by people with a disability. ""We support many, many people with a disability to complete the London Marathon - just not when they are being pushed by another person, as this contravenes the rules."" In the meantime, the Kerr family is continuing to train for marathons that they are able to part in - starting with the Belfast City Marathon next weekend.

"Chvrches say they are ""confused and disappointed"" by producer Marshmello's decision to work with Chris Brown. The Scottish band wrote on Instagram: ""Working with people who are predators and abusers enables, excuses and ultimately tacitly endorses that behaviour."" Chris Brown admitted assaulting his then girlfriend, Rihanna, in 2009. Chvrches posted the message after the release of Marshmello's new track, which features the US singer. Radio 1 Newsbeat has contacted Marshmello for a comment but he hasn't replied yet. Chvrches posted this message on Instagram Chvrches recently collaborated with electronic dance music producer Marshmello on the track Here With Me. In the statement they say while they respect him as a person they don't agree with his decision to work with Chris Brown and Tyga. Marshmello Hours later, Chvrches lead singer Lauren Mayberry posted details of abusive messages she had received from one person in response to her original Instagram post, who called Chvrches' song with Marshmello a ""flop"". She captioned the picture: ""Angry men on the internet can call me all the names they want. ""I still think domestic abuse is wrong. Peace out, internet. Tomorrow is a brand new day."" Chris Brown, 29, admitted assaulting Rihanna as they made their way to the Grammy Awards in 2009. He was sentenced to five years' probation and six months' community service. Tyga and Chris Brown Tyga, who also features on Marshmello's song Light It Up, is well known for having dated Kylie Jenner. The rapper, 29, and reality TV show star eventually went public with their relationship in 2015. Although he continually denied that they'd been dating before she was 18. Tyga's representatives are also on record as having denied allegations that the musician exchanged sexually-charged messages with a 14-year-old girl. The star's management team said he had been messaging her about working on some music together. Chvrches - a trio from Glasgow and fronted by Lauren Mayberry - are known for being publically vocal about social issues. Duringan interview with the BBC in 2018Lauren spoke out about misogyny in the music industry and reflected on the #MeToo movement. Lauren Mayberry is the lead singer of Chvches ""It's great that people are waking up and having that conversation, but it has to be more than a symbolic gesture,"" she said. ""Yes, it's great that you kicked Harvey Weinstein out of the Academy but Roman Polanski's still in there, Woody Allen's still in there, Bill Cosby's still in there. More than 80 womenhave accused Harvey Weinsteinof varying degrees of sexual misconduct going back decades. Movie producer Harvey Weinstein leaves a court in Manhattan, New York in January 2019 A spokesperson for the movie producer has said ""any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied"" and there were ""never any acts of retaliation"" against women who turned him down. Director Roman Polanski, who now lives in France, fled the US in 1978 when he admitted unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl. Woody Allen's adopted daughter Dylan has said he molested her in 1992 when she was seven, which he strongly denies. Bill Cosby is awaiting sentencing after being found guilty of three counts of sexual assault, each of which carries a potential 10 years in prison.

"The stencilled street art appeared at Marble Arch where climate activists had been based Speculation is mounting that Banksy was at Extinction Rebellion's London protests after the appearance of a mural at the group's Marble Arch base. The stencilled street art of a girl along with the words ""From this moment despair ends and tactics begin"" was found on a wall overnight. The site had been occupied by climate activists for nearly two weeks until protests ended on Thursday. Banksy has not confirmed if he was behind the work.

"Charlie Parkes has autism, sensory processing issues, hypermobility, allergies, digestive problems, anxiety and attachment disorder When five-year-old Charlie Parkes was in the womb, a scan revealed a problem with his brain. He spent his first two years of life in hospital having tests. His parents were desperate for answers - but they never came. ""We have lots of little pieces of a puzzle, but they don't quite fit together. We haven't completed the picture yet,"" says his mother Laura. Charlie is one of about 6,000 children born every year with a genetic condition so rare that doctors can't identify it and instead classify it as a Swan (Syndrome Without a Name). Each case is thought to be one of a kind. Without a diagnosis, families can feel isolated and face a battle for treatment, Mrs Parkes said. Laura and Steve Parkes say they are ""unbelievably proud"" of their children Charlie and Chloe Alongside sensory processing issues, hypermobility, allergies, a weakened immune system, digestive and bowel problems, anxiety and attachment disorder, Charlie is on the autism pathway and doctors are looking into a possible connective tissue condition. ""We were suddenly thrust into this world of tube feeding and medicine schedules. We felt very alone. At one point we were under 20 different doctors for different issues. ""Not having a diagnosis very often means you don't tick boxes. We've had to fight for everything, every service, every bit of extra support and equipment."" Charlie, who lives in Corby, Northamptonshire, did not babble or sit up like other babies. But florist Mrs Parkes and her husband Steve were not worried about him missing milestones - they were too busy keeping him alive. ""It was terrifying how quickly he could deteriorate as a baby, suddenly we'd be searching for the oxygen and calling the ambulance,"" she said. Charlie spent the first two years of his life in hospital as doctors tried to work out what was wrong with him The tractor-loving boy seems like any other young child on the surface, but that is part of the problem, according to his mother. ""We've been made to feel like it was our fault, even by medical professionals. ""We've lost family and friends and have been accused of making up Charlie's problems because we don't have a diagnosis people can just 'Google'. ""I particularly have struggled with my mental health as a result."" Charlie attends a mainstream school and Mrs Parkes said she was so proud of her ""unbelievably cheeky"" little boy, who has recently learnt to hold a pencil.

"Just how far can you get in the New York City socialite scene without a real fortune of your own? Incredibly far, in the case of Anna Delvey - real name Anna Sorokin - who tricked the city's elite into thinking she was a billionaire heiress. She hired a private jet, went to all the best parties, and threw cash at everyone she saw  - a $100 (Â£78) tip if you carried her bag or were her Uber driver. Yet, ultimately, her time at the top was short-lived. And it unravelled spectacularly. In real life, Sorokin had no multi-million-dollar trust fund. According to New York Magazine, her father is a former trucker, who runs a heating-and-cooling business. After her credit cards began to fail - repeatedly - and she was kicked out of the luxury hotels she lived in, other people were left to pick up the bills. Following a month-long trial, Sorokin has now been found guilty of multiple offences, including stealing more than $200,000. ""As proven at trial, Anna Sorokin committed real white-collar felonies over the course of her lengthy masquerade,"" District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement announcing the conviction. Sorokin, who chose not to testify and pleaded not guilty, now faces up to 15 years in prison and will be sentenced on 9 May. So how did this woman in her mid-20s cause financial chaos across a city, leaving people picking up her tabs in the US and beyond? Anna Delvey came to New York City on a mission. At least that is what she told people. She wanted to start an arts centre, with a chic Soho House ethos. She was considering calling it the Anna Delvey Foundation, according to New York Magazine, and she claimed to have lined up renowned artist Christo for the inauguration. For the venue, she had her eye on a six-floor space - 45,000 sq ft (4,200 sq m) - in Church Missions House, a prestigious, late 19th Century building, on the corner of Park Avenue and 22nd Street. There is a certain lifestyle that goes with such bold claims - and she was living it. Jered Threatin: The fake rock star Fyre: the world's biggest festival flop Speaking at the trial's opening, defence lawyer Todd Spodek said: ""Anna had to fake it until she could make it."" He told jurors that Sorokin was ""easily seduced by glamour and glitz"" when she saw how wealth - or the illusion of wealth - opened doors. Anna Sorokin (right), then known as Anna Delvey, at a fashion event at a New York hotel in 2014 According to court documents, Sorokin represented herself as a German heiress with $60m in assets to try to get a loan of $22m for her foundation. She presented forged bank statements and would deposit bad cheques, then withdraw the money before they bounced. Her attempt to get the major loan ultimately failed, and she was found not guilty on a count related specifically to this. However, prosecutors said that, while she never managed to secure millions, she did get a temporary $100,000 overdraft with City National Bank - based on forged proof of foreign assets - but she failed to repay it with a wire transfer, as promised. Instead, they say, she went on a one-month shopping spree, spending $55,000 on ""her upkeep at 11 Howard [a luxury hotel], high-end fashion purchases from Net-a-Porter and Forward by Elyse Walker, sessions with a personal trainer, Apple, and other personal expenses"". Her lawyer said she never intended to commit a crime. ""In her world, this is what her social circle did,"" he told the jury. ""Everyone's life was perfectly curated for social media. People were fake. People were phoney. And money was made on hype alone."" ""Wannabe socialite busted for skipping out on pricey hotel bills"", reada July 2017 headline in the New York Post,external. This was followed, in April 2018, by aconfessional first-person piece in Vanity Fair,externalby one of the magazine's photojournalists, saying she had been hoodwinked by Ms Sorokin. Rachel DeLoache Williams became a key witness in the trial, and her accusations formed one of the larceny charges. ""I wish I had never met Anna,"" she said in the courtroom during a tear-soaked testimony. She said she had met her at Manhattan nightclub Happy Ending, where Sorokin held court with tales of her proposed arts foundation and then picked up the tab for a bottle of vodka. They became friends. Ms Williams wrote in her article about being seduced by the apparent ""glamorous, frictionless"" lifestyle. She enjoyed going out for espresso martinis and fancy dinners. Anna usually paid, referring to her trust fund, and this culminated in her inviting Ms Williams on a trip to Morocco. Ms Williams wrote: ""Anna also invited her personal trainer, along with a friend of mine - a photographer - whom, at a dinner the week before our trip, Anna had asked to come as a documentarian, someone to capture video."" In the courtroom, she said Ms Sorokin asked her to reserve a luxury, $7,000-per-night riad in Marrakesh, complete with three bedrooms, a private swimming pool and a dedicated butler. She said it was always intended that Ms Sorokin would pay the bill, but when they came to check out, her credit cards did not work. Put on the spot, Ms Williams ended up footing the bill for the entire trip, which, including extras, came to approximately $62,000 for a six-night stay. However, Sorokin was acquitted of the charge related to that bill. The jury did not consider it theft. The photojournalist said she was left in tears and suffering regular panic attacks, consumed by the stress of trying to retrieve the money. ""It was a magic trick,"" she wrote at the conclusion of her story. ""I'm embarrassed to say that I was one of the props, and the audience, too. Anna's was a beautiful dream of New York, like one of those nights that never seems to end. And then the bill arrives."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Though Ms Williams' magazine article had had people talking, it was anan article in New York Magazine in May 2018,external, by journalist Jessica Pressler, that really blew the lid on the scandal. She interviewed various people who had come across Sorokin, including a concierge, Neffatari ""Neff"" Davis, also in her mid-20s, who worked at the 11 Howard hotel. Ms Davis said Sorokin arrived at the newly opened Soho hotel like a whirlwind in April 2017, block-booking a deluxe room (around $400 a night). Gestures, such as allegedly paying a personal trainer $4,500 in a cash advance, gave the impression she was wallowing in money. She also spent an inordinate amount of time at the concierge desk, said Ms Davis. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Usually tourists just come in and ask how to get to the Statue of Liberty,"" Ms Davis later told New York art and fashion magazine Paper. ""But then, you have this girl who's draped in Rick Owens, huge CÃ©line glasses, messy hair, European accent, hundreds of dollars of bills on her and she's literally just giving it to me, for my time?"" She said she was used to being a makeshift therapist for guests travelling on their own. ""It's really none of my business where the money comes from,"" she said. But somewhere along the line, 11 Howard had made an apparent error of judgement. Staff had not got a credit card on file for Ms Sorokin. A major dispute broke out, according to Ms Davis. However - perhaps surprisingly - Sorokin did eventually settle that debt. She used the money from the City Bank overdraft. In court, her lawyer said that his client ""believed that she would have the funds to pay every single person back"". This was the crux of her case. But jurors were not convinced. Many people have said this whole story is so specific to New York's young socialites; how some people move in circles where they don't know their friends' surnames or background; how what matters most is the night out, the connections, the name-drops, the moment. Sorokin's lawyer was keen to play into this. ""Any millennial will tell you, it is not uncommon to have delusions of grandeur,"" he said in court. But writer and psychologist Maria Konnikova, the author of The Confidence Game - a book about con artistry - believes the case is full of elements that are both timeless and universal. ""People love to think they are idiosyncratic, but this has happened over and over and over again, everywhere. Anna Delvey fit the New York scene, but this could have happened in London and even in a small town, if certain things were adapted."" Allow Instagram content?

""Claiming to have an aristocratic edge is something that has been done for hundreds of years,"" she says. ""In the past, people would take out newspaper adverts, or befriend gossip columnists, or get photographed with the right people to bolster their credibility."" But social media has made it easier, she concedes. ""The barrier of entry is so much lower. We accept so much at face value, and we put so much out there."" Theoretically you should be able to vet people better, she says, but people are not being savvy. Sorokin was an active Instagram user, building a profile that made her look like a mover on the arts scene. Eileen Kinsella has been covering the story from the courtroom forNew York-based art market website, Artnet,external. She says it has made the art world sit up because there are always concerns about being duped. ""You often don't know who is on the other side of a transaction, and people do buy things they can't afford,"" she says. She also says the city has been on a particularly high alert since one of its most-established galleries - Knoedler - was exposed in 2012 for selling fake works, supposedly by the likes of Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko. ""People went to incredible lengths to make things seem authentic. It had huge implications."" One of her Artnet colleagues, critic Ben Davis, also wrote a pieceanalysing the art content of Sorokin's Instagram account,external, noting her use of familiar hashtags, and posting works from major events: Frieze, Art Basel, the Venice Biennale and the openings at Pace Gallery. It was, he concluded, a ""thin tissue of celebrity and scene-y artists"". However, he added that the envy generated by social media has become a kind of currency of its own, and she had managed to create ""crisply curated fabulousness"". The New York Magazine story about Sorokin's ruse was almost instantly optioned by Netflix, and linked with producer Shonda Rimes (Grey's Anatomy, Scandal). Ms Williams' story is being adapted for HBO, with writer Lena Dunham working on the screenplay. Ms Williams has also signed a book deal with Simon and Schuster. People have been captivated by the idea of Sorokin's apparent audacity, and yet also left with so many questions: Why? What was the end game? Where did she come from? How come no-one guessed sooner? (Some have said that her unkempt hair should have been a giveaway. People who live in hotels have time on their hands for daily blow-dries. In court, Ms Williams said there were, in hindsight, plenty of ""red flags"".) There were rumours that Jennifer Lawrence might take the title role in the adaptation, however, the Oscar winner was then signed up to play another so-called ""millennial scammer"" - Elizabeth Holmes, the deep-voiced entrepreneur who fraudulently built up the Silicon Valley company, Theranos. Ms Holmes' story has become the subject of various documentaries and podcasts. As has that of Billy McFarland, who created the infamous and completely hollow Fyre Festival. Both characters have been the subject of hit documentaries. Billy McFarland (R) with former Fyre Festival employee Andy King, who became a memorable character in the Netflix documentary TV critic Scott Bryan, who co-hosts BBC Must Watch, says such documentaries have become huge hits because they explore social media stories in such depth. ""The documentary that followed then provided a great amount of context and insight into how it all spiralled out of control and viewers learnt so much more than what they did from the original news story, when they initially thought that they weren't going to do so. When these documentaries are done well, they can be equally, if not more compelling, than when we heard the story first time round,"" he says. Theranos founder in $700m fraud charge Celebrity parents and the bizarre 'cheating' scandal In the case of Sorokin, some already view her as a sort of antihero. They admire her for gaming a system that few people will ever have access to. Last summer, T-shirts saying Free Anna Delvey became the ironic must-have for Brooklynites. New York Magazine - via its website The Cut - also also saw an opportunity to profit off the story it had made viral and added a range of slogan tees to its online shop: ""Fake German Heiress""; ""My other shirt will wire you $30,000"". Marie Claire magazine also exploredthe outpouring of enthusiasm for the story,external. ""No-one died as a result of her actions, she just made rich people look like idiots,"" it said. However, it also recognised the story's alleged victims, notably Ms Williams. Anna Sorokin was held in New York's notoriously tough Rikers Island jail ahead of her trial. Since her detention, she has not been Instagramming from the inside, according to jail officials. After her detention, one of her posts was tagged with a Rikers location (""Throwback Thursday to @LeCouCou_NYC""), but the authorities say someone else must be managing the account. She appears, however, to still be curating her image. She reportedly told Ms Davis - who remains a friend - that she would prefer if Margot Robbie played her in the Netflix production. And she also worked with a stylist, Anastasia Walker, to get her courtroom look during the trial. She arrived in the court room on the first day dressed in stylish black glasses and a matching choker, and went on to parade a number of other designer outfits: Saint Laurent, Michael Kors, Victoria Beckham. Ms Walker toldElle magazine the look was ""mysterious chic,external"". One day, the proceedings were delayed because of wardrobe troubles and Justice Diane Kiesel gave her a verbal dressing down. ""This is unacceptable and inappropriate,"" she said. ""This is not a fashion show."" Yet multiple media outlets pulled together galleries of her in-court fashion, and an Instagram account (@annadelveycourtlooks,external) has picked up a few thousand followers. Ultimately her lawyer, Todd Spodek, was keen to paint this as a New York story, referencing the Frank Sinatra song in his opening and closing statements. ""In a city that favours money and the appearance of money... they both created their own opportunities,"" he said. ""She was creating a business that she believed would work and she was buying time,"" he argued. Anna Sorokin was a part of it. But not for long. She was found guilty on Thursday of four counts of theft of services, three counts of grand larceny and one count of attempted grand larceny, and acquitted of one count of grand larceny and one count of attempted grand larceny. She also declined a plea deal, which could have resulted in a more lenient sentence if she agreed to return to Germany, where she lived after the age of 16, having been born in Russia. She now faces deportation to Germany because she has overstayed her visa.

"This video can not be played The moment of the blast was caught on CCTV Two workers suffered burns in an early hours explosion at Tata's biggest steelworks plant in the UK. Residents living near the Port Talbot plant heard a ""massive"" blast shortly after 03:30 BST. Images and footage posted on social media showed a huge mushroom cloud and plumes of smoke rising above the plant. Tata Steel said the explosion came from a train carrying molten metal. It said the workers had received treatment for minor injuries. ""The spillage led to a number of fires which were extinguished by our own emergency services supported by members of the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service,"" it said in a statement. Why is Port Talbot steelworks important? 18 years since steel site's fatal blast BBC Wales understands the explosion happened on a stretch of railway track between the engineering shops and the locomotive repair shops. Stephen Davies from the Unite union believed a train - carrying a ""torpedo"" which holds the molten metal - derailed, leading to the metal coming into contact with cold water. He said: ""They [the men] were both on the train. One of them is close to retirement and the other is younger."" One of them had a burn to the head and the other to the chest, he added. The site reopened by 07:00 although production at blast furnaces four and five have been halted until all checks had been completed, Mr Davies said. Pictures show ""torpedo"" which was carrying the molten metal, ended up on its side Lance Davies, 36, who lives at the highest point in the town overlooking it and the steelworks, said it was a ""miracle"" no-one was killed. ""I was woken up this morning by what sounded like thunder. I went to the window and could see the results of the first explosion, then I called my partner and saw the other two,"" he added. ""That was all you could see - it was like a scene from Independence Day - a big ball of flame, followed by a massive mushroom of smoke. It was unbelievable."" Sharon Freeguard, a Neath Port Talbot councillor, said: ""I thought I heard about two to three explosions. It was extremely frightening. This video can not be played Tata Steel said the explosion came from a train used to carry molten metal ""The house just shook, so it was quite alarming. Once it was over, I did wonder what it was and just did think about the works. ""We're just all relieved that there are no fatalities."" Local resident Craig Williams said he heard ""an almighty bang"", adding: ""It's very unusual to hear something of that magnitude. ""The house shook a little. It's not something we are accustomed to."" CCTV footage from a house captured the explosion Some of the buildings near where the blast took place Mr Williams said Port Talbot ""revolves around this plant"" and it helps to ""bring the community together"". The steelworks is the largest in the UK and employs more than 4,000 people. Helicopters were circling overhead and South Wales Police said it received ""numerous calls"" shortly after 03:30 ""reporting an explosion"" which, they said, had caused damage to some buildings on the site. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said 10 appliances it sent to the scene had left by 08:40. The Health and Safety Executive added it would be making contact with the emergency services. An investigation into the cause of the explosion has begun The explosion was heard as far away as Bridgend, 14 miles (22km) from the blast, and the National Police Air Service's St Athan wing confirmed a helicopter had been scrambled to the scene. Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said safety at the plant had improved ""massively"" since 2001, when three workers were killed in a blast. He said he had spoken with Tata bosses,externalon Friday and was told a review was under way into the cause. ""We've got to understand why it happened and make sure it doesn't happen again,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We are investigating the cause of the incident and are working closely with relevant agencies including the Health and Safety Executive,"" it said.

"Ferry firm P&O is taking legal action against the UK government, claiming a rival was unlawfully handed Â£33m of taxpayers' money. Last month, theDepartment for Transport (DfT) was forced to settle with train operator Eurotunnel, which had challenged the procurement of no-deal Brexit shipping contracts. As part of the deal, Eurotunnel agreed to make improvements to its terminal. P&O argues that this put its business at a ""competitive disadvantage"". Eurotunnel's case came after the DfT awarded contracts worth more than Â£100m in total to three firms - Brittany Ferries, DFDS and Seaborne Freight. The companies were to provide extra capacity across the Channel in the event that a no-deal Brexit led to congestion at UK ports. Eurotunnel is set to upgrade its facilities following its settlement with the government In February, the DfT was forced to cancel its contract with Seaborne,which the BBC found had never run a ferry service. The government was criticised for not having run a full public procurement process, and Eurotunnel subsequently sued, claiming it had never been considered for a contract, despite having previously run a cross-channel ferry service. The DfT, led by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, settled the claim out of court for Â£33m. The government was keen to stress that the money would be used by Eurotunnel to upgrade its facilities in Folkestone, including installing new scanners and changing traffic routing. At the time, experts said that this provision could amount to illegal state aid. Andrew Dean, from law firm Clifford Chance said it ""could be construed as another piece of public procurement without open and transparent competition"". Chris Grayling has come under fire for his handling of the no-deal Brexit contracts P&O, which did not bid for the original ferry contracts, is now challenging the Eurotunnel settlement. ""We have repeatedly made clear during decades of providing vital transport services between Britain and the Continent that we are happy to compete with other providers on a level playing field. ""We also fully accept that it was prudent of the government to make contingency plans to protect international supply chains in the event of a hard Brexit. ""However, we do not believe that the payment of Â£33m of public money to Eurotunnel to settle its legal challenge to these plans is fair or reasonable. ""It is explicitly designed to be invested in the tunnel's infrastructure and if left unchallenged would put our services at a competitive disadvantage."" A government spokeswoman said: ""We are confident we acted appropriately in reaching the agreement with Eurotunnel."" By Emily Heard, Head of Procurement, Competition and State Aid at law firm Bevan Brittan P&O's potential grounds include a claim that the Â£33m payment to Eurotunnel amounts to a contract, which should have been advertised under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015. The remedies include setting aside the contract, damages and a fine. The interesting question here is whether securing ""Improvement Projects"" as part of the Eurotunnel settlement agreement turns an otherwise lawful settlement agreement into an unlawful public contract. P&O may also be arguing that the settlement amounts to unlawful state aid, on the grounds that it confers an advantage on Eurotunnel over its competitors. If unlawful state aid is found, the government would have to recover the aid in full, with interest, and damages may be payable to P&O. The extent to which the settlement represents fair value will be highly relevant here.

"This video can not be played Putin and Kim toast at the summit in Vladivostok North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has accused the US of acting in ""bad faith"" during the summit earlier this year with President Donald Trump, according to the Korean Central News Agency. He also said peace in the Korean peninsula would depend entirely on Washington. Mr Kim made his remarks at Thursday's summit with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Vladivostok. The North Korean leader departed Vladivostok on Friday. Russian media had reported that Mr Kim would be visiting the city's aquarium and seeing a ballet, however his visit was cut short. It is unclear why. Kim Jong-un smiles as he departs Vladivostok KCNA reported that President Putin had accepted an invitation to visit North Korea. The visit would take place ""at a convenient time"", the news agency added. During the meeting, Kim Jong-un reportedly told Vladimir Putin that ""the situation on the Korean peninsula and the region is now at a standstill and has reached a critical point"". He warned the situation ""may return to its original state as the US took an unilateral attitude in bad faith"" during recent talks. It comes a week after Pyongyang accused the US of derailing peace talks. The secret world of Russia's North Korean workers What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Negotiations between the two countries broke down during a summit in Vietnam in February, with no deal reached over North Korea's nuclear weapons. Those talks reportedly stalled over North Korea's demand for full economic sanctions relief in return for some denuclearisation commitments - a deal the US was not willing to make. During Thursday's summit in Vladivostok, President Putin attempted to act as arbiter,saying Mr Kim needed international security guarantees if he was to end his nuclear programme. Mr Kim travelled on his armoured train Such guarantees would need to be offered within a multinational framework, the Russian leader added. ""We need to... return to a state where international law, not the law of the strongest, determines the situation in the world,"" Mr Putin said. Mr Kim greeted Russian officials warmly when he arrived in Russia on Wednesday. He praised the summit as a ""very meaningful one-on-one exchange,"" and said he hoped to usher in a ""new heyday"" between Moscow and Pyongyang. The two leaders agreed to seek stronger relations. However nothing has been publicly reported about agreements on US sanctions and North Korea's nuclear weapons. Mr Putin is now attending a two-day summit in China, where he said he would inform China's leadership about the talks. He also said he was willing to share details with the US. According to Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin believes the six-party talks on North Korea are the only efficient way of addressing nuclear weapons on the peninsula. This video can not be played Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un meet in Vladivostok Those talks, which began in 2003, involve the two Koreas as well as China, Japan, Russia and the US. They are currently stalled, however. ""There are no other efficient international mechanisms at the moment,"" Mr Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. ""But, on the other hand, efforts are being made by other countries. Here all efforts merit support as long as they really aim at de-nuclearisation and resolving the problem of the two Koreas."" The visit was widely viewed as an opportunity for North Korea to show it has powerful allies following the breakdown of talks with the US. The country has blamed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the collapse of the Hanoi summit. Earlier this monthNorth Korea demanded that Mr Pompeo be removed from nuclear talks, accusing him of ""talking nonsense"" and asking for someone ""more careful"" to replace him. The summit was also an opportunity for Pyongyang to show that its economic future does not depend solely on the US, and for Russia to show that it is an important player on the Korean peninsula. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Yongbyon: Inside Trump and Kim's deal-breaker Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea President Putin had been eager to meet the North Korean leader for some time. Yet amid the two Trump-Kim summits, the Kremlin had been somewhat sidelined. Russia, like the US and China, is uncomfortable with North Korea being a nuclear state. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union (of which Russia is the main successor state) maintained close military and trade links with its communist ally, North Korea, for ideological and strategic reasons. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, trade links with post-communist Russia shrank and North Korea leaned towards China as its main ally. Under President Putin, Russia recovered economically and in 2014 he wrote off most of North Korea's Soviet-era debt in a major goodwill gesture. While it is arguable how much leverage Russia has with the North today, Mr Kim's regime regards it as one of the least hostile foreign powers.

As part of the deal, Eurotunnel agreed to make improvements to its terminal. P&O argues that this put its business at a ""competitive disadvantage"". Eurotunnel's case came after the DfT awarded contracts worth more than Â£100m in total to three firms - Brittany Ferries, DFDS and Seaborne Freight. The companies were to provide extra capacity across the Channel in the event that a no-deal Brexit led to congestion at UK ports. Eurotunnel is set to upgrade its facilities following its settlement with the government In February, the DfT was forced to cancel its contract with Seaborne,which the BBC found had never run a ferry service. The government was criticised for not having run a full public procurement process, and Eurotunnel subsequently sued, claiming it had never been considered for a contract, despite having previously run a cross-channel ferry service. The DfT, led by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, settled the claim out of court for Â£33m. The government was keen to stress that the money would be used by Eurotunnel to upgrade its facilities in Folkestone, including installing new scanners and changing traffic routing. At the time, experts said that this provision could amount to illegal state aid. Andrew Dean, from law firm Clifford Chance said it ""could be construed as another piece of public procurement without open and transparent competition"". Chris Grayling has come under fire for his handling of the no-deal Brexit contracts P&O, which did not bid for the original ferry contracts, is now challenging the Eurotunnel settlement. ""We have repeatedly made clear during decades of providing vital transport services between Britain and the Continent that we are happy to compete with other providers on a level playing field. ""We also fully accept that it was prudent of the government to make contingency plans to protect international supply chains in the event of a hard Brexit. ""However, we do not believe that the payment of Â£33m of public money to Eurotunnel to settle its legal challenge to these plans is fair or reasonable. ""It is explicitly designed to be invested in the tunnel's infrastructure and if left unchallenged would put our services at a competitive disadvantage."" A government spokeswoman said: ""We are confident we acted appropriately in reaching the agreement with Eurotunnel."" By Emily Heard, Head of Procurement, Competition and State Aid at law firm Bevan Brittan P&O's potential grounds include a claim that the Â£33m payment to Eurotunnel amounts to a contract, which should have been advertised under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015. The remedies include setting aside the contract, damages and a fine. The interesting question here is whether securing ""Improvement Projects"" as part of the Eurotunnel settlement agreement turns an otherwise lawful settlement agreement into an unlawful public contract. P&O may also be arguing that the settlement amounts to unlawful state aid, on the grounds that it confers an advantage on Eurotunnel over its competitors. If unlawful state aid is found, the government would have to recover the aid in full, with interest, and damages may be payable to P&O. The extent to which the settlement represents fair value will be highly relevant here.

"People in the poll were asked about emotions such as feeling stressed or happy People around the world are becoming more angry, stressed and worried, according to a new global survey. Of some 150,000 people interviewed in over 140 countries, a third said they suffered stress, while at least one in five experienced sadness or anger. The annualGallup Global Emotions Report,externalasked people about their positive and negative experiences. The most negative country was Chad, followed by Niger. The most positive country was Paraguay, the report said. The US was the 39th most positive country, the UK was 46th and India ranked 93rd. Researchers focused on the experiences of participants the day before the survey took place. Interviewees were asked questions such as ""did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?"" and ""were you treated with respect?"" in a bid to gain an insight into people's daily experiences. Finland 'world's happiest place' in 2018 Can we be as happy as Scandinavians? Around 71% of people said they experienced a considerable amount of enjoyment the day before the survey. The poll found that levels of stress were at a new high, while levels of worry and sadness also increased. Some 39% of those polled said they had been worried the day before the survey, and 35% were stressed. Paraguay Panama Guatemala Mexico El Salvador Chad Niger Sierra Leone Iraq Iran Latin American countries including Paraguay, Panama and Guatemala topped the list of positive experiences, where people reported ""feeling a lot of positive emotions each day."" The poll claims it is reflective of the cultural tendency in Latin America to ""focus on life's positives"". Chad had the highest score for negative experiences. More than seven in 10 Chadians said they had struggled to afford food at some point in the past year. As many as 61% of people in the country said they had experienced physical pain. The country suffers from inadequate infrastructure and internal conflict, while health and social conditions compare unfavourably with those elsewhere in the region. Despite Chad's high score for negative experiences, people in the US and Greece were more stressed than Chadians. Greece had the most stressed population in the world with 59% saying they experienced stress on the day before the poll. Around 55% of US adults said they were stressed.

Company owner Andy Magee told BBC News NI he ""feels sorry"" for the person who carried out the theft. ""He feels the need that he has to go and go to all that bother and steal something, rather than getting up and going to his work,"" he said. ""Life ruined you know, wasted. Maybe that's a silly view to take, but that would be my view on it."" The digger was taken from the Green Pastures Church in Ballymena, where work was being carried out. 11 incidents involving 14 machines. 1 February - Supermarket, Ballymena Road, Antrim (Two cash machines removed). 2 February - Supermarket, Glenavy Road, Moira. 15 February - Service Station, Killyclogher Road, Omagh. 10 March - Service Station, Ballygawley Road, Dungannon. 22 March - Bank, Mallusk Road, Newtownabbey. 24 March - Service station, Dromore Road, Irvinestown. 1 April - Shop, Brook Street, Ahoghill. 7 April - Service Station, Feeney Road, Dungiven. 16 April - Coffee shop, Main Street, Bushmills. 16 April - Supermarket, Main Street, Crumlin (Two cash machines removed). 26 April - Tesco, Larne Link Road, Ballymena (Two cash machines removed).

""I want to reassure the public that we continue to do everything that we can to try stop these attacks and catch those responsible. The cash machines were recovered in the back of a pick-up style truck ""We have dedicated an increased the amount of resources to tackling this issue including actively patrolling ATM sites day and night.""

"This video can not be played London Marathon accused of discrimination London Marathon organisers have been accused of discrimination over their policy of excluding assisted runners. David and Sandra Kerr from County Down have run 35 marathons pushing their son, Aaron, in his adapted wheelchair. The Kerr family had asked London Marathon organisers if they could compete but were told it would be against the rules. ""An individual cannot be considered unless they are participating under their own power,"" said organisers. Aaron Kerr, 21, from Annahilt, does not speak, communicating solely through body language. He has a series of complex needs including cerebral palsy, epilepsy and a chromosome disorder which means he uses a wheelchair. Aaron was also born with chronic renal failure which resulted in a kidney transplant at the age of 13; his dad David was the donor. David and Sandra are Aaron's full time carers and in 2015 they caught the running bug. The family has completed in almost 150 running events, including 35 full marathons ""We started running in 2015 with a few park runs and we haven't looked back since, we haven't stopped running since,"" said David. The family has completed in almost 150 running events, including 35 full marathons, such as Manchester, Belfast and Dublin. They couple try to promote inclusivity and say their slogan is ""running and rolling together"". ""We just love spending time together as a family, it's quality time for us,"" said Sandra. ""It's great seeing Aaron about in the fresh air. Listen to Team Kerr on BBC Sounds here. ""For kids with complex needs, as they get older, stuff gets taken away from them, and it's hard to find things that as a family you can enjoy. ""The only thing that doesn't go away is disability."" The family has wanted to take part in the London Marathon, but so far that hasn't been possible. ""It's incredibly frustrating, the reason that they are giving to us is that Aaron can't complete the marathon on his own,"" said David. IAAF rules state: ""A competitor can be helped to an upright position, but that they cannot be helped in a forward motion."" The Kerrs say they have taken part in other IAAF events and aren't bothered about being competitors - they just want to take part. ""We've spoken to the IAAF ourselves and they have said that Aaron can take part as a non-participant (meaning his time would not be counted) at London's discretion,"" said David. The Kerr family is continuing to train for marathons that they are able to part in - starting with the Belfast City Marathon next weekend ""We just see it as discrimination against Aaron and it's very upsetting."" The family had hoped to run in a charity place with the Mae Murray Foundation, but when it found out that the Kerr family would not be allowed to enter the charity declined their offer to take part. The group's director, Alix Crawford, called on London Marathon organisers to explain ""why it is lagging behind other major marathons by continuing to exclude certain disadvantaged groups of people from within society from taking part. ""It is astonishing that the London Marathon, one of the UK's flagship sporting events, should take a stance against the inclusion of those with profound and lifelong disability,"" she said. The charity has protested by giving up its space and has asked London mayor Sadiq Khan to intervene. Nick Bitel, Chief Executive of London Marathon Events Ltd, said organisers had explained the rules to the family ""in some detail"". ""An individual cannot be considered a competitor in the London Marathon unless they are participating in the event under their own power,"" he said. ""Some races do permit non-competitors to be pushed or carried. Every race is different. The London Marathon has high runner density, some very narrow roads on the course and some steep hills. ""This is a combination that other events may not have. ""London Marathon Events is proud of all it has done to develop and promote para-sport and always works to encourage participation in our events by people with a disability. ""We support many, many people with a disability to complete the London Marathon - just not when they are being pushed by another person, as this contravenes the rules."" In the meantime, the Kerr family is continuing to train for marathons that they are able to part in - starting with the Belfast City Marathon next weekend.

"Young graduates in England need a postgraduate degree to get significantly ahead in earnings, official income data suggests. Graduate earnings figures show that up to the age of 30, postgraduates typically earn Â£9,000, or about 40%, more than those without degrees. This is double the Â£4,500 per year gap - about 21% - between those with an undergraduate degree and non-graduates. Universities Minister Chris Skidmore welcomed the ""graduate premium"" in pay. The graduate earnings figures for 2018, published by the Department for Education, show that for graduates aged between 21 and 30, the typical salary is Â£25,500, compared with Â£21,000 for non-graduates. But with more students than ever getting undergraduate degrees, the biggest earnings premium is now for those who stay on for further studies, with postgraduates typically earning Â£30,000. This gap applies across the whole working population, between the ages of 16 and 64, with postgraduates averaging Â£40,000, compared with Â£34,000 for graduates and Â£24,000 for non-graduates. The government has commissioned a review of whether undergraduate fees of Â£9,250 per year in England represent value for money. Review plan to cut fees faces Brexit delay How tuition fees change students' choices The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Biggest winners and losers from degrees These latest official figures show a narrowing advantage for young graduates - the annual pay gap closing from Â£6,000 between graduates and non-graduates in 2008 to Â£4,500 and a lower proportion of young graduates in ""high skilled"" jobs in 2018. The earnings figures show that pay levels for all levels of education have faced a decade of stagnation and real-terms decline. In 2008, the typical young graduate was earning Â£24,000 - and by 2018, if it had simply kept pace with inflation, that would have risen to about Â£31,500. But the typical young graduate in 2018 was only earning Â£25,500, representing a significant drop in real-terms earnings. Below these national figures for young graduates there are very wide differences - depending on gender, ethnicity and regional jobs markets. Female graduate earnings average, up to the age of 30, average Â£24,500, but male graduates average Â£28,000 White young graduates average Â£26,000, while black graduates average Â£22,000 Graduates with first-class degrees earn Â£27,000, while those with a 2:2 degree earn Â£24,000 In London, young graduates average Â£30,000, while in the north-east they average Â£21,000 Mr Skidmore said: ""There is clearly much further to go to improve the race and gender pay gap. ""We have introduced a range of reforms in higher education which have a relentless focus on levelling the playing field, so that everyone with the talent and potential can not only go to university, but flourishes there and has the best possible chance of a successful career.""

He said: ""Grief can change your outlook. You don't forget the shock and sadness or pain, but I do not believe grief changes who you are. ""If you let it, it will reveal who you are. It will reveal depths you did not know you had."" The prince visited staff at Christchurch Hospital where many of those injured in the attacks were taken Prince William met four-year-old Alen Alsati and her family The prince had earlier met four-year-old Alen Alsati - who was injured in the attack and awoke from a coma earlier this week - on a visit to Starship Children's Hospital. He also visited a memorial to the victims of the earthquake which hit Christchurch in 2011, where he laid a wreath. En route, the prince stopped to talk to five-year-old Tilly Pearce, who stood among the crowds holding a sign which read: ""Prince William I love your grandmother."" Tilly's grandmother Kay Mintrom said the prince, promised ""to say hello to the Queen from Tilly"" Tilly, who has been saving her pocket money for a trip to London to have tea with the Queen, described the moment as ""really exciting"".

"This video can not be played Zahran Hashim's sister condemns his actions The alleged ringleader behind Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday bombings was killed in the attacks, President Maithripala Sirisena said. Mr Sirisena said Zahran Hashim, a radical preacher, died at the Shangri-La hotel in the capital, Colombo. He said Hashim led the attack on the popular tourist hotel, accompanied by a second bomber identified as ""Ilham"". At least 250 people died in the wave of bombings on Sunday, which targeted churches and hotels in Colombo. Mr Sirisena also said that Sri Lankan intelligence services believed around 130 suspects linked to Islamic State (IS) group were in the country and that police were hunting 70 who were still at large. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? The victims of the Easter Sunday bombings US woman wrongly identified as suspect The president did not clarify what role Hashim took in the Shangri-La bombing - one of six attacks on Sunday that terrorised Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan authorities have blamed a local Islamist extremist group, National Tawheed Jamath, for the attacks. A previously little-known domestic radical, Hashim gained some local notoriety a few years ago as part of a group which defaced Buddhist statues. He subsequently found a following on YouTube, where he posted videos calling for violence against non-Muslims. In the days after the Easter Sunday attacks, he appeared in a video released by IS in which seven men - thought to be some of the bombers - pledged allegiance to the group. Hashim was the only one to show his face. But it was not clear whether Hashim had been in direct contact with IS or if he had simply pledged allegiance to the group, which has claimed it was behind the attacks. Damage at the Shangri-La hotel, where Zahran Hashim is said to have died Hashim was from the coastal Sri Lankan town of Kattankudy. There, earlier this week, his sister told the BBC she was horrified by what her brother had done. ""Even if he is my brother, I cannot accept this. I don't care about him any more,"" she said, adding that Hashim had been in contact with her until about two years ago, when he went quiet. Sister of 'ringleader' deplores attack President Sirisena told reporters that police were still hunting a number of IS suspects, but it was not clear if others believed to be linked to the attacks had been detained or had fled the country. A shootout between police and alleged suspects during one search operation was reported in the eastern town of Sainthamaruthu on Friday evening. The president also said that Sri Lanka's police chief, Pujith Jayasundara, had resigned over the bombings. His departure follows the resignation of the country's top defence ministry official, Hemasiri Fernando. Sri Lanka has begun to bury the dead, many in mass graves The bombings exposed a massive intelligence failure by Sri Lankan authorities after it emerged police and some government departments had received detailed warnings about possible attacks on churches. However, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the BBC that the warnings had failed to reach him - and as a result, he was not prepared to stand down from his role as he could not be held accountable. ""If we had any inkling, and we had not taken action, I would have handed in my resignation immediately,"" he said, adding: ""But what do you do when you are out of the loop?"" Sri Lankan officials have also revised the death toll from the bombings down by about 100 on Thursday, to 253, blaming the difficulty in identifying body parts at bomb scenes. But the move raised questions over how the previous estimate could have been so inaccurate. The country's Catholic Church has announced the suspension of all church services. In Negombo, a community of Ahmadi Muslims from Pakistan as well as some Christians and Afghan nationals have been ejected from their homes by landlords. Rights activists say the Ahmadi community, as foreign Muslims, could face reprisal attacks. This video can not be played Father and brother of teenager victims pay tribute to lost loved ones The Sri Lankan government has said it will search schools, in one of a series of announcements designed to address public anxiety in the aftermath of the attacks. Emergency powers announced declared on Monday continued, allowing police to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders. Sri Lanka's finance minister, Mangala Samaraweera said on Friday there were fears the country's lucrative tourism industry could see a fall in arrivals of up to 30% this year - a loss of $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn). Nine people are suspected of carrying out the attacks. Two of the bombers are said to have been the sons of spice trader Mohammad Yusuf Ibrahim, one of Sri Lanka's richest men. Mr Ibrahim was detained and questioned after the attacks. One of his sons was reportedly the bomber at the city's Shangri-La hotel - alongside Hashim, according to President Sirisena. The other son reportedly targeted the restaurant at the high-end Cinnamon Grand hotel, a short distance away. A CCTV image shows a bomber approaching St Sebastian's church in Negombo A woman said to be a wife of one of Mr Ibrahim's sons detonated explosives during a police raid at the family's villa on Sunday. Several people, including children and three police officers, were reportedly killed in that blast. According to the Sri Lankan government, most of the attackers were ""well educated"" and had come from ""middle- or upper middle-class"" families. Sri Lanka attacks: Who were the bombers? Another of the alleged bombers studied in the UK, a senior Whitehall official told the BBC.

"This video can not be played Eyewitness captures moment Kenneth hits northern Mozambique A powerful cyclone has smashed into Mozambique, flattening thousands of homes and flooding low-lying areas. Cyclone Kenneth struck with winds of 220km/h (140mph) barely a month after a previous cyclone killed hundreds and devastated large areas. Heavy rain continued to fall on Friday, raising fears of more floods. Authorities have advised people to move to higher ground amid concern that thousands may be trapped in remote villages. Mozambique was still recovering from Cyclone Idai, which killed more than 900 people across three countries in March. Cyclone Kenneth had already killed three people on the island nation of Comoros. At least one person has been reported dead in Mozambique after being crushed by a falling tree. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Cyclone Idai: What the aftermath looks like How prepared was southern Africa for Idai? UN weather experts say it is unprecedented for two cyclones of such intensity to hit Mozambique in the same season. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) also said that no previous records show a cyclone striking the region as far north as Kenneth. It said a fact-finding mission would examine the ""impact of climate change and sea-level rise on Mozambique's resilience"" to extreme weather. Winds eased on Friday, but France's meteorological agency said up to 800mm of rain was expected to land on Mozambique over coming days. Aid agencies say they are concerned about communities prone to flooding and landslides. The level of expected rainfall is nearly double the 10-day accumulated rainfall that caused devastating flooding in the port city of Beira, further south, during Cyclone Idai. The UN's World Food Programme said it was working on an ""emergency preparedness plan"" with the Mozambican government and other humanitarian groups. Mozambique's National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) said 30,000 people had been evacuated from affected areas, and reports from northern Mozambique said many homes had collapsed and the provincial capital of Pemba had lost its power supply. Kenneth made landfall on Mozambique's northern province of Cabo Delgado on Thursday evening, with wind speeds equivalent to a category four hurricane. Communications with the affected areas were disrupted, obscuring the full extent of the damage. Thousands remain away from their homes after compulsory evacuation procedures were put in place by authorities. Cabo Delgado province is not as densely populated as the area hit by Cyclone Idai, and there is apparently more high ground there. That, in addition to warnings by authorities ahead of the storm, could significantly stem losses compared with Cyclone Idai. But reports said many thousands of homes had been flattened by the winds, and the area has been hit by militant Islamist violence in recent months, which could complicate humanitarian operations. Thousands of people had already fled their homes to seek shelter from violence in camps for displaced people. How ruby smugglers nurtured jihadists in Mozambique Comoros is still reeling from damage caused by the cyclone, which battered the islands with high winds and heavy rains. The winds have caused widespread power outages and damage to homes. In some southern areas of neighbouring Tanzania, authorities have ordered schools and businesses to close. Cyclone Kenneth has already devastated areas of the island nation of Comoros Residents in the southern Tanzanian town of Mtwara were earlier told to seek higher ground and shelter, but that warning was stood down. Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones explained The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies shared images of the damage on social media. In a tweet, the group confirmed it had volunteers on the ground assisting communities. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Police and rescue vehicles have been investigating the area where one of the bodies was found, near the village of Orounta in Cyprus A man in Cyprus has confessed to murdering seven women and girls in what local media have called the island's ""first serial killings"". Two bodies were found in a mine shaft earlier this month and a third one was found on Thursday. The main suspect, a 35-year-old Greek-Cypriot army officer, is then said to have admitted more killings. Police are now looking for them based on the information he provided. They involve a woman who was either Indian or Nepalese, as well as a Romanian woman and her eight-year-old daughter. A six-year-old girl, the daughter of one of the murder victims, is also missing. Investigators found the third woman's body on Thursday after the suspect led them to the spot where he is alleged to have dumped it, near the capital of Nicosia. The suspect is reported to have met the victim, who disappeared in December 2017, on a dating website. The man's name has not yet been made public. Police have extended a remand order against the suspect and called in additional help from British investigative experts.

"The new Â£17.6bn railway across London was due to open in December 2018 Crossrail will be completed two years behind schedule, transport bosses have admitted. But the completion between October 2020 and March 2021 will not include the opening of Bond Street, one of 10 new stations along the new Elizabeth Line, they said. London mayor Sadiq Khan described the new timetable as ""realistic and deliverable"". The new Â£17.6bn railway across London was due to open last December. ""Many risks and uncertainties remain in the development and testing of the train and signalling systems,"" Crossrail Ltd said in a statement, having identified a new ""six-month delivery window"" for the project. The line had been rescheduled to open this autumn but that had beencast into doubt after further setbacks were reported. Crossrail said Bond Street's opening had been delayed ""because of design and delivery challenges"" and would be unveiled ""at the earliest opportunity"". Its chief executive Mark Wild told the BBC's Today programme Tottenham Court Road station would be open and he hoped Bond Street station would be opened soon after the Elizabeth Line started operating. ""It's very disappointing we didn't make it in December but we've got a plan now, a clear plan, to get it opened by the end of next year. ""I think the project in the summer of last year got itself into quite a compressed state with overlapping activities."" He added: ""My job now is to get the railway open."" Crossrail 'could be delayed until 2021' TfL boss refuses to quit over Crossrail Lack of accountability over Crossrail delay Crossrail said it had major tasks to complete before opening the line, including creating and testing software that would integrate the train operating system with three different signalling systems. It said it also needed to finish installing equipment in tunnels, test communications, install and test station systems and trial run the trains over many thousands of miles on the completed railway.

The London Assembly Transport Committee has welcomed the announcement with ""cautionary relief"", its chair Caroline Pidgeon said. However, she also said: ""The project has been pushed back twice already, so the question has to be asked, 'Is the six-month window a hedge-betting exercise to avoid disappointing passengers once more?' ""It is also incredibly frustrating that no senior executives will accept any responsibility for the litany of failures that have led to this delay.""

"This video can not be played The father and brother of Amelie and Daniel Linsey, who died in the attacks, paid tribute to the teenagers The UK is advising against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka after the Easter Sunday bombings in which about 250 people died. The Foreign Office says,externalterrorists are very likely to try to carry out indiscriminate attacks there, including in places visited by foreigners. Eight Britons were among those killed by suicide bombers at churches and luxury hotels in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa. More than 500 people were injured. On Thursday, the Sri Lankan health ministryrevised down the death tollby more than 100 to ""about 253"", blaming a calculation error. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said the UK government was now talking to the travel industry about helping the 8,000 British tourists believed to be in Sri Lanka if they decide they want to cut short their visits. The Foreign Office has issued advice to any Britons still in Sri Lanka: Remain vigilant, keep up to date with developments and follow the advice of local security authorities and hotel security staff Keep a low profile, avoid crowded public places, large gatherings, including religious gatherings and places of worship, and any demonstrations. Avoid travelling during periods of curfew (other than to or from the airport) Keep in touch with family and friends and make them aware of any plans you may have Police in Sri Lanka are continuing to carry out raids and have issued photographs of seven people wanted in connection with the attacks. So far, more than 70 people have been arrested. The authorities have blamed a local Islamist extremist group but say the bombers must have had outside help. The Islamic State group said it carried out the attacks but provided no direct evidence. Colombo Airport is operating but with increased security checks and long queues. Trainee GP Amy, and her husband-to-be Ross, have cancelled their honeymoon to Sri Lanka Amy Goodman, 27, from Armagh in Northern Ireland, was due to go to Sri Lanka, Dubai and the Maldives in June for her honeymoon with fiancÃ©, Ross Kernan. The couple had been booked to stay at the Cinnamon Grand in Colombo - one of the hotels which was bombed. But they have now cut out the Sri Lanka leg of her holiday - at the cost of Â£863 (â¬1,000). ""To think that the hotel we were due to be staying in a few weeks time got bombed and that that could have been us doesn't bear thinking about,"" said trainee GP Ms Goodman. ""It's been an emotional few days for us. I don't know how I would've felt travelling around Sri Lanka after what's happened. We could have been putting our lives at risk, anything could happen. ""We've been really lucky and have managed to get our trip changed for a fee."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he hoped to be able to change the travel advice once the current security operation had concluded. ""My first priority will always be the security of British citizens living and travelling abroad. ""We all hope the situation will return to normal very soon, and that the Sri Lankan tourism industry is able to get back on its feet following the terrorist attacks. ""We will do all we can to help the Sri Lankan authorities in the meantime,"" he added. Sri Lanka honeymooners 'just want to get home' Sri Lanka travel: what should you do? What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? Who were the victims? Travel expert Simon Calder said tourism was the third most important industry to the Sri Lankan economy, particularly in terms of employment and foreign exchange. In 2017, more than two million tourists visited the island, an increase from fewer than half a million in 2009. Sri Lanka's tourism sector was worth just $350m (Â£270m) in 2009, growing more than 10 times to be worth $4.4bn (Â£3.4bn) in 2018,according to figures from the Sri Lankan central bank,external. According to ONS figures,Â£88m was spent on tourism in Sri Lanka in 2017 by UK residents,external, who made 86,000 visits. Mr Calder told the BBC the UK travel warning would ""send a signal to the rest of the world"" and ""almost certainly have a detrimental effect"" on the industry. He also pointed out that it can take years for a ban to be lifted. ""It took two years forTunisia to get off the no-go list,"" he said. There will also be a short-term impact on the travel industry, he added. ""People that have a package holiday booked in the next few weeks will not be expected to travel and the travel company will have to make arrangements to give a full refund or provide an alternative holiday - it's your choice,"" he said. However, travel trade organisation Abta said anyone who booked their flights and accommodation separately will need to discuss their options with the individual companies. Holidaymakers with travel insurance may be able to claim for losses depending on the terms of their policy. Tour operator Tui said it has started to contact customers in Sri Lanka and those due to travel in the next seven days to discuss travel arrangements. Eight Britons died in the attacks: Alex, Anita and Annabel Nicholson, Daniel and Amelie Linsey, Dr Sally Bradley and Bill Harrop, and Lorraine Campbell (clockwise from top left) Among the victims of Sunday's bombings were Anita Nicholson and her children Annabel, 11, and Alex, 14, who were visiting Sri Lanka on holiday from their home in Singapore.

"This video can not be played The father and brother of Amelie and Daniel Linsey, who died in the attacks, paid tribute to the teenagers The UK is advising against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka after the Easter Sunday bombings in which about 250 people died. The Foreign Office says,externalterrorists are very likely to try to carry out indiscriminate attacks there, including in places visited by foreigners. Eight Britons were among those killed by suicide bombers at churches and luxury hotels in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa. More than 500 people were injured. On Thursday, the Sri Lankan health ministryrevised down the death tollby more than 100 to ""about 253"", blaming a calculation error. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said the UK government was now talking to the travel industry about helping the 8,000 British tourists believed to be in Sri Lanka if they decide they want to cut short their visits. The Foreign Office has issued advice to any Britons still in Sri Lanka: Remain vigilant, keep up to date with developments and follow the advice of local security authorities and hotel security staff Keep a low profile, avoid crowded public places, large gatherings, including religious gatherings and places of worship, and any demonstrations. Avoid travelling during periods of curfew (other than to or from the airport) Keep in touch with family and friends and make them aware of any plans you may have Police in Sri Lanka are continuing to carry out raids and have issued photographs of seven people wanted in connection with the attacks. So far, more than 70 people have been arrested. The authorities have blamed a local Islamist extremist group but say the bombers must have had outside help. The Islamic State group said it carried out the attacks but provided no direct evidence. Colombo Airport is operating but with increased security checks and long queues. Trainee GP Amy, and her husband-to-be Ross, have cancelled their honeymoon to Sri Lanka Amy Goodman, 27, from Armagh in Northern Ireland, was due to go to Sri Lanka, Dubai and the Maldives in June for her honeymoon with fiancÃ©, Ross Kernan. The couple had been booked to stay at the Cinnamon Grand in Colombo - one of the hotels which was bombed. But they have now cut out the Sri Lanka leg of her holiday - at the cost of Â£863 (â¬1,000). ""To think that the hotel we were due to be staying in a few weeks time got bombed and that that could have been us doesn't bear thinking about,"" said trainee GP Ms Goodman. ""It's been an emotional few days for us. I don't know how I would've felt travelling around Sri Lanka after what's happened. We could have been putting our lives at risk, anything could happen. ""We've been really lucky and have managed to get our trip changed for a fee."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he hoped to be able to change the travel advice once the current security operation had concluded. ""My first priority will always be the security of British citizens living and travelling abroad. ""We all hope the situation will return to normal very soon, and that the Sri Lankan tourism industry is able to get back on its feet following the terrorist attacks. ""We will do all we can to help the Sri Lankan authorities in the meantime,"" he added. Sri Lanka honeymooners 'just want to get home' Sri Lanka travel: what should you do? What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? Who were the victims? Travel expert Simon Calder said tourism was the third most important industry to the Sri Lankan economy, particularly in terms of employment and foreign exchange. In 2017, more than two million tourists visited the island, an increase from fewer than half a million in 2009. Sri Lanka's tourism sector was worth just $350m (Â£270m) in 2009, growing more than 10 times to be worth $4.4bn (Â£3.4bn) in 2018,according to figures from the Sri Lankan central bank,external. According to ONS figures,Â£88m was spent on tourism in Sri Lanka in 2017 by UK residents,external, who made 86,000 visits. Mr Calder told the BBC the UK travel warning would ""send a signal to the rest of the world"" and ""almost certainly have a detrimental effect"" on the industry. He also pointed out that it can take years for a ban to be lifted. ""It took two years forTunisia to get off the no-go list,"" he said. There will also be a short-term impact on the travel industry, he added. ""People that have a package holiday booked in the next few weeks will not be expected to travel and the travel company will have to make arrangements to give a full refund or provide an alternative holiday - it's your choice,"" he said. However, travel trade organisation Abta said anyone who booked their flights and accommodation separately will need to discuss their options with the individual companies. Holidaymakers with travel insurance may be able to claim for losses depending on the terms of their policy. Tour operator Tui said it has started to contact customers in Sri Lanka and those due to travel in the next seven days to discuss travel arrangements. Eight Britons died in the attacks: Alex, Anita and Annabel Nicholson, Daniel and Amelie Linsey, Dr Sally Bradley and Bill Harrop, and Lorraine Campbell (clockwise from top left) Among the victims of Sunday's bombings were Anita Nicholson and her children Annabel, 11, and Alex, 14, who were visiting Sri Lanka on holiday from their home in Singapore. Dr Sally Bradley and William Harrop were also on holiday from western Australia where they were living. IT director Lorraine Campbell, 55, from Greater Manchester, was staying at Colombo's Cinnamon Grand Hotel on a business trip when she died.

"Wildfires in Scotland are to be tackled by controlled burning for the first time. The increasing threat of wildfires has forced the fire service to begin training staff in the fire management method common in hot countries. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) issued 21 wildfire danger warnings last year. The service has warned climate change means wildfires are likely to be become more common in Scotland. Area manager Bruce Farquharson, who helped to coordinate the response this week to amajor wildfire in Moray, one of the largest in the UK for years, said: ""What we have seen over the last week is not surprising. ""When we have a cold winter, combined with easterly winds and then a warm spring - that is an ideal storm for wildfires to happen. ""Climate change is a factor, we are going to see drier winters and warmer springs so we are going to need to change the way we deal with wildfires."" The SFRS last year issued 21 fire danger warnings, which combine data about ground and weather conditions to predict the likelihood of wildfires. In 2017 only six warnings were issued and the year before there were only two. So far this year four warnings have been issued by the service, which has dealt with eight major wildfires since 18 April alone. Satellite images showed the large areas affected by the fire in Moray this week A wildfire around Knockando, Moray was thought to be out but six appliances had to return to the area when fresh fires were spotted on Thursday Mr Farquharson said the gravity of the threat now meant firefighters were being trained in controlled burning with a view to formally starting the practice next spring, most likely in the worst affected areas of the Highlands and Aberdeenshire. Controlled burning involves creating fires to remove the fuel, typically heather or grass, which keeps wildfires burning and forcing them to burn out. It is a technique that is used in countries that have severe wildfires, such as Australia or the United States, which haddevastating fires in California last year. In the UK, the South Wales Fire and Rescue servicestarting using the method last yearand was called in to help with the majorSaddleworth Moor firewhich occurred during the 2018 heatwave. A firefighter watches a controlled burn in the Sequoia National Forest, California, where the method of trying to stop the advance of wildfires has been used for decades Mr Farquharson tried the method himself in Spain last year where he and local firefighters put out a blaze covering several acres of scrubland on a remote hill without using a single drop of water. He explained: ""It might sound a bit odd to some but what we are aiming to do is to teach some of our key stations how to use fire to fight wildfires. ""You clear a strip of vegetation as a base using hand tools and you slowly burn back from that to create an ever widening area of what we call a black strip so that when the fire reaches this strip, it burns out itself. ""Gamekeepers have traditionally done it but the fire service has never done it in Scotland before."" Up to 80 firefighters were in attendance at the Moray blaze at its peak Working smarter to try and reduce the amount of ""back breaking work""  needed to deal with wildfires has also thrown up a perhaps unlikely new ally for firefighters- the leaf blower. Mr Farquharson, who is also chairman of the Scottish Wildfire Forum, continued:  ""The firefighters coming off the hill at Moray looked like they have been at war. ""That is why we are keen to get the controlled fire approach working but there are other methods, industrial standard leaf blowers are an awesome tool. ""Not on all fuel types, but certainly on heather and some types of grass, a leaf blower does the same job as beating a fire. ""Think about a birthday cake and blowing the candles out, a leaf blower does the same job and two people with leaf blowers can do same job as ten people with traditional beaters, in a fraction of the time."" SFRS area manager Bruce Farquharson is hopeful the controlled burning approach will reduce the impact of wildfires and make the work safer for firefighters The fire service is keen to increase public awareness of the dangers of wildfires and would also like to see a network of signs erected at popular countryside spots which tell people the current status of the wildfire threat. Mr Farquharson said better education of visitors to the countryside was also needed. He said: ""Disposable barbeques remain a problem but also the increase in wild camping can create issues, such as what appears to be a decrease in the knowledge of how to build and run a safe camp fire.""

"This video can not be played The moment of the blast was caught on CCTV Two workers suffered burns in an early hours explosion at Tata's biggest steelworks plant in the UK. Residents living near the Port Talbot plant heard a ""massive"" blast shortly after 03:30 BST. Images and footage posted on social media showed a huge mushroom cloud and plumes of smoke rising above the plant. Tata Steel said the explosion came from a train carrying molten metal. It said the workers had received treatment for minor injuries. ""The spillage led to a number of fires which were extinguished by our own emergency services supported by members of the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service,"" it said in a statement. Why is Port Talbot steelworks important? 18 years since steel site's fatal blast BBC Wales understands the explosion happened on a stretch of railway track between the engineering shops and the locomotive repair shops. Stephen Davies from the Unite union believed a train - carrying a ""torpedo"" which holds the molten metal - derailed, leading to the metal coming into contact with cold water. He said: ""They [the men] were both on the train. One of them is close to retirement and the other is younger."" One of them had a burn to the head and the other to the chest, he added. The site reopened by 07:00 although production at blast furnaces four and five have been halted until all checks had been completed, Mr Davies said. Pictures show ""torpedo"" which was carrying the molten metal, ended up on its side Lance Davies, 36, who lives at the highest point in the town overlooking it and the steelworks, said it was a ""miracle"" no-one was killed. ""I was woken up this morning by what sounded like thunder. I went to the window and could see the results of the first explosion, then I called my partner and saw the other two,"" he added. ""That was all you could see - it was like a scene from Independence Day - a big ball of flame, followed by a massive mushroom of smoke. It was unbelievable."" Sharon Freeguard, a Neath Port Talbot councillor, said: ""I thought I heard about two to three explosions. It was extremely frightening. This video can not be played Tata Steel said the explosion came from a train used to carry molten metal ""The house just shook, so it was quite alarming. Once it was over, I did wonder what it was and just did think about the works. ""We're just all relieved that there are no fatalities."" Local resident Craig Williams said he heard ""an almighty bang"", adding: ""It's very unusual to hear something of that magnitude. ""The house shook a little. It's not something we are accustomed to."" CCTV footage from a house captured the explosion Some of the buildings near where the blast took place Mr Williams said Port Talbot ""revolves around this plant"" and it helps to ""bring the community together"". The steelworks is the largest in the UK and employs more than 4,000 people. Helicopters were circling overhead and South Wales Police said it received ""numerous calls"" shortly after 03:30 ""reporting an explosion"" which, they said, had caused damage to some buildings on the site. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said 10 appliances it sent to the scene had left by 08:40. The Health and Safety Executive added it would be making contact with the emergency services. An investigation into the cause of the explosion has begun The explosion was heard as far away as Bridgend, 14 miles (22km) from the blast, and the National Police Air Service's St Athan wing confirmed a helicopter had been scrambled to the scene. Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said safety at the plant had improved ""massively"" since 2001, when three workers were killed in a blast. He said he had spoken with Tata bosses,externalon Friday and was told a review was under way into the cause. ""We've got to understand why it happened and make sure it doesn't happen again,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Amazon has promised to cut delivery times worldwide for customers of its Prime service. Amazon Prime is a subscription service offering free delivery and access to Amazon's TV shows. Members in the US currently receive free two-day delivery, but the plan is to cut that to one day. Prime customers already get free one-day delivery in some parts of the UK. Amazon plans to spend $800m (Â£620m) to cut delivery times elsewhere. It did not say when delivery times would be cut but said it expects to make ""steady progress"" this year. Walmart and Target have been improving their delivery times in the US and offer two-day shipping on many items. Amazon's move is an effort to stay ahead of those rivals. It already ships many items to US cities within a day, but analysts say extended that service to more remote parts of the country will be difficult. ""Amazon is cranking it up a notch, trying to set themselves apart,"" said Cathy Morrow Roberson, a former UPS analyst who founded consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. ""I don't know how they are going to do it in Little Town USA,"" she said. Amazon also reported a first quarter profit of $3.6bn (Â£2.8bn), double the same period in the previous year. It was its fourth successive quarter of record profit. In the first quarter sales rose 17% to $59.7bn. Amazon expects sales to grow between 13% and 20% in the second quarter. Sales surged at Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides computing services to companies over the internet - a service know as cloud computing. Launched in 2002, AWS has become a crucial part of Amazon's business, and sales rose 41% to $7.7bn in the three-month period to the end of March. ""While the cost of building the data-driven infrastructure to support the cloud systems is vast, the fact it requires such deep pockets actually works in Amazon's favour,"" said George Salmon, an analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It's difficult to see how a new challenger can wrestle business away from the likes of Amazon, Google, and the latest member of the $1tn club, Microsoft.""

"The attack happened in Church Road in Rayleigh on Wednesday evening An off-duty police officer is in a serious condition in hospital after being stabbed multiple times in a ""targeted"" attack. The victim suffered injuries to his stomach, chest and arm in the attack in Rayleigh at about 21:15 BST on Wednesday, Essex Police said. A man was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is in custody. Police said it was believed the attack was ""targeted and isolated"" and have appealed for witnesses. In a statement Ben-Julian Harrington, chief constable of Essex, said the force was ""supporting one of our colleagues who was the victim of a stabbing in Rayleigh"". ""I can however confirm we have a man in custody who has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder,"" he said. ""We believe this attack was targeted and that the officer and the suspect are known to each other. ""There is no wider risk to the local community or other police officers as a result of this incident."" Police said he was in a ""serious but stable condition"" after undergoing hospital treatment. He had been found at an address in Church Road and it was not seeking anyone else in connection with the stabbing. In a Tweet, John Apter, the chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ""Thoughts are with the officer, his family and his colleagues. Wishing him a full and speedy recovery."" The Essex Police Federation said Tweeted: ""One of our colleagues was the victim of a horrendous, targeted and violent attack."" Karen Brian, who lives on the road, said: ""I've lived here six years and we've never had anything like this down this road. ""It's a shock to all of a sudden have something like this happen at your door."" Rayleigh and Wickford MP Mark Francois said: ""This is an appalling crime and my thoughts are with the officer concerned and his family. ""Mercifully, while his injuries are serious, I have been told they are no longer life-threatening. ""Nevertheless, attacking a police officer on their own doorstep is absolutely wicked.""

"A honeymoon in Sri Lanka ticks a lot of boxes. The tropical island offers golden beaches, remote temples and friendly locals, all at a gentle pace. But, since Easter Sunday's bombings, the mood has changed. Britons are being told not to go to Sri Lankaunless their trip is essential.The UK government says more terrorist attacks are ""very likely"". For travellers still in the country, there are worries about how they'll get home. And for those with expensive holidays booked and paid for, they may not get there at all. Joe and Rebecca Jones have one day left of their honeymoon in Sri Lanka, and are worried about making the journey home on Saturday. Mr Jones, a 30-year-old teacher from Cardiff, said they had spent their time on the south coast of the island, far away from the carnage. ""Our honeymoon has been tarnished, but it hasn't been ruined because the Sri Lankan people have got on with things,"" he told the BBC from the southern town of Unawatuna. ""They've carried on as normal and really accommodated us. I think the people here are battle-hardened to attacks like this."" But he admitted the couple were on edge about travelling to Colombo for their flight back to London. ""We just want to get back now - and sharpish."" And he lamented that people would now associate the country with the terror attacks - instead of the glorious landscapes and ""the friendliest and most hospitable people I have ever come across"". Sri Lanka travel: What should you do? UK warns against Sri Lanka travel Things got off to a great start for Abi McKie and Ali Smith. The young couple from Doncaster won their wedding, worth Â£20,000, after raising Â£1,000 for a children's charity. Ali, 25, waxed his legs for charity and Abi, 24, won a Valentine's Day obstacle race, involving 10 brides dressed in a second-hand wedding dress. With the whole wedding paid for, the couple thought they would spend the money to make their honeymoon extra special. So they splashed out Â£5,000 on a two-week honeymoon in Sri Lanka, beginning in June, and dreamed about seeing elephants in the national park. ""I've cried quite a few times today,"" Abi told the BBC. ""Now who knows whether we're going. I'm absolutely gutted."" She said they had been so excited about the trip, and enjoyed planning it. ""We've already got our train tickets to Heathrow and our visas to travel but it's now up in the air. Our situation is uncertain which I don't like,"" she added. ""And our travel agent is not sure if there's anything they can do."" The couple are due to marry on 31 May and travel to the Sri Lankan capital Colombo on 4 June, but Abi worries it may all come down to the wire. ""Our situation is nothing though compared to those who have lost loved ones or are out in Sri Lanka now though. That must be really hard."" For Rosie Lee and her fiancÃ© Sam Barnes, a Sri Lankan honeymoon would have been their dream trip. The couple, from Helston in Cornwall, would have celebrated their relationship's ninth anniversary out there and had booked in two days of whale-watching. ""That's one of my bucket list things so it's a pretty big holiday for us,"" said Rosie, 26. The couple will marry in May and are due to spend 11 nights in Sri Lanka in July, followed by five in the Maldives. But Miss Lee fears they may have to postpone it - and worries she might not get her Â£2,000 deposit back. ""I'm in limbo at the moment. I feel like I don't know what's going on,"" she told the BBC. ""We've saved for three years for this moment and I feel like the attacks have taken it away from us."" UK warns against Sri Lanka travel Sri Lanka travel: What should you do?

"A resident who fails to pay their first month's council tax bill of Â£167 can see the cost increase to Â£2,065 in nine weeks, according to Citizens Advice. The missed payment in England and Wales can mean they are liable for the rest of the annual bill, as well as court costs of Â£84 and bailiff fees of Â£310. The charity wants the rules changed to ensure people whose finances are stretched do not receive a big bill. Councils say people in financial trouble can be supported. The government is also reviewing the rules surrounding the way local authorities collect council tax. The calculations by Citizens Advice were based on a resident missing the very first bill of the financial year, which typically cost Â£167 in England. As a result, the full bill of Â£1,671 could be levied. This outstanding bill would be lower if a payment was missed later in the year. Mark, who is unemployed and has mental health problems, is one of those who has faced such a situation. ""Last year was not a good year in terms of my health or finances. I had so many debts that it became very stressful and hard to find a way to make my money stretch to cover them all,"" the 53-year-old told Citizens Advice. ""In August, a letter arrived from a bailiff. I had become liable for the full year bill and my council tax debt was now with them. I felt really intimidated."" Typical council tax in England rose by 4.7% in April Scottish council tax 2019/20 - What's happening? Citizens Advice said that 9% of households in England fell behind on council tax payments in 2017-18, and it wants the rules changed so the full year charge and the threat of imprisonment for arrears in England are removed. ""Council tax regulations make it harder for people to pay their original debts instead of helping them to get their finances back on track,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. However, the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, urged anyone in financial trouble to get in touch with their local authority for help, saying they would be supported. Although it pointed out that council tax was vital for services such as social care, bin collection and children's services, it said it welcomed the government review. ""Councils want it to be easier to recover money without having to go to the courts so would be in favour of a review of the regulations, including whether to remove the requirement for the entire annual sum to become payable if an instalment is missed,"" said Richard Watts, of the LGA. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it expected councils to be ""sympathetic to those in genuine hardship and proportionate in enforcement"". Potential reforms of the system could be proposed later this year following the review, it said.

"A formal inquiry is to be held into the leaking of discussions about Huawei at the National Security Council, the BBC has learned. This follows the Daily Telegraph publishing details of a meeting about using the Chinese telecoms firm to help build the UK's 5G network. Several cabinet ministers have denied they were involved in the leak. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill is to lead the inquiry, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. The National Security Council (NSC) is made up of senior cabinet ministers and its weekly meetings are chaired by the prime minister, with other ministers, officials and senior figures from the armed forces and intelligence agencies invited when needed. It is a forum where secret intelligence can be shared by GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 with ministers, all of whom have signed the Official Secrets Act. All you need to know about Huawei's problems Huawei: The story of a controversial company What is 5G and what will it mean for you? But following Tuesday's meeting, theDaily Telegraph reported,externalthat the NSC had agreed to allow Huawei limited access to help build Britain's new 5G network, amid warnings about possible risks to national security. It also reported that various ministers had raised concerns about the plan. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told MPs: ""We cannot exclude the possibility of a criminal investigation here and everyone will want to take seriously that suggestion."" Amid speculation about who was behind the leak, several ministers have denied any involvement. This video can not be played Huawei leak: Minister says he cannot rule out a criminal investigation Home Secretary Sajid Javid said divulging sensitive information was ""completely unacceptable"", adding: ""If it happens it should absolutely be looked at."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied the leak had come from them, with Mr Hunt calling it ""utterly appalling"". Sources close to International Trade Secretary Liam Fox also categorically denied that he had been involved. According to the Daily Telegraph,external, Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" parts of the UK's 5G network, such as antennas. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and No 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring. Huawei has denied there is any risk of spying or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government. Earlier, former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the BBC: ""All those involved should be investigated now to find out who this leaker is. ""Ministers are subject to the Official Secrets Act just like anybody else. It is an offence to divulge secret information from the most secret of all government bodies, which is the National Security Council. It has got to be stopped."" When questioned, Prime Minister Theresa May replied: ""We don't comment on leaks and on those matters. ""On the overall matter of security and our telecoms network, we are very clear that we give that high priority. We want to ensure we see greater resilience in our telecoms network and that we are able to provide high levels of cyber security, but we also see diversity of suppliers.""

"Emmanuel Macron made the live address at the Elysee Palace French President Emmanuel Macron has given a long-awaited response to the yellow vest protest movement with promises of tax cuts, higher pensions and a reform of the civil service. Despite insisting that order must return, he acknowledged a ""lack of trust"" in the establishment. Protests, sometimes violent, started in Novemberover rises in fuel costs but widened to cover a range of grievances over economic inequality. Mr Macron said he stood by his reforms. His speech was originally scheduled for 15 April but was postponed afterthe devastating fire at Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. President Macron recognised that at the core of the movement were ""fair demands"". The protests against the fuel price rises - intended to fund eco-friendly projects - escalated into the gilets jaunes, or yellow vest, movement, a national uprising against what protesters see as economic injustice in France. The yellow vest movement spread across the whole of France as well as some parts of the UK When he was elected in 2017, Mr Macron vowed to fight ""the forces of division that undermine France"". Yellow vest violence returns to Paris Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Although he questioned in his speech whether he had taken a ""wrong turn"", he insisted that government reforms so far had been right, but not fast enough. The president said he had ""learnt a lot"" from national debates held with French citizens across the country - an unforeseen political exercise. His plans include: A ""significant cut"" in income tax worth â¬5bn (Â£4.3bn; $5.6bn), financed by spending cuts and closing company tax loopholes, but the French will have to ""work harder"" Reintroduction of inflation-linking for pensions worth less than â¬2,000 a month but more working life spent making pension contributions More decentralised government Extending proportional representation in elections, and making referendums easier to hold Abolition of the ENA university, which has trained political leaders and captains of industry but is seen as elitist by many The president also acknowledged there were concerns in society regarding climate change and immigration. The president's announcement is the culmination of what was touted as a ""grand debate"" with the French people about their concerns. The latest proposals come on top of changes announced in December at a cost of â¬10bn. Those plans, including a government bonus scheme for the low-paid, failed to quell the protests. Yes, there were announcements. More PR at elections (good news for the far right); fewer MPs; lower income tax for the middle classes;  reform (but perhaps not outright abolition) of the National Administration School (ENA); decentralisation of the state administration; longer working lives. And yes, there was partial admission of responsibility for the breakdown of trust between governed and governing that led to the yellow vests. He should have been more human, less arrogant, Mr Macron admitted. But such was not the burden from tonight's marathon press conference. The overall message was not what must now change, but what must remain the same. And that, says Mr Macron, is the overarching ""orientation"" of his presidency. The reforms enacted so far, on tax, labour and education, are the right ones and they are working, he said. There will be more to come. The yellow vests, or the more hard-line among them, will not like it. But they are not Mr Macron's target audience. The target is France as a whole.
