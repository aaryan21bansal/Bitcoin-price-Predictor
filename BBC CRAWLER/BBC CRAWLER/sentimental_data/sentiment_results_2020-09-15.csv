"This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel explains why ""mingling"" is against the latest Covid-19 restrictions Families stopping to talk in the street would be in breach of the rule of six restrictions, the home secretary has said. Priti Patel told the BBC that two families of four stopping for a chat on the way to the park was ""absolutely mingling"". She said she would report her neighbours if they broke the rules. Therules restrict indoor and outdoor gatherings in England and Scotland, and indoor groups in Wales. Thenew measuresmean police can break up groups larger than six, with fines of up to Â£3,200 if people flout the rules. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Patel said that two families of four stopping for a chat on the way to the park was ""absolutely mingling"". ""You have got to put this in the context of coronavirus and keeping distance, wearing masks,"" she said. ""The rule of six is about making sure that people are being conscientious and not putting other people's health at risk."" The home secretary added: ""Mingling is people coming together. That is my definition of mingling."" Testing problems 'to be solved in matter of weeks' What you can and can't do under the new rules R number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise When asked if she would call the police on her neighbours if they breached the new coronavirus rules, Ms Patel told BBC Breakfast: ""I don't spend my time looking into people's gardens."" Pressed further on the topic, she said anybody would want to ""take responsibility"" to help to stop the spread of the virus, adding that if she saw gatherings of more than six, ""clearly I would report that"". Ms Patel's comments echo those made by Policing Minister Kit Malthouse, who suggested thatpeople should ring the non-emergency 101 numberif they had concerns that people were breaching the law.

It comes as the national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales called for guidance over enforcement of the measures. Speaking to Good Morning Britain, John Apter said that police officers on the frontline were ""trying to interpret"" the rules, and were being accused of ""asking (people) to snitch on their neighbours"". He added: ""Maybe we should have guidance, because we haven't had any yet."" Government guidelines include exemptions for physical activities that can be done in groups of more than six, such as football, hockey and netball, as well as sailing, angling and polo. Shooting - including hunting and paintball that requires a shotgun or firearms certificate licence - is also exempt as an organised sport. YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? Earlier, Ms Patel defended the government's record on testing, following widespread reports of people struggling to get swabbed. She told BBC Breakfast the government was ""surging capacity"" where it was needed. This video can not be played Priti Patel challenged on coronavirus testing delays ""Clearly there is much more work that needs to be undertaken with Public Health England and the actual public health bodies in those particular local areas, and as a government obviously we work with Public Health England to surge where there is demand in local hotspot areas."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the system is facing an ""enormous challenge"" after a ""sharp rise"" in people seeking a test.

"Artwork: D-Orbit's carrier platform has cameras that could also look for nearby space debris New approaches to tracking satellites and debris in orbit are to get a boost from the UK Space Agency. UKSA is giving over Â£1m to seven firms to help advance novel sensor technologies and the smart algorithms needed to interpret their data. Finding better ways to surveil objects moving overhead has become a high priority issue. With more and more satellites being launched, there's growing concern about the potential for collisions. A big worry is the burgeoning population of redundant hardware and junk in orbit - some 900,000 objects larger than 1cm by some counts, and all of it capable of doing immense damage to, or even destroying, an operational spacecraft in a high-velocity encounter. UK takes Â£400m stake in satellite firm OneWeb Europe's new space budget to enable CO2 mapping UK satellite tracks 'space junk' The projects being supported by UKSA come from a mix of start-ups and more established companies. The overriding goal is to improve ways to spot, characterise and track objects. Ultimately, this is information which could be fed into the automated traffic management systems of the future that will keep functioning satellites out of harm's way. The funded projects include: Lift Me Off:To develop machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques to distinguish between satellites and space junk. Fujitsu:To also develop machine-learning approaches and quantum-inspired processing to improve mission planning to remove debris. DeimosandNorthern Space and Security:To both develop a new range of optical sensors to track space objects from the UK. Andor:To enhance the sensitivity and speed of its camera detector technology to map and track ever smaller sized debris objects. D-Orbit UK:To refine the use of recently launched sensors to capture images of, and characterise, objects moving around a spacecraft. Lumi Space:The company is developing laser ranging technology to again spot, characterise and precisely track objects in orbit. Deimos is developing technologies to track space objects from the UK ""We've known for a long while that the space environment is getting more difficult, more cluttered,"" said Jacob Geer from UKSA. ""Space surveillance and tracking is one of the key things we can do to keep safe those satellites we rely on now, and to make sure certain orbits don't become inaccessible for future generations because there's too much debris in them. ""We had 26 proposals come to us and I think we've selected a good cross-section of ideas in the seven companies we're supporting,"" he told BBC News. While a lot of these projects are still at the lab stage, D-Orbit's work is dedicated to pushing the capability of some of its hardware already in space. The company recently launched a vehicle to carry and deploy a clutch of small satellites. This vehicle uses cameras to photograph its surroundings and to map the stars for the purposes of navigation. D-Orbit has the idea of using the cameras' imagery to also identify passing junk. ""One of the challenges in using star trackers is filtering out objects that are not supposed to be there - obviously, because you're trying to compare what you can see against a star catalogue,"" explained D-Orbit's Simon Reid. ""And, of course, it's those extra objects which in principal are the things that are potentially debris."" The funding announcement also coincides with the signing of a new partnership agreement between the Ministry of Defence and UKSA to work together on space domain awareness. Both have valuable assets and interests in orbit that need protecting. And for the UK taxpayer, this investment was recently deepened with the purchase out of bankruptcy of the OneWeb satellite broadband company. The UK government is now the part owner of one of the biggest spacecraft networks in the sky. OneWeb has so far launched 74 satellites in its communications constellation, with plans to put up thousands more. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""Millions of pieces of space junk orbiting the Earth present a significant threat to UK satellite systems which provide the vital services that we all take for granted - from mobile communications to weather forecasting. ""By developing new AI and sensor technology, the seven pioneering space projects we are backing today will significantly strengthen the UK's capabilities to monitor these hazardous space objects, helping to create new jobs and protect the services we rely on in our everyday lives.""

"The Unite union has called on the government to say it will extend its furlough scheme or face ""redundancy floodgates"" opening in the UK. Many workers can expect a ""miserable Christmas"" without targeted support for employers, the union warned. The government's furlough programme will end on 31 October. A Treasury spokesperson said the government had ""not hesitated to act in creative and effective ways to support jobs and we will continue to do so"". Wednesday marks 45 days before the end of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which is the same amount of time employers must give for notice of redundancy. The call comes amid growing evidence that the winding down of the scheme is leading to more plans for job cuts. Redundancy 'stressful and upsetting' Coronavirus: When will the furlough scheme end? Rishi Sunak: New ways to protect jobs 'my priority' The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June, 1,778 firms said they were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In total, nine million people have been furloughed for at least one three-week period since March, However, about 695,000 UK workers have gone from the payrolls of UK companies since then and it is feared that more will follow if the government stops paying to safeguard jobs. Unite said that without ""a clear and urgent sign"" from the government that it was responding to calls to extend the scheme, it feared that ""employers facing short-term struggles will issue redundancy notices"". The government has been urged by MPs, business groups, unions and political opponents to continue the furlough programme, in which workers placed on leave receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. The scheme, which has cost more than Â£35bn, was initially funded by the government, but firms started to contribute to wages in September after the scheme began to wind down. Last week, the Treasury Select Committee said the governmentshould consider a targeted extension of the scheme. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said a signal from the government would ""put a floor under struggling employers who are working hard to stabilise in the face of immense challenges"". ""With our competitor nations announcing the extension or modification of their jobs retention schemes, we ask that your government recognises the need for UK businesses and workers to receive similar support,"" Mr McCluskey wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A spokeswoman said Unite wanted to see support for sectors including manufacturing, aviation infrastructure, aerospace and hospitality. The government has repeatedly rebuffed the calls for an extension to the scheme, saying that it has served its purpose in cushioning the economy during the coronavirus crisis. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said hispriority is to find new ways to protect jobs. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The furlough scheme has done what it was designed to do - save jobs and help people back into employment."" The spokesperson said the government had made ""unprecedented interventions"", including firms being given Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker still employed in January, business rates holidays, VAT cuts and the Kickstart scheme, which gives young people jobs experience.

"Sexual and violent offenders will serve at least two-thirds of jail terms, rather than half, as part of changes to the criminal justice system in England and Wales. An overhaul of sentencing laws has been announced by the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland. Whole-life orders will also be extended to 18 to 20-year-olds convicted of terrorism causing mass loss of life. Mr Buckland said it marked the end of ""complex and confusing"" laws. Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say Locations of 10 temporary courts revealed Minister warns over court case backlog from virus Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Buckland said the measures would ""keep offenders who pose a risk to the public off our streets for longer"". He said they would ""help restore public confidence that robust sentences are executed in a way that better reflects the gravity of the crimes committed"". Mr Buckland also said protecting the public meant ""finding new ways to break cycles of crime, to prevent a revolving door of short custodial sentences that we know offer little rehabilitative value"". More help is being promised for those with mental health issues, addictions and neurodiverse conditions such as autism. It comes after the criminal justice system ground to a halt during the coronavirus pandemic. There are steep backlogs and delays for victims and defendants, who are facing trial dates years ahead. Among the new interventions proposed in a White Paper published on Wednesday are: the option of a new whole life tariff for killers under the age of 21 whole life orders for adults who murder children - whichwas a pledge by the Conservatives at last year's general election. raising the sentencing threshold for serious offences including a ""third strike"" for burglaries and ""two strikes"" for knife possession new powers to halt the automatic release of offenders who pose a terrorist threat or are a danger to the public reducing the opportunities for over-18s who committed murder as a child to have their minimum jail term reviewed using GPS tags to track burglars, robbers and thieves when they are released from prison deploying so-called ""sobriety tags"" to tackle alcohol-related crime And offenders sentenced to between four and seven years in prison for serious crimes such as rape and manslaughter will no longer be automatically considered for release halfway through their jail terms. However, one charity boss warned that ""increasing the prison population through longer sentences will only add more pressure to this already stretched system"". Campbell Robb, chief executive of social justice charity Nacro, said the UK needed a system that ""gives victims justice, reduces re-offending and creates a safer UK for everyone - senselessly banging people up for longer will not deliver this."" While tougher sentences are among the measures proposed, changes to criminal records to reduce the time offenders have to declare past crimes to employers are also included. A focus on supporting ex-offenders will see custodial sentences become ""spent"" after 12 months without reoffending, with convictions of up to four years no longer disclosed after a further four crime-free years. Sentences of more than four years will not automatically be disclosed to employers after a further seven-year period of rehabilitation is completed. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy welcomed the changes but sought assurance that new sentencing rules would not be applied ""gratuitously"". ""It would be wrong to abandon the general presumption in criminal law that when you're younger there is more opportunity for redemption and to turn your life around,"" he said. For the past few days, the government has been trailing its White Paper with a series of eye-catching announcements promising tougher sentences for terrorists, violent offenders and motorists who kill. Many of the plans are likely to command broad public support while measures to relax criminal records disclosure rules have the potential to make a real difference to ex-offenders struggling to find work. But the timing of the proposals is somewhat odd, as the government grapples with the biggest crisis the criminal justice system has faced in decades. Problems caused by the coronavirus have meant that a huge backlog of trials across England and Wales has got even bigger. The sentencing changes, if they go ahead, won't help the tens of thousands of victims, witnesses and defendants caught up in the backlog who now face the prospect of waiting up to two years for their day in court. The announcement of reforms to sentencing comes after lawyers warned hundreds of thousands of people may have to wait until 2022 for justice, due to delays in the Crown Courts. Since lockdown began in March, the backlog of Crown Court cases has risen by 6,000 to 43,000. The Ministry of Justice has pledged an extra 1,600 court staff and Â£80m towards a range of measures, including more Nightingale courts. And Mr Buckland has told the BBChe would ""use every tool in the book""to clear the case backlog. This video can not be played Robert Buckland: Government working on court backlog Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, he said the situation in Magistrates' Courts was ""encouraging - with the number of cases being dealt with exceeding the number coming into the system"". And he said the Crown Courts had been ""unique"" compared to other countries, as it ""kept going"" throughout the pandemic. But, he added: ""I am bearing down daily on my team in the Courts and Tribunals Service to make sure that they have got the resources they need to make the buildings safe and that judges and listing officers are doing everything they can to get those cases listed so we can achieve swift justice."" Meanwhile detection rates for crimes remain low, having fallen from one-in-seven crime reports leading to a charge in 2015to around one-in-14 last year.

"This video can not be played Victoria Gill reports on what's at stake and what can be done to help Humanity is at a crossroads and we have to take action now to make space for nature to recover and slow its ""accelerating decline"". This is according to a report by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. It sets out a bullet point list of eight major transitions that could help stop the ongoing decline in nature. ""Things have to change,"" said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the convention's executive secretary. ""If we take action, the right action - as the report proposes - we can transition to a sustainable planet."" Wildlife in 'catastrophic decline', report warns Attenborough makes stark warning on extinction Coronavirus: A hunt for the 'missing link' species Tackling climate change will be critical in the endeavour to ""bend the curve"" on biodiversity loss New diseases emerge in the human population probably three or four times every year. It is only when they are easily transmitted from human to human - like the coronavirus - that they have the potential to kick-start a pandemic. But increasing the chances of a new disease emerging increases the chances of that disease becoming the ""next Covid"". And these are not truly new diseases - they are just new to our species. The vast majority of outbreaks are the result of an animal disease spilling over into the human population. Ebola and HIV came from primates; scientists have linked cases of Ebola to consuming meat from infected animals. A bite from a rabies-infected animal is a very effective mode of disease transmission. And in the 20 years before Covid-19,  SARs, MERs, swine flu, and avian flu all spilled over from animals. As we reengineer the natural world, we encroach on reservoirs of animal disease and put ourselves at risk. ""More and more we are affecting wildlife populations, deforesting and causing animals to move and enter our environment,"" explained Prof Matthew Baylis, a veterinary epidemiologist from the University of Liverpool. ""That causes [disease-causing] pathogens to be passed from one species to another. So our behaviours on a global scale are facilitating the spread of a pathogen from animals into humans."" The convention (CBD) has called this the ""final report card"" on progress against the20 global biodiversity targets,externalthat were agreed in 2010 with a 2020 deadline. ""Progress has been made, but none of [those] targets will be fully met,"" Ms Maruma Mrema told BBC News. ""So a lot still needs to be done to bend the curve on biodiversity loss."" As well as a stark warning, this report sets out an instruction manual about how to bend that curve. ""It can be done,"" said David Cooper, deputy executive secretary of the CBD. ""Next year in China we'll have the UN biodiversity conference, where countries are expected to adopt a new framework that will represent global commitments to put nature on a path to recovery by 2030."" It is one of our closest primate relatives, but the Bornean orangutan is on the brink of extinction That framework - which has been dubbed a ""Paris climate agreement for nature"", will encompass eight major transitions that all 196 nations will be expected to commit to: Land and forests: Protecting habitats and reducing the degradation of soil; Sustainable agriculture: redesigning the way we farm to minimise the negative impact on nature through things like forest clearance and intensive use of fertilisers and pesticides; Food:Eating a more sustainable diet with, primarily, more moderate consumption of meat and fish and ""dramatic cuts"" in waste; Oceans and fisheries:Protecting and restoring marine ecosystems and fishing sustainably - allowing stocks to recover and important marine habitats to be protected Urban greening:Making more space for nature in towns and cities, where almost three-quarters of us live; Freshwater:Protecting lake and river habitats, reducing pollution and improving water quality; Urgent climate action:Taking action on climate change with a ""rapid phasing out"" of fossil fuels; A 'One Health' approach:This encompasses all of the above. It essentially means managing our whole environment - whether it is urban, agricultural, forests or fisheries - with a view to promoting ""a healthy environment and healthy people"". ""Covid-19 has been a stark reminder of the relationship between human action and nature,"" said Ms Maruma Mrema. ""Now we have the opportunity to do better post-Covid. The pandemic itself has beenlinked to wildlife trade and human encroachment into forests, which scientists say increases the risk of a ""spillover"" of diseases from wildlife into humans. This video can not be played Scientists believe another pandemic will happen during our lifetime The report does highlight some successes: deforestation rates are continuing to fall, eradication of invasive alien species from islands is increasing, and awareness of biodiversity appears to be increasing. Photographer Joel Sartore is on a mission to document threatened species, like the Malayan tiger, before they disappear ""Many good things are happening around the world and these should be celebrated and encouraged,"" said Ms Maruma Mrema. Nevertheless, she added, the rate of biodiversity loss was unprecedented in human history and pressures were intensifying.Â ""We have to act now. It is not too late.

"The DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) was initially adjourned but it resumed business on Tuesday evening Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has tested negative for Covid-19 after reporting feeling unwell. Members of the Irish cabinet were told to restrict their movements after the country's health minister made the report on Tuesday afternoon. Initially it was announced that the cabinet would have to self-isolate and the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) would be adjourned indefinitely. However, the DÃ¡il resumed business on Tuesday evening. The restrictions on the cabinet have now been lifted. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that the decision for the cabinet to restrict their movements came from ""an abundance of caution"". Minister for Climate Action, Communication Networks and Transport, Eamon Ryan, had already been isolating, as a member of his household awaits a test for Covid-19. On Tuesday, three more deaths were reported in the Republic and 357 cases of the virus have been confirmed. Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly reported feeling unwell on Tuesday afternoon Earlier, the Ceann Comhairle SeÃ¡n Ã FearghÃ¡il (Irish parliament speaker) told the DÃ¡il shortly after 17:00 local time that after ""very serious information arising out of events today the Cabinet must now self-isolate"". However, the DÃ¡il later reconvened after 20:00 - the Ceann Comhairle explained that he had been advised at the time that the parliament should be adjourned and then recalled by the taoiseach. Mr Donnelly was present at a press conference on Tuesday morning when the Irish government unveiled a five-stage plan on living with Covid-19. The plan outlined stricter rules for Dublin over the next few weeks because of the increase in infections in the city. Pubs that do not serve food can reopen on 21 September, except in Dublin where they must stay closed From midnight on Tuesday, household visits in the city will be limited to six people from one other household. Elsewhere, the limit will remain at six visitors from up to three households. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said it is designed to provide a roadmap on how to live with Covid-19 for the next six months. He said level five is the most restrictive and similar to what happened during the lockdown in March. He said the country is currently at level two but because of the situation Dublin there were special modifications for the capital. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly (right) was present at a press conference for a new Covid-19 plan on Tuesday morning TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar told the news conference that virus cases have increased tenfold in Dublin over the last two months. Mr Martin also told the news conference that Ireland would sign up for the European Commission's travel plan.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that people 'want to be in work' rather than on furlough The chancellor has said looking for new ways to protect jobs is his ""number one priority"" after the unemployment rate hit its highest level in two years. Rishi Sunak said finding innovative solutions was ""top of mind"" as figures showed unemployment rose to 4.1% in the three months to July, up from 3.9%. Labour called for the furlough scheme to be replaced when it ends in October, warning joblessness could spike. But the chancellor stressed this would not help people find new opportunities. Mr Sunak acknowledged the furlough wage support scheme had worked, with more than half of the 9.6 million workers furloughed since May returning to work by mid-August. Could UK adopt German or French furlough scheme? Which sectors are hiring at the moment? The women who started businesses in lockdown But he told the BBC: ""I wouldn't be being honest with people if I pretended that it was always going to be possible for people to return to the job that they had. ""Now in terms of helping those people, I don't think the right thing to do is to endlessly extend furlough. ""People don't want to be at home, they want to be in work, and that's why our plan for jobs is so important, because it helps provide people with new opportunities, going forward."" Instead he said the government had cut taxes for business, offered targeted support to the hospitality industry, and launched a job retention bonus for firms that bring back staff from furlough. At the job protection scheme's peak in May, 30% of the workforce across the UK was furloughed. That figure fell to 11% by mid-August. Earlier on Tuesday, employment minister Mims Davies also indicated that more targeted support for struggling sectors could be announced by the government. ""There will be sectors that take longer to come back - I don't think this government is afraid of supporting where we can,"" she said. The furlough scheme was designed with a specific problem in mind - to keep people connected to jobs that would return after the pandemic peak passed. Any future package would be concentrated on a different target - to help create new and replacement jobs, or to allow for short time work. Number 11 is still sceptical about sectoral targeting. How do you deal with supply chains, for example, a media buyer who works in the aviation industry? Will cash be wasted on businesses that do not need support? But the very facts that the chancellor pointed out to me in Stoke, that people are quite quickly coming off furlough, show that is less of a worry than might be thought. The ongoing generosity of such a scheme would have to be assessed in the light of the spending review, and high levels of government debt. Something is cooking at the Treasury as it looks beyond furlough scheme. Though it is not yet what might be referred to as ""oven ready"". Read more here Firms have continued to remove staff from payrolls as they prepare for the end of the furlough scheme on 31 October, the latest employment figures show. About 695,000 UK workers have disappeared from the payrolls of British companies since March, when the coronavirus lockdown began, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Young workers have also been hard hit, with those aged 16 to 24 suffering the biggest drop in employment compared with other age groups. Some 156,000 fewer young people were in employment in the three months to July compared to the previous quarter, the ONS said. Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? ""Generation Z has been hit particularly hard by the economic fall out of the pandemic as the retail and hospitality sectors, which have taken such a battering, are often relied on to help school and university leavers find an entry-level job, and get started in the world of work,"" said Susannah Streeter, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Sadly, this may not just be a bump in the road but could have long term consequences for the path of their careers."" The government haslaunched a scheme called Kickstartto create work placements for unemployed young people. Employers will be paid Â£1,500 for every 16-24 year old they train. The unemployment rate has risen slightly, but experts say it does not yet fully illustrate the full impact of the economic crisis on jobs, with the furlough scheme helping keep the numbers down. The government's Job Retention Scheme begins tapering off this month before ending on 31 October. Under the scheme the government initially paid 80% of a person's wages up to Â£2,500 a month. The women who started businesses in lockdown What's the best way to find a new job? Could UK adopt German or French scheme? Since the start of September, the state's contribution has fallen to 70%, with employers expected to make up the remainder of pay. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said there had been some signs that the economy ""reopened"" in July as businesses including restaurants, pubs and hairdressers were allowed to trade again. Job vacancies in the three months to August jumped by 30% to 434,000 - although this was still significantly below pre-virus levels. However, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics research group, said he expected that ""employment will fall more sharply and unemployment will increase more quickly as the furlough scheme continues to unwind and ceases at the end of October"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: The family hit hard by unemployment Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - addressing the TUC conference by video link, as he is self-isolating - called for an extension of part-time working as furlough comes to an end, with rewards for employers who keep people on, though he gave no detail of these rewards. He also called for targeted support for vulnerable sectors such as hospitality and aviation. He urged ministers to ""outlaw fire-and-rehire tactics"" where workers are made redundant, then taken back on worse terms. Orrean Jacob recently lost the job he had done for nine years, working at the Mini car factory in Oxford as an agency worker. ""They decided to let people go, and I was one of them,"" he says.Hundreds of workers at the plant were affected. ""It really hurt. When you go to work, it's not just about the money or pay. It's about making something of yourself, making friends and making connections."" Although he found himself in a similar position to many others during the pandemic, a phone call with a friend presented him with an opportunity. They recommended he get in touch with the HS2 rail project about their one-week training programmes. By the end of the following week, he was fully licensed to be on-site and drive a forklift, having completed a course worth about Â£1,000 with one of HS2's sub-contractors. ""This was just the push I needed in the right direction - to find something new, to find a new path to pursue because the other one clearly wasn't working.""

"Gary Lineker and Zoe Ball are now the highest earners on the star salaries list Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has agreed a Â£400,000 pay cut, the BBC has revealed as it publishes the latest list of its best-paid presenters. Lineker was the highest-earning star with an unchanged salary of Â£1.75m in the 2019/20 financial year. But he has since signed a new contract, which will see that fee cut by 23%. That means he could earn less than Zoe Ball next year. The Radio 2 presenter has seen her pay rise by Â£1m since taking over the breakfast show in 2019. Fiona Bruce and Lauren Laverne have also moved into the top 10 of the highest-paid stars, which features four women for the first time. Vanessa Feltz is also among the top earners,the corporation's annual report shows,external. However, many stars do not appear on the list because the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios, does not have to publish its talent spend. Left to right: Vanessa Feltz, Lauren Laverne and Fiona Bruce are also in the top 10 All 10 of the top-earning presenters on this year's list are white, although the BBC's director general Tim Davie said 18% of those making more than Â£150,000 were from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, up from 12% four years ago. ""We made good progress, if you look across the industry we're in a good place, but we've got work to do,"" Mr Davie said. And while 26.5% of actors and presenters were from BAME backgrounds, it was a different story behind the camera, with 9.8% of production staff from ethnic minorities. The report also showed 12.3% of BBC leaders were BAME, below its 15% target for 2020. George Alagiah is the highest-paid person of colour on the list Lineker's new salary will be published on next year's list. Director general Tim Davie described the former England player as a brilliant broadcaster and said his new five-year deal was a great example of the ""best talent and the best value"". ""And before you ask, Gary knows his responsibility to the BBC in terms of his use of social media,"" Mr Davie added, referring to social media rules for BBC staff and presenters that are expected to be announced soon. Lineker, a prolific tweeter who frequently discusses his political views online,said the BBC,external""recognise that I tweet carefully and will continue to do so"", and sent a message to ""the haters"" on Twitter.

Gary Lineker calls for 'voluntary' licence fee 'I'm kind of the whipping boy for the BBC' The stars of some of the BBC's biggest programmes - like Top Gear and Doctor Who - are absent from the list because they are made by BBC Studios. Ball's Strictly Come Dancing spin-off It Takes Two is produced by the commercial arm, and so is not included. But her pay has risen because this is her first full year since taking over from Chris Evans on Radio 2. Last year, the top earners included three women - Ball, Feltz and Claudia Winkleman. Overall, the BBC's total salary bill for on-air talent in 2019/20 rose by Â£1m to Â£144.6m,while salaries for the BBC's executive committee rose from Â£4.95m to Â£5.41m. Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said the overall rise in pay for on-air talent was ""concerning"". He said: ""Despite Gary Lineker's pay cut, when millions of pensioners are having to find extra cash to pay for the BBC and services they depend on, it's concerning to see not only has the bill for on-air talent has grown by more than Â£1m but that more than 100 senior executives are paid over Â£150,000 a year - in many cases considerably more than that."" The overall gender pay gap at the BBC has fallen from 6.7% to 6.2%. Previous director general Tony Hall had pledged to close the gender pay gap by 2020. Mr Davie said that ""was a very aggressive target,"" adding: ""We can be proud of our progress but we must go further."" He said he wanted to increase the number of women across leadership ranks, where the figure currently stands at 45%, short of the 50% target. ""It's about the leaders, not talk but action,"" he said. There are ""a small number of historic equal pay cases"" to be resolved, the report said. This annual report contains plenty of complex messages, but is likely still to lead to simple and negative headlines for the BBC. The list of salaries for on-air broadcasters - which includes me - reflects three years of reforms. As part of those reforms, many broadcasters - particularly but not exclusively men - either took significant pay cuts (Huw Edwards, Jeremy Vine etc) or left the BBC (Chris Evans, John Humphrys leaving Today, Eddie Mair). Now, several broadcasters - particularly but not exclusively women - have had pay rises. Crucially, the pay rises for these female broadcasters (Zoe Ball, Fiona Bruce, Lauren Laverne, Emily Maitlis), reflect additional work. The overall rise in pay for those whose salaries are published - around Â£1m - is not, in financial terms, huge, given the number of people to which it pertains, and the salaries themselves. Indeed, it is below inflation, and therefore a cut in real terms. Nevertheless, the optics are bad for the BBC. Complexity doesn't cut through in stories about high pay. The simple fact is, in a time of immense hardship across the country, with so many people redundant or furloughed and suffering, these huge salaries (and their modest overall increase) will strike many licence fee payers as disgraceful. The other big story is the BBC's finances. In the medium-term, they are badly strained. It is striking that by the end of next year, the BBC will have delivered around Â£800m in savings in just five years. But the fact that the licence fee didn't rise with inflation between 2010 and 2017, and the Â£125m hit (at least) from the coronavirus pandemic, are a huge injury to the bottom line for the coming year. And that's before you even consider whether a generation who give so much time to TikTok, YouTube and WhatsApp feel they need to pay for a TV licence. Licence fee income dropped by Â£170m to Â£3.52bn in 2019/20, partly due to evasion. Overall, the BBC's overall income was down by Â£119m. There was growth in commercial income from BBC Studios, and the corporation's chairman Sir David Clementi said a drive to increase such revenue would be ""even more pressing"" because there will be ""major financial pressures on the BBC"" in the coming years. The coronavirus pandemic means the organisation has faced ""significant challenges"" and will have to find extra savings on top of those already planned. The BBC has already saved Â£618m since 2016/17, and that figure is expected to rise above Â£800m by the end of the current financial year, the report said.

"The film will chart Madonna's rise to fame ""in a man's world"" Pop icon Madonna has announced she will direct a film about her own life and career. The star is also co-writing the movie with Diablo Cody, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of Juno and Young Adult. The script is expected to chart her rise from Michigan, to the slums of New York City, to global superstardom - via songs such as Like A Virgin and Vogue. The star said the film would focus on music, adding: ""Music has kept me going and art has kept me alive."" The as-yet-untitled project will be Madonna's third as director after 2008's Filth and Wisdom and 2011's WE, which was based around King Edward VIII's affair with Wallis Simpson. The latter film was panned by critics, and bombed at the box office, making just $2m (Â£1.5m) against a budget of $11m (Â£8.5m). We fact-checked the Madonna film script Madonna: 'I want to reinvent pop tours' Madonna cringes at British accent as tour resumes However, rock and pop biopics are in the middle of a purple patch, with huge successes for Elton John's Rocketman and the Freddie Mercury film Bohemian Rhapsody, for which Rami Malek earned an Oscar. Madonna's entry to the genre will be made by Universal Pictures - which previously attracted the artist's anger by snapping upan unofficial script based on her life. Madonna is writing the script with Diablo Cody, with updates on Instagram No casting or production timeline for the film has been announced, but the pop star has charted the early stages of scriptingon her Instagram account,external. In a Q&A with fans, she said the biopic would be about her ""struggle as an artist trying to survive in a man's world,"" adding that the journey covers a range of emotions: ""happy, sad, mad, crazy, good, bad and ugly"". She added that the plot would address her relationship with artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, the fallout from her controversial Like A Prayer video and her experience filming Evita. ""I want to convey the incredible journey that life has taken me on as an artist, a musician, a dancer - a human being, trying to make her way in this world,"" Madonna said in a statement, confirming her directorial role.

"Junior civil servants asked to work on Brexit policy that they fear might break the law, have been advised to inform their managers, BBC Newsnight has learned. The email advice - from senior civil servants in a major government department - sets out what staff should do if they are asked to work on a policy which might be ""inappropriate"". It follows the publication of the Internal Market Bill, which ministers accept contains provisions which would break international law as agreed between the UK and EU, PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons Johnson says bill protects UK's economic borders How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? One departmental e-mail is explicit that it is being sent following ""the government's announcement that it would break international law""- the e-mail advises officials that if they should feel uncomfortable about what they are being asked to do, they must raise it with their superiors. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewislast week confirmed to the House of Commonsthat should the full provisions of the bill be enacted, it would break the commitments the government made as part of the treaty it signed with the EU and therefore, would run counter to international law ""in a very specific and limited way"". However, civil servants' conduct is governed by thecivil service code,external, which makes clear that civil servants must ""comply with the law and uphold the administration of justice"". This has led to some disquiet within elements of the service that they may be asked to enact policies which run counter to their own code of behaviour. The emails seen by Newsnight encourage staff to reacquaint themselves with the code and says that if they are concerned they are ""being asked to do something inappropriate by a fellow civil servant or a minister you should raise it with your line manager immediately"". It is a very unusual move for senior civil servants to advise their colleagues to potentially refuse ministerial instruction. It potentially raises the prospect of renewed tension between ministers and the service as the Brexit process continues.

"The Fitness+ service can be viewed on an iPhone, iPad or via an Apple TV set-top box Apple has unveiled a new personalised workout subscription service alongside new smartwatches and tablet computers. Fitness+ collects health data gathered by an Apple Watch and then displays it alongside workout videos shown on a larger display. The platform will compete with existing fitness apps on iOS from Peloton, Les Mills and Fiit. It also poses a challenge to Fitbit, whose wearables benefit from their own health-coaching subscription service. As many had forecast, Apple decided to hold back details of its next iPhones for a separate event. The iPhone 12 was not unveiled but may have snuck in an appearance in a shot of Apple's labs Like some of its rivals, Fitness+ also allows competitive users to see how their own efforts compare with others who have completed the same fitness routine previously. ""Health-tracking continues to be a major focus for Apple, and its new Fitness+ service signals its intent to generate more revenue from its products in this area,"" commented Leo Gebbie from the consultancy CCS Insight. Fitness+ will initially launch in six countries including the US and UK before the end of 2020. It will cost Â£10 per month or Â£80 per year as a standalone service, which can be shared among members of the same family. Fitness+ features cycling, dance, treadmill and yoga routines among others Alternatively, it can be purchased alongside other Apple services - including iCloud storage, Arcade video games and Apple Music - for about Â£30 per month - as part of the top tier of a bundle of services called Apple One. Other mixes of services can be subscribed to for lower fees. ""Support for 10 different workouts with and without equipment, and the fact it is being sold at a family price will make Fitness+ very attractive,"" said Carolina Milanesi from the Silicon Valley-based consultancy Creative Strategies. ""And I don't think bundling it with the other services is anti-competitive, as you are seeing other services do the same thing - for example Disney's Hulu TV service in the US with Spotify."" Spotify, however, has suggested the bundles are another example of Apple abusing its ""dominant position""and has called on regulators to intervene,external. Chief executive Tim Cook introduced the virtual event from Apple's headquarters in California But one personal trainer said he did not see the new service as competition for one-on-one sessions with an online coach. ""The real results come from support, accountability and understanding human behaviour, and being able to tailor a fitness regime to an individual so that it is sustainable,"" Sam Wake told the BBC. Apple unveiled two new ranges of smartwatches: the high-end Series 6 Watch and lower-priced Watch SE. The Series 6 introduces a blood-oxygen sensor to help manage conditions that affect the heart and lungs. It measures SpO2 levels, which indicate how much oxygen is being carried by the user's red blood cells from the lungs to other parts of their body. Apple suggested this could potentially act as means to detect the early onset of respiratory problems, although its small print says the feature is ""not intended for medical use"". Samsung, Huawei and Fitbit already sell smartwatches that provide the same facility. However, their ability to offer it has depended on the approval of local health regulators. Apple has published a list of where it will offer the feature, confirming itincludes the UK and most other countries,external. The SE model lacks the new sensor, uses a slower processor and does not have an ""always-on"" display, but otherwise offers most of the features found in the more expensive model. The new smartwatches can be customised with a cartoon-like character resembling the owner These include sleep-tracking and a new facility targeted at children called Family Set-up. It can be set to trigger automatic location notifications to a child's parents when the wearer visits familiar places like their grandparents or school. It also makes it possible to assign a unique phone number to a Watch, rather than using one that already belongs to an iPhone. ""A logical use would be for a parent to give a child a cellular-enabled Apple Watch so they can remain in contact,"" commented Mr Gebbie. ""We expect to see hand-me-down Watches used in this scenario, rather than a device bought specifically for this purpose."" The Series 6 range starts at Â£379 and SE at Â£269. Apple's new iPad Air is the first product from the firm to be based on a new chip-manufacturing process that promises more processing power and better energy efficiency thanks to the fact that transistors can be packed together more densely than before. Apple typically launches its new chips inside its iPhone before its iPads, but this year the release of its new handsets have been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The company suggested the A14 processor would make it easier to edit 4K videos and do motion-tracking of real-world objects for augmented reality apps. The machine has a fingerprint sensor built into one of its side buttons to reduce the size of the bezels, and also introduces a USB-C port, which until now had been limited to the more costly iPad Pro range. The new iPad Air also has a slightly larger screen than before - 10.9in (27.7cm) - but it costs Â£100 more, starting at Â£579. The firm also unveiled a new lower-priced basic iPad that uses the older A12 chip. It starts at Â£329, which is Â£20 less than before. Demand for tablets across the wider tech industry has risen since the start of the coronavirus pandemic as consumers increasingly used them for entertainment, home schooling and remote working. Shipments in the April-to-July quarter were up 19% on the same period in 2019, according to research firm IDC, with Samsung, Amazon and Huawei among those making even bigger gains. According to IDC's figures, Apple's iPads remain the market leader, but only saw a 2% annual gain. ""Apple kept its volume but its rivals made strides via the opportunistic sale of cheaper devices,"" commented IDC's Marta Pinto. Apple also announced that iOS 14 - the latest version of its mobile operating system - would be released on Wednesday, This came as a surprise to many developers, who thought they had more time to submit corresponding new versions of their products to Apple's App Store.

"Kim Kardashian West and dozens of other celebrities have announced they will freeze their social media accounts to protest against the spread of ""hate, propaganda and misinformation"". ""Misinformation shared on social media has a serious impact,"" Kardashian West wrote in a statement on Tuesday. The move is part of the #StopHateforProfit campaign which was organised by civil rights activists. The celebrities will freeze their accounts for 24 hours on Wednesday. ""I can't sit by and stay silent while these platforms continue to allow the spreading of hate, propaganda and misinformation - created by groups to sow division and split America apart,""Kardashian West said.,external ""Misinformation shared on social media has a serious impact on our elections and undermines our democracy,"" she added. Facebook 'profits from hate' claims engineer who quit Coca-Cola suspends social media advertising Facebook to tag âharmfulâ posts as boycott widens Other celebrities that have agreed to take part in the boycott include actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Sacha Baron Cohen and Jennifer Lawrence, as well as singer Katy Perry. ""I can't sit idly by while these platforms turn a blind eye to groups and posts spreading hateful disinformation,"" Perry wrote on Instagram. Actor Ashton Kutcher, who has millions of followers and is also joining the boycott, said ""these tools were not built to spread hate [and] violence"". Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom have also joined the boycott The organisers of the#StopHateforProfit campaign,external, which was launched in June, accuse Facebook and Instagram of not doing enough to stop hate speech and disinformation. The group has focused on Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp and last year attracted advertising revenue of almost $70bn (Â£56.7bn). Thousands of businesses and major civil rights groups - including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Anti-Defamation League (AD) - have signed up to the campaign.

"GP Nina Abel, with her two children, could not get a prioritised test for medical staff where she lives in Wiltshire People trying to get Covid-19 tests have spoken of their frustration over the length of time to book, distance to travel and delays after they arrive. One testing site in Abercynon, south Wales, reportedly ran out of kits. Many families had travelled there from England while some Welsh residents had been offered tests in England. The Welsh Government said there were ongoing test issues at a UK-wide level, while contractors Serco said the Abercynon backlog had been cleared. An official at the site told BBC Wales it had closed for a few hours while they fetched more tests from Swansea. Nina Abel, from near Chippenham in Wiltshire, had a 90-minute drive with her children, aged five and two, to Abercynon in Rhondda Cynon Taf for a booked appointment at 09:30 BST on Tuesday. ""I spent all day yesterday refreshing the government website every 15 minutes to try to get appointments for my five-year-old, who's been in school over the last week,"" she said. Dr Abel, a GP, is meant to be in work on Wednesday, but could not get a prioritised test through her local clinical commissioning group. She was told to wait until 12:30 BST for the test in Abercynon because of delays after being informed there were no tests available at her appointed time. ""It's a deeply frustrating situation,"" she said. On keeping her children fed and entertained in a car park, she added: ""I've only got snacks but we've got Frozen 2."" Other people who travelled to Abercynon, in the south Wales valleys, had similar tales to tell. Hannah Summers with her five-year-old daughter Hannah Summers, from Bristol, drove earlier on Tuesday for an hour and 20 minutes for an appointment at  09:30 BST. ""We finally managed to get an appointment yesterday,"" she said. ""My daughter, who is five, has a heavy cold and it's turned into classic Covid symptoms. ""I tried from 3pm. We were offered Bristol but [the system] timed out and crashed,"" she said. ""This was our closest option. I work in early years and I'm a childminder so I've had to cancel everything."" Her daughter Maia is with her for a test while her twin has stayed at home with their father. Ms Summers said: ""The novelty is wearing off. I'm not sure I've got enough food. ""It's put all of us on hold. I can't go back to work until I get a negative result."" She said she had been told her QR code would still be valid for a test ""around midday"" despite it being for an 09:30 slot. Ms Summers described the situation as ""chaotic"", adding: ""The online site is still showing Abercynon as having availability. So another load of people will have turned up."" Allow Twitter content?

The couple both work in manufacturing and do not know if they will get paid while they get the tests done. ""We just had to find a toilet in Abercynon,"" Mr Milosh said. ""We've got water and snacks, but obviously if we have to wait until 12:15 we need something else. It took ages to book this - five hours at least.

Lynette and Adrian Jones from Neath were given tests in Abercynon but had initially been offered tests in Warminster, 100 miles away While families from England spoke of delays and long journeys to Wales, a Welsh couple said it was ""ridiculous"" that they were offered tests in England. Lynette and Adrian Jones, from Neath, condemned the system as a ""shambles"" after they were asked to go to Warminster, in Wiltshire, 100 miles away. They said they were unable to get a test in closer centres to their home such as Margam or Swansea's Liberty Stadium. Rhondda Cynon Taff council leader Andrew Morgan said he was aware of reports of people ""struggling to book a test in a local testing centre"" in the area, whichhas been struggling to avoid a local lockdown over case numbers. ""It is absolutely vital that capacity is increased to further develop our understanding of the prevalence of the virus in communities and identify any clusters that may exist to inform the test and trace operation,"" he said. Meanwhile in north Wales, Julia Massey from Abergele in Conwy said she had to ""fight"" to get a Covid-19 test for her daughter aged 11 and son, aged seven, who both started displaying symptoms last week. When she went online to book tests, she was told the nearest were several hours away in Oldham, Greater Manchester. She eventually managed to get her children tested at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, but staff there told her they were ""only to test where absolutely necessary"". ""It's frustrating,"" said Ms Massey. ""We're following the guidelines, but people seem really reluctant to allow us to have a test. ""And until we do, the children can't go back to school and I can't go back to work."" A Serco spokesman for the Abercynon site said: ""It was closed for a short period because of operational issues but it reopened and the backlog has all been cleared."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""The problems people have been experiencing when trying to book a test are directly related to the ongoing UK-wide issues with theLighthouse Lab,externalsystem, which we urgently need to see resolved at a UK level. ""The health minister [in Wales] has repeatedly raised this with the [UK government's] secretary of state for health. ""We are moving as much NHS Wales testing capacity as we can into areas where testing is needed the most, as well as taking urgent action to switch over testing facilities to Welsh laboratories to further increase capacity while the UK government resolves these issues with the Lighthouse Lab system.""

"The testing system is facing an ""enormous challenge"" after a ""sharp rise"" in those seeking a Covid-19 test, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. When asked about reports of people struggling to get tested, Mr Hancock said it would take a ""matter of weeks"" to resolve the issues. He said No 10 would update its testing policy shortly to prioritise the most urgent cases. Test slots have been limited due to bottlenecks in lab processing of swabs. The rise in demand for tests had led to local shortages, with Labour saying no tests were available in virus ""hotspots"" over the weekend. Hospital bosses have also warned that a lack of tests for NHS workers is putting services at risk. 'How am I supposed to get my family of eight tested?' NHS staff 'off work due to testing shortages' Three government claims on testing fact-checked Call for mini lockdowns as coronavirus cases mount People have told the BBC of their frustrationat being turned away from a walk-in test centre in Oldham, Greater Manchester. A woman attending the walk-in centre said staff told her that labs were struggling to turn tests around. BBC Health editor Hugh Pym said: ""There seem to be enough testing sites, but there are bottlenecks in the labs for processing the swabs taken. That's why they're limiting the amount of slots for the public, just when more people want to get tested."" One Cabinet minister told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergthis was a ""classic government problem"" where demand for a public service outstrips supply. The minister, she said, was confident that ""underneath the noise"", the majority of people were getting the service they needed, when they needed it. This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people trying to get tests at a centre in Oldham On Saturday, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told the BBC that thegovernment was working to boost testing capacity through investment in new testing centres and so-called lighthouse labs. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said sheis hopeful that a backlog in test results will be resolvedshortly, after ""constructive"" talks with Mr Hancock. The UK government announced3,105 new lab-confirmed cases on Tuesday,external, bringing the total number of positive tests to 374,228. Another 27 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, bringing the overall death toll to 41,664. The number of patients in mechanical ventilation beds across the UK has passed 100 for the first time in nearly two months. There were 106 patients on ventilation in the UK on Monday - the first time the figure has been over 100 since 24 July. UK-wide figures for today are yet to be published but there were 101 patients on ventilation in England alone on Tuesday. Around 220,000 tests are processed each day, according togovernment figures released last week,external, with a testing capacity of more than 350,000 - which includes swab tests and antibody tests. The aim is to increase that to 500,000 a day by the end of October. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock said there were ""operational challenges"" with testing which the government was ""working hard"" to fix. He said throughout the pandemic they had prioritised testing according to need. Mr Hancock said the ""top priority is and always has been acute clinical care"", followed by social care, where the government is sending ""over 100,000 tests a day"" due to the virus risks in care homes. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We're working around the clock to make sure everyone who needs a test can get a test"" Conservative chairman of the Health and Social Care Committee Jeremy Hunt was among the MPs to question Mr Hancock on testing, saying a number of his constituents had to travel for tests, while one key worker had to wait a week for her results. ""A week ago today, the secretary of state told the Health Select Committee that he expected to have this problem solved in two weeks,"" Mr Hunt said. ""Is the secretary of state, given the efforts that his department is making, still confident that in a week's time we will have this problem solved?"" ""I think that we will be able to solve this problem in a matter of weeks,"" Mr Hancock replied. He said demand was ""high"" but ""record capacity"" was being delivered, with plans to ensure tests are prioritised for those that need them most. Despite the health secretary's promises, there will be no easy solution to the shortages of tests. All the expectations are that cases will go up. People are circulating more as society reopens and we are entering the period when respiratory viruses thrive. As cases go up so will demands on the testing system. Even with the promise of more testing capacity in the coming weeks, the chances of shortages continuing remains a distinct possibility. A new lab is due to open later this month which will be able to carry out 50,000 tests a day. But this could easily be swallowed up. What it means is that testing will have to be prioritised where it is needed most. That will be in care homes, hospitals and among key workers, as well as where there are local outbreaks. The government's surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics will also be protected. But this is not unique to the UK. Other countries are facing similar pressures. In fact, the UK is testing more people per head of population than Spain, France and Germany. It promises to be a difficult winter across Europe. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Hancock was ""losing control of this virus"". He said that after schools and offices reopened, extra demand on the system was ""inevitable"". He questioned why Mr Hancock did not use the summer ""to significantly expand"" NHS lab capacity and ""fix"" contact tracing. Responding, Mr Hancock said it was ""inevitable"" that demand would rise with a free service, adding the ""challenge"" was to ensure tests are prioritised for those who most need them.

"Testing at a drive-in mobile unit in Rhondda Cynon Taf on Saturday Some mobile testing units will be run by the Welsh NHS in a bid to control potential outbreaks after UK lab issues, the health minister has said. On Friday tests in Wales were capped after increased demand saw UK-wide issues. Vaughan Gething said the issues could go on ""for weeks"" and Wales would not rely on the Lighthouse labs programme. But Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the issues came after a ""huge demand for tests"". The mobile testing units are new, run under the Lighthouse labs partnership between the private sector and UK and devolved governments. Each unit can normally carry out around 300 tests a day - but high demand around the UK as cases have risen has meant a limit of 60 was set for each mobile unit in Wales by the UK government. Capacity problems at the labs have resulted in people being asked to travel long distances to access drive-through tests,with some people reported being offered tests more than 50 miles (80km) from their homes. A mobile testing unit was set up in Porth, Rhondda, on Thursday and moved to Clydach Vale at the weekend Following a local lockdown imposed in Caerphilly,officials were told this week they had just days to ""get on top of"" rising infections in Rhondda Cynon Taff(RCT). But on Friday, Council leader Andrew Morgan had said a ""huge effort"" would have to be made after the cap was introduced by the UK government. On Sunday, Mr Morgan confirmed that the area now had 300 drive through tests and 300 walk in tests available, following the limitations. Discussions with the UK Government's Health Secretary Matt Hancock led to the limit being increased to 150 on Saturday before rising to 300 tests on Sunday. Mr Morgan tweeted that ""Welsh agencies are using their capacity to boost numbers"". Speaking toBBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programmeMr Gething said that the situation on Friday was ""unacceptable"" and lessons were being learnt rapidly. ""[These issues] are not going to be resolved for a period of weeks and we just can't have that position repeating itself several times over the next three weeks,"" he said. He said that the Welsh Government had ""always wanted to build up have built up a significant NHS Wales testing capacity"", but that action was needed to safeguard Wales' resources. ""What I'm looking to do is to shift our mobile testing units, some of which are run through lighthouse labs where the tests are processed, and to try to move more of those to NHS Wales capacity, because that would mean we wouldn't have this problem,"" he said. ""If we have flare-ups and outbreaks or I need to put mobile testing resources in, we won't then rely on the lighthouse lab programme,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

"The government is facing criticism over its ""world-beating"" coronavirus testing system after people reported struggles to get tests, including being offered slots at testing sites a long way away. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and various cabinet members have been defending the scheme, and have claimed that testing capacity is increasing and that the average trip to get tested isn't that far. We've looked at five of their claims. The health secretary made this claim in the House of Commons - last week, he said the average distance was 6.4 miles. Initially, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not release the data on this - despite our repeated requests to see it.Now it has released some of it.,external It supports Mr Hancock's claims. It states that the median distance travelled (that's the point at which half the trips were shorter and half longer) in England in the last week was 5.8 miles. This was down from 6.4 miles the previous week. It also shows that the 5% of people travelled more than 47 miles away for a test - that would make a round-trip of 94 miles.How far are people travelling to get tested? It counts trips made to regional test centres, local walk-ins and mobile test units. What's going wrong with coronavirus testing? How do I get a coronavirus test? Not enough tests for five months, study predicts It doesn't supply the numbers of people butwe know 360,000 tests were processed from these sites,externalin the latest week. 5% of this figure would be around 18,000 people who travelled nearly 50 miles to a test centre (although some may have got more than one test). The data also shows that most people (75%) travelled around 13 miles each way. The DHSC has also given us details about how it worked the distances out. It uses a straight line from someone's location to the test site ""as the crow flies"". But this doesn't take into account that most roads are not in a straight line between the two points - so average distance actually travelled will be higher. For example, if someone was to drive between the BBC offices in central London and the Wembley testing facility, the exact distance between the two is 5.5 miles (8.9km). However, once you take into account the actual roads, this increases to about eight miles. Finally, the data only records people who booked a test. It doesn't tell us how many tried to get one, decided the one they were offered was too far away and didn't take it. As of 30 August, the UK had processed just over 15m antigen tests, - the ones which tell you whether you currently have coronavirus. This total is higher than any other country in Europe, according to data collected by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an EU agency. Their figures show that, by this date: Germany processed 12.3m tests France processed 7.4m tests Comparisons between countries will not always be perfect, because some countries report less often and there might be some differences in methodology. A coronavirus testing centre in Cologne's Rautenstrauch Joest museum Boris Johnson has also claimed that the UK is testing more per head of population than France, Germany and Spain. Looking at this measure allows for differences in population size between countries. Mr Johnson is right - according to ECDC data on tests per 1,000 people for the week ending 30 August: UK - 19 tests per 1,000 France - 13 tests per 1,000 Germany - 13 tests per 1,000 Spain - 12 tests per 1,000 The data also shows that four European countries rank higher than the UK, including Denmark on 42 tests per 1,000. The home secretary is correct that government data shows that both testing capacity and laboratory capacity have increased considerably since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there has been a sizeable gap between how many tests labs are able to process (""capacity"") and the number of tests actually processed. For example, on 10 September, labs in the UK would have been able to process 244,000 antigen tests, which indicate if you currently have the virus, but processed 204,000. This means, in theory, labs could have processed results for 40,000 more tests. Last week, Sarah-Jane Marsh, a director of the government's test-and-trace programme in England, confirmed there was a problem with the labs, offering a ""heartfelt apology"" to those who couldn't get a test. ""All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don't look overcrowded, it's our laboratory processing that is the critical pinch-point,"" she said. Data on backlogs in labs is not publicly available, but on Tuesday Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the backlog was ""less than a day's capacity"". This means it could be anywhere up to 244,000. He added that this has been driven by a surge in demand as children go back to school and adults return to work. We have asked the government why - in a system with more lab capacity than actual tests carried out - there is a backlog, but have had no response. The latest test return times in England we have, are for the week to 9 September - the figure is actually for people getting results within 24 hours rather than the next day. The figure Mr Johnson appears to be referring to is the proportion of test results published within 24 hours of them being received by a laboratory -it was 88.8% according to the latest figures,external. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health But this excludes the time it takes to get the test to the lab, and it's for pillar 1 tests, which are for people with a clinical need and are processed in Public Health England labs and NHS hospitals. For pillar 2 tests,the ones for the wider population and run by private labs,external, the median turnaround time from taking a test at a regional test site to getting the result was 27 hours, which means half of tests took longer than that, and half took less time. For mobile testing units that figure was 26 hours, but for satellite testing centres it was 97 hours. Satellite tests are ones which are processed by private labs and sent to places like care homes or hospitals. The government says tests in these settings are often conducted over multiple days. This means that someone might take a test a few days before it is collected. Outside permanent drive-through testing sites, people can also get testing kits delivered to their home or visit mobile testing sites, which move around according to demand. Ms Patel is correct that there has been an increase in both of these, doubling in number since the end of May. It is difficult to confirm whether more tests are taking place in lockdown areas because - again - the government does not release this data by local authority. We also don't know how many people have asked for tests but have not been able to get them when they want them. On 15 September, the health secretary said 9,278 Pillar 2 - or commercially run - tests were carried out in the top 10 most affected areas of the country. That equates to about 7.5% of all tests on an average day. These 10 areas make up 5% of the population, meaning they received proportionally more tests.

"Caerphilly went into lockdown last week Wales should use micro-quarantines to avoid a second national lockdown in the winter, Plaid Cymru has said. It came before the Welsh Government outlined how it will tackle coronavirus in the NHS during the winter months. Plaid said small areas could be locked down around clusters where there has been a higher rate of infection, rather than entire council area. Caerphilly countybecame the first place in Wales to go into local lockdownlast week. On Tuesday, Wales' Labour Health Minister Vaughan Gething published a winter protection plan. It includes anextra 5,000 NHS beds - half in field hospitals - to cope with winter pressures, including a potential second wave of Covid-19 in hospitals. Earlier, he warned of the risk of afurther national lockdownif members of the public do not better respect social distancing rules. Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said the plan needs to be able to deal with both Covid-19 and the usual winter pressures in health and social care. ""Seeing the minister dismantling one Â£25m field hospital at the Principality stadium andbuilding a smaller Â£33m one a few miles awaydoes not fill you with confidence that the ministers plan will achieve this,"" he added. Plaid says people should be encouraged to keep records of their contacts with the help of an app Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price proposed a ""10-point coronavirus winter plan"", which included""smart-lockdowns"" used in countries including Pakistan,external- with targeted lockdowns including a ""local economic package of support"". ""If we do not act, then winter could become a second wave that is even worse than the first, with little option than reintroducing a full lockdown,"" he said. The party also proposed encouraging everyone to keep contact records, with the support of an app, and testing individuals who have been in contact with people with coronavirus, but do not have symptoms themselves. 18,000 Covid-19 test results put online by mistake New rules and lockdowns 'could be too late' Plaid called for quick saliva tests to be implemented, national guidance for face masks in schools, and better use of ventilation. People should be asked to avoid closed, crowded and close-contact settings, Plaid said, calling for a new Covid-19 plan ahead of a vaccine. The Welsh Government said: ""Our contact tracing system is helping us to quickly identify confirmed cases and routes of transmission to allow us to respond swiftly. ""We have introduced new local restrictions in Caerphilly County Borough Council area in response to the rapid increase in this area and new national restrictions to slow the spread after seeing an overall increase in cases across Wales. Local authorities are also taking targeted local action. ""As the first minister said on Friday, this is a fast-moving situation and we have a small window to act to prevent a fresh coronavirus crisis in Wales. We need the help of everyone in the country to do that."" It later added said: ""The new Cardiff facility is designed to last for 20 years and is modular so can be moved to other sites. ""We have carried out a review of the extra bed capacity that will be needed across NHS Wales, using the latest projections and lessons learnt from earlier this year. ""A full plan of the extra capacity for all health boards will be published by the end of this month.""

"Family queuing for coronavirus tests in Oldham No government wants scenes like this. Families in Oldham,external, where there has been particular concern about the spread of coronavirus, are boiling over with frustration that they can't access tests. Not least a government that promised the public its testing system would be better than any other country's in the world. Not least a government that believes a properly functioning testing system is vital to keeping kids back in school and climbing out of recession as quickly as possible. Not least a government that knows testing is a crucial way to monitor and control the virus that saw such a terrible loss of life in the grim spring that we have all just lived through. How do I get a coronavirus test? Testing problems to be solved in weeks - Hancock Coronavirus testing system 'falling over' The challenges are obvious. The system was scrambled together in a matter of months. There seem to be problems with capacity in labs. Huge numbers of people are now getting tested. Demand has soared, with children going back to school, and ministers having initially encouraged people to come forward. The government has been trying to move testing capacity around to areas where its most needed, promising now to deliver 100,000 tests a day to care homes, where people are particularly vulnerable. But with varying statistics, it can be hard to work out exactly what is going on. There is a mountain of anecdotal evidence of real frustration with the system, but this is what we know for sure. One Cabinet minister told me yesterday it's a ""classic government problem"" where demand for a public service outstrips supply. That minister was confident that ""underneath the noise"" the majority of people are getting the service they need and when they need it. But in the House of Commons today you couldn't help but bump into MPs from all parties full of complaints from constituents about a lack of access. Claims from Jacob Rees Mogg today,external, that the system is a ""national success"" don't exactly scream empathy with people stuck in the system. And after a painful few months for many people in all sorts of ways, public patience is not elastic. The prime minister last week even promised by early next year there could be 10 million tests a day. But overpromising and underdelivering is not a reputation any government desires. Who can still get free Covid tests?

"This video can not be played (September 2020) Donald Trump on Israel-UAE-Bahrain deals: 'We mark the dawn of a new Middle East' US President Donald Trump has hailed the ""dawn of a new Middle East"", amid Israel's landmark deals with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain. Mr Trump spoke as the two Gulf states signed agreements fully normalising their relations with Israel. The three countries hailed the deals as historic, as did Mr Trump, whose administration helped broker them. The Gulf states are just the third and fourth Arab countries to recognise Israel since its founding in 1948. Mr Trump hopes other countries will follow suit, but the Palestinians have urged them not to while their conflict remains unresolved. For decades, most Arab states have boycotted Israel, insisting they would only establish ties after Israel's dispute with the Palestinian was settled. Why Israel's peace deals with Gulf states matter Israel opens tentative new chapter with Gulf Arabs What does Trump's Mid-East plan say on key issues? ""After decades of division and conflict we mark the dawn of a new Middle East,"" Mr Trump told a crowd of hundreds gathered at the White House on Tuesday. ""We're here this afternoon to change the course of history,"" he added. This video can not be played ""A threat to the viability of the two state solution"" brought plans forward, says Anwar Gargash Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the deals, saying, ""This day is a pivot of history; it heralds a new dawn of peace."" But Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said only an Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories could bring peace to the Middle East. ""Peace, security and stability will not be achieved in the region until the Israeli occupation ends,"" he said in a statement after the signing of the deals, AFP news agency reports. The Israeli army said that two rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel while the ceremony was under way. Before the UAE and Bahrain, the only other Arab countries in the Middle East to recognise Israel officially were Egypt and Jordan, who signed peace treaties in 1978 and 1994 respectively. Mauritania, a member of the Arab League in north-west Africa, established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1999 but severed ties in 2010. The flags of the involved nations were projected on a section of the walls surrounding Jerusalem's Old City All eyes will be on whether other countries in the region follow suit, above all Saudi Arabia. So far, the Saudis have signalled that they are not ready. The agreements are also likely to usher in new security ties in a region where many of the Gulf Arab states share with the Israelis a common adversary in Iran. Analysis by Gary O'Donoghue, Washington correspondent These agreements represent the most significant diplomatic achievement of the Trump administration. Persuading two Arab states to engage in this kind of rapprochement with Israel - without a solution to the Palestinian question - marks a significant move for pan-Arab unity. The specific details of the agreements are not yet public, but there will be embassies, commercial deals and the opening of travel links between the countries. Mr Trump even suggested five other Arab states were ""far down the road"" towards finalising similar arrangements. But the agreements have been condemned by the Palestinian leadership as a ""black day"" for the region. Developments on the ground in the occupied West Bank and Gaza could still derail these new relationships. The Palestinians have said the agreements are dangerous betrayals. They believe the moves by the Gulf countries renege on a promise by Arab states not to embrace ties with Israel until Palestinian statehood is achieved. The UAE has said progress on Palestinian statehood is central, and that their agreement included a promise from Israel to ""suspend"" its controversial plan to annex key parts of the occupied West Bank that were allocated to it by President Trump under the Middle East peace plan he unveiled in January. The Palestinians rejected Mr Trump's proposals as biased towards Israel and warned that annexation would destroy their hopes of a viable future independent state and violate international law - a stance supported by much of the international community. This video can not be played The earlier Israel-UAE agreement made it possible for young people from both nations to meet online The UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs told the BBC that it had sensed an ""opportunity"" when Mr Netanyahu signalled he would press ahead with annexation earlier this year. ""Everybody was worried about the annexation of Palestinian lands, which was really a threat to the viability of the two-state solution,"" Anwar Gargash said. ""And I think this sort of brought our plans forward and gave us a reason, a clear reason and clear rationale, why a decision that we would have taken in 2021 or 2022 should be taken now."" Mr Gargash said he did not believe Mr Netanyahu or another Israeli leader would be likely to renege on the promise to suspend the annexation plans. The UAE has called on the Palestinian leadership to use this moment to reorganise its approach and prepare to re-engage in productive discussions with Israel. In a statement issued after he attended the ceremony at the White House, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said the deals were ""a massive and welcome opportunity to recast the politics of the region"". He said he understood Palestinian objections but that ""in time, the Palestinian people will understand that it is only by radically changing strategy that the legitimate aspirations for a viable Palestinian state can be realised"". There is a backdrop of the regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran in these diplomatic moves. The decades-old feud between them is exacerbated by religious differences. They each follow one of the two main branches of Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals The UAE and Bahrain are both Saudi allies. Saudi Arabia's response will be watched closely. There is no indication yet it is ready to follow Bahrain and the UAE. This video can not be played Jared Kushner: ""A new script for a new Middle East"" Prior tothe announcement of the UAE agreement in August- which included the suspension of Israel's controversial plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank - Israel had had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries. Last month saw the first official flight from Israel to the UAE, which was seen as a major step in normalising relations. President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who was on the plane, described the UAE deal as having ""the ability to change the whole course of the Middle East"".

"This video can not be played ""It's only the beginning of getting full justice"": Breonna Taylor's mother reacts to the settlement Officials in Louisville, Kentucky have agreed to pay $12m (Â£9.3m) to the family of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was killed in her home by police. Taylor was 26 when she was shot at least five times and killed on 13 March during a mistaken drugs raid. Her name has featured prominently in anti-racism protests in recent months. Lonita Baker, a lawyer for Taylor's family, called the settlement just one ""layer"" in the effort to seek justice, and praised new police reforms. ""Justice for Breonna is multi-layered,"" said Ms Baker at a press conference on Tuesday alongside Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. She called the agreement ""tremendous, but only a portion"" of what the family hopes for, including the arrest of the officers involved in her death. ""Today what we did here was to do what we could do to bring a little bit of police reform and it's just a start,"" continued Ms Baker. ""But we finished the first mile in the marathon and we've got a lot more miles to go to until we achieve and cross that finish line."" The settlement includes a series of police reforms in the city, including a requirement that all search warrants be approved by a senior officer and giving a housing credit to officers who move to low-income neighbourhoods they patrol in the city. In a short statement, Taylor's mother Tamika Palmer called for criminal charges against the officers and asked people to continue to say her daughter's name publicly in advocacy for police reforms. Oprah Magazine to honour Breonna Taylor Why Breonna Taylor's name is chanted at demos Timeline of US police killings The settlement is the largest financial sum paid in a police misconduct case in the city's history, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. This video can not be played ""Questions still aren't answered"": Breonna Taylor's family are worried about a ""cover-up"" Taylor's killing was propelled into the spotlight once again with the death George Floyd, an African-American man who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for minutes during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May. Floyd's death sparked global anti-racism protests and brought renewed focus on police brutality. Shortly after midnight on 13 March, three officers entered Taylor's apartment by executing a no-knock search warrant - a court document that authorises police to enter a home without warning. Taylor and her partner, Kenneth Walker, were reportedly asleep as the commotion began. The officers exchanged fire with Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner who called 911 in the belief that the drug raid was a burglary. The officers - who fired more than 25 bullets - said they returned fire after one officer was shot and wounded. Taylor, a decorated emergency medical technician, was 26 when she died. During the exchange, Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was shot eight times and later died. No drugs were found on the property. The lawsuit filed by Taylor's family accuses the officers of battery, wrongful death, excessive force and gross negligence. It also says the officers were not looking for her or her partner, but for an unrelated suspect who did not live in the complex. Her family has also accused police of leading the raid as a plot to gentrify her neighbourhood. The city's mayor dismissed the allegation as ""outrageous"" and ""without foundation or supporting facts"". One of the officers involved in the raid, Brett Hankison, was fired in June. The other two - Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove - were placed on administrative leave. The city's police chief was also fired in June after a separate police shooting. A grand jury could soon decide whether criminal charges should be filed against any of the officers. Until Freedom, a social justice organisation that has held rallies for Taylor, released a statement saying: ""No amount of money will bring back Breonna Taylor."" ""True justice is not served with cash settlements,"" the group added. ""We need those involved in her murder to be arrested and charged. We need accountability. We need justice."" Earlier this year, Louisville's city council voted unanimously in favour of banning no-knock warrants. Similar legislation that would ban the warrants nationwide was introduced in the US Congress.

"Extra beds, like the ones provided at a field hospital in the centre of Cardiff, will now be provided at a temporary unit on the site of the city's main hospital There will be an extra 5,000 NHS beds - half in field hospitals - to cope with winter pressures, including a potential second wave of Covid-19 in hospitals. Unveiling the winter plan for NHS Wales, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it was ""expected to be our most difficult yet"". The extra capacity is to deal with a worst-case scenario. Meanwhile,the flu vaccine will be available to both people shielding and their families. NHS Wales said without action taken in March, there could have been 100,000 hospital admissions as well as ""very significant numbers of deaths"". Chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said: ""If there's a second peak, we have to have the NHS capacity in place."" Further details of the future pattern of field hospitals will be announced later. The network was set up originally to provide an extra 6,000 beds to cope with a worst-case scenario. For this winter, it will involve keeping in placesome of those 17 field hospitals already in placewhile allowing others judged surplus to requirements to revert back to their former uses. It has already been announced that thePrincipality Stadium in Cardiff, which has been equipped with 2,000 beds, will be decommissioned, with a Â£33m 400-bed unit instead built on the University Hospital of Wales site. The Swansea Bay field hospital being fitted out The Bay Studios field hospital in Swansea will be kept on and its extra beds will also be available to neighbouring health boards if needed. Other hospitals could get temporary facilities on site. Mr Gething said: ""Sadly, many people have lost loved ones as a result of Covid-19. Preventing more families from experiencing such tragedy is paramount in our planning and decision making."" He said the health service must remain vigilant, with services being able to respond ""quickly and flexibly to changing circumstances"". Vaughan Gething said decisions were informed by scientific evidence Mr Gething said: ""We will continue to provide support and protection to staff and residents so that we can avoid, if at all possible, having to take the drastic measures that were needed in March."" The plans also say while local lockdowns might restrict access, health and social services ""must do what we can to encourage and be creative in how we use other forms of communication so that families can keep in touch"". A 75% target has been set for flu vaccinations of those at risk, as well as health and social workers. If and when Covid-19 vaccine becomes available, NHS Wales said mechanisms were in place to roll it out from as early as November - which would involve different NHS staff in different settings. Prince Charles Hospital, in Merthyr, an area with one of the highest infection rates in Wales NHS Wales also wants to ensure there are segregated areas so normal treatment can continue - but it is recognised if a second wave of Covid-19 and other winter pressures came together, then routine treatment may have to be put on hold. ""Our 999 calls are pretty much back to normal and A&E and emergency admissions are returning to normal levels of activity, and primary care very busy,"" said Dr Goodall. He said there was still concern over essential services such as cancer and other patients on waiting lists. ""Cancer was an area that we prioritised all the way through,"" he said. ""We were worried when referrals dropped down by about 60% early on. But referrals have recovered to levels higher than I would normally expect to see. ""But cancer treatment activity is still a bit lower than I would expect to see. We need to make sure we work through a plan to deal with people on waiting lists."" The NHS Confederation in Wales, which represents health boards, called on the public to help keep Covid-19 cases under control. ""If we behave responsibly and take sensible steps to mitigate the spread of disease, we can protect the NHS and save lives again,"" said director Darren Hughes. ""Please do not go to A&E departments as a first port of call, you could be putting other patients and staff at risk. You should only use A&E departments in an emergency."" Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said it was critically important to address the backlog of waiting times: ""It's important that the public can have confidence that some of these waiting times will be eaten into."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said people needed to know lessons had been learnt from some of the mistakes made early on, while the issues around testing capacity needed to be addressed to ensure problems were not an issue over the coming weeks and months. Brexit Party MS Mandy Jones said one of her biggest worries was over extra cancer deaths because of Covid-19 and also the effect on diagnostic services, with more patients being referred.

"The breach involved the details of people who tested positive for Covid-19 First Minister Mark Drakeford found out about a major coronavirus data breach 11 days after his Health Minister Vaughan Gething, according to accounts given in the Senedd by the pair. Mr Gething said he received a ""serious incident alert"" on 3 September. But Mr Drakeford said he found out on Monday - the day when Public Health Wales disclosed what happened publicly. Details relating to 18,000 people who tested positive for the virus had been published on the health body's site. The data, including theinitials, date of birth, geographical area and sexof individuals involved, remained live from 14:00 on 30 August to 09:55 the next morning. Public Health Wales (PHW) has apologised for the breach. In the Senedd Mr Drakeford said he did not know when officials and ministers, other than himself, were informed of the breach. Tory Senedd member Andrew RT Davies said called for an investigation by the permanent secretary into how the first minister ""claims to have been kept in the dark on such a serious issue"". The information was online for 20 hours before being taken down At First Minister's Questions Welsh Conservative group leader Paul Davies called for the first minister to apologise to those affected by the incident. Mr Drakeford replied: ""I learned of this data breach yesterday [Monday], and I learned of it as a result of Public Health Wales' statement."" ""It is a serious matter when data regulations are not properly observed."" He said PHW had been right to apologise to those concerned. ""Thankfully... the breach lasted for less than a day, and the initial inquiries suggest that no harm has been done as a result, but that is a matter of luck rather than anything else."" Mr Drakeford said it was right that PHW had instituted an inquiry and informed the information commissioner. Mark Drakeford was questioned on the matter by Andrew RT Davies in the Senedd on Tuesday Pressed by Tory Senedd member Andrew RT Davies on when the Welsh Government was informed and which minister was the first to be told, Mr Drakeford said: ""I know when I was informed. ""I don't know the answer to those other questions nor would I expect to know them just standing up here in the chamber."" But Vaughan Gething later told Senedd members he was informed by ""a serious incident alert on 3 September"", after officials were told on 2 September. ""That is entirely normal,"" he said. ""We don't believe anyone has come to harm. But it is a serious breach and it needs to be treated seriously. ""That's why there is an independent investigation,"" he said, promising that a report on the matter will be released publicly. Andrew RT Davies said: ""This either points to a seriously dysfunctional working relationship between currently the two most important people in the Welsh Labour Government, or someone is not telling the full story. ""There are also serious questions as to why Public Health Wales and Vaughan Gething sat on this breach for two weeks before making it public."" Public Health Wales, in answering a question as to why it took two weeks before the public was informed, said: ""The time between the breach itself and the announcement included notifying the Information Commissioner's Office and Welsh Government of the breach, seeking legal advice from GDPR experts, conducting a risk assessment, liaising with NHS and local authority partners about the incident and mitigation strategy, and establishing an independent investigation. ""After these steps had been taken, we made the announcement on Monday in order to maximise media and public engagement.""

"The Ukrainian and Israeli governments had called on Hasidic Jews not to travel to Uman this year Hundreds of Hasidic Jews have been stranded at the border between Ukraine and Belarus as coronavirus restrictions impede an annual pilgrimage. The pilgrims were travelling to the central Ukrainian town of Uman to visit the tomb of Rabbi Nahman, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic movement. Every year thousands make the journey to mark the Jewish New Year, which in 2020 runs from 18 to 20 September. However, Ukraine has closed its borders to limit the spread of coronavirus. As the pilgrims - many of them from Israel - attempted to enter Ukraine this week, they were stopped by border guards. They began their journey despite appeals from both the Ukrainian and Israeli governments asking them not to travel to Uman this year, fearing a spike in coronavirus infections. Ukrainian authorities said the Hasidic Jews were not exempt from the travel ban Ukraine has restricted entry to foreigners from 28 August to 28 September to curb the spread of coronavirus. Meanwhile,Israel has imposed a new national lockdown, with tough restrictions coming into effect on the first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Despite this, Ukrainian authorities said hundreds more pilgrims were expected to seek entry to the country in the coming days. On Tuesday, estimates varied as to how many were already at Ukraine's borders. Traffic had to be stopped at the border on Monday night Belarusian and Ukrainian authorities put the number at about 700, butthe Times of Israel reported,externalthat there were at least 1,000 pilgrims trapped at the border. Pictures from the border show dozens of Hasidic Jews wearing traditional dress and carrying luggage as they wandered along a road thronged by lorries. Safety guidance issued for Jewish festivals Why it could be a 'lonely time' for Jewish families On Monday night Ukrainian guards said they had to stop traffic on the crossing at Novi Yarylovychi, because the pilgrims were in the way. Some pilgrims had set up makeshift tents, while others slept on their luggage in front of the lorries. ""I spent the night on the bus, but most of them spent the night right on the road, some gathered branches in the forest and lit fires,"" one pilgrim told Reuters news agency. ""We have no food or water."" The Red Cross Society of Belarus said the pilgrims did not have ""enough resources to ensure their basic needs"" and assistance was being provided. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has told officials to provide assistance to the pilgrims, accusing Ukraine of ""shutting its borders"" and leaving hundreds of people in neutral territory. Ukraine's government has insisted it will not waive the travel restrictions. ""I don't know who promised to whom the passage of 3,000 citizens,"" the head of Ukraine's border service Serhiy Deyneko told pilgrims at the border. ""You were deceived."" Ukraine's border service head Serhiy Deyneko (R) spoke to pilgrims at the border On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the situation with Mr Deyneko, his office said. Ukraine had full control of the situation, it added. The Belarusian border service said it was helping pilgrims return to Belarus,according to state news agency Belta.,external In the meantime, many pilgrims remain camped out at the border, in the hope Ukrainian authorities will allow them to enter the country before Jewish New Year, Belta reported.

"Campaigners outside court during a previous hearing Two women affected by the state pension age being changed from 60 to 66 for women have lost their appeal against a High Court ruling. Campaigners claim women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by rapid changes to their pension age, due to reach 66 later this year. On Tuesday, senior judges unanimously dismissed the women's appeal. They say introducing the same state pension age for men and women did not amount to unlawful discrimination. The government welcomed the ruling, saying the changes were a ""long-overdue move towards gender equality"". Julie Delve, 62, and Karen Glynn, 63, backed by campaign group BackTo60, were challenging the pension age changes after losing a High Court fight against the Department for Work and Pensions last year. The fight over women's state pensions The campaign groups associated with the court case represent almost four million women who were affected by the government decision to increase the state pension age from 60 to 66. Many on lower incomes say they are facing financial hardship as a result. Campaigners, however, say their fight is not over. Joanne Welch, founder and director of BackTo60, told the BBC she would now consider taking the case to the Supreme Court and would also draft legislation to bring a women's Bill of Rights. Unison, the UK's largest trade union, said raising the state pension age with ""next to no notice"" has had a calamitous effect on the retirement plans of a generation of women. It called on MPs to intervene to help those women who were now struggling to make ends meet. Pamela Satchwell had to carry on working post 60 after the pension age rules changed. She did 16 hours a week as a carer for disabled children and people with ADHD. But without a pension contribution to support her earnings, it was not enough. Pam's husband then died. She subsequently lost her house because she could not afford her mortgage alone and she had to sell all of the jewellery her husband had given her. Now that she is 67, she is finally receiving her pension and she manages better financially. ""But it's too late now. I lost my home, I have none of the trinkets my husband gave me. I lost the life I had and I am never going to get it back,"" says Pam. As for the women involved in the court case, Pam wishes people understood it is not so easy for that those who found out they could not retire. ""You can not just run out and find a job when you are in your 60s. Employers don't want people that age, "" she says. Julie Delve and Karen Glynn were in court last June when they told a judicial review that when they had not received their state pension at the age of 60, their lives had been affected disproportionately. They argued the way the government had introduced the increase of the pension age was discriminatory. Some women thought they would retire at 60 but found they had to wait up to more than five years, leading to financial hardship. Campaigners say the workplace was less equal for many of this generation who were taking time out of their careers to raise children, were paid less than men and could not save as much in occupational pensions, so the change has hit them harder. The senior justices said: ""Despite the sympathy that we, like the members of the Divisional Court [High Court], feel for the appellants and other women in their position, we are satisfied that this is not a case where the court can interfere with the decisions taken through the parliamentary process."" They said that ""in the light of the extensive evidence"" put forward by the government, they agreed with the High Court's assessment that ""it is impossible to say that the government's decision to strike the balance where it did - between the need to put state pension provision on a sustainable footing and the recognition of the hardship that could result for those affected by the changes - was manifestly without reasonable foundation"". This issue led to a huge campaign, not always led by the same groups, which has garnered widespread support for women who believe their pensions were stolen from them. A different result in the general election could have changed the picture. Labour had promised to compensate those affected. That avenue was closed for campaigners. Now, the BackTo60 group has lost another major court battle. Driven supporters may not be willing to give up, and will hope to take it to the next stage legally. But with each defeat, their chances of actually seeing a greater pension become slimmer. Unison assistant general secretary Christina McAnea said: ""For a generation of women, this is nothing short of a disaster. ""Those on lower incomes have been left in dire straits, struggling to make ends meet with precious little support from the government."" Yvette Greenway Mansfield, chief executive of the charity, SOS the Silence of Suicide and the partner of the QC who argued the case in court, underlined the mental health impact the government's decision had had. She cited a recent survey by her charity which garnered 20,000 responses about the pensions age change. ""People have been having thoughts of suicide, they are self harming,"" said Ms Mansfield. ""This is the unseen impact. This is not discussed anywhere near enough and I am hugely concerned for women."" A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said they were pleased the court ""decided that due notice"" had been given to women. They added: ""The government decided 25 years ago that it was going to make the state pension age the same for men and women as a long-overdue move towards gender equality. ""Raising state pension age in line with life expectancy changes has been the policy of successive administrations over many years."" What is the row about women's pensions?

"Charlie Elphicke entered Southwark Crown Court alone Ex-Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke has been jailed for two years for sexually assaulting two women. Elphicke, 49, the former MP for Dover, was convicted of groping the women in similar situations, nine years apart. He denied the charges,but was found guiltyof one count of sexual assault in 2007 and two further counts in 2016, after a trial at Southwark Crown Court. The judge told Elphicke he was a ""sexual predator who used your success and respectability as a cover"". Within minutes of his jailing, Elphicke confirmed he would appeal against his conviction, arguing he had not had a ""fair trial"". Mrs Justice Whipple said Elphicke's denials had left his victims faced with the ordeal of giving evidence in court. ""They told the truth, and you told a pack of lies - not only to the jury, but your wife, the whips and the police,"" she told him during the sentencing hearing. Despite the fact the defendant's wife Natalie - the current Dover MP - ended their marriage when he was convicted in July, she agreed he had not had a fair trial and confirmed she would support his appeal. Charlie Elphicke's wife Natalie, the MP for Dover, supported him during the trial Before Elphicke was sentenced, the court heard victim impact statements from both of the women he attacked. His first victim, who was attacked at the then MP's London home in 2007, said his actions had had a ""lasting impact"" on her life, leaving her cautious of being around men. He had forced the woman on to a sofa and groped her breast while trying to kiss her, before chasing her and chanting ""I'm a naughty Tory"", his trial had heard. The second victim, a parliamentary worker aged in her 20s, said the assaults in 2016 left her with a feeling of ""fear and helplessness"". ""He stole a large part of my self-worth and self-esteem,"" she said in a statement read to the court. Elphicke sexually assaulted her twice, the first involving him attempting to kiss her and groping her breast. In the second assault several weeks later, he ran his hand up the inside of her thigh towards her groin. Why did it take so long to bring ex-MP to justice? Ian Winter QC, defending, had argued Elphicke should not be jailed because he had ""fully and completely"" learned his lesson. ""Shortly, Mr Elphicke's descent into total disgrace will be complete,"" Mr Winter said. As well as his marriage ending he is estranged from his daughter as a result of the conviction, he added. ""The only further degradation would be to lose his liberty,"" Mr Winter said. Elphicke had come to court with 34 character witnesses, including from some ""serving members of parliament,"" Mr Winter added. The names of the MPs were not disclosed in court. Mrs Justice Whipple said she ""considered carefully"" whether the sentence should be suspended. ""[But] bearing in mind the gross breach of your position of power... I am satisfied that appropriate punishment can only be achieved by immediate custody,"" she said. However, a spokesman for Elphicke said his lawyers had begun an attempt to overturn the conviction. ""I know that I am innocent of any criminal wrongdoing and will continue to fight to clear my name,"" Elphicke said in a statement. Mrs Elphicke confirmed she supported an appeal against conviction and ""today's excessive sentence,"" adding that ""the court seems to be on a bit of a mission"". There was ""no doubt that Charlie behaved badly,"" but he had been denied a fair trial, she said. He was suspended by the Conservatives when ""serious allegations"" were passed to police in November 2017, butthe whip was restored ahead of a confidence vote against then-Prime Minister Theresa Mayin 2018. He was again suspended after being charged with the three counts of sexual assault on 22 July 2019. Ex-MP guilty of sexual assaults Why did it take so long to bring ex-MP to justice?

"This year's nominees are (clockwise from top left): Tsitsi Dangarembga, Avni Doshi, Maaza Mengiste, Douglas Stuart, Diane Cook and Brandon Taylor Four debut novels have been included on the shortlist for this year's Booker Prize, but two-time winner Hilary Mantel has missed out. Mantel had been tipped for a record third win for The Mirror and the Light. Both previous titles in her trilogy about the life of Thomas Cromwell, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, had won. This year's nominees are Diane Cook, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Avni Doshi, Maaza Mengiste, Douglas Stuart and Brandon Taylor. All are based outside the UK. The Booker Prize, the UK's most prestigious literary award, is open to any novel written in English by an author of any nationality. Commenting on Mantel's omission, judge Lee Child said: ""We thought it was an absolutely wonderful novel, no question about it... but there were books that were better, that's all I can say personally."" Hilary Mantel's The Mirror and the Light was the final instalment in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy The topics covered by the six nominees are wide-ranging, including stories about climate change, the hardship of life in Zimbabwe, dementia, and the women soldiers of 1935 Ethiopia. ""The shortlist of six came together unexpectedly, voices and characters resonating with us all even when very different,"" said Margaret Busby, chair of this year's judges. ""We are delighted to help disseminate these chronicles of creative humanity to a global audience."" Diane Cook - The New Wilderness Tsitsi Dangarembga - This Mournable Body Avni Doshi - Burnt Sugar Maaza Mengiste -The Shadow King Douglas Stuart - Shuggie Bain Brandon Taylor - Real Life The winner will be announced on 17 November. Last year saw Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo share the Â£50,000 prize, breaking the Booker's own 1992 rule of awarding it to only one author. By Rebecca Jones, BBC arts correspondent Let's talk about what IS on the list before discussing what is not. With promotional literary events postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic and 600 books published on a single day in September, prizes like the Booker provide much-needed attention, especially for first-time novelists. This shortlist rewards four impressive debuts and introduces readers to new and diverse voices, from as far afield as India, Ethiopia and Scotland - although five of the six authors were either born or now live in America. The subjects covered are broad-ranging. Climate change, dementia, racism and homophobia all feature. Heavy-going? Occasionally yes, but these six novels all provide their own rewards. It is, undoubtedly, a fresh and exciting list. But I am surprised there was no room for Hilary Mantel. While The Mirror and the Light might not be the best book in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy, it is still a tour de force and the ending stays with you long after you have finished the final page. And I am astonished my personal favourite, Apeirogon by Colum McCann, did not make the cut. Hugely ambitious, it expands the very notion of the novel. I loved it. Read it anyway. Here's some more information about this year's nominees and their books: Debut US novelist Diane Cook lives in Brooklyn and has established herself as an accomplished short-story writer. She is a former producer for the radio show This American Life. Her first novel tells the story of Bea and her five-year-old daughter, Agnes, who is wasting away in the smog and pollution of the metropolis they call home. To survive is to escape as they join a group of nomadic hunter gatherers. They slowly learn how to survive but the process creates an unexpected, troubling shift in their relationship. Cook is currently writing a screenplay based on the novel and Warner Bros Television has also acquired the rights to develop it as a television series. Tsitsi Dangarembga is a filmmaker and playwright. She was recently arrested in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, during a peaceful protest against government corruption. She is due to be in court on 18 September. English PEN and PEN International are calling for the immediate dropping of all charges. This Mournable Body is the third book in a trilogy following Nervous Conditions (1988) -  winner of the Commonwealth Writers' Prize - and The Book of Not (2006). Returning to the protagonist of her first novel, Dangarembga tells the story of one young girl living in a run-down hostel in Harare. She's left her dead-end job and is struggling to forge a new life for herself but at every turn is thwarted, which drives her to breaking point. Avni Doshi is a debut novelist who was born in New Jersey and is currently based in Dubai. Burnt Sugar tells the story of the shifting power dynamics in a mother-daughter relationship when the parent, who previously enjoyed a wild life, is forced to let her child look after her as she gets older. It's both a love story and a story about betrayal, as well as a look at the nature of false memory and how it affects our closest relationships. Maaza Mengiste was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and now lives in New York. Her first novel was Beneath the Lion's Gaze, which was named one of The Guardian's 10 best contemporary African books. The Shadow King is about an orphan girl named Hirut living in Ethiopia in 1935 amid the threat of invasion by Mussolini. When the Ethiopian emperor goes into exile, Hirut disguises a peasant as him while she becomes his guard - only to find herself having to fight her own personal, unexpected war. Douglas Stuart grew up in Glasgow and now lives in New York, which he first made home in order to start his career in fashion design. He says the 1994 Booker winner How Late It Was, How Late by James Kelman changed his life as it was one of the first times he saw his people and dialect on the page. For his first move into novel writing, Stuart has taken that inspiration to write a story set in a poverty-stricken Glasgow. Here we follow Agnes Bain, who is descending into despair and alcoholism after the breakdown of her marriage. All but one of her children have been driven away by her deterioration, and that child Shuggie struggles to support his mother while suffering huge personal problems of his own. Brandon Taylor hails from Alabama. He is the senior editor of Electric Literature's Recommended Reading and a staff writer at Literary Hub. For his debut novel, Taylor tells the story of the biochemistry student Wallace, who after weeks of tireless lab work has to deal with its destruction by a torrid storm. But weather disasters are shown to be the least of Wallace's troubles. He's isolated himself from his friends as a defence mechanism against his painful past. But now he finds that history coming back to haunt him. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external. If you have a story suggestion emailentertainment.news@bbc.co.uk,external.

"The DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) was initially adjourned but it resumed business on Tuesday evening Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has tested negative for Covid-19 after reporting feeling unwell. Members of the Irish cabinet were told to restrict their movements after the country's health minister made the report on Tuesday afternoon. Initially it was announced that the cabinet would have to self-isolate and the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) would be adjourned indefinitely. However, the DÃ¡il resumed business on Tuesday evening. The restrictions on the cabinet have now been lifted. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that the decision for the cabinet to restrict their movements came from ""an abundance of caution"". Minister for Climate Action, Communication Networks and Transport, Eamon Ryan, had already been isolating, as a member of his household awaits a test for Covid-19. On Tuesday, three more deaths were reported in the Republic and 357 cases of the virus have been confirmed. Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly reported feeling unwell on Tuesday afternoon Earlier, the Ceann Comhairle SeÃ¡n Ã FearghÃ¡il (Irish parliament speaker) told the DÃ¡il shortly after 17:00 local time that after ""very serious information arising out of events today the Cabinet must now self-isolate"". However, the DÃ¡il later reconvened after 20:00 - the Ceann Comhairle explained that he had been advised at the time that the parliament should be adjourned and then recalled by the taoiseach. Mr Donnelly was present at a press conference on Tuesday morning when the Irish government unveiled a five-stage plan on living with Covid-19. The plan outlined stricter rules for Dublin over the next few weeks because of the increase in infections in the city. Pubs that do not serve food can reopen on 21 September, except in Dublin where they must stay closed From midnight on Tuesday, household visits in the city will be limited to six people from one other household. Elsewhere, the limit will remain at six visitors from up to three households. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said it is designed to provide a roadmap on how to live with Covid-19 for the next six months. He said level five is the most restrictive and similar to what happened during the lockdown in March. He said the country is currently at level two but because of the situation Dublin there were special modifications for the capital.

"This video can not be played ""It's only the beginning of getting full justice"": Breonna Taylor's mother reacts to the settlement Officials in Louisville, Kentucky have agreed to pay $12m (Â£9.3m) to the family of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was killed in her home by police. Taylor was 26 when she was shot at least five times and killed on 13 March during a mistaken drugs raid. Her name has featured prominently in anti-racism protests in recent months. Lonita Baker, a lawyer for Taylor's family, called the settlement just one ""layer"" in the effort to seek justice, and praised new police reforms. ""Justice for Breonna is multi-layered,"" said Ms Baker at a press conference on Tuesday alongside Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. She called the agreement ""tremendous, but only a portion"" of what the family hopes for, including the arrest of the officers involved in her death. ""Today what we did here was to do what we could do to bring a little bit of police reform and it's just a start,"" continued Ms Baker. ""But we finished the first mile in the marathon and we've got a lot more miles to go to until we achieve and cross that finish line."" The settlement includes a series of police reforms in the city, including a requirement that all search warrants be approved by a senior officer and giving a housing credit to officers who move to low-income neighbourhoods they patrol in the city. In a short statement, Taylor's mother Tamika Palmer called for criminal charges against the officers and asked people to continue to say her daughter's name publicly in advocacy for police reforms. Oprah Magazine to honour Breonna Taylor Why Breonna Taylor's name is chanted at demos Timeline of US police killings The settlement is the largest financial sum paid in a police misconduct case in the city's history, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. This video can not be played ""Questions still aren't answered"": Breonna Taylor's family are worried about a ""cover-up"" Taylor's killing was propelled into the spotlight once again with the death George Floyd, an African-American man who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for minutes during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May. Floyd's death sparked global anti-racism protests and brought renewed focus on police brutality. Shortly after midnight on 13 March, three officers entered Taylor's apartment by executing a no-knock search warrant - a court document that authorises police to enter a home without warning. Taylor and her partner, Kenneth Walker, were reportedly asleep as the commotion began. The officers exchanged fire with Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner who called 911 in the belief that the drug raid was a burglary. The officers - who fired more than 25 bullets - said they returned fire after one officer was shot and wounded. Taylor, a decorated emergency medical technician, was 26 when she died. During the exchange, Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was shot eight times and later died. No drugs were found on the property. The lawsuit filed by Taylor's family accuses the officers of battery, wrongful death, excessive force and gross negligence. It also says the officers were not looking for her or her partner, but for an unrelated suspect who did not live in the complex. Her family has also accused police of leading the raid as a plot to gentrify her neighbourhood. The city's mayor dismissed the allegation as ""outrageous"" and ""without foundation or supporting facts"". One of the officers involved in the raid, Brett Hankison, was fired in June. The other two - Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove - were placed on administrative leave. The city's police chief was also fired in June after a separate police shooting. A grand jury could soon decide whether criminal charges should be filed against any of the officers. Until Freedom, a social justice organisation that has held rallies for Taylor, released a statement saying: ""No amount of money will bring back Breonna Taylor."" ""True justice is not served with cash settlements,"" the group added. ""We need those involved in her murder to be arrested and charged. We need accountability. We need justice."" Earlier this year, Louisville's city council voted unanimously in favour of banning no-knock warrants. Similar legislation that would ban the warrants nationwide was introduced in the US Congress.

"The bomb was detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, killing 22 people The family of a 15-year-old girl killed in the Manchester Arena bombing have shared how their ""hearts have been shattered into a million pieces"". The loved ones of Megan Hurley presented a""pen portrait"" of their ""amazing girl""during the second week of the inquiry into the 2017 attack. The portraits give each family the chance to present an insight into the lives of those who died. Twenty-two people died when a bomb was detonated as people left the arena. A slideshow of photographs documenting Megan's life were displayed on screen at Manchester Magistrates' Court as the family's lawyer read out words from her loved ones. Megan Hurley, from Liverpool, was 15 when she was killed in the attack ""Since the horrendous day in May 2017 our lives have been ruined for forever,"" her family wrote in their statement. ""Our hearts have been shattered into a million pieces. The pain we feel day in and day out, year upon year. ""Losing Megan has left an enormous and irreparable void in our lives. We miss you more than words can say, Megan. ""You will forever be our beautiful beauty queen."" What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? Relatives to give 'pen portraits' to arena inquiry Deborah Hutchinson, mother of 19-year-old Courtney Boyle, from Gateshead, told the inquiry that shecan still see her daughter's smileas she left the car that night. ""I will never forget the laughing in the car. As she left to get into the foyer she was complaining,"" she added. ""She was cold, all wrapped up in a blanket which was nothing unusual for Courtney."" ""She had a beautiful heart and always put others first,"" she said. Kelly Brewster was described as ""fun-loving, kind and thoughtful"" Kelly Brewster was a""larger than life"" character"" despite being ""tiny at just 5ft"", her family told the inquiry. The 32-year-old, from Sheffield, was ""fun-loving, kind and thoughtful... but everyone knew she had to be taken seriously when she put her sky-scraper heels on"". The family said she was ""so excited"" on the day of the Ariana Grande concert because her and her ""soulmate"" Ian Winslow had had an offer accepted on a new four-bedroom home that morning. They said the couple were planning to have a baby and had already planned which room was going to be Ian's daughter's bedroom and the nursery. ""Kelly was the happiest she had ever been,"" the inquiry heard. Figen Murray, the mother of Martyn Hett, also presented a ""pen portrait"" to the inquiry. She said the 29-year-old, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, had ""the most incredible passion for life"" and an ""energy that was exhausting at times"" living at ""100 miles an hour"". ""He had this catching charisma about him,"" she said. ""Everybody just loved him."" ""He was proud of who he was, he believed in who he was."" She said his loss left ""this absolutely massive, gaping hole inside my soul."" Martyn Hett was due to fly to America for the trip of a lifetime two days after the bombing On Monday, the inquiry heardtestimony from Martyn's father Paul, along with tributes toJohn Atkinson, 28, from Bury,Eilidh MacLeod, 14, from the Isle of Barra,andSorrell Leczkowski, 14, from Leeds. The inquiry comes more than three years after the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, which left hundreds more injured. It was due to start in June, but was delayed by the trial of Salman Abedi's brother Hashem,who was jailed for at least 55 years for 22 murders on 20 August. The commemorative hearings are expected to conclude on 23 September. The inquiry was set up to examine the background to the attack and the response of the emergency services. Its chairman, Sir John Saunders, will make a report and recommendations once all the evidence has been heard, which is expected to take up to six months.

"Covid marshals in towns and city centres in England are one way the government wants to ensure social distancing rules are followed. It isgiving local councils a further Â£30mto help enforce restrictions. Some of this is for marshals, but many areas still do not have any in place. The idea is for Covid marshals to advise and support members of the public and businesses on following social distancing rules. They cannot enforce the rules, but it is hoped they will take some pressure off police and council officers, who do have powers. Areaswhere marshals can help,externalinclude: Helping businesses manage queues Supporting social distancing in crowded public areas Reminding people to wear a face covering when necessary Assisting with regular cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces However, the plans have been criticised. Conservative MP Steve Baker, for example, has said it would ""turn every public space in Britain into the equivalent of going through airport security"". But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Breakfast it was ""never the idea"" to have people on the streets in every neighbourhood ""wearing Covid marshal uniforms"". The funding can be used to pay for Covid-19 secure marshals, or equivalents, and any associated costs. But local authorities can also choose to spend it on: Increasing public awareness of regulations via advertising, signage and educational campaigns Enforcement of regulations, or guidance, and any associated staff, training or overtime costs The highest payments are to Leeds (Â£485,826),external, Manchester (Â£453,047) and Sheffield (Â£348,384). The lowest amounts are for the City of London, the Isles of Scilly and Rutland, which each receive Â£13,000. Before the government funding announcement, the BBC contacted more than 120 councils to ask whether they were currently using marshals, had done so at some point during the pandemic, or planned to use them in the future. Just over a third have responded, with 70% saying they either had no marshals, no plans to introduce them, or were waiting for further guidance from central government. Luton, Bradford, Sandwell and Newcastle councils told the BBC they have deployed existing council staff as marshals, wardens or ""city hosts"". Cornwall's summer scheme is just ending, while Peterborough and Southend councils have used volunteers to provide marshalling for short periods and Portsmouth is considering them. In London, Hammersmith and Fulham, Harrow, and Kensington and Chelsea have at various points used existing staff as marshals or street ambassadors. Lewisham said it is gathering a group of volunteers to become ""community champions"" and Tower Hamlets said it will be recruiting two marshals. The government says marshals can either be existing members of council staff, new recruits or agency staff and it expects them to be paid. If local councils plan to use volunteers, the government says they should consider whether the roles and responsibilities are appropriate. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"People across England have told BBC News they are struggling to access coronavirus tests. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said last week that no-one should have to travel more than 75 miles for a test, after the BBC revealedsome were being sent hundreds of miles away. But dozens have now reported being unable to book a swab at all. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said testing capacity was targeted at the hardest-hit areas. A significant rise in demand for testing led the government to reduce the number of appointments available in areas of lower prevalence, to prioritise areas with outbreaks. This in turn led to people applying for tests being directed to centres sometimes hundreds of miles away. R number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise What are the challenges of mass testing? Concerns over PM's mass virus testing plans But last Thursday Mr Hancock pledged to put in ""immediate"" solutions to make sure people did not have to travel more than 75 miles, effective from last Friday. Since then, postcodes entered into the government's booking system return a message suggesting there are no testing centres or home kits available - even if you are an essential worker with symptoms. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said he understood it would be ""naturally worrying"" for people with symptoms who could not secure a test in a ""timely way"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the testing system was under ""pressure"" because of the spike in the infection rate of the virus. Mr Gove said: ""We are increasing the number of tests. It is the case that the capacity every day is for 370,000 - we do want to do more."" He added that No 10 is working to boost capacity through investment in new testing centres and so-called lighthouse labs. 'Complete nightmare' Melissa, a GP in north-west England, applied for a test for her seven-year-old son on Tuesday after he developed a new continuous cough and changes to his sense of taste. After being offered a test in Sunderland, about 130 miles away, she applied via her local NHS's staff portal - designed to prioritise health staff. But this system directed her first to Telford, almost 100 miles away, and then to London, a distance of more than 200 miles. No home kits were available. ""It was a complete nightmare,"" she said. ""I had to cancel face-to-face appointments with patients, including baby clinics."" Government apologises over Covid tests shortage How do I get a coronavirus test? She added that this had become a common theme in NHS Facebook groups of which she was a member. ""The whole system is going to fall over. ""It doesn't feel like the infrastructure is there to support NHS staff going into winter."" This sentiment was echoed by a psychiatrist in an area currently subject to government intervention because of its high rate of coronavirus. She found that no tests were available after developing all of the textbook coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and a fever. Frances, in Suffolk, tried to apply for a test when her daughter developed a high temperature. She didn't think it was coronavirus but ""the rules are the rules"". She had understood that anyone with a temperature should apply for a test, and was not able to send either of her children to school until she did. ""Their teachers need to be kept safe, their classmates need to be kept safe, we need to do the right thing,"" she said. Frances, like Melissa, was also not able to get a home kit, and when she tried to get an appointment at a drive-through centre was told no test sites were found. ""It almost looks like a glitch in the system,"" she said. Jamie in Chesterfield spent seven hours trying to contact someone using the 119 number after no slots were appearing on the online booking system. His school-age child had developed a new cough. ""It's the right thing to do according to the guidelines,"" he said. Eventually he managed to get a test 50 miles away. Meanwhile in Wales, the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taff council, which is struggling to avoid a local lockdown, said he was ""furious"" about the limited testing capacity. Andrew Morgan said a ""huge effort"" had to be made after learning that mobile testing units in Wales were to be limited to only 60 tests. It comes as a number of different data sources showcases are rising and the epidemic is growingfor the first time since before lockdown. On Saturday, the number of new daily confirmed UK cases of the virus rose to 3,497 - the second day running it has been above 3,000. The virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases doubling every seven to eight days, with a marked rise in infections in the north and among young people. Although cases are rising, the number of patients in hospital remains largely flat at 863. ENDGAME:When will life get back to normal? EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash There are some suggestions that the problems with accessing tests have happened since schools have returned. Mr Hancock has claimed 25% of people applying for tests are not eligible because they don't have symptoms, although his department did not say where this figure came from. Meanwhile, NHS 111 data published on 11 September reported a rise in calls relating to children with symptoms that would make them eligible for a coronavirus test.

"The DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) was initially adjourned but it resumed business on Tuesday evening Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has tested negative for Covid-19 after reporting feeling unwell. Members of the Irish cabinet were told to restrict their movements after the country's health minister made the report on Tuesday afternoon. Initially it was announced that the cabinet would have to self-isolate and the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) would be adjourned indefinitely. However, the DÃ¡il resumed business on Tuesday evening. The restrictions on the cabinet have now been lifted. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that the decision for the cabinet to restrict their movements came from ""an abundance of caution"". Minister for Climate Action, Communication Networks and Transport, Eamon Ryan, had already been isolating, as a member of his household awaits a test for Covid-19. On Tuesday, three more deaths were reported in the Republic and 357 cases of the virus have been confirmed. Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly reported feeling unwell on Tuesday afternoon Earlier, the Ceann Comhairle SeÃ¡n Ã FearghÃ¡il (Irish parliament speaker) told the DÃ¡il shortly after 17:00 local time that after ""very serious information arising out of events today the Cabinet must now self-isolate"". However, the DÃ¡il later reconvened after 20:00 - the Ceann Comhairle explained that he had been advised at the time that the parliament should be adjourned and then recalled by the taoiseach. Mr Donnelly was present at a press conference on Tuesday morning when the Irish government unveiled a five-stage plan on living with Covid-19. The plan outlined stricter rules for Dublin over the next few weeks because of the increase in infections in the city. Pubs that do not serve food can reopen on 21 September, except in Dublin where they must stay closed From midnight on Tuesday, household visits in the city will be limited to six people from one other household. Elsewhere, the limit will remain at six visitors from up to three households. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said it is designed to provide a roadmap on how to live with Covid-19 for the next six months. He said level five is the most restrictive and similar to what happened during the lockdown in March. He said the country is currently at level two but because of the situation Dublin there were special modifications for the capital. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly (right) was present at a press conference for a new Covid-19 plan on Tuesday morning TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar told the news conference that virus cases have increased tenfold in Dublin over the last two months. Mr Martin also told the news conference that Ireland would sign up for the European Commission's travel plan. That plan has yet to be unveiled but is known to include countries on green, amber and red lists. He indicated that crowds of 200 people will be allowed attend sporting events where the capacity of a stadium is 5,000.

"Alexei Navalny posted on Instagram from his hospital bed in Germany The poisoned Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny is to return to Russia, his spokeswoman has said. ""It's puzzling to me why anyone should think otherwise,"" Kira Yarmysh posted on Twitter. Mr Navalny also posted a picture on Instagram for the first time since he was poisoned, announcing that he was breathing free of ventilation. He collapsed on a flight from Siberia on 20 August. Tests have shown he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He was transferred to the CharitÃ© hospital in the German capital, Berlin. His team alleges he was poisoned on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin denies any involvement. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life What are Novichok nerve agents? ""All morning journalists have been writing to me and asking, is it true that Alexei plans to return to Russia?"" Ms Yarmysh wrote. ""Again I can confirm to everyone: no other options were ever considered."" The announcement came shortly after Mr Navalny took to Instagram. ""Hi, this is Navalny. I have been missing you. I still can't do much, but yesterday I managed to breathe on my own for the entire day,"" he wrote. ""Just on my own, no extra help, not even a valve in my throat. I liked it very much. It's a remarkable process that is underestimated by many. Strongly recommended."" There is a modest police presence outside the hospital where Mr Navalny is being treated, Ben Tavener from the BBC Russian service reports from the scene. There are two armed officers by one entrance and a police van that has been stationed outside for days, our correspondent says. Unconfirmed reports in German media suggest two further armed police units have been set up inside - outside the ward and by the politician's bed. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has ruled out a meeting between Mr Navalny and Mr Putin after the opposition figure recovers. ""We do not see the need for such a meeting, so I believe that such a meeting will not take place,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency. Sergei Goryashko, BBC Russian The Kremlin is sticking firm to its line that it has nothing to do with Mr Navalny's poisoning and there is no surprise that Mr Putin's spokesperson ruled out the possibility of a meeting between the president and his harshest critic. Mr Putin has actually never called Mr Navalny by his name, trying to make it look like this politician is unknown and insignificant. They aim to persuade everyone - in Russia and abroad - that the Kremlin is not paying any attention at all to Mr Navalny's activity, which is obviously far from reality. Moscow's reaction to Mr Navalny's poisoning is based on its well-known policy that attack is the best form of defence. Russia has not just rejected the allegations of any involvement in the attempt on Mr Navalny's life, but insists that there hasn't been any poisoning at all and the opposition leader simply fell ill. And today the chief of Russian intelligence, Sergei Naryshkin, has stopped just short of accusing Germany of poisoning Mr Navalny with the Novichok nerve agent. He said there had been no trace of poison in Mr Navalny's body when the politician left Russia. Mr Naryshkin also said Russia had destroyed all reserves of Novichok and therefore Moscow has got questions for Germany. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has long been the most prominent face of opposition to President Putin. Mr Navalny's supporters believe his tea was spiked at Tomsk airport on 20 August. He became ill during the flight, and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. Russian officials were persuaded to allow him to be airlifted to Germany two days later. A nerve agent from the Novichok group was also used to poison ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, in England, in 2018. They both survived, but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the poison. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Britain accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack. Twenty countries expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats and spies. Moscow denied any involvement. What are Novichok nerve agents?

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the government is working hard to fix operational challenges in the coronavirus testing system A lack of coronavirus tests for NHS staff is leading to absences and services being put at risk, hospital bosses warn UK unemployment rate rises to its highest level for two years A report by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says the pandemic has pushed global development back by more than 20 years France introduces new restrictions in the areas around Marseille and Bordeaux Globally there have been more than 29 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 928,000 deaths, Johns Hopkins University data shows Edited by Suzanne Leigh We're pausing our Live coverage for the day. Thank you for joining us - coverage will resume Wednesday morning. Today's writers were Katie Wright, Becky Morton, Victoria Bisset and Alexandra FouchÃ©; the page was edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Suzanne Leigh. There have been many developments today, including: Earlier we heard the speaker of the Irish parliament had announced that all members of the cabinet in Dublin would have to self-isolate, after the health minister reported feeling unwell. Stephen Donnelly has contacted his GP for a Covid-19 test, Irish broadcaster RTÃ reports. Initially it was believed that the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) would be adjourned indefinitely, after Speaker Sean O Fearghail said ""the possibility of proceeding with business does not
arise and the house stands adjourned, I suspect, until Tuesday next"". However, Irish prime minister MicheÃ¡l Martin later told RTÃ that the DÃ¡il would be reconvened at 20:00 IST and the cabinet were restricting their movements due to ""an abundance of caution"".

Families in Oldham,external, where there has been particular concern about the spread of coronavirus, are boiling over with frustration that they can't access tests. Not least a government that promised the public its testing system would be better than any other country's. Not least a government that believes a properly functioning testing system is vital to keeping kids back in school and climbing out of recession as quickly as possible. Not least a government that knows testing is a crucial way to monitor and control the virus that saw such a terrible loss of life in the grim spring that we have all just lived through. Read more. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Premier League games continue to be played behind closed doors The English Football League will continue to stage pilots with up to 1,000 fans at matches this weekend, following approval from the government. EFL clubs were asked to put in requests by Tuesday in order for their plans to be signed off in time. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden will meet with sports bodies later this week to discuss the planned return of spectators to sport from 1 October. Last week, the governmentrestricted pilot events to 1,000 spectatorsafter a rise in coronavirus cases, and said plans for grounds to be up to a third full from 1 October would be reviewed. The Premier League says around Â£100m per month will be lost by clubs across the leagues while matches continue behind closed doors and it is one of a number of sports bodies to have voiced concerns at the financial impact of an extended period with empty venues.

With Yom Kippur to follow on Monday week, how will the UK's new coronavirus restrictions affect Jewish celebrations? For Dr Katrina Lester, who is due to give birth in eight weeks, this year will be a ""very lonely time"", spent away from relatives and the synagogue. Like millions of others, her family has been looking forward to the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah - which marks the Jewish new year - and Yom Kippur - a solemn day of atonement, involving a 25-hour fast and continuous prayer throughout the day. But this year, certain rituals and customs will have to be adapted to meet Covid-19 guidelines. The government has issued highly detailed guidancefor the Jewish community as they observe the festivals, with measures including the removal of communal items, such as prayer books, in synagogues; andthe use of microphones for devotions or sermons to avoid shouting,external.

Ministers have been defending the NHS Test and Trace system for England and have claimed testing capacity is increasing. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""The government has been consistently increasing testing capacity, but also laboratory capacity."" She is correct that government data shows that both testing capacity and laboratory capacity have increased considerably since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there has been a sizeable gap between how many tests labs are able to process (""capacity"") and the number of tests actually processed. Read more on this and other claims made by the governmenthere. Many adults are drinking more since the coronavirus pandemic began,data suggests,external. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is warning that addiction services in England could struggle to cope with the ""soaring"" numbers of people misusing alcohol. The college estimates that in June, more than 8.4m people in England were drinking at higher-risk levels, up from 4.8m in February. It says deep cuts made to addiction services could mean patients will miss out on life-saving care. Read more. Yogita LimayeMumbai correspondent, BBC News India has now recorded more than five million confirmed cases of coronavirus. It is the second worst affected country in the world, but the virus is spreading much faster there than in the US, which is in the top spot. More than 82,000 people have died with the virus in India, with more than 1,000 dying each day. Hospitals in many cities are running out of intensive
care bedsand oxygen supplies. But the government has been pointing out that the number
of Indians dying with Covid-19 relative to the size of its population is a lot
lower than in other badly hit countries. ""Non-life-sustainingâ businesses were ordered to shut down in Pennsylvania Some of the lockdown provisions put in place by Pennsylvaniaâs Democratic Governor Tom Wolf are unconstitutional, a US federal judge has ruled. Judge William Stickman found in favour of two Republican politicians and several business owners, who said ongoing restrictions threatened livelihoods. He said Governor Wolf did not have the right to infringe civil liberties, even if he was acting with good intentions. Mr Wolf had already lifted some restrictions after infections in Pennsylvania began to fall.They had required people to stay at home, placed limits on the size of indoor and outdoor gatherings and ordered ânon-life-sustainingâ businesses to shut down. The lawsuit is one of hundreds brought across America challenging local lockdown rules. The Wolf administration said it would appeal: âThe actions taken by the administration were mirrored by governors across the country and saved, and continue to save lives in the absence of federal action,"" a spokeswoman for Mr Wolf said. ""This decision is especially worrying as Pennsylvania and the rest of the country are likely to face a challenging time with the possible resurgence of Covid-19 and the flu in the fall and winter,â she added. Another person awaiting test results is Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who will not take part in Prime Minister's Quesions tomorrow as he is ""still awaiting"" a coronavirus test result for a member of his family, a spokesman said. The spokesman said he would remain in self-isolation and deputy leader Angela Rayner would take his place. The Labour leaderhas been self-isolating since Monday, after a member of his household showed symptoms. They were tested the same day. Starmer is not reported to have shown any symptoms himself. Scott said he tried hundreds of times to book a test for his family Schools are back, businesses are reopening and winter bugs are starting to spread - meaning more and more people are asking for a coronavirus test. Scott Vining's daughter fell ill with a temperature on Saturday. By Sunday, the rest of the family, who live near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, had also developed symptoms. ""We've tried hundreds of times,"" he told the BBC about trying to book a test. ""We started to try and book tests for my daughter on Sunday, to no avail, and then we started at 08:00 on Monday morning for us all."" At one point Scott was offered a test in Warwickshire, 65 miles away from his home, through the government website. But by the time he'd entered the details of his family of four, the spaces had disappeared. Scott eventually managed to secure a test for his wife today in Luton. He has since managed to book tests for himself and his children at a separate testing centre, in Bedford. Read more about Scott and other families' experienceshere. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor ""A tricky balancing act"" is how the chancellor himself described to me the next stage of support to an economy that will continue to be affected by the pandemic. He dropped his heaviest hint yet that this will include a new measure or scheme to boost job creation, as the jobless numbers start their inevitable turn upwards. That task, he says, is his ""number one priority"" and he told me on a visit to a pottery factory in Stoke: ""I'm always looking for interesting creative, innovative and effective new ways to support jobs and employment."" What it is not is the extension to the current furlough scheme. The purpose of the visit to the Emma Bridgewater factory was to celebrate the return to work from furlough of its staff. The Treasury calculates that half of those furloughed are now back in their jobs, and the chancellor is adamant that people are ""itching to get back to work"". Read morefrom Faisal here. This video can not be played Sunak: We cannot 'endlessly extend' furlough scheme New Covid 19 cases were recorded in all but one of Englandâs 315 local authority areas in the seven days to 12 September. Baberghin Suffolk was the only area to not record a new case, according to the latest Public Health England data. It also shows that 510 new cases were recorded inBradfordin the week up to 12 September. Thatâs the equivalent of 94.5 cases per 100,000 people - up from 77.6 in the previous week. Other cities recording sharp increases in their weekly rate include: Liverpool(up from 51.2 to 91.4, with 455 new cases) Leicester(up from 56.7 to 86.4, with 306 new cases) Sunderland(up from 61.9 to 82.5, with 229 new cases) Bradford is among the cities to see a sharp rise in cases Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent The Speaker of the Irish parliament has announced that all members of the cabinet in Dublin have to self-isolate. The Irish national broadcaster RTÃ is reporting that Health Minister Stephen Donnelly contacted his GP for a coronavirus test after feeling unwell this afternoon. The Speaker told parliament that following ""very serious information arising out of events today, the cabinet must now self-isolate"". Parliamentary proceedings have been adjourned. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst As China celebrates 30 days without any domestic cases of
Covid-19, Chinaâs top health body says it is now going to roll out counselling
to people who have recovered from Covid-19. According to the official China Daily,social
workers, volunteers and therapists will be made available to former patients,external,
to help understand any physical, mental or financial help they might
need. Their data will be held
on local medical databases, under a system that âemphasises the importance of
protecting their privacyâ. Local health centres will also offer mental health assessments
âbased on informed consent and voluntary participationâ. In China, more than 80,000 people have recovered from Covid-19
since the beginning of the year.Mental health hotlines have been open since as early as January,external. But mental health is a major concern in China. The official Xinhua news agency estimated last year thatone in 10 Chinese people had mental health problems,external. That is 140 million people. People on Chinese social media have spoken often in recent months
about how they have struggled as a result of strict lockdown procedures,
working/studying at home, and finding work. The government is particularly concerned that those who have
recovered have experienced work and social stigma. However, it has urged people
to be transparent if they have any ailments rather than hide their
symptoms and risk the event of another localised outbreak. School attendance figures ""should reassure parents"" about sending their children back to classrooms, Downing Street has said. The first official figures for England,published earlier today, showed 88% of pupils went back for the autumn term. This is a higher absence rate than the usual figure of about 5% but it is not broken down to show whether pupils were at home because of Covid-19 outbreaks. The prime minister's spokesman said the government acknowledged it may take time for some parents to feel confident enough to send their children back to school and fines would only be used ""as a last resort, where there's no valid reason for absence"". It is understood no fines have been issued since schools returned. BBC Radio 5 Live There are a lot of reports of people struggling to get a coronavirus test. Gaynor Hope in south west London got her 16-year-old son a test after four days of trying. But test site workers were only able to grant him one by using a postcode from over 500 miles away. âWe drove up to the test centre, no queue, two other carsâ¦ but the steward said we had to use an Aberdeen postcode to get a QR code for a testâ, she told BBC Radio 5 Live. âThey were on their handheld devices, searching for any postcode they could useâ¦ itâs just so frustrating.â Gaynorâs MP, Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson,asked the health secretary about this issue in Parliament this afternoon,external. The number of patients in mechanical ventilation beds across the UK has passed 100 for the first time in nearly two months There were 106 patients on ventilation in the UK on Monday - the first time the figure has been over 100 since 24 July. UK-wide figures for today are yet to be published but there were 101 patients on ventilation in England on Tuesday. Jewish pilgrims sleep at the border point Hundreds of Hasidic Jews who set
off on a pilgrimage to Ukraine are stranded on the Ukraine-Belarus border because of coronavirus restrictions. They want to get to the central Ukrainian town of Uman for the Jewish New Year, which is being celebrated at the weekend, and visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman, who revived the
Hasidic movement in the 19th Century. One described the conditions at the border: ""I spent the night on the bus, but most of them [other pilgrims] spent the
night right on the road, some gathered branches in the forest
and lit fires,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""We have no food or water, we have children with
us, about 100 children,"" he added. Ukraine has imposed a ban on the entry of foreigners from the end of August till the end of September because of the pandemic.

"Covid marshals in towns and city centres in England are one way the government wants to ensure social distancing rules are followed. It isgiving local councils a further Â£30mto help enforce restrictions. Some of this is for marshals, but many areas still do not have any in place. The idea is for Covid marshals to advise and support members of the public and businesses on following social distancing rules. They cannot enforce the rules, but it is hoped they will take some pressure off police and council officers, who do have powers. Areaswhere marshals can help,externalinclude: Helping businesses manage queues Supporting social distancing in crowded public areas Reminding people to wear a face covering when necessary Assisting with regular cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces However, the plans have been criticised. Conservative MP Steve Baker, for example, has said it would ""turn every public space in Britain into the equivalent of going through airport security"". But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Breakfast it was ""never the idea"" to have people on the streets in every neighbourhood ""wearing Covid marshal uniforms"". The funding can be used to pay for Covid-19 secure marshals, or equivalents, and any associated costs. But local authorities can also choose to spend it on: Increasing public awareness of regulations via advertising, signage and educational campaigns Enforcement of regulations, or guidance, and any associated staff, training or overtime costs The highest payments are to Leeds (Â£485,826),external, Manchester (Â£453,047) and Sheffield (Â£348,384). The lowest amounts are for the City of London, the Isles of Scilly and Rutland, which each receive Â£13,000. Before the government funding announcement, the BBC contacted more than 120 councils to ask whether they were currently using marshals, had done so at some point during the pandemic, or planned to use them in the future. Just over a third have responded, with 70% saying they either had no marshals, no plans to introduce them, or were waiting for further guidance from central government. Luton, Bradford, Sandwell and Newcastle councils told the BBC they have deployed existing council staff as marshals, wardens or ""city hosts"". Cornwall's summer scheme is just ending, while Peterborough and Southend councils have used volunteers to provide marshalling for short periods and Portsmouth is considering them. In London, Hammersmith and Fulham, Harrow, and Kensington and Chelsea have at various points used existing staff as marshals or street ambassadors. Lewisham said it is gathering a group of volunteers to become ""community champions"" and Tower Hamlets said it will be recruiting two marshals. The government says marshals can either be existing members of council staff, new recruits or agency staff and it expects them to be paid. If local councils plan to use volunteers, the government says they should consider whether the roles and responsibilities are appropriate. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Alexei Navalny posted on Instagram from his hospital bed in Germany The poisoned Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny is to return to Russia, his spokeswoman has said. ""It's puzzling to me why anyone should think otherwise,"" Kira Yarmysh posted on Twitter. Mr Navalny also posted a picture on Instagram for the first time since he was poisoned, announcing that he was breathing free of ventilation. He collapsed on a flight from Siberia on 20 August. Tests have shown he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He was transferred to the CharitÃ© hospital in the German capital, Berlin. His team alleges he was poisoned on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin denies any involvement. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life What are Novichok nerve agents? ""All morning journalists have been writing to me and asking, is it true that Alexei plans to return to Russia?"" Ms Yarmysh wrote. ""Again I can confirm to everyone: no other options were ever considered."" The announcement came shortly after Mr Navalny took to Instagram. ""Hi, this is Navalny. I have been missing you. I still can't do much, but yesterday I managed to breathe on my own for the entire day,"" he wrote. ""Just on my own, no extra help, not even a valve in my throat. I liked it very much. It's a remarkable process that is underestimated by many. Strongly recommended."" There is a modest police presence outside the hospital where Mr Navalny is being treated, Ben Tavener from the BBC Russian service reports from the scene. There are two armed officers by one entrance and a police van that has been stationed outside for days, our correspondent says. Unconfirmed reports in German media suggest two further armed police units have been set up inside - outside the ward and by the politician's bed. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has ruled out a meeting between Mr Navalny and Mr Putin after the opposition figure recovers. ""We do not see the need for such a meeting, so I believe that such a meeting will not take place,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency. Sergei Goryashko, BBC Russian The Kremlin is sticking firm to its line that it has nothing to do with Mr Navalny's poisoning and there is no surprise that Mr Putin's spokesperson ruled out the possibility of a meeting between the president and his harshest critic. Mr Putin has actually never called Mr Navalny by his name, trying to make it look like this politician is unknown and insignificant. They aim to persuade everyone - in Russia and abroad - that the Kremlin is not paying any attention at all to Mr Navalny's activity, which is obviously far from reality. Moscow's reaction to Mr Navalny's poisoning is based on its well-known policy that attack is the best form of defence. Russia has not just rejected the allegations of any involvement in the attempt on Mr Navalny's life, but insists that there hasn't been any poisoning at all and the opposition leader simply fell ill. And today the chief of Russian intelligence, Sergei Naryshkin, has stopped just short of accusing Germany of poisoning Mr Navalny with the Novichok nerve agent. He said there had been no trace of poison in Mr Navalny's body when the politician left Russia. Mr Naryshkin also said Russia had destroyed all reserves of Novichok and therefore Moscow has got questions for Germany. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has long been the most prominent face of opposition to President Putin. Mr Navalny's supporters believe his tea was spiked at Tomsk airport on 20 August. He became ill during the flight, and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. Russian officials were persuaded to allow him to be airlifted to Germany two days later. A nerve agent from the Novichok group was also used to poison ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, in England, in 2018. They both survived, but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the poison. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Britain accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack. Twenty countries expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats and spies. Moscow denied any involvement. What are Novichok nerve agents?

"The first official figures for school attendance in England for the autumn term show 88% of pupils went back. This is a higher absence rate than the usual figure of about 5% but it is not broken down to show whether pupils were at home because of Covid outbreaks. The figures show attendance last Thursday, based on responses from almost three quarters of state schools. Since the reopening, school leaders have warned that delays in testing are leading to year groups being sent home. In the run-up to the new term the government called on parents to send their children back to school, with the assurance that safety measures would be in place to protect them from the spread of Covid-19. Heads warn of staff shortages without Covid tests for teachers Millions of pupils return after the pandemic shutdown Wiltshire school sends year group home after Covid case There had been speculation that some parents would keep their children at home - but the Department for Education figures show almost nine in 10 returned. The department also estimates that 92% of all state schools in England were fully open - and that 99.9% were at least partially open. Pupils on their first day back at Riverside School in Barking, east London However, there have been repeated local cases of schools having to send home year groups of pupils, either because of infections or because of problems with getting Covid tests for staff or pupils: On Tuesday, nearly 300 pupils at the Royal Wootton Bassett Academy in Wiltshire were sent home after a Covid case and at Bishop Fox's school in Taunton, Somerset there are 415 pupils self isolating in response to Covid infections on Monday, Steve Chalke, head of the Oasis academy trust, said about 1,200 pupils had been sent home from their schools, in a way which he said had become ""rotation by default"" while a survey by Teacher Tapp of more than 6,000 teachers suggested 3% of schools had sent home year groups or classes last week and 4% of teachers were self-isolating this week The guidance for the safe reopening of schools in England had promised: ""The government will ensure that it is as easy as possible to get a test through a wide range of routes that are locally accessible, fast and convenient."" But the National Association of Head Teachers, while welcoming the numbers returning to school, warned that problems getting tests was ""causing chaos for schools right now and could jeopardise attendance remaining high"". The WorthLess? network of 5,000 head teachers warned that lack of access to tests could create staff shortages and force schools into partial closure. Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner School in New Malden, Surrey, said the Covid testing system had become a ""complete and utter shambles"". He said students wanted to be back in school, but there had been 70 away on Monday, with many of these absences attributable to the difficulties in getting tests. The Netmums online parents' network has written an open letter to the government complaining about the difficulties for parents who are struggling to get a Covid test. ""It's broken, not working and needs fixing. Our children have been back at school for a week or so, and already the testing system is at breaking point. And so are we,"" says the letter. England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""The best place for children and young people to learn is in the classroom, and it's encouraging to see that last week more than seven million pupils were back with their classmates and teachers at schools around the country.""

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that people 'want to be in work' rather than on furlough The chancellor has said looking for new ways to protect jobs is his ""number one priority"" after the unemployment rate hit its highest level in two years. Rishi Sunak said finding innovative solutions was ""top of mind"" as figures showed unemployment rose to 4.1% in the three months to July, up from 3.9%. Labour called for the furlough scheme to be replaced when it ends in October, warning joblessness could spike. But the chancellor stressed this would not help people find new opportunities. Mr Sunak acknowledged the furlough wage support scheme had worked, with more than half of the 9.6 million workers furloughed since May returning to work by mid-August. Could UK adopt German or French furlough scheme? Which sectors are hiring at the moment? The women who started businesses in lockdown But he told the BBC: ""I wouldn't be being honest with people if I pretended that it was always going to be possible for people to return to the job that they had. ""Now in terms of helping those people, I don't think the right thing to do is to endlessly extend furlough. ""People don't want to be at home, they want to be in work, and that's why our plan for jobs is so important, because it helps provide people with new opportunities, going forward."" Instead he said the government had cut taxes for business, offered targeted support to the hospitality industry, and launched a job retention bonus for firms that bring back staff from furlough. At the job protection scheme's peak in May, 30% of the workforce across the UK was furloughed. That figure fell to 11% by mid-August. Earlier on Tuesday, employment minister Mims Davies also indicated that more targeted support for struggling sectors could be announced by the government. ""There will be sectors that take longer to come back - I don't think this government is afraid of supporting where we can,"" she said. The furlough scheme was designed with a specific problem in mind - to keep people connected to jobs that would return after the pandemic peak passed. Any future package would be concentrated on a different target - to help create new and replacement jobs, or to allow for short time work. Number 11 is still sceptical about sectoral targeting. How do you deal with supply chains, for example, a media buyer who works in the aviation industry? Will cash be wasted on businesses that do not need support? But the very facts that the chancellor pointed out to me in Stoke, that people are quite quickly coming off furlough, show that is less of a worry than might be thought. The ongoing generosity of such a scheme would have to be assessed in the light of the spending review, and high levels of government debt. Something is cooking at the Treasury as it looks beyond furlough scheme. Though it is not yet what might be referred to as ""oven ready"". Read more here Firms have continued to remove staff from payrolls as they prepare for the end of the furlough scheme on 31 October, the latest employment figures show. About 695,000 UK workers have disappeared from the payrolls of British companies since March, when the coronavirus lockdown began, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

"The UK unemployment rate has risen to its highest level for two years, official figures show. The unemployment rate grew to 4.1% in the three months to July, compared with 3.9% previously. Young people were particularly hard hit, with those aged 16 to 24 suffering the biggest drop in employment compared with other age groups. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said ""helping people get back into, or finding new work"" was his ""number one priority"". But in a briefing to the Cabinet on the economy, he reaffirmed a decision not to extend the government's Job Retention Scheme which ends on 31 October. Mr Sunak told colleagues that ""indefinitely keeping people out of work is not the answer"", but added that he would ""be creative"" in finding ways of helping people. New data from the Office for National Statistics,externalshowed that firms continued to remove staff from payrolls as they prepare for the end of the scheme. Some 695,000 UK workers disappeared from the payrolls of British companies since March, when the coronavirus lockdown began. Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? Meanwhile, there were 156,000 fewer young people in employment in the three months to July compared to the previous quarter. ""Generation Z has been hit particularly hard by the economic fall out of the pandemic as the retail and hospitality sectors, which have taken such a battering, are often relied on to help school and university leavers find an entry-level job, and get started in the world of work,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

As people returned to work from being paid under the furlough scheme, the rate of decline in employee pay growth slowed. Meanwhile, job vacancies in the three months to August jumped by 30% to 434,000. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The family hit hard by unemployment However, the number of vacancies is still significantly below pre-virus levels. Mr Morgan said: ""With the number of employees on the payroll down again in August and both unemployment and redundancies sharply up in July, it is clear that coronavirus is still having a big impact on the world of work,"" he said. Mr Sunak told colleagues that it was important to remember that the ""significant support"" that had already been put in place had ""come at a cost"" and the economy was still nowhere near pre-Covid levels. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - addressing the TUC conference by video link, as he is self-isolating - called for an extension of part-time working as furlough comes to an end, with rewards for employers who keep people on, though he gave no detail of these rewards. He also called for targeted support for vulnerable sectors such as hospitality and aviation. He urged ministers to ""outlaw fire-and-rehire tactics"" where workers are made redundant, then taken on in worse conditions. Unfortunately, this is the start of the official unemployment numbers starting to go up, just ahead of the furlough scheme being phased out. While the headline unemployment rate went up to 4.1%, this is still low by historic and international standards. Digging a little deeper, however, shows a more considerable increase of 0.5% to 4.4% solely in July. And in the final week of July, it increased to 4.8%. This is the start of what economists and academics expect will be a sustained rise. The good news for now is that so far, the vast bulk of previously furloughed workers appear to have gone back to their jobs. The other very notable feature is that the overall three-month average rise in unemployment, while still small, was in large part the result of young people losing their jobs. Redundancies also went up to their highest level since the aftermath of the financial crisis. Employment remained at a record, however, and hours worked and vacancies showed a small recovery from massive falls during lockdown. So the climb has started slowly, but the concern now is, where exactly does this go? Orrean Jacob recently lost the job he had done for nine years, working at the Mini car factory in Oxford as an agency worker. ""They decided to let people go, and I was one of them,"" he says.Hundreds of workers at the plant were affected. ""It really hurt. When you go to work, it's not just about the money or pay.

"Small businesses have been thrown a lifeline after the High Court ruled some insurers should have paid out for losses caused by lockdown. Judges ruled that the disease clauses in some business interruption policies should have meant they were covered. Following lockdown, a host of businesses had to close and many looked to insurers to cover their losses. But many insurers disputed the claims, arguing policies were never meant to cover such unprecedented restrictions. The test case was brought by the Financial Conduct Authority and had the potential to affect 370,000 mostly small businesses. The insurers can appeal against the decision. Policyholders should hear from their insurer within seven days. 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive of the FCA, said the ruling removed ""a large number"" of roadblocks to successful claims, as well as clarifying those that might not be successful. ""We are pleased that the court has substantially found in favour of the arguments we presented on the majority of the key issues. ""Today's judgement is a significant step in resolving the uncertainty being faced by policyholders. ""Coronavirus is causing substantial loss and distress to businesses and many are under immense financial strain to stay afloat."" Anna Smart and her husband Robin Anna Smart runs a photography studio in Oxfordshire with her husband Robin and thought she was covered by business interruption insurance. But when she was turned down by her insurer, she was forced to make her one member of staff redundant and move out of their premises. She said it was ""painful"" to let someone go and it felt like ""ditching a member of the family"". Instead, they have used a Bounce Back loan to build a studio in their back garden. Businesses such as hers were under ""immense"" stress, she said, while some had already been forced to close permanently, irrespective of the result of the case. Hospitality Insurance Group Action (Higa), one of the campaign groups backing the FCA's case, said thousands of UK hospitality businesses should now be able to receive pay-outs as a result of the judgement. Sonia Campbell, of law firm Mishcon de Reya, which represents Higa, said: ""This is fantastic news which has shown that we were right to pursue insurers who across the board denied cover for Covid-related losses. ""I would now urge other hospitality businesses to join us to ensure that they can successfully recover payments from insurers in line with the court's decision."" The Hiscox Action Group (HAG), which has more than 400 members and also intervened in the case, called Tuesday's ruling a ""landmark"". Steering committee member Mark Killick said: ""The most important thing now is that the insurers accept this ruling and start to pay out rather than embark on a fruitless appeals process that will just cause more suffering for the very policyholders they were meant to protect."" As of July, about 400 companies had complained to the financial ombudsman, saying they had been wrongly denied cover for lockdown-related losses. In response, the FCA brought its test case, arguing that while some insurers had provided payouts to customers, many claims had been ""rejected"" under ""blanket denials of cover"". It asked the High Court to decide on the correct interpretation of a selection of policies, with judges in the end looking at 21 issued by eight separate insurers - among them giants such as Hiscox, RSA, QBE and Zurich. The ruling could affect many more policies. However, the regulator added: ""Although the judgement will bring welcome news for many policyholders, the judgement did not say that the eight defendant insurers are liable across all of the 21 different types of policy wording in the representative sample considered by the court. ""Each policy needs to be considered against the detailed judgement to work out what it means for that policy."" Insurer Hiscox said it was ""assessing the judgement in detail"" to see how it applied to claims made by individual policyholders. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""Insurers have supported this fast-track court process led by the FCA to help bring clarity for customers and we welcome the speed with which the court has delivered a ruling. ""The judgment divides evenly between insurers and policyholders on the main issues. The national lockdown was an unprecedented situation that posed understandable questions of interpretation for some business insurance contracts. ""Insurers always regret any contract dispute with their customers and will continue to reflect on feedback from recent events."" Both sides have some grounds to celebrate after this ruling. For policyholders, there is progress towards the payout they believe they are entitled to. They may still have to wait some time to see the money. Some will ultimately be disappointed to not get a penny. For insurers, there is some relief as some may not be paying out as much as could have been the case in their worst-case scenario. Both sides wanted clarity, quickly, but this dispute may still have more twists and turns before it is finally settled.

"The new Wylfa power station was to be built next to the old power plant on Anglesey Plans for a Â£15-Â£20bn nuclear power plant in Wales have been scrapped. Work on the Wylfa Newydd project on Angleseywas suspended in January last yearbecause of rising costs after Hitachi failed to reach a funding agreement with the UK government. Isle of Anglesey council said the company had now confirmed in writing it is withdrawing from the project. Council leader Llinos Medi said: ""This is very disappointing, particularly at such a difficult time economically."" Hitachi shelved the scheme, the biggest energy project ever proposed in Wales, over funding issues. Anglesey council said it had received a letter from the Tokyo-based parent company confirming its decision. Developer Horizon Nuclear, which is owned by Hitachi, said it would not comment. Donald Trump plea over Wylfa nuclear project sale dismissed Wylfa Newydd and the energy gap What's Wylfa - and why is it so important? The UK government also declined to comment but the Welsh Affairs Committee has said the Wylfa nuclear power project withdrawal is ""a blow for Wales and the UK's ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050."" ""This was set to be the largest energy project Wales had ever seen with a positive impact on skills and employment in the region,"" said committee chairman Stephen Crabb MP. ""With the nation's remaining nuclear plants ageing and the need for low-carbon, high yield plants needed to replace them urgent, it has never been more important than now to ensure energy security."" Work on Wylfa was due to start this year Mr Crabb added that Hitachi had given ""reassurances"" of its commitment to the project over the summer ""that gave hope to the workers who'd be needed to construct it and the high-skilled employees who would run it"". Developers said the plant would create up to 9,000 jobs during the construction phase and have a 60-year operational life. Campaigners against the project - a replacement for the original Wylfa plant shut in 2015 after 44 years of service - welcomed Hitachi's move claiming a ""nuclear power station would have endangered lives on Anglesey and beyond"". The People Against Wylfa B action group said: ""It would have ruined the environment over an area which is 10 times greater than the current site."" It called on Hitachi to ""ensure that no nuclear scheme will happen on the site in the future"" and return the site to its ""former state, for community benefit"". ""Proposals to develop green energy schemes would be an area where Hitachi's expertise could create many jobs here,"" the group added. Anglesey council has called for a meeting with the Welsh and UK governments to discuss the future of the site. A two-reactor plant at Wylfa was earmarked as having thepotential to power up to five million homes, but the project was put on hold as the upfront costs rose. With 9,000 workers ready to start the construction phase, the decision in January 2019 was described as ""a tremendous blow"" to the Welsh economy by business leaders. The company said in June it was hoping to secure extra funding from the UK government to resume the project but has now thrown in the towel. As one of Wales' biggest proposed construction projects, Wylfa Newydd has faced turbulent times. The company behind it, Hitachi, has always been concerned about the costs of building the new nuclear power plant. The UK government went some way in offering financial support to the project but it wasn't enough to satisfy Hitachi's concerns over the financial risks. The UK government also held a consultation on plans that would see energy customers pay upfront for the costs of construction. The industry has been waiting for months for an outcome to that. When the UK government said nuclear was part of its push for green energy, the industry thought it was a positive sign for Wylfa Newydd. But critics question how green nuclear energy really is, not to mention how safe it is. Wales has been called the ""land of artists' impressions"" with many big schemes that are talked about and never happen. Supporters of Wylfa Newydd will be concerned it will become another of those, while its critics would be glad to see the back of the plans. Economist Edward Jones said people were learning new skills in the hope of finding work at Wylfa Newydd The decision will have ""a big effect on the economy"", according to Edward Jones, lecturer in economics at Bangor University. ""We are currently feeling the effect of Covid-19 and Brexit is around the corner, and we will feel the negative impact of that on the economy,"" he said. ""A lot of people were investing in learning new skills with the thought of getting jobs at Wylfa. ""We know businesses are investing in new production methods to be part of the supply chain of the nuclear power plant. ""The challenge now is to find other projects that can make use of these skills."" Mr Jones said other energy projects on the island, such asthe Morlais tidal energy scheme, could make use of the investment already made.

"Building Wylfa Newydd was due to being construction in 2020 ""Arguably we have the best site in Europe here for new nuclear build."" That's how Horizon Nuclear Power described its base on Anglesey inan interview with BBC Wales back in 2016. The geography was right, with a skilled local community that had grown up around the old Wylfa plant on hand. As the name suggests - Wylfa Newydd, a 'new Wylfa' - was meant to mark the start of a fresh chapter for nuclear power generation on the island. It was an important step too towards realising the UK government's ambition for a fleet of modern reactors to supply us with electricity for decades to come. Always upbeat and outwardly confident, Horizon had celebrated many ""milestones"" since taking on the scheme in 2009  - licences to use the reactors approved, applications for environmental permits and planning permission submitted. But in the energy industry, rumours began to swirl about its parent company - Japanese tech giant Hitachi's commitment to the project. Finding investors to fund the upfront costs - which in 2018 had reportedly doubled to Â£20bn for Wylfa and another plant at Oldbury in Gloucestershire - seemed to have become a step too far. And negotiations in Westminster around the price to be paid for power from the plant are yet to produce any firm commitments. Ministers wanted the subsidy to be less than was agreed for Hinkley Point C in Somerset - a deal that was heavily criticised for being too expensive. Wylfa decision 'a tremendous blow' for Wales What's Wylfa and why is it so important? Nuclear strategy 'in tatters' It has also been reported that Brexit uncertainty and a growing aversion to nuclear in Japan following the Fukushima disaster in 2011 have played a part. All the while, the cost of renewable technologies has continued to plummet, making nuclear power look less and less attractive. The project's difficulties have led to calls for a review of the UK's energy policy from opposition parties and industry leaders. The new station would be built close to the old nuclear power station at Cemaes, which stopped production in 2015 Control over energy developments in Wales is split between the Welsh and Westminster governments. But when it comes to a project this big - with a generating capacity of 2900 MW - ministers in London take the lead. They could decide to offer a different funding mechanism, or invest in the plant themselvesto try to get Hitachi back on board.,external Their priority is to secure affordable energy supplies in years to come, while cutting carbon emissions, which are driving global climate change. So coal-fired power stations - like Aberthaw in the Vale of Glamorgan - are set to close by 2025.  Extending that deadline or reverting to more gas generation would be highly controversial. Nuclear has been seen as important because it is predictable low-carbon power, constantly feeding the national grid unlike the fluctuating output of wind and solar. It currently accounts for more than a fifth of electricity generated in the UK. The plan had been for several new plants to come on stream by the mid 2030s. It would have seen the red segment in the graph above swallowing up the dark green and grey areas representing fossil fuels - with the help of more renewables too. But so far only one proposal - Hinkley Point C - has made it off the drawing board - with experts warning of a looming energy gap. If traditional, big plants are too costly, proponents of small modular reactors -such as the one proposed for Trawsfynydd in Gwynedd- could see this as an opportunity. Others will call for significant investment in renewables, as well as battery storage. Last year a 22MW battery was installed at the largest onshore windfarm in Wales and England at Pen-y-Cymoedd near Neath. The Welsh Government - which has control over energy schemes of up to 350 MW - has said it wants to see 70% of Wales' electricity needs met by renewables by 2030. But ultimately, it will be policies penned in Westminster that have the greatest influence on large-scale projects capable of delivering a significant percentage of the UK's energy supply. Brexit may be dominating debate at the moment, but where we get our power from in 10 to 20 years' time is another huge issue the UK government will need to find time - and energy - to address.

Ebola and HIV came from primates; scientists have linked cases of Ebola to consuming meat from infected animals. A bite from a rabies-infected animal is a very effective mode of disease transmission. And in the 20 years before Covid-19,  SARs, MERs, swine flu, and avian flu all spilled over from animals. As we reengineer the natural world, we encroach on reservoirs of animal disease and put ourselves at risk. ""More and more we are affecting wildlife populations, deforesting and causing animals to move and enter our environment,"" explained Prof Matthew Baylis, a veterinary epidemiologist from the University of Liverpool. ""That causes [disease-causing] pathogens to be passed from one species to another. So our behaviours on a global scale are facilitating the spread of a pathogen from animals into humans."" The convention (CBD) has called this the ""final report card"" on progress against the20 global biodiversity targets,externalthat were agreed in 2010 with a 2020 deadline. ""Progress has been made, but none of [those] targets will be fully met,"" Ms Maruma Mrema told BBC News. ""So a lot still needs to be done to bend the curve on biodiversity loss."" As well as a stark warning, this report sets out an instruction manual about how to bend that curve. ""It can be done,"" said David Cooper, deputy executive secretary of the CBD. ""Next year in China we'll have the UN biodiversity conference, where countries are expected to adopt a new framework that will represent global commitments to put nature on a path to recovery by 2030."" It is one of our closest primate relatives, but the Bornean orangutan is on the brink of extinction That framework - which has been dubbed a ""Paris climate agreement for nature"", will encompass eight major transitions that all 196 nations will be expected to commit to: Land and forests: Protecting habitats and reducing the degradation of soil; Sustainable agriculture: redesigning the way we farm to minimise the negative impact on nature through things like forest clearance and intensive use of fertilisers and pesticides; Food:Eating a more sustainable diet with, primarily, more moderate consumption of meat and fish and ""dramatic cuts"" in waste; Oceans and fisheries:Protecting and restoring marine ecosystems and fishing sustainably - allowing stocks to recover and important marine habitats to be protected Urban greening:Making more space for nature in towns and cities, where almost three-quarters of us live; Freshwater:Protecting lake and river habitats, reducing pollution and improving water quality; Urgent climate action:Taking action on climate change with a ""rapid phasing out"" of fossil fuels; A 'One Health' approach:This encompasses all of the above. It essentially means managing our whole environment - whether it is urban, agricultural, forests or fisheries - with a view to promoting ""a healthy environment and healthy people"". ""Covid-19 has been a stark reminder of the relationship between human action and nature,"" said Ms Maruma Mrema. ""Now we have the opportunity to do better post-Covid. The pandemic itself has beenlinked to wildlife trade and human encroachment into forests, which scientists say increases the risk of a ""spillover"" of diseases from wildlife into humans. This video can not be played Scientists believe another pandemic will happen during our lifetime The report does highlight some successes: deforestation rates are continuing to fall, eradication of invasive alien species from islands is increasing, and awareness of biodiversity appears to be increasing. Photographer Joel Sartore is on a mission to document threatened species, like the Malayan tiger, before they disappear ""Many good things are happening around the world and these should be celebrated and encouraged,"" said Ms Maruma Mrema. Nevertheless, she added, the rate of biodiversity loss was unprecedented in human history and pressures were intensifying.Â ""We have to act now. It is not too late. Otherwise, our children and grandchildren will curse us because we will leave behind a polluted, degraded and unhealthy planet.""

"Caerphilly went into lockdown last week Wales should use micro-quarantines to avoid a second national lockdown in the winter, Plaid Cymru has said. It came before the Welsh Government outlined how it will tackle coronavirus in the NHS during the winter months. Plaid said small areas could be locked down around clusters where there has been a higher rate of infection, rather than entire council area. Caerphilly countybecame the first place in Wales to go into local lockdownlast week. On Tuesday, Wales' Labour Health Minister Vaughan Gething published a winter protection plan. It includes anextra 5,000 NHS beds - half in field hospitals - to cope with winter pressures, including a potential second wave of Covid-19 in hospitals. Earlier, he warned of the risk of afurther national lockdownif members of the public do not better respect social distancing rules. Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said the plan needs to be able to deal with both Covid-19 and the usual winter pressures in health and social care. ""Seeing the minister dismantling one Â£25m field hospital at the Principality stadium andbuilding a smaller Â£33m one a few miles awaydoes not fill you with confidence that the ministers plan will achieve this,"" he added. Plaid says people should be encouraged to keep records of their contacts with the help of an app Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price proposed a ""10-point coronavirus winter plan"", which included""smart-lockdowns"" used in countries including Pakistan,external- with targeted lockdowns including a ""local economic package of support"". ""If we do not act, then winter could become a second wave that is even worse than the first, with little option than reintroducing a full lockdown,"" he said. The party also proposed encouraging everyone to keep contact records, with the support of an app, and testing individuals who have been in contact with people with coronavirus, but do not have symptoms themselves. 18,000 Covid-19 test results put online by mistake New rules and lockdowns 'could be too late' Plaid called for quick saliva tests to be implemented, national guidance for face masks in schools, and better use of ventilation. People should be asked to avoid closed, crowded and close-contact settings, Plaid said, calling for a new Covid-19 plan ahead of a vaccine. The Welsh Government said: ""Our contact tracing system is helping us to quickly identify confirmed cases and routes of transmission to allow us to respond swiftly. ""We have introduced new local restrictions in Caerphilly County Borough Council area in response to the rapid increase in this area and new national restrictions to slow the spread after seeing an overall increase in cases across Wales. Local authorities are also taking targeted local action. ""As the first minister said on Friday, this is a fast-moving situation and we have a small window to act to prevent a fresh coronavirus crisis in Wales. We need the help of everyone in the country to do that."" It later added said: ""The new Cardiff facility is designed to last for 20 years and is modular so can be moved to other sites. ""We have carried out a review of the extra bed capacity that will be needed across NHS Wales, using the latest projections and lessons learnt from earlier this year. ""A full plan of the extra capacity for all health boards will be published by the end of this month.""

"The bodies of 29 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer Four people have been jailed in Vietnam for their roles in the death of 39 migrants found in a lorry in Essex, according to state media reports. The men, women and children were discovered in a refrigerated trailer in Grays on 23 October. The four defendants were found guilty of ""organising, brokering illegal emigration"" after a one-day trial in Ha Tinh, VnExpress reported. The state media outlet said one victim paid $22,000 for the illegal journey. The four defendants, aged between 24 and 36, were given sentences ranging from two-and-a-half to seven-and-a-half years. Three others received suspended jail sentences. The bodies of the Vietnamese nationals were discovered at an industrial estate soon after the lorry arrived in the UK on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Ten teenagers, two of them 15-year-old boys, were among the dead. An inquest heard their medical cause of death was asphyxia and hyperthermia. Last month haulier Ronan Hughes, 40, of Tyholland, County Monaghan,admitted manslaughter and conspiring to assist unlawful immigrationat the Old Bailey while Eamonn Harrison, 23, of Mayobridge, County Down, denied 39 charges of manslaughter. Gazmir Nuzi, 42, of Barclay Road, Tottenham, north London, pleaded guilty to a single charge of assisting unlawful immigration on or before 11 October 2019 and 18 April 2020. Earlier this year, lorry driver Maurice Robinson, 25, of Craigavon, County Armagh, pleaded guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. Mr Harrison now faces a trial expected to last five weeks starting on 5 October with three others. Gheorghe Nica, 43, of Langdon Hills, Basildon, Essex, denies 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham, and Christopher Kennedy, 23, of County Armagh, Northern Ireland, have each denied conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.

"The UK unemployment rate has risen to its highest level for two years, official figures show. The unemployment rate grew to 4.1% in the three months to July, compared with 3.9% previously. Young people were particularly hard hit, with those aged 16 to 24 suffering the biggest drop in employment compared with other age groups. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said ""helping people get back into, or finding new work"" was his ""number one priority"". But in a briefing to the Cabinet on the economy, he reaffirmed a decision not to extend the government's Job Retention Scheme which ends on 31 October. Mr Sunak told colleagues that ""indefinitely keeping people out of work is not the answer"", but added that he would ""be creative"" in finding ways of helping people. New data from the Office for National Statistics,externalshowed that firms continued to remove staff from payrolls as they prepare for the end of the scheme. Some 695,000 UK workers disappeared from the payrolls of British companies since March, when the coronavirus lockdown began. Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? Meanwhile, there were 156,000 fewer young people in employment in the three months to July compared to the previous quarter. ""Generation Z has been hit particularly hard by the economic fall out of the pandemic as the retail and hospitality sectors, which have taken such a battering, are often relied on to help school and university leavers find an entry-level job, and get started in the world of work,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Sadly, this may not just be a bump in the road but could have long term consequences for the path of their careers."" The government haslaunched a scheme called Kickstartto create work placements for unemployed young people. Employers will be paid Â£1,500 for every 16-24 year old they train. The unemployment rate has risen slightly, but experts say it does not yet fully illustrate the full impact of the economic crisis on jobs, with the furlough scheme helping keep the numbers down. The government's Job Retention Scheme begins tapering off this month before ending on 31 October. Under the scheme - which has seen9.6 million people furloughed,external- the government initially paid 80% of a person's wages up to Â£2,500 a month. The women who started businesses in lockdown What's the best way to find a new job? Could UK adopt German or French scheme? Since the start of September, the state's contribution has fallen to 70%, with employers expected to make up the remainder of pay before the scheme ends on 31 October. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics research group, said he expected that ""employment will fall more sharply and unemployment will increase more quickly as the furlough scheme continues to unwind and ceases at the end of October"". ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said that there had been some signs that the economy ""reopened"" in July as businesses including restaurants, pubs and hairdressers were allowed to trade again. As people returned to work from being paid under the furlough scheme, the rate of decline in employee pay growth slowed. Meanwhile, job vacancies in the three months to August jumped by 30% to 434,000. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The family hit hard by unemployment However, the number of vacancies is still significantly below pre-virus levels. Mr Morgan said: ""With the number of employees on the payroll down again in August and both unemployment and redundancies sharply up in July, it is clear that coronavirus is still having a big impact on the world of work,"" he said. Mr Sunak told colleagues that it was important to remember that the ""significant support"" that had already been put in place had ""come at a cost"" and the economy was still nowhere near pre-Covid levels. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - addressing the TUC conference by video link, as he is self-isolating - called for an extension of part-time working as furlough comes to an end, with rewards for employers who keep people on, though he gave no detail of these rewards. He also called for targeted support for vulnerable sectors such as hospitality and aviation. He urged ministers to ""outlaw fire-and-rehire tactics"" where workers are made redundant, then taken on in worse conditions. Unfortunately, this is the start of the official unemployment numbers starting to go up, just ahead of the furlough scheme being phased out. While the headline unemployment rate went up to 4.1%, this is still low by historic and international standards. Digging a little deeper, however, shows a more considerable increase of 0.5% to 4.4% solely in July. And in the final week of July, it increased to 4.8%. This is the start of what economists and academics expect will be a sustained rise. The good news for now is that so far, the vast bulk of previously furloughed workers appear to have gone back to their jobs. The other very notable feature is that the overall three-month average rise in unemployment, while still small, was in large part the result of young people losing their jobs. Redundancies also went up to their highest level since the aftermath of the financial crisis. Employment remained at a record, however, and hours worked and vacancies showed a small recovery from massive falls during lockdown. So the climb has started slowly, but the concern now is, where exactly does this go? Orrean Jacob recently lost the job he had done for nine years, working at the Mini car factory in Oxford as an agency worker. ""They decided to let people go, and I was one of them,"" he says.Hundreds of workers at the plant were affected. ""It really hurt. When you go to work, it's not just about the money or pay. It's about making something of yourself, making friends and making connections."" Although he found himself in a similar position to many others during the pandemic, a phone call with a friend presented him with an opportunity. They recommended he get in touch with the HS2 rail project about their one-week training programmes. By the end of the following week, he was fully licensed to be on-site and drive a forklift, having completed a course worth about Â£1,000 with one of HS2's sub-contractors. ""This was just the push I needed in the right direction - to find something new, to find a new path to pursue because the other one clearly wasn't working.""

Covid-19, Chinaâs top health body says it is now going to roll out counselling
to people who have recovered from Covid-19. According to the official China Daily,social
workers, volunteers and therapists will be made available to former patients,external,
to help understand any physical, mental or financial help they might
need. Their data will be held
on local medical databases, under a system that âemphasises the importance of

âbased on informed consent and voluntary participationâ. In China, more than 80,000 people have recovered from Covid-19

The official Xinhua news agency estimated last year thatone in 10 Chinese people had mental health problems,external. That is 140 million people. People on Chinese social media have spoken often in recent months
about how they have struggled as a result of strict lockdown procedures,
working/studying at home, and finding work. The government is particularly concerned that those who have
recovered have experienced work and social stigma. However, it has urged people
to be transparent if they have any ailments rather than hide their
symptoms and risk the event of another localised outbreak. School attendance figures ""should reassure parents"" about sending their children back to classrooms, Downing Street has said. The first official figures for England,published earlier today, showed 88% of pupils went back for the autumn term. This is a higher absence rate than the usual figure of about 5% but it is not broken down to show whether pupils were at home because of Covid-19 outbreaks. The prime minister's spokesman said the government acknowledged it may take time for some parents to feel confident enough to send their children back to school and fines would only be used ""as a last resort, where there's no valid reason for absence"". It is understood no fines have been issued since schools returned. BBC Radio 5 Live There are a lot of reports of people struggling to get a coronavirus test.

"The UK unemployment rate has risen to its highest level for two years, official figures show. The unemployment rate grew to 4.1% in the three months to July, compared with 3.9% previously. Young people were particularly hard hit, with those aged 16 to 24 suffering the biggest drop in employment compared with other age groups. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said ""helping people get back into, or finding new work"" was his ""number one priority"". But in a briefing to the Cabinet on the economy, he reaffirmed a decision not to extend the government's Job Retention Scheme which ends on 31 October. Mr Sunak told colleagues that ""indefinitely keeping people out of work is not the answer"", but added that he would ""be creative"" in finding ways of helping people. New data from the Office for National Statistics,externalshowed that firms continued to remove staff from payrolls as they prepare for the end of the scheme. Some 695,000 UK workers disappeared from the payrolls of British companies since March, when the coronavirus lockdown began. Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? Meanwhile, there were 156,000 fewer young people in employment in the three months to July compared to the previous quarter. ""Generation Z has been hit particularly hard by the economic fall out of the pandemic as the retail and hospitality sectors, which have taken such a battering, are often relied on to help school and university leavers find an entry-level job, and get started in the world of work,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Sadly, this may not just be a bump in the road but could have long term consequences for the path of their careers."" The government haslaunched a scheme called Kickstartto create work placements for unemployed young people. Employers will be paid Â£1,500 for every 16-24 year old they train. The unemployment rate has risen slightly, but experts say it does not yet fully illustrate the full impact of the economic crisis on jobs, with the furlough scheme helping keep the numbers down. The government's Job Retention Scheme begins tapering off this month before ending on 31 October. Under the scheme - which has seen9.6 million people furloughed,external- the government initially paid 80% of a person's wages up to Â£2,500 a month. The women who started businesses in lockdown What's the best way to find a new job? Could UK adopt German or French scheme? Since the start of September, the state's contribution has fallen to 70%, with employers expected to make up the remainder of pay before the scheme ends on 31 October. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics research group, said he expected that ""employment will fall more sharply and unemployment will increase more quickly as the furlough scheme continues to unwind and ceases at the end of October"". ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said that there had been some signs that the economy ""reopened"" in July as businesses including restaurants, pubs and hairdressers were allowed to trade again. As people returned to work from being paid under the furlough scheme, the rate of decline in employee pay growth slowed. Meanwhile, job vacancies in the three months to August jumped by 30% to 434,000. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The family hit hard by unemployment However, the number of vacancies is still significantly below pre-virus levels. Mr Morgan said: ""With the number of employees on the payroll down again in August and both unemployment and redundancies sharply up in July, it is clear that coronavirus is still having a big impact on the world of work,"" he said. Mr Sunak told colleagues that it was important to remember that the ""significant support"" that had already been put in place had ""come at a cost"" and the economy was still nowhere near pre-Covid levels. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - addressing the TUC conference by video link, as he is self-isolating - called for an extension of part-time working as furlough comes to an end, with rewards for employers who keep people on, though he gave no detail of these rewards. He also called for targeted support for vulnerable sectors such as hospitality and aviation. He urged ministers to ""outlaw fire-and-rehire tactics"" where workers are made redundant, then taken on in worse conditions. Unfortunately, this is the start of the official unemployment numbers starting to go up, just ahead of the furlough scheme being phased out. While the headline unemployment rate went up to 4.1%, this is still low by historic and international standards. Digging a little deeper, however, shows a more considerable increase of 0.5% to 4.4% solely in July. And in the final week of July, it increased to 4.8%. This is the start of what economists and academics expect will be a sustained rise. The good news for now is that so far, the vast bulk of previously furloughed workers appear to have gone back to their jobs. The other very notable feature is that the overall three-month average rise in unemployment, while still small, was in large part the result of young people losing their jobs. Redundancies also went up to their highest level since the aftermath of the financial crisis. Employment remained at a record, however, and hours worked and vacancies showed a small recovery from massive falls during lockdown. So the climb has started slowly, but the concern now is, where exactly does this go? Orrean Jacob recently lost the job he had done for nine years, working at the Mini car factory in Oxford as an agency worker. ""They decided to let people go, and I was one of them,"" he says.Hundreds of workers at the plant were affected. ""It really hurt. When you go to work, it's not just about the money or pay. It's about making something of yourself, making friends and making connections."" Although he found himself in a similar position to many others during the pandemic, a phone call with a friend presented him with an opportunity. They recommended he get in touch with the HS2 rail project about their one-week training programmes. By the end of the following week, he was fully licensed to be on-site and drive a forklift, having completed a course worth about Â£1,000 with one of HS2's sub-contractors. ""This was just the push I needed in the right direction - to find something new, to find a new path to pursue because the other one clearly wasn't working.""

The first official figures for England,published earlier today, showed 88% of pupils went back for the autumn term. This is a higher absence rate than the usual figure of about 5% but it is not broken down to show whether pupils were at home because of Covid-19 outbreaks. The prime minister's spokesman said the government acknowledged it may take time for some parents to feel confident enough to send their children back to school and fines would only be used ""as a last resort, where there's no valid reason for absence"". It is understood no fines have been issued since schools returned. BBC Radio 5 Live There are a lot of reports of people struggling to get a coronavirus test. Gaynor Hope in south west London got her 16-year-old son a test after four days of trying. But test site workers were only able to grant him one by using a postcode from over 500 miles away. âWe drove up to the test centre, no queue, two other carsâ¦ but the steward said we had to use an Aberdeen postcode to get a QR code for a testâ, she told BBC Radio 5 Live. âThey were on their handheld devices, searching for any postcode they could useâ¦ itâs just so frustrating.â Gaynorâs MP, Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson,asked the health secretary about this issue in Parliament this afternoon,external. The number of patients in mechanical ventilation beds across the UK has passed 100 for the first time in nearly two months There were 106 patients on ventilation in the UK on Monday - the first time the figure has been over 100 since 24 July.

off on a pilgrimage to Ukraine are stranded on the Ukraine-Belarus border because of coronavirus restrictions. They want to get to the central Ukrainian town of Uman for the Jewish New Year, which is being celebrated at the weekend, and visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman, who revived the
Hasidic movement in the 19th Century. One described the conditions at the border: ""I spent the night on the bus, but most of them [other pilgrims] spent the
night right on the road, some gathered branches in the forest
and lit fires,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""We have no food or water, we have children with
us, about 100 children,"" he added. Ukraine has imposed a ban on the entry of foreigners from the end of August till the end of September because of the pandemic.

"Online grocer Ocado says its switch to delivering Marks & Spencer food has been ""successful"" and demand is rising despite a rocky start. The firm, which previously delivered for Waitrose, had to cancel some orders when its new partnership launched on 1 September, angering customers. But it said launch day had been its ""biggest forward order day to date"" amid excitement about the new tie-up. Average shopper baskets have also grown by about five items since then. It comes as the firm reported a 50% jump in sales for the third quarter of the year at its Ocado Retail business, in which M&S holds a 50% stake. Ocado said it had benefited from continued strong demand for online shopping during lockdown, with weekly orders climbing 10% in the 13 weeks to 30 August. Ocado cancels orders on first M&S delivery day Ocado halts staff deliveries amid order backlog Some customers criticised Ocado when it launched its M&S range, saying orders made weeks earlier had been cancelled at the last minute. The retailer also halted orders from its staff as it tried to clear an order backlog. However, on Tuesday, the firm said customers had ""responded positively to the switchover"", with ""demand for the new range driving both an increase in the number of products in customer baskets and strong forward demand"". It added: ""The weighting of M&S products in the average Ocado basket is higher than Waitrose prior to the switchover, reflecting positive customer reaction to the addition of M&S to the range."" Analysts said the results were not only promising for Ocado, but also for M&S. Last year, some warned the retailer might have overpaid for its stake in the partnership at a time when its business was struggling. Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""This could bode well for Marks & Spencer, whose sales could do with a boost, and who staked a lot on this deal paying off. ""98% of customers are already shopping at M&S, though, so it will be interesting to see how many of these sales will have simply transferred from stores."" Ocado, which booked a pre-tax loss of Â£214.5m in 2019, said it expected strong underlying earnings of Â£40m this year because of continued demand for its services. But it added: ""Uncertainties remain over the scale, and duration, of the ongoing impact of social distancing restrictions in the UK."" The firm has said the shift to online shopping during the pandemic could mean a ""permanent redrawing"" of the retail landscape. In July boss Tim Steiner said that as a result of Covid-19, ""we have seen years of growth in the online grocery market condensed into a matter of months and we won't be going back"".

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for âurgent talksâ to set up ânew targeted supportâ when the furlough scheme ends Sir Keir Starmer has called on the government to replace the furlough scheme and outlaw ""firing and re-hiring"" methods to avoid the ""scarring effect"" of ""mass unemployment"". Almost 10 million workers have been furloughed since March but the scheme is set to end on 31 October. The Labour leader made an ""open offer"" to work on a plan with the PM including targeted support for badly-hit sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he would be ""creative"" in helping people find work. He told Cabinet it was his ""top priority"", but said that ""indefinitely keeping people out of work is not the answer"". However, Employment Minister Mims Davies hinted there could be a more targeted approach when Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveils his budget later in the year. She said there would be ""sectors that take longer to come back"" from the pandemic, adding: ""I don't think this government is afraid of supporting where we can [and we] have fiscal events where the chancellor can start to look at that."" Sir Keir's speech at this year's Trades Union Congress' annual conference comes as the latest UK unemployment figures are released, showingthe highest level for two years. The unemployment rate grew to 4.1% in the three months to July - compared with 3.9% previously - with young people were particularly hard hit. Will the furlough scheme be extended? Could UK adopt German or French scheme? TUC warns Chancellor 'act or face job loss tsunami' Sir Keir made the case for replacing the job retention scheme - also known as the furlough scheme - which was introduced to support employers and staff during the coronavirus lockdown. Under it, employees placed on leave due to virus restrictions have received 80% of their pay up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Since September, firms have had to start making a contribution to wages as part of the scheme winding down. The government has been reluctant to extend the furlough scheme beyond October with Boris Johnson arguing that it would only keep people ""in suspended animation"". Speaking to the conference via Zoom while isolating at home, Sir Keir said: ""We all know the furlough scheme can't go on as it is forever, but the truth is the virus is still with us and infections are increasing. ""It just isn't possible to get back to work or reopen businesses. It isn't a choice. It's the cold reality of this crisis. ""So it makes no sense at all for the government to pull support away now in one fell swoop."" The Labour leader said the government should hold urgent talks with his party, trade unions and businesses, and use a ""bit of imagination"" to create ""new targeted support that can replace the job retention scheme and develop those sectors where it is most needed"" - such as retail, hospitality and aviation. ""Imagine how powerful it would be if we all shared a national plan to protect jobs, create new ones and invest in skills and trade,"" he added. ""So I'm making an open offer to the prime minister: work with us to keep millions of people in work, work with the trade unions, work with businesses and do everything possible to protect jobs and deliver for workers. My door is open."" Politically, Keir Starmer's language was at least as interesting as his post-furlough policies. First, his call for a ""national plan"" and his offer of an ""open door"" to government. He is attempting to appear as a consensus-builder, and placing responsibility for any lack of engagement on Boris Johnson. This is felt to be a more effective tactic than unadulterated criticism - offering potential solutions as well as pointing out problems. It has caused teeth-gnashing amongst some on his party's left, however. Second, and perhaps more significantly, was the language he used to encase a commitment that Jeremy Corbyn could have made. The re-hiring of employees on worse conditions was ""against British values"" and hit those who worked hard he said and should be banned. This terminology is aimed at those residing amidst the ruins of the red wall, presenting left-wing positions that might appeal to them as ""patriotic"". The question for the future is how far Keir Starmer will feel he has to change previous Labour policies rather than to re-badge them. Other proposals from Labour include expanding part-time working and rewarding employers who give people hours rather than cut jobs, and providing training and support for those who can't come back full-time. ""We know only too well the scarring effect massive mass unemployment will have on communities and families across the country,"" Sir Keir added. ""We cannot let that happen again."" The Labour leader praised trade unions as ""unsung heroes"" saying: ""Without you there would have been no furlough scheme, no life raft for seven million people."" And he pledged to ""stand together"" with the unions under his leadership. During questions from union members, Sir Keir also called for a ""different approach"" to the care sector, which he said had been ""underpaid and undervalued"" for years. And asked about the return to workplaces, he criticised the government communications for ""being all over the place"" but said going back safely was ""in the best interest of everybody and in the best interests of the country"".

"The testing system is facing an ""enormous challenge"" after a ""sharp rise"" in those seeking a Covid-19 test, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. When asked about reports of people struggling to get tested, Mr Hancock said it would take a ""matter of weeks"" to resolve the issues. He said No 10 would update its testing policy shortly to prioritise the most urgent cases. Test slots have been limited due to bottlenecks in lab processing of swabs. The rise in demand for tests had led to local shortages, with Labour saying no tests were available in virus ""hotspots"" over the weekend. Hospital bosses have also warned that a lack of tests for NHS workers is putting services at risk. 'How am I supposed to get my family of eight tested?' NHS staff 'off work due to testing shortages' Three government claims on testing fact-checked Call for mini lockdowns as coronavirus cases mount People have told the BBC of their frustrationat being turned away from a walk-in test centre in Oldham, Greater Manchester. A woman attending the walk-in centre said staff told her that labs were struggling to turn tests around. BBC Health editor Hugh Pym said: ""There seem to be enough testing sites, but there are bottlenecks in the labs for processing the swabs taken. That's why they're limiting the amount of slots for the public, just when more people want to get tested."" One Cabinet minister told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergthis was a ""classic government problem"" where demand for a public service outstrips supply. The minister, she said, was confident that ""underneath the noise"", the majority of people were getting the service they needed, when they needed it. This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people trying to get tests at a centre in Oldham On Saturday, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told the BBC that thegovernment was working to boost testing capacity through investment in new testing centres and so-called lighthouse labs. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said sheis hopeful that a backlog in test results will be resolvedshortly, after ""constructive"" talks with Mr Hancock. The UK government announced3,105 new lab-confirmed cases on Tuesday,external, bringing the total number of positive tests to 374,228. Another 27 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, bringing the overall death toll to 41,664. The number of patients in mechanical ventilation beds across the UK has passed 100 for the first time in nearly two months. There were 106 patients on ventilation in the UK on Monday - the first time the figure has been over 100 since 24 July. UK-wide figures for today are yet to be published but there were 101 patients on ventilation in England alone on Tuesday. Around 220,000 tests are processed each day, according togovernment figures released last week,external, with a testing capacity of more than 350,000 - which includes swab tests and antibody tests. The aim is to increase that to 500,000 a day by the end of October. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock said there were ""operational challenges"" with testing which the government was ""working hard"" to fix. He said throughout the pandemic they had prioritised testing according to need. Mr Hancock said the ""top priority is and always has been acute clinical care"", followed by social care, where the government is sending ""over 100,000 tests a day"" due to the virus risks in care homes. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We're working around the clock to make sure everyone who needs a test can get a test"" Conservative chairman of the Health and Social Care Committee Jeremy Hunt was among the MPs to question Mr Hancock on testing, saying a number of his constituents had to travel for tests, while one key worker had to wait a week for her results. ""A week ago today, the secretary of state told the Health Select Committee that he expected to have this problem solved in two weeks,"" Mr Hunt said. ""Is the secretary of state, given the efforts that his department is making, still confident that in a week's time we will have this problem solved?"" ""I think that we will be able to solve this problem in a matter of weeks,"" Mr Hancock replied. He said demand was ""high"" but ""record capacity"" was being delivered, with plans to ensure tests are prioritised for those that need them most. Despite the health secretary's promises, there will be no easy solution to the shortages of tests. All the expectations are that cases will go up. People are circulating more as society reopens and we are entering the period when respiratory viruses thrive. As cases go up so will demands on the testing system. Even with the promise of more testing capacity in the coming weeks, the chances of shortages continuing remains a distinct possibility. A new lab is due to open later this month which will be able to carry out 50,000 tests a day. But this could easily be swallowed up. What it means is that testing will have to be prioritised where it is needed most. That will be in care homes, hospitals and among key workers, as well as where there are local outbreaks. The government's surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics will also be protected. But this is not unique to the UK. Other countries are facing similar pressures. In fact, the UK is testing more people per head of population than Spain, France and Germany. It promises to be a difficult winter across Europe. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Hancock was ""losing control of this virus"". He said that after schools and offices reopened, extra demand on the system was ""inevitable"". He questioned why Mr Hancock did not use the summer ""to significantly expand"" NHS lab capacity and ""fix"" contact tracing. Responding, Mr Hancock said it was ""inevitable"" that demand would rise with a free service, adding the ""challenge"" was to ensure tests are prioritised for those who most need them.

"Job vacancies are at a record high, rising to 1.17 million in the three months to October. Latest figures also show the number of workers on payrolls jumped by 160,000 in October, despite the end of the furlough scheme. Workers call the shots as job vacancies boom According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there were 388,000 more vacancies in this period (August to October 2021) than the three months immediately before the pandemic (January-March 2020), with record highs in 15 of its 18 sector categories. Health The health sector had the most vacancies between July and September with 183,000. The King's Fund think tank says the NHS is facing a""workforce crisis"",external. According tothe latest annual State of the Adult Social Care Sector and Workforce in England report, the sector is struggling to recruit and retain staff, with more unfilled posts now than at the start of the pandemic. The government says extra funding and a regular recruitment drive will help boost the workforce. Care home staff shortage adding pressure on NHS Hospitality The hospitality sector had 151,000 unfilled roles. Industry body UK Hospitality said chefs, security and front of house staff were particularly in demand. The shortage is put down to a number a factors including job security fears in light of Covid, and Brexit. It's leading some businesses to scale back their operations, with restaurants reducing opening hours and hotels closing off parts of their buildings. Is there a solution to the hospitality staff crisis? 'Help - I still can't find a job' Retail and transport There were 91,000 vacancies in retail -GreggsandNextare among the high street names which have recently warned of staff shortages in the run-up to Christmas. The British Retail Consortium said there were vacancies across the sector - for example in warehouses and logistics - and its supply chains, like flower-pickers, butchers and distribution centre operators. There is also aUK-wide shortage of lorry drivers, with 53,000 vacancies in the transport sector Staff shortages could last two years, say firms Starter salaries rise at fastest rate in 24 years Furlough, the government's main coronavirus job support scheme, finished at the end of September. There were fears this could lead to a spike in unemployment, with employers unable to keep staff on their books without the support it offered. The ONS says it could take a few months for the full impact of furlough to be shown - but the latest figures show the number of workers on payrolls jumped by 160,000 in October, and strong demand for workers seems to have prevented the feared wave of job cuts. What are my rights if I am made redundant? Jobseekers should be ''strategic'' and target sectors experiencing shortages as well as those that are growing, says Gerwyn Davies, from human resources body the CIPD. Theshortage occupation list,external- used to offer work visas to people moving to the UK - shows where workers are needed. It includes fields like engineering, web programming and graphic design. Consider your core skills, rather than hunting for a specific job title, suggests Corinne Mills, managing director of Personal Career Management. For example, if you work in retail customer service, this could translate to other people-facing roles, such as sales. This video can not be played Ten tips for getting your dream job Many companies list jobs on their own website or on recruitment sites. You can also sign up with a general or specialist recruitment agency. If you want to work for a particular company, check if it hires directly, or through a recruiter. And if you want a specific job, be proactive and contact someone doing that role to discover how they got there. Professional networks can also be useful. These could be LinkedIn or Facebook groups, or industry organisations, where jobs and events are posted and advice is available. Some industries and employers have set upvirtual networking events and job fairs.,external Corinne Mills suggests drawing on your personal network. Friends, family and acquaintances will collectively know hundreds of people, many of whom will be hiring. Employers often respond to personal recommendations, and you may hear about roles before they are advertised. Tech recruiter Amy Golding also recommends: Tailoring your CV and cover letter for each application Emphasising your skills and listing specific achievements such as finishing a project on time and within budget Showing enthusiasm and giving reasons why you want to do this job for this employer Proofreading your materials, including asking someone else to check them for spelling or grammatical errors which could mean your application goes straight in the bin 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the government is working hard to fix operational challenges in the coronavirus testing system A lack of coronavirus tests for NHS staff is leading to absences and services being put at risk, hospital bosses warn UK unemployment rate rises to its highest level for two years A report by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says the pandemic has pushed global development back by more than 20 years France introduces new restrictions in the areas around Marseille and Bordeaux Globally there have been more than 29 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 928,000 deaths, Johns Hopkins University data shows Edited by Suzanne Leigh We're pausing our Live coverage for the day. Thank you for joining us - coverage will resume Wednesday morning. Today's writers were Katie Wright, Becky Morton, Victoria Bisset and Alexandra FouchÃ©; the page was edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Suzanne Leigh. There have been many developments today, including: Earlier we heard the speaker of the Irish parliament had announced that all members of the cabinet in Dublin would have to self-isolate, after the health minister reported feeling unwell. Stephen Donnelly has contacted his GP for a Covid-19 test, Irish broadcaster RTÃ reports. Initially it was believed that the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) would be adjourned indefinitely, after Speaker Sean O Fearghail said ""the possibility of proceeding with business does not
arise and the house stands adjourned, I suspect, until Tuesday next"". However, Irish prime minister MicheÃ¡l Martin later told RTÃ that the DÃ¡il would be reconvened at 20:00 IST and the cabinet were restricting their movements due to ""an abundance of caution"". Read more. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor No government wants scenes like this. Families in Oldham,external, where there has been particular concern about the spread of coronavirus, are boiling over with frustration that they can't access tests. Not least a government that promised the public its testing system would be better than any other country's. Not least a government that believes a properly functioning testing system is vital to keeping kids back in school and climbing out of recession as quickly as possible. Not least a government that knows testing is a crucial way to monitor and control the virus that saw such a terrible loss of life in the grim spring that we have all just lived through. Read more. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Premier League games continue to be played behind closed doors The English Football League will continue to stage pilots with up to 1,000 fans at matches this weekend, following approval from the government. EFL clubs were asked to put in requests by Tuesday in order for their plans to be signed off in time. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden will meet with sports bodies later this week to discuss the planned return of spectators to sport from 1 October. Last week, the governmentrestricted pilot events to 1,000 spectatorsafter a rise in coronavirus cases, and said plans for grounds to be up to a third full from 1 October would be reviewed. The Premier League says around Â£100m per month will be lost by clubs across the leagues while matches continue behind closed doors and it is one of a number of sports bodies to have voiced concerns at the financial impact of an extended period with empty venues.

With Yom Kippur to follow on Monday week, how will the UK's new coronavirus restrictions affect Jewish celebrations? For Dr Katrina Lester, who is due to give birth in eight weeks, this year will be a ""very lonely time"", spent away from relatives and the synagogue. Like millions of others, her family has been looking forward to the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah - which marks the Jewish new year - and Yom Kippur - a solemn day of atonement, involving a 25-hour fast and continuous prayer throughout the day. But this year, certain rituals and customs will have to be adapted to meet Covid-19 guidelines. The government has issued highly detailed guidancefor the Jewish community as they observe the festivals, with measures including the removal of communal items, such as prayer books, in synagogues; andthe use of microphones for devotions or sermons to avoid shouting,external. Read more. Ben ButcherBBC Reality Check The government is facing criticism over its ""world-beating"" coronavirus testing system after people reported struggles to get tests. Ministers have been defending the NHS Test and Trace system for England and have claimed testing capacity is increasing. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""The government has been consistently increasing testing capacity, but also laboratory capacity."" She is correct that government data shows that both testing capacity and laboratory capacity have increased considerably since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there has been a sizeable gap between how many tests labs are able to process (""capacity"") and the number of tests actually processed. Read more on this and other claims made by the governmenthere. Many adults are drinking more since the coronavirus pandemic began,data suggests,external. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is warning that addiction services in England could struggle to cope with the ""soaring"" numbers of people misusing alcohol. The college estimates that in June, more than 8.4m people in England were drinking at higher-risk levels, up from 4.8m in February. It says deep cuts made to addiction services could mean patients will miss out on life-saving care. Read more. Yogita LimayeMumbai correspondent, BBC News India has now recorded more than five million confirmed cases of coronavirus. It is the second worst affected country in the world, but the virus is spreading much faster there than in the US, which is in the top spot. More than 82,000 people have died with the virus in India, with more than 1,000 dying each day. Hospitals in many cities are running out of intensive
care bedsand oxygen supplies. But the government has been pointing out that the number
of Indians dying with Covid-19 relative to the size of its population is a lot
lower than in other badly hit countries. ""Non-life-sustainingâ businesses were ordered to shut down in Pennsylvania Some of the lockdown provisions put in place by Pennsylvaniaâs Democratic Governor Tom Wolf are unconstitutional, a US federal judge has ruled. Judge William Stickman found in favour of two Republican politicians and several business owners, who said ongoing restrictions threatened livelihoods. He said Governor Wolf did not have the right to infringe civil liberties, even if he was acting with good intentions. Mr Wolf had already lifted some restrictions after infections in Pennsylvania began to fall.They had required people to stay at home, placed limits on the size of indoor and outdoor gatherings and ordered ânon-life-sustainingâ businesses to shut down. The lawsuit is one of hundreds brought across America challenging local lockdown rules. The Wolf administration said it would appeal: âThe actions taken by the administration were mirrored by governors across the country and saved, and continue to save lives in the absence of federal action,"" a spokeswoman for Mr Wolf said. ""This decision is especially worrying as Pennsylvania and the rest of the country are likely to face a challenging time with the possible resurgence of Covid-19 and the flu in the fall and winter,â she added. Another person awaiting test results is Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who will not take part in Prime Minister's Quesions tomorrow as he is ""still awaiting"" a coronavirus test result for a member of his family, a spokesman said. The spokesman said he would remain in self-isolation and deputy leader Angela Rayner would take his place. The Labour leaderhas been self-isolating since Monday, after a member of his household showed symptoms. They were tested the same day. Starmer is not reported to have shown any symptoms himself. Scott said he tried hundreds of times to book a test for his family Schools are back, businesses are reopening and winter bugs are starting to spread - meaning more and more people are asking for a coronavirus test. Scott Vining's daughter fell ill with a temperature on Saturday. By Sunday, the rest of the family, who live near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, had also developed symptoms. ""We've tried hundreds of times,"" he told the BBC about trying to book a test. ""We started to try and book tests for my daughter on Sunday, to no avail, and then we started at 08:00 on Monday morning for us all."" At one point Scott was offered a test in Warwickshire, 65 miles away from his home, through the government website. But by the time he'd entered the details of his family of four, the spaces had disappeared. Scott eventually managed to secure a test for his wife today in Luton. He has since managed to book tests for himself and his children at a separate testing centre, in Bedford. Read more about Scott and other families' experienceshere. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor ""A tricky balancing act"" is how the chancellor himself described to me the next stage of support to an economy that will continue to be affected by the pandemic. He dropped his heaviest hint yet that this will include a new measure or scheme to boost job creation, as the jobless numbers start their inevitable turn upwards. That task, he says, is his ""number one priority"" and he told me on a visit to a pottery factory in Stoke: ""I'm always looking for interesting creative, innovative and effective new ways to support jobs and employment."" What it is not is the extension to the current furlough scheme. The purpose of the visit to the Emma Bridgewater factory was to celebrate the return to work from furlough of its staff. The Treasury calculates that half of those furloughed are now back in their jobs, and the chancellor is adamant that people are ""itching to get back to work"". Read morefrom Faisal here.

Baberghin Suffolk was the only area to not record a new case, according to the latest Public Health England data. It also shows that 510 new cases were recorded inBradfordin the week up to 12 September. Thatâs the equivalent of 94.5 cases per 100,000 people - up from 77.6 in the previous week. Other cities recording sharp increases in their weekly rate include: Liverpool(up from 51.2 to 91.4, with 455 new cases) Leicester(up from 56.7 to 86.4, with 306 new cases) Sunderland(up from 61.9 to 82.5, with 229 new cases) Bradford is among the cities to see a sharp rise in cases Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent The Speaker of the Irish parliament has announced that all members of the cabinet in Dublin have to self-isolate.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst As China celebrates 30 days without any domestic cases of
Covid-19, Chinaâs top health body says it is now going to roll out counselling
to people who have recovered from Covid-19. According to the official China Daily,social
workers, volunteers and therapists will be made available to former patients,external,
to help understand any physical, mental or financial help they might
need. Their data will be held
on local medical databases, under a system that âemphasises the importance of
protecting their privacyâ. Local health centres will also offer mental health assessments
âbased on informed consent and voluntary participationâ. In China, more than 80,000 people have recovered from Covid-19
since the beginning of the year.Mental health hotlines have been open since as early as January,external. But mental health is a major concern in China. The official Xinhua news agency estimated last year thatone in 10 Chinese people had mental health problems,external. That is 140 million people. People on Chinese social media have spoken often in recent months
about how they have struggled as a result of strict lockdown procedures,
working/studying at home, and finding work. The government is particularly concerned that those who have
recovered have experienced work and social stigma. However, it has urged people
to be transparent if they have any ailments rather than hide their
symptoms and risk the event of another localised outbreak. School attendance figures ""should reassure parents"" about sending their children back to classrooms, Downing Street has said. The first official figures for England,published earlier today, showed 88% of pupils went back for the autumn term. This is a higher absence rate than the usual figure of about 5% but it is not broken down to show whether pupils were at home because of Covid-19 outbreaks. The prime minister's spokesman said the government acknowledged it may take time for some parents to feel confident enough to send their children back to school and fines would only be used ""as a last resort, where there's no valid reason for absence"". It is understood no fines have been issued since schools returned. BBC Radio 5 Live There are a lot of reports of people struggling to get a coronavirus test. Gaynor Hope in south west London got her 16-year-old son a test after four days of trying. But test site workers were only able to grant him one by using a postcode from over 500 miles away. âWe drove up to the test centre, no queue, two other carsâ¦ but the steward said we had to use an Aberdeen postcode to get a QR code for a testâ, she told BBC Radio 5 Live. âThey were on their handheld devices, searching for any postcode they could useâ¦ itâs just so frustrating.â Gaynorâs MP, Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson,asked the health secretary about this issue in Parliament this afternoon,external. The number of patients in mechanical ventilation beds across the UK has passed 100 for the first time in nearly two months There were 106 patients on ventilation in the UK on Monday - the first time the figure has been over 100 since 24 July. UK-wide figures for today are yet to be published but there were 101 patients on ventilation in England on Tuesday. Jewish pilgrims sleep at the border point Hundreds of Hasidic Jews who set
off on a pilgrimage to Ukraine are stranded on the Ukraine-Belarus border because of coronavirus restrictions. They want to get to the central Ukrainian town of Uman for the Jewish New Year, which is being celebrated at the weekend, and visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman, who revived the
Hasidic movement in the 19th Century. One described the conditions at the border: ""I spent the night on the bus, but most of them [other pilgrims] spent the
night right on the road, some gathered branches in the forest
and lit fires,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""We have no food or water, we have children with
us, about 100 children,"" he added. Ukraine has imposed a ban on the entry of foreigners from the end of August till the end of September because of the pandemic.

"This year's nominees are (clockwise from top left): Tsitsi Dangarembga, Avni Doshi, Maaza Mengiste, Douglas Stuart, Diane Cook and Brandon Taylor Four debut novels have been included on the shortlist for this year's Booker Prize, but two-time winner Hilary Mantel has missed out. Mantel had been tipped for a record third win for The Mirror and the Light. Both previous titles in her trilogy about the life of Thomas Cromwell, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, had won. This year's nominees are Diane Cook, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Avni Doshi, Maaza Mengiste, Douglas Stuart and Brandon Taylor. All are based outside the UK. The Booker Prize, the UK's most prestigious literary award, is open to any novel written in English by an author of any nationality. Commenting on Mantel's omission, judge Lee Child said: ""We thought it was an absolutely wonderful novel, no question about it... but there were books that were better, that's all I can say personally."" Hilary Mantel's The Mirror and the Light was the final instalment in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy The topics covered by the six nominees are wide-ranging, including stories about climate change, the hardship of life in Zimbabwe, dementia, and the women soldiers of 1935 Ethiopia. ""The shortlist of six came together unexpectedly, voices and characters resonating with us all even when very different,"" said Margaret Busby, chair of this year's judges. ""We are delighted to help disseminate these chronicles of creative humanity to a global audience."" Diane Cook - The New Wilderness Tsitsi Dangarembga - This Mournable Body Avni Doshi - Burnt Sugar Maaza Mengiste -The Shadow King Douglas Stuart - Shuggie Bain Brandon Taylor - Real Life The winner will be announced on 17 November. Last year saw Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo share the Â£50,000 prize, breaking the Booker's own 1992 rule of awarding it to only one author. By Rebecca Jones, BBC arts correspondent Let's talk about what IS on the list before discussing what is not. With promotional literary events postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic and 600 books published on a single day in September, prizes like the Booker provide much-needed attention, especially for first-time novelists. This shortlist rewards four impressive debuts and introduces readers to new and diverse voices, from as far afield as India, Ethiopia and Scotland - although five of the six authors were either born or now live in America. The subjects covered are broad-ranging. Climate change, dementia, racism and homophobia all feature. Heavy-going? Occasionally yes, but these six novels all provide their own rewards. It is, undoubtedly, a fresh and exciting list. But I am surprised there was no room for Hilary Mantel. While The Mirror and the Light might not be the best book in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy, it is still a tour de force and the ending stays with you long after you have finished the final page. And I am astonished my personal favourite, Apeirogon by Colum McCann, did not make the cut. Hugely ambitious, it expands the very notion of the novel. I loved it. Read it anyway. Here's some more information about this year's nominees and their books: Debut US novelist Diane Cook lives in Brooklyn and has established herself as an accomplished short-story writer. She is a former producer for the radio show This American Life. Her first novel tells the story of Bea and her five-year-old daughter, Agnes, who is wasting away in the smog and pollution of the metropolis they call home. To survive is to escape as they join a group of nomadic hunter gatherers. They slowly learn how to survive but the process creates an unexpected, troubling shift in their relationship. Cook is currently writing a screenplay based on the novel and Warner Bros Television has also acquired the rights to develop it as a television series. Tsitsi Dangarembga is a filmmaker and playwright. She was recently arrested in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, during a peaceful protest against government corruption. She is due to be in court on 18 September. English PEN and PEN International are calling for the immediate dropping of all charges. This Mournable Body is the third book in a trilogy following Nervous Conditions (1988) -  winner of the Commonwealth Writers' Prize - and The Book of Not (2006). Returning to the protagonist of her first novel, Dangarembga tells the story of one young girl living in a run-down hostel in Harare. She's left her dead-end job and is struggling to forge a new life for herself but at every turn is thwarted, which drives her to breaking point. Avni Doshi is a debut novelist who was born in New Jersey and is currently based in Dubai. Burnt Sugar tells the story of the shifting power dynamics in a mother-daughter relationship when the parent, who previously enjoyed a wild life, is forced to let her child look after her as she gets older. It's both a love story and a story about betrayal, as well as a look at the nature of false memory and how it affects our closest relationships. Maaza Mengiste was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and now lives in New York. Her first novel was Beneath the Lion's Gaze, which was named one of The Guardian's 10 best contemporary African books. The Shadow King is about an orphan girl named Hirut living in Ethiopia in 1935 amid the threat of invasion by Mussolini. When the Ethiopian emperor goes into exile, Hirut disguises a peasant as him while she becomes his guard - only to find herself having to fight her own personal, unexpected war. Douglas Stuart grew up in Glasgow and now lives in New York, which he first made home in order to start his career in fashion design. He says the 1994 Booker winner How Late It Was, How Late by James Kelman changed his life as it was one of the first times he saw his people and dialect on the page. For his first move into novel writing, Stuart has taken that inspiration to write a story set in a poverty-stricken Glasgow. Here we follow Agnes Bain, who is descending into despair and alcoholism after the breakdown of her marriage. All but one of her children have been driven away by her deterioration, and that child Shuggie struggles to support his mother while suffering huge personal problems of his own. Brandon Taylor hails from Alabama. He is the senior editor of Electric Literature's Recommended Reading and a staff writer at Literary Hub. For his debut novel, Taylor tells the story of the biochemistry student Wallace, who after weeks of tireless lab work has to deal with its destruction by a torrid storm. But weather disasters are shown to be the least of Wallace's troubles. He's isolated himself from his friends as a defence mechanism against his painful past. But now he finds that history coming back to haunt him. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external. If you have a story suggestion emailentertainment.news@bbc.co.uk,external.

"John Boyega said the original advert ""celebrated my personal story"" John Boyega has resigned as global ambassador for perfume brand Jo Malone after he was replaced in an ad he made for them by a Chinese actor. The Star Wars actor made the personal video in his home city of London, but it was re-shot for the Chinese market. The company apologisedfor what it described as a ""misstep"" that caused ""offence"". However, Boyega has said Jo Malone was ""wrong"" to have used another actor ""without my consent or prior notice"".

"This video can not be played Priti Patel challenged on coronavirus testing delays A lack of coronavirus tests for NHS staff is leading to staff absences and services being put at risk, hospital bosses have warned. NHS Providers, which represents English hospital trusts, said staff are having to self-isolate because they cannot get tests for themselves or family members. It comes after widespread reports ofpeople struggling to get tested. The home secretary said the government was ""surging capacity"" where it was needed. The government's testing system - part of its test, track and trace operation which Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpromised would be ""world-beating""- has faced criticism in recent weeks. An increase in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with some people beingdirected to test sites hundreds of milesfrom their homes. Meanwhile, there have been fewer than 100 Covid-19 deaths in a week in the UK for the first time since March, according to Office for National Statistics figures. There were 8,996 deaths were registered in the UK in the week of 4 September - 83 of those deaths mentioned coronavirus, the lowest figure since the week of 13 March. How do I get a coronavirus test? Scotland: Why is there a test results backlog? 18,000 Covid-19 test results put online by mistake Motorists have been collecting tests from a centre set up in a park in London Around 220,000 tests are processed each day, according togovernment figures released last week,external, with a testing capacity of more than 350,000 - which includes swab tests and antibody tests. The aim is to increase that to 500,000 a day by the end of October. Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast said: ""I haven't said there's a shortage of tests, what I have said is that we're surging capacity in areas where we've had local lockdowns. ""Clearly there is much more work that needs to be undertaken with Public Health England and the actual public health bodies in those particular local areas, and as a government obviously we work with Public Health England to surge where there is demand in local hotspot areas."" Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there had been ""challenges in access to tests"" but said ""the vast majority of people get their tests rapidly and close to home"". Hesuggested demand from people who did not have symptomswas partly to blame for the shortages. NHS Providers said hospitals in London, Bristol and Leeds had raised concerns over the weekend about staff absences because of a lack of testing. Chris Hopson, NHS Providers chief executive, said it was ""clear"" there were capacity problems. ""It's not just access for tests for staff members themselves, it's also access for their family members as NHS workers have to self-isolate if their family members are unable to confirm if they have Covid-19 or not. ""The problem is that NHS trusts are working in the dark - they don't know why these shortages are occurring, how long they are likely to last, how geographically widespread they are likely to be and what priority will be given to healthcare workers and their families in accessing scarce tests."" YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? Mr Hopson said trusts need to know more detail so they can plan accordingly, for example by creating their own testing facilities. He said patients who are due to come in for treatment should also be prioritised for tests. Some people say they booked tests online only to be turned away from testing centres because they were not sent a QR code - a barcode that can be scanned on a smartphone. One doctor working in a coronavirus hotspot said she applied for a test for herself and her partner after they developed coughs and fevers. After refreshing the website for five hours, she managed to get an appointment but on arrival was told no booking had been made. She had taken screenshots of a confirmation code but was not sent a QR code to scan. ""I showed the screenshots but I was told that the appointments weren't happening,"" she said. ""I have to say I burst into tears. I was meant to be seeing patients and I feel guilty.""

After hours of trying, he had ""eventually"" booked at a site about 50 miles away and been sent a confirmation but no QR code. And on arrival at the testing site, he had been told he could not have a test. ""I was told, 'There is nothing we can do,' at first,"" he said. Eventually, he applied for the first testing appointment he could find anywhere in the country - in this case, about 500 miles away in Dundee - and managed to get a QR code. By Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter NHS Providers said the lack of testing was also hindering preparations for the winter, when hospitals could become busier due to Covid-19 and seasonal flu. Dr Rachel Ward, a GP in Newbury, told BBC Breakfast she was seeing a lot of patients who were struggling to get tests, saying a lot of families were ""at the end of their tether"" as it was ""very stressful when you are faced with two weeks off work"". She said if the staff at her practice were unable to get tests and had to self-isolate it would have a ""huge impact"" on patients as some of their healthcare workers are booked in to administer 100 flu jabs in a day. Shila Rawson, from Leicestershire, told the BBC she has been unable to get a test for her daughter, Leah, who has been displaying symptoms of Covid-19 since Sunday. She said she was told by a 111 clinician, who was unable to arrange a test, ""don't be afraid to call 999 if your daughter's lips turns blue and she has severe difficulty with breathing"". ""I read that as wait and watch until our daughter is near enough to intensive care,"" she said. ""And that is just not acceptable at any level."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check looks at why testing matters Prof Alan McNally, director of the institute of microbiology and infection at the University of Birmingham, who helped set up one testing centre - the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab - told BBC Breakfast there was ""a perfect storm of events that have come together to almost essentially crash the testing system"". Asked about the situation in Birmingham, wherenew lockdown measures have come into force, he said it was ""the exact same as we're hearing in other parts of the country... lots of people struggling to get tests and no real quantity of information on why that's the case"". One professor of medicine who has been advising the government has said that a ""second wave"" of Covid-19 has led to a surge in demand for tests. Sir John Bell, of Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think what has been underestimated was the speed at which the second wave would arrive, but also the pressure put on the system from children returning to school."" Meanwhile, the chairman of the British Medical Association has said the government should focus on the current testing system - rather than its ""Operation Moonshot"" plan which aims to see millions of tests processed every day by using a new type of test which is not yet rolled out. ""Down here on planet Earth, we need a fit for purpose test and trace system in the here and now with capacity, agility and accessibility that doesn't require 100-mile journeys that disadvantage some of the most vulnerable,"" the BMA's Dr Chaand Nagpaul is expected to say in a speech later on Tuesday. Mr Johnsonpreviously saida mass-testing programme could be ready by the spring and could help the UK to avoid a second national lockdown. MINDFUL ESCAPES:Why is breathing so important?

"Charlie Elphicke entered Southwark Crown Court alone Ex-Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke has been jailed for two years for sexually assaulting two women. Elphicke, 49, the former MP for Dover, was convicted of groping the women in similar situations, nine years apart. He denied the charges,but was found guiltyof one count of sexual assault in 2007 and two further counts in 2016, after a trial at Southwark Crown Court. The judge told Elphicke he was a ""sexual predator who used your success and respectability as a cover"". Within minutes of his jailing, Elphicke confirmed he would appeal against his conviction, arguing he had not had a ""fair trial"". Mrs Justice Whipple said Elphicke's denials had left his victims faced with the ordeal of giving evidence in court. ""They told the truth, and you told a pack of lies - not only to the jury, but your wife, the whips and the police,"" she told him during the sentencing hearing. Despite the fact the defendant's wife Natalie - the current Dover MP - ended their marriage when he was convicted in July, she agreed he had not had a fair trial and confirmed she would support his appeal. Charlie Elphicke's wife Natalie, the MP for Dover, supported him during the trial Before Elphicke was sentenced, the court heard victim impact statements from both of the women he attacked. His first victim, who was attacked at the then MP's London home in 2007, said his actions had had a ""lasting impact"" on her life, leaving her cautious of being around men. He had forced the woman on to a sofa and groped her breast while trying to kiss her, before chasing her and chanting ""I'm a naughty Tory"", his trial had heard. The second victim, a parliamentary worker aged in her 20s, said the assaults in 2016 left her with a feeling of ""fear and helplessness"". ""He stole a large part of my self-worth and self-esteem,"" she said in a statement read to the court. Elphicke sexually assaulted her twice, the first involving him attempting to kiss her and groping her breast. In the second assault several weeks later, he ran his hand up the inside of her thigh towards her groin. Why did it take so long to bring ex-MP to justice? Ian Winter QC, defending, had argued Elphicke should not be jailed because he had ""fully and completely"" learned his lesson. ""Shortly, Mr Elphicke's descent into total disgrace will be complete,"" Mr Winter said. As well as his marriage ending he is estranged from his daughter as a result of the conviction, he added. ""The only further degradation would be to lose his liberty,"" Mr Winter said. Elphicke had come to court with 34 character witnesses, including from some ""serving members of parliament,"" Mr Winter added. The names of the MPs were not disclosed in court. Mrs Justice Whipple said she ""considered carefully"" whether the sentence should be suspended. ""[But] bearing in mind the gross breach of your position of power... I am satisfied that appropriate punishment can only be achieved by immediate custody,"" she said. However, a spokesman for Elphicke said his lawyers had begun an attempt to overturn the conviction. ""I know that I am innocent of any criminal wrongdoing and will continue to fight to clear my name,"" Elphicke said in a statement. Mrs Elphicke confirmed she supported an appeal against conviction and ""today's excessive sentence,"" adding that ""the court seems to be on a bit of a mission"". There was ""no doubt that Charlie behaved badly,"" but he had been denied a fair trial, she said. He was suspended by the Conservatives when ""serious allegations"" were passed to police in November 2017, butthe whip was restored ahead of a confidence vote against then-Prime Minister Theresa Mayin 2018. He was again suspended after being charged with the three counts of sexual assault on 22 July 2019. Ex-MP guilty of sexual assaults Why did it take so long to bring ex-MP to justice?

"Carole Baskin runs the Big Cat Rescue sanctuary Tiger King's Carole Baskin's debut on Dancing With The Stars was overshadowed by an advert shown in the break.

In the short film the eldest daughter Donna says: ""We need to know what happened to our father."" The family lawyer John Phillips also speaks and specifically names Carole Baskin. ""Don Lewis mysteriously disappeared in 1997, his family deserves answers, they deserve justice. Do you know who did this or if Carole Baskin was involved?"" he asks.

"Gary Lineker and Zoe Ball are now the highest earners on the star salaries list Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has agreed a Â£400,000 pay cut, the BBC has revealed as it publishes the latest list of its best-paid presenters. Lineker was the highest-earning star with an unchanged salary of Â£1.75m in the 2019/20 financial year. But he has since signed a new contract, which will see that fee cut by 23%. That means he could earn less than Zoe Ball next year. The Radio 2 presenter has seen her pay rise by Â£1m since taking over the breakfast show in 2019. Fiona Bruce and Lauren Laverne have also moved into the top 10 of the highest-paid stars, which features four women for the first time. Vanessa Feltz is also among the top earners,the corporation's annual report shows,external. However, many stars do not appear on the list because the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios, does not have to publish its talent spend. Left to right: Vanessa Feltz, Lauren Laverne and Fiona Bruce are also in the top 10 All 10 of the top-earning presenters on this year's list are white, although the BBC's director general Tim Davie said 18% of those making more than Â£150,000 were from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, up from 12% four years ago. ""We made good progress, if you look across the industry we're in a good place, but we've got work to do,"" Mr Davie said. And while 26.5% of actors and presenters were from BAME backgrounds, it was a different story behind the camera, with 9.8% of production staff from ethnic minorities. The report also showed 12.3% of BBC leaders were BAME, below its 15% target for 2020. George Alagiah is the highest-paid person of colour on the list Lineker's new salary will be published on next year's list. Director general Tim Davie described the former England player as a brilliant broadcaster and said his new five-year deal was a great example of the ""best talent and the best value"". ""And before you ask, Gary knows his responsibility to the BBC in terms of his use of social media,"" Mr Davie added, referring to social media rules for BBC staff and presenters that are expected to be announced soon. Lineker, a prolific tweeter who frequently discusses his political views online,said the BBC,external""recognise that I tweet carefully and will continue to do so"", and sent a message to ""the haters"" on Twitter.

Gary Lineker calls for 'voluntary' licence fee 'I'm kind of the whipping boy for the BBC' The stars of some of the BBC's biggest programmes - like Top Gear and Doctor Who - are absent from the list because they are made by BBC Studios. Ball's Strictly Come Dancing spin-off It Takes Two is produced by the commercial arm, and so is not included. But her pay has risen because this is her first full year since taking over from Chris Evans on Radio 2. Last year, the top earners included three women - Ball, Feltz and Claudia Winkleman. Overall, the BBC's total salary bill for on-air talent in 2019/20 rose by Â£1m to Â£144.6m,while salaries for the BBC's executive committee rose from Â£4.95m to Â£5.41m. Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said the overall rise in pay for on-air talent was ""concerning"". He said: ""Despite Gary Lineker's pay cut, when millions of pensioners are having to find extra cash to pay for the BBC and services they depend on, it's concerning to see not only has the bill for on-air talent has grown by more than Â£1m but that more than 100 senior executives are paid over Â£150,000 a year - in many cases considerably more than that."" The overall gender pay gap at the BBC has fallen from 6.7% to 6.2%. Previous director general Tony Hall had pledged to close the gender pay gap by 2020. Mr Davie said that ""was a very aggressive target,"" adding: ""We can be proud of our progress but we must go further."" He said he wanted to increase the number of women across leadership ranks, where the figure currently stands at 45%, short of the 50% target. ""It's about the leaders, not talk but action,"" he said. There are ""a small number of historic equal pay cases"" to be resolved, the report said. This annual report contains plenty of complex messages, but is likely still to lead to simple and negative headlines for the BBC. The list of salaries for on-air broadcasters - which includes me - reflects three years of reforms. As part of those reforms, many broadcasters - particularly but not exclusively men - either took significant pay cuts (Huw Edwards, Jeremy Vine etc) or left the BBC (Chris Evans, John Humphrys leaving Today, Eddie Mair). Now, several broadcasters - particularly but not exclusively women - have had pay rises. Crucially, the pay rises for these female broadcasters (Zoe Ball, Fiona Bruce, Lauren Laverne, Emily Maitlis), reflect additional work. The overall rise in pay for those whose salaries are published - around Â£1m - is not, in financial terms, huge, given the number of people to which it pertains, and the salaries themselves. Indeed, it is below inflation, and therefore a cut in real terms. Nevertheless, the optics are bad for the BBC. Complexity doesn't cut through in stories about high pay. The simple fact is, in a time of immense hardship across the country, with so many people redundant or furloughed and suffering, these huge salaries (and their modest overall increase) will strike many licence fee payers as disgraceful. The other big story is the BBC's finances. In the medium-term, they are badly strained. It is striking that by the end of next year, the BBC will have delivered around Â£800m in savings in just five years. But the fact that the licence fee didn't rise with inflation between 2010 and 2017, and the Â£125m hit (at least) from the coronavirus pandemic, are a huge injury to the bottom line for the coming year. And that's before you even consider whether a generation who give so much time to TikTok, YouTube and WhatsApp feel they need to pay for a TV licence. Licence fee income dropped by Â£170m to Â£3.52bn in 2019/20, partly due to evasion. Overall, the BBC's overall income was down by Â£119m. There was growth in commercial income from BBC Studios, and the corporation's chairman Sir David Clementi said a drive to increase such revenue would be ""even more pressing"" because there will be ""major financial pressures on the BBC"" in the coming years. The coronavirus pandemic means the organisation has faced ""significant challenges"" and will have to find extra savings on top of those already planned. The BBC has already saved Â£618m since 2016/17, and that figure is expected to rise above Â£800m by the end of the current financial year, the report said.

"Polly has lived in a small campervan for more than a year ""I don't want to live like this, no-one should live like this - but I don't have any options,"" says Polly Richardson who finds herself at the sharp end of the lack of affordable homes in England. For more than a year, she has lived out of a small camper van. ""This is my home. I've two sets of clothes in a box. I've got my cups and saucers in this drawer, my pans under this bed, and I have a little camping cooker. ""Winter time was horrendous because there was no heating."" The 59-year-old grandmother of four from East Yorkshire is one of half-a-million households that aren't even counted as waiting for a council or housing association property, according to the National Housing Federation. New research commissioned by the Federation from Heriot-Watt University says the real number of people in England waiting for such homes is 3.8 million, representing 1.6 million households, or 500,000 more than is indicated by official government data. ""I've got belongings in people's garages,"" says Polly. She spent years working as a retail manager but after taking time off to look after her sick father, and then having a big argument with her sister, she found herself being forced to move into the van in March 2019. ""Without a job, you can't have a house. Without a house, they won't give you a job. I'm hoping somebody out there will give me a job,"" she says. Landlords 'ban' benefits claimants despite ruling Coronavirus: Call to lift benefits to help renters Legal victories over 'No DSS' letting agents The National Housing Federation say 90,000 homes for social rent need to be built each year for the next decade to meet demand but, according to official figures, just 6,338 such homes were completed in 2018-19, down 84% since 2010-11. The main advantage of social housing - where either the local council or a housing association are the landlord - is that it's more affordable than private rented accommodation, typically around 50% of market rents, and usually offers a more secure tenancy. ""What we are seeing is an escalating need for social housing and a lack of supply,"" says Kate Henderson, chief executive of the National Housing Federation. ""Investing in social housing would boost the economy, it would create thousands of jobs, it would support supply chains in the construction industry and it would provide better, more secure, safe housing for people in need."" The lack of suitable properties leaves large numbers of families living in overcrowded accommodation. Abigail McManus, a 27-year-old single mother lives in a two-bedroom flat in Leeds with her three young children - two daughters aged six and two and a little boy who's five months old. Leaving her house is a daily grind as she struggles to manoeuvre her double buggy down the stairs. Abigail has been bidding weekly for a three-bedroomed ground floor property for years, without success. She says the council are encouraging her to search further afield to increase her chances being allocated somewhere suitable to live. But she says: ""My whole family live on this estate, so I'd like to try and stay as close as possible. ""As a single parent, who doesn't drive, it would be hard for me to get anywhere and I'd feel more isolated than I already do, if I move too far from this area."" Mum of three Abigail McManus struggles to get her double buggy into her flat When she was prime minister, Theresa May altered the way in which councils could use funding to allow them to build more homes. Her government predicted the change would lead to 10,000 new council houses each year, a figure that hasn't been reached since 2013-14. While local authorities believe building that number is possible, experts say the pandemic could create problems in the construction industry. The Ministry of Housing said it ""didn't recognise"" the figures in the new analysis carried out by the National Housing Federation, describing them as a ""major overestimation"". It also highlighted its Â£11.5bn investment in affordable homes, to be spent between 2021 and 2026, some of which will be used on building homes for social rent.

"This video can not be played Priti Patel challenged on coronavirus testing delays A lack of coronavirus tests for NHS staff is leading to staff absences and services being put at risk, hospital bosses have warned. NHS Providers, which represents English hospital trusts, said staff are having to self-isolate because they cannot get tests for themselves or family members. It comes after widespread reports ofpeople struggling to get tested. The home secretary said the government was ""surging capacity"" where it was needed. The government's testing system - part of its test, track and trace operation which Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpromised would be ""world-beating""- has faced criticism in recent weeks. An increase in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with some people beingdirected to test sites hundreds of milesfrom their homes. Meanwhile, there have been fewer than 100 Covid-19 deaths in a week in the UK for the first time since March, according to Office for National Statistics figures. There were 8,996 deaths were registered in the UK in the week of 4 September - 83 of those deaths mentioned coronavirus, the lowest figure since the week of 13 March. How do I get a coronavirus test? Scotland: Why is there a test results backlog? 18,000 Covid-19 test results put online by mistake Motorists have been collecting tests from a centre set up in a park in London Around 220,000 tests are processed each day, according togovernment figures released last week,external, with a testing capacity of more than 350,000 - which includes swab tests and antibody tests. The aim is to increase that to 500,000 a day by the end of October. Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast said: ""I haven't said there's a shortage of tests, what I have said is that we're surging capacity in areas where we've had local lockdowns. ""Clearly there is much more work that needs to be undertaken with Public Health England and the actual public health bodies in those particular local areas, and as a government obviously we work with Public Health England to surge where there is demand in local hotspot areas."" Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there had been ""challenges in access to tests"" but said ""the vast majority of people get their tests rapidly and close to home"". Hesuggested demand from people who did not have symptomswas partly to blame for the shortages. NHS Providers said hospitals in London, Bristol and Leeds had raised concerns over the weekend about staff absences because of a lack of testing. Chris Hopson, NHS Providers chief executive, said it was ""clear"" there were capacity problems. ""It's not just access for tests for staff members themselves, it's also access for their family members as NHS workers have to self-isolate if their family members are unable to confirm if they have Covid-19 or not. ""The problem is that NHS trusts are working in the dark - they don't know why these shortages are occurring, how long they are likely to last, how geographically widespread they are likely to be and what priority will be given to healthcare workers and their families in accessing scarce tests.""

FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? Mr Hopson said trusts need to know more detail so they can plan accordingly, for example by creating their own testing facilities. He said patients who are due to come in for treatment should also be prioritised for tests. Some people say they booked tests online only to be turned away from testing centres because they were not sent a QR code - a barcode that can be scanned on a smartphone. One doctor working in a coronavirus hotspot said she applied for a test for herself and her partner after they developed coughs and fevers. After refreshing the website for five hours, she managed to get an appointment but on arrival was told no booking had been made. She had taken screenshots of a confirmation code but was not sent a QR code to scan. ""I showed the screenshots but I was told that the appointments weren't happening,"" she said. ""I have to say I burst into tears. I was meant to be seeing patients and I feel guilty."" This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people trying to get tests at a centre in Oldham A nurse in the South West, whose daughter had a persistent cough and temperature, said he had almost been turned away despite having a test booked. After hours of trying, he had ""eventually"" booked at a site about 50 miles away and been sent a confirmation but no QR code. And on arrival at the testing site, he had been told he could not have a test. ""I was told, 'There is nothing we can do,' at first,"" he said. Eventually, he applied for the first testing appointment he could find anywhere in the country - in this case, about 500 miles away in Dundee - and managed to get a QR code. By Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter NHS Providers said the lack of testing was also hindering preparations for the winter, when hospitals could become busier due to Covid-19 and seasonal flu. Dr Rachel Ward, a GP in Newbury, told BBC Breakfast she was seeing a lot of patients who were struggling to get tests, saying a lot of families were ""at the end of their tether"" as it was ""very stressful when you are faced with two weeks off work"". She said if the staff at her practice were unable to get tests and had to self-isolate it would have a ""huge impact"" on patients as some of their healthcare workers are booked in to administer 100 flu jabs in a day. Shila Rawson, from Leicestershire, told the BBC she has been unable to get a test for her daughter, Leah, who has been displaying symptoms of Covid-19 since Sunday. She said she was told by a 111 clinician, who was unable to arrange a test, ""don't be afraid to call 999 if your daughter's lips turns blue and she has severe difficulty with breathing"". ""I read that as wait and watch until our daughter is near enough to intensive care,"" she said. ""And that is just not acceptable at any level."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check looks at why testing matters Prof Alan McNally, director of the institute of microbiology and infection at the University of Birmingham, who helped set up one testing centre - the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab - told BBC Breakfast there was ""a perfect storm of events that have come together to almost essentially crash the testing system"". Asked about the situation in Birmingham, wherenew lockdown measures have come into force, he said it was ""the exact same as we're hearing in other parts of the country... lots of people struggling to get tests and no real quantity of information on why that's the case"". One professor of medicine who has been advising the government has said that a ""second wave"" of Covid-19 has led to a surge in demand for tests. Sir John Bell, of Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think what has been underestimated was the speed at which the second wave would arrive, but also the pressure put on the system from children returning to school."" Meanwhile, the chairman of the British Medical Association has said the government should focus on the current testing system - rather than its ""Operation Moonshot"" plan which aims to see millions of tests processed every day by using a new type of test which is not yet rolled out. ""Down here on planet Earth, we need a fit for purpose test and trace system in the here and now with capacity, agility and accessibility that doesn't require 100-mile journeys that disadvantage some of the most vulnerable,"" the BMA's Dr Chaand Nagpaul is expected to say in a speech later on Tuesday. Mr Johnsonpreviously saida mass-testing programme could be ready by the spring and could help the UK to avoid a second national lockdown. MINDFUL ESCAPES:Why is breathing so important?

"This video can not be played Trump: ""It'll start getting cooler"" US President Donald Trump has dismissed concerns over climate change on a visit to fire-ravaged California, telling an official ""I don't think science knows"" about global warming. ""It'll start getting cooler, you just watch,"" Mr Trump said after he was urged not to ""ignore the science"". Blazes in several states have burned vast areas of land and killed at least 36 people since early August. Scientists say human activities have driven up global temperatures. But Mr Trump has blamed poor forest management for the fires that have burned almost 2 million hectares (5 million acres) of land in California, Oregon and Washington state. During his visit to the US West Coast, Mr Trump - who hasoften denied climate change- repeated his argument on forest management as he met Californian officials involved in the battle against the wildfires. A really simple guide to climate change Is Trump right about the cause of US wildfires? Climate change takes centre stage in presidential campaign Earlier on Monday, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called Mr Trump ""a climate arsonist"". In 2018,the president criticised California's forest management, pointing to Finland, where he said they raked and cleared the forests to prevent fires. When asked by a reporter whether climate change was a factor in the massive wildfires, Mr Trump responded: ""I think this is more of a management situation."" He also claimed that other countries had not dealt with the same level of forest fires, despite major conflagrations in Australia and the Amazon rainforest in recent years that experts attributed to the changing climate. This video can not be played Drone footage shows Oregon town covered in flame retardant ""They don't have problems like this,"" he said. ""They have very explosive trees, but they don't have problems like this."" He added: ""When you get into climate change, well is India going to change its ways? And is China going to change its ways? And Russia? Is Russia going to change its ways?"" Mr Trump has previously called climate change ""mythical"", ""non-existent"", or ""an expensive hoax""- but has also described it as a ""serious subject"". He pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, which committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels. It's a path well worn by President Trump, especially in relation to climate change - other countries are taking advantage of the US and not doing their fair share. But the irony is that the absence of the US from the Paris agreement is making a changing of the ways much harder to achieve. In the Paris pact, China committed to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 at the latest - and is on course to do that. India agreed to reduce the intensity of its emissions by 2030, and significantly increase renewables as part of the energy mix. Last year, India's spending on solar energy eclipsed coal fired power for the first time. Russia has pledged to cut carbon by up to 30% of 1990 levels by 2030. So all these countries have undertaken and are set to meet their commitments. Where the president might have a point though, is in the scale of these countries' efforts, which have all been rated as ""highly insufficient"" if the world is to avoid dangerous warming. However, the real strength of the Paris agreement was to get every country to commit to doing something, however paltry, and then use peer pressure to ratchet up those commitments over time. Strong winds and low humidity have been hampering efforts to keep the fires under control. Authorities in California, where 25 people have died since 15 August, report that firefighters are working to tackle ""hot spots"" to allow some residents to return to several neighbourhoods in areas near San Francisco. State officials have also warned that while storms forecast for later in the week could bring much-needed rainfall, they could also bring more lightning. Thousands of homes and other properties have been destroyed in California, Oregon and Washington state, and large areas of land have been covered with ash. This video can not be played Drone footage shows homes completely wiped out by wildfires At least 10 people have been killed in Oregon in the past week. Officials have said dozens of people are missing and warned that the death toll could rise. Police in Oregon have set up the state's first ever mobile mortuary,external, the Oregonian newspaper reports. The report adds that a separate facility is being created to allow the families of those reported missing to undergo DNA testing to help with the identification process. One person has died in Washington, where there were five large fires on Sunday. Speaking at a meeting with Mr Trump on Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom acknowledged that ""we have not done justice on our forest management"", but he said that more than half of the land in California was under federal, not state control. The state itself owns just three per cent, with the rest owned by private individuals or companies or Native American groups. But he echoed his own statement from Friday thatthe fires showed the debate about climate change was ""over"". ""The hots are getting hotter, the dries are getting drier,"" he said. ""We submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident: that climate change is real and that is exacerbating this."" In pictures: Oregon fires force thousands to flee Smoke from California wildfires turns skies orange False claims about Oregon fires spread online A really simple guide to climate change Oregon Governor Kate Brown has said her state is facing ""the perfect firestorm"" and called the moment ""truly the bellwether for climate change on the West Coast"". ""And this is a wake-up call for all of us that we have got to do everything in our power to tackle climate change,"" she said. Six of the 20 largest fires on record in California have all occurred this year Washington Governor Jay Inslee described the situation as ""apocalyptic"" and condemned Mr Trump's stance on the climate. Nine of the world's 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the UN warned this week that the five years from 2016 until this year will very probably be the hottest such period yet recorded. Both Oregon and California have warmed by more than 1C since 1900. This video can not be played Five ways that show the scale of California's 2020 wildfires The sustained warmth has seen six of the 20 largest fires on record in California all occur this year. In Oregon, the spate of fires burned almost twice the amount of average annual losses in a week. In California, a prolonged drought over the past decade has killed millions of trees, turning them into potent fuel for the fires. Mountain regions that are normally cooler and wetter have dried out more rapidly in the summer, adding to the potential fuel load.

"John Boyega said the original advert ""celebrated my personal story"" John Boyega has resigned as global ambassador for perfume brand Jo Malone after he was replaced in an ad he made for them by a Chinese actor. The Star Wars actor made the personal video in his home city of London, but it was re-shot for the Chinese market. The company apologisedfor what it described as a ""misstep"" that caused ""offence"". However, Boyega has said Jo Malone was ""wrong"" to have used another actor ""without my consent or prior notice"". Writing on Twitter, the British star said while he accepted that companies would use different representatives around the world, ""dismissively trading out one's culture this way is not something I can condone"".

""The film celebrated my personal story - showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family,"" he added. ""It's back to back but I assure you this will be dealt with swiftly. I don't have time for nonsense. We press on and strong. Stay blessed people."" The recreated advert largely followed the same script, but featured Chinese star Liu Haoran instead of Boyega. The original version, titled London Gent, showed Boyega hanging out with friends and family in Peckham, where he grew up. They were also removed for Chinese audiences. This video can not be played Spot the difference: John Boyega advert and the Chinese version Jo Malone, owned by Estee Lauder, has since removed the advert from its campaign in China. ""We deeply apologise for what, on our end, was a mistake in the local execution of the John Boyega campaign,"" they said in statement on Monday. Boyega's sister Grace posted the Chinese version of the advert,externalin a Twitter response. In a statement toThe Hollywood Reporter,external, Jo Malone London said: ""John is a tremendous artist with great personal vision and direction. The concept for the film was based on John's personal experiences and should not have been replicated. ""While we immediately took action and removed the local version of the campaign, we recognise that this was painful and that offence was caused,"" it added. ""We respect John, and support our partners and fans globally. We are taking this misstep very seriously and we are working together as a brand to do better moving forward."" It's not the first time Boyega has fallen foul of editing for the Chinese market.

"Addiction services in England could struggle to cope with ""soaring"" numbers of people misusing alcohol, the Royal College of Psychiatrists is warning. Many adults are drinking more since the coronavirus pandemic began,data shows,external. The college estimates that in June, more than 8.4m people in England were drinking at higher-risk levels, up from 4.8m in February. It says deep cuts made to addiction services could mean patients will miss out on life-saving care. 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' 'Tackle harmful lockdown drinking' The rise in risky drinking comes at a time when more people addicted to opiates are seeking help from addiction services, says the college, referring to National Drug Treatment Monitoring System statistics showing 3,459 new adult cases in April - up 20% from 2,947 in the same month the previous year. Check how much you are drinking,external Guidelines advise people drink no more than 14 units of alcohol (equivalent to six large glasses of wine or six pints of beer) a week, spreading consumption over three days or more. Drinking too much can damage your liver and increases the risk of other health conditions such as heart disease and stroke. People with alcohol use disorder are more likely to develop serious complications if they catch Covid-19. The college is asking the government to invest millions more in addiction services. Prof Julia Sinclair, chair of the college's addictions faculty, said: ""Covid-19 has shown just how stretched, under-resourced and ill-equipped addiction services are to treat the growing numbers of vulnerable people living with this complex illness. ""There are now only five NHS inpatient units in the country, and no resource anywhere in my region to admit people who are alcohol dependent with co-existing mental illness. ""Drug-related deaths and alcohol-related hospital admissions were already at all-time highs before Covid-19. I fear that unless the government acts quickly we will see these numbers rise exponentially."" Laura Bunt from the drug, alcohol and mental health charityWe Are With You,externalsaid: ""Social isolation and a lack of a human connection is a big factor behind why some people turn to alcohol as a coping mechanism, so clearly the pandemic continues to be really tough for many people. ""When you consider that the UK had some of the highest levels of alcohol-related harms in Europe even before the lockdown in March, the need for government action now is clear."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We have increased their funding this year, providing over Â£3.2 billion to spend on public health services like addiction. ""We support evidence-based approaches to reduce the health-related harms of drug misuse and, as part of our NHS Long Term Plan, alcohol care teams will be introduced in hospitals where alcohol-related admissions are high, intervening in 50,000 cases over five years to reduce harm.""

"Polly has lived in a small campervan for more than a year ""I don't want to live like this, no-one should live like this - but I don't have any options,"" says Polly Richardson who finds herself at the sharp end of the lack of affordable homes in England. For more than a year, she has lived out of a small camper van. ""This is my home. I've two sets of clothes in a box. I've got my cups and saucers in this drawer, my pans under this bed, and I have a little camping cooker. ""Winter time was horrendous because there was no heating."" The 59-year-old grandmother of four from East Yorkshire is one of half-a-million households that aren't even counted as waiting for a council or housing association property, according to the National Housing Federation. New research commissioned by the Federation from Heriot-Watt University says the real number of people in England waiting for such homes is 3.8 million, representing 1.6 million households, or 500,000 more than is indicated by official government data. ""I've got belongings in people's garages,"" says Polly. She spent years working as a retail manager but after taking time off to look after her sick father, and then having a big argument with her sister, she found herself being forced to move into the van in March 2019. ""Without a job, you can't have a house. Without a house, they won't give you a job. I'm hoping somebody out there will give me a job,"" she says. Landlords 'ban' benefits claimants despite ruling Coronavirus: Call to lift benefits to help renters Legal victories over 'No DSS' letting agents The National Housing Federation say 90,000 homes for social rent need to be built each year for the next decade to meet demand but, according to official figures, just 6,338 such homes were completed in 2018-19, down 84% since 2010-11. The main advantage of social housing - where either the local council or a housing association are the landlord - is that it's more affordable than private rented accommodation, typically around 50% of market rents, and usually offers a more secure tenancy. ""What we are seeing is an escalating need for social housing and a lack of supply,"" says Kate Henderson, chief executive of the National Housing Federation. ""Investing in social housing would boost the economy, it would create thousands of jobs, it would support supply chains in the construction industry and it would provide better, more secure, safe housing for people in need."" The lack of suitable properties leaves large numbers of families living in overcrowded accommodation. Abigail McManus, a 27-year-old single mother lives in a two-bedroom flat in Leeds with her three young children - two daughters aged six and two and a little boy who's five months old. Leaving her house is a daily grind as she struggles to manoeuvre her double buggy down the stairs. Abigail has been bidding weekly for a three-bedroomed ground floor property for years, without success. She says the council are encouraging her to search further afield to increase her chances being allocated somewhere suitable to live. But she says: ""My whole family live on this estate, so I'd like to try and stay as close as possible. ""As a single parent, who doesn't drive, it would be hard for me to get anywhere and I'd feel more isolated than I already do, if I move too far from this area."" Mum of three Abigail McManus struggles to get her double buggy into her flat When she was prime minister, Theresa May altered the way in which councils could use funding to allow them to build more homes. Her government predicted the change would lead to 10,000 new council houses each year, a figure that hasn't been reached since 2013-14. While local authorities believe building that number is possible, experts say the pandemic could create problems in the construction industry. The Ministry of Housing said it ""didn't recognise"" the figures in the new analysis carried out by the National Housing Federation, describing them as a ""major overestimation"". It also highlighted its Â£11.5bn investment in affordable homes, to be spent between 2021 and 2026, some of which will be used on building homes for social rent.

While local authorities believe building that number is possible, experts say the pandemic could create problems in the construction industry. The Ministry of Housing said it ""didn't recognise"" the figures in the new analysis carried out by the National Housing Federation, describing them as a ""major overestimation"". It also highlighted its Â£11.5bn investment in affordable homes, to be spent between 2021 and 2026, some of which will be used on building homes for social rent.

"One court case awarded home carers in London more than Â£100,000 The government should guarantee that care workers are paid fairly, the UK's largest union has demanded. Unison's statement comes on the heels of a legal victory it helped win for homecare workers in north London. General secretary Dave Prentis said: ""It's time the skills and experience of care staff were respected instead of them being underpaid and undervalued."" A government spokesperson said it was ""clear"" that care workers must be paid at least the national minimum wage. Companies contracted by Haringey Council were found to have breached wage rules after some carers were paid less than Â£4 per hour. A court awarded the carers more than Â£100,000 in backdated earnings following an employment tribunal ruling. Care service companies, Kaamil Education Limited, Diligent Care Services Limited and Premier Carewaiting Limited say they inherited the case when they took over the work contract from care provider, Sevacare. The court found that when the employees were working with Sevacare, they should have been paid for travel time spent moving between patient visits during their working day. The firms who took over the contracts were ordered to pay the claimants. Self-isolating care workers 'to have wages topped up' Care homes ask for insurance cost help From working in retail to becoming a carer When travel time was not paid, some carers worked up to 14 hours a day, but the average hourly pay recorded on their payslips was well below the legal minimum hourly rate. The 10 claimants will receive an average settlement of Â£10,000 each, after a four-year legal battle. The judgement said that travelling and waiting time of up to an hour between appointments should be compensated as working time. Mr Prentis said: ""This is a major victory for these dedicated workers who dared take on their employers. ""These are the very same care staff who were applauded during the lockdown. They shouldn't have to work in a system that breeds such awful treatment,"" he added. Jess (not her real name) also heralded the victory as ""great news and a big win"". She still works for one of the firms and told the BBC that the outcome offered every key worker a voice. She hopes that the precedent set by the union's case would help others like her. However, she says that she still struggles on low wages. ""They were all clapping for us, but now it's all gone back to normal. And I think that is very bad. We work so hard,"" she says. ""It is difficult to make ends meet"", Jess adds. Any unexpected expenses push her over the edge and it takes longer to recover financially. Together with others who were fighting the court case, she had gone to Parliament to testify about their working conditions and was told she was doing a ""fantastic job"". Jess says that politicians ""only tell you what you want to hear"". She adds: ""I've been here for ten years and it's not easy."" A Local Government Association spokesperson told the BBC: ""We will consider this ruling carefully to assess any implications for local authorities"". They added: ""Before the pandemic, adult social care services faced a funding gap of almost Â£4bn by 2025. ""Social care needs parity of esteem with the NHS, backed up by a genuine, long-term and sustainable funding settlement, which councils have been calling for long before the current crisis."" More than one million people work in social care and the majority, 83% are female, according to figures from the Resolution Foundation. A study the think tank did in April 2020 found that more than half of workers are paid less than the voluntary living wage and were five times more likely to be on a zero-hours contract. The overwhelming majority of those working in social care are female, according to a think tank Jess will remain in her job, but hopes things will change. ""Some of us, we can do more than key worker work, but we are doing it for a purpose. To give back. Some of my patients were key workers themselves."" She says it is time for the government to show care workers their support. ""Pay us some proper wages, so that we can feed our kids and pay our bills,"" says Jess. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are very clear that social care workers must be paid at least the national minimum wage, with those over 25 earning at least the national living wage, and they should be paid for the time spent caring for clients, travelling to appointments and waiting for them to start. ""We know there is a need for a long-term solution for social care and are looking at a range of proposals as part of our commitment to bringing forward a plan that puts the sector on a sustainable footing for the future.""

"Gary Lineker and Zoe Ball are now the highest earners on the star salaries list Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has agreed a Â£400,000 pay cut, the BBC has revealed as it publishes the latest list of its best-paid presenters. Lineker was the highest-earning star with an unchanged salary of Â£1.75m in the 2019/20 financial year. But he has since signed a new contract, which will see that fee cut by 23%. That means he could earn less than Zoe Ball next year. The Radio 2 presenter has seen her pay rise by Â£1m since taking over the breakfast show in 2019. Fiona Bruce and Lauren Laverne have also moved into the top 10 of the highest-paid stars, which features four women for the first time. Vanessa Feltz is also among the top earners,the corporation's annual report shows,external. However, many stars do not appear on the list because the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios, does not have to publish its talent spend. Left to right: Vanessa Feltz, Lauren Laverne and Fiona Bruce are also in the top 10 All 10 of the top-earning presenters on this year's list are white, although the BBC's director general Tim Davie said 18% of those making more than Â£150,000 were from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, up from 12% four years ago. ""We made good progress, if you look across the industry we're in a good place, but we've got work to do,"" Mr Davie said. And while 26.5% of actors and presenters were from BAME backgrounds, it was a different story behind the camera, with 9.8% of production staff from ethnic minorities. The report also showed 12.3% of BBC leaders were BAME, below its 15% target for 2020. George Alagiah is the highest-paid person of colour on the list Lineker's new salary will be published on next year's list. Director general Tim Davie described the former England player as a brilliant broadcaster and said his new five-year deal was a great example of the ""best talent and the best value"". ""And before you ask, Gary knows his responsibility to the BBC in terms of his use of social media,"" Mr Davie added, referring to social media rules for BBC staff and presenters that are expected to be announced soon. Lineker, a prolific tweeter who frequently discusses his political views online,said the BBC,external""recognise that I tweet carefully and will continue to do so"", and sent a message to ""the haters"" on Twitter.

Gary Lineker calls for 'voluntary' licence fee 'I'm kind of the whipping boy for the BBC' The stars of some of the BBC's biggest programmes - like Top Gear and Doctor Who - are absent from the list because they are made by BBC Studios. Ball's Strictly Come Dancing spin-off It Takes Two is produced by the commercial arm, and so is not included. But her pay has risen because this is her first full year since taking over from Chris Evans on Radio 2. Last year, the top earners included three women - Ball, Feltz and Claudia Winkleman. Overall, the BBC's total salary bill for on-air talent in 2019/20 rose by Â£1m to Â£144.6m,while salaries for the BBC's executive committee rose from Â£4.95m to Â£5.41m. Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said the overall rise in pay for on-air talent was ""concerning"". He said: ""Despite Gary Lineker's pay cut, when millions of pensioners are having to find extra cash to pay for the BBC and services they depend on, it's concerning to see not only has the bill for on-air talent has grown by more than Â£1m but that more than 100 senior executives are paid over Â£150,000 a year - in many cases considerably more than that."" The overall gender pay gap at the BBC has fallen from 6.7% to 6.2%. Previous director general Tony Hall had pledged to close the gender pay gap by 2020. Mr Davie said that ""was a very aggressive target,"" adding: ""We can be proud of our progress but we must go further."" He said he wanted to increase the number of women across leadership ranks, where the figure currently stands at 45%, short of the 50% target. ""It's about the leaders, not talk but action,"" he said. There are ""a small number of historic equal pay cases"" to be resolved, the report said. This annual report contains plenty of complex messages, but is likely still to lead to simple and negative headlines for the BBC. The list of salaries for on-air broadcasters - which includes me - reflects three years of reforms. As part of those reforms, many broadcasters - particularly but not exclusively men - either took significant pay cuts (Huw Edwards, Jeremy Vine etc) or left the BBC (Chris Evans, John Humphrys leaving Today, Eddie Mair). Now, several broadcasters - particularly but not exclusively women - have had pay rises. Crucially, the pay rises for these female broadcasters (Zoe Ball, Fiona Bruce, Lauren Laverne, Emily Maitlis), reflect additional work. The overall rise in pay for those whose salaries are published - around Â£1m - is not, in financial terms, huge, given the number of people to which it pertains, and the salaries themselves. Indeed, it is below inflation, and therefore a cut in real terms. Nevertheless, the optics are bad for the BBC. Complexity doesn't cut through in stories about high pay. The simple fact is, in a time of immense hardship across the country, with so many people redundant or furloughed and suffering, these huge salaries (and their modest overall increase) will strike many licence fee payers as disgraceful. The other big story is the BBC's finances. In the medium-term, they are badly strained. It is striking that by the end of next year, the BBC will have delivered around Â£800m in savings in just five years. But the fact that the licence fee didn't rise with inflation between 2010 and 2017, and the Â£125m hit (at least) from the coronavirus pandemic, are a huge injury to the bottom line for the coming year. And that's before you even consider whether a generation who give so much time to TikTok, YouTube and WhatsApp feel they need to pay for a TV licence. Licence fee income dropped by Â£170m to Â£3.52bn in 2019/20, partly due to evasion. Overall, the BBC's overall income was down by Â£119m. There was growth in commercial income from BBC Studios, and the corporation's chairman Sir David Clementi said a drive to increase such revenue would be ""even more pressing"" because there will be ""major financial pressures on the BBC"" in the coming years. The coronavirus pandemic means the organisation has faced ""significant challenges"" and will have to find extra savings on top of those already planned. The BBC has already saved Â£618m since 2016/17, and that figure is expected to rise above Â£800m by the end of the current financial year, the report said.

"The new Wylfa power station would be built next to the old power plant on Anglesey Hitachi has said it has no plans to sell a Welsh nuclear power site to a Chinese corporation after comments by Donald Trump. The US president wasquoted by the Sunday Times,externalwarning it not to sell Wylfa, on Anglesey, ""to China"". Work onthe Â£13bn project was put on holdlast year because of rising costs after Hitachi failed to reach a funding agreement with the UK government. A Horizon Energy spokesman said: ""We don't comment on speculation.

Wylfa was earmarked as havingthe potential to power up to five million homes, but the project was put on hold as the upfront costs rose.

"The new Wylfa power station was to be built next to the old power plant on Anglesey Plans for a Â£15-Â£20bn nuclear power plant in Wales have been scrapped. Work on the Wylfa Newydd project on Angleseywas suspended in January last yearbecause of rising costs after Hitachi failed to reach a funding agreement with the UK government. Isle of Anglesey council said the company had now confirmed in writing it is withdrawing from the project. Council leader Llinos Medi said: ""This is very disappointing, particularly at such a difficult time economically."" Hitachi shelved the scheme, the biggest energy project ever proposed in Wales, over funding issues. Anglesey council said it had received a letter from the Tokyo-based parent company confirming its decision. Developer Horizon Nuclear, which is owned by Hitachi, said it would not comment. Donald Trump plea over Wylfa nuclear project sale dismissed Wylfa Newydd and the energy gap What's Wylfa - and why is it so important? The UK government also declined to comment but the Welsh Affairs Committee has said the Wylfa nuclear power project withdrawal is ""a blow for Wales and the UK's ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050."" ""This was set to be the largest energy project Wales had ever seen with a positive impact on skills and employment in the region,"" said committee chairman Stephen Crabb MP. ""With the nation's remaining nuclear plants ageing and the need for low-carbon, high yield plants needed to replace them urgent, it has never been more important than now to ensure energy security."" Work on Wylfa was due to start this year Mr Crabb added that Hitachi had given ""reassurances"" of its commitment to the project over the summer ""that gave hope to the workers who'd be needed to construct it and the high-skilled employees who would run it"". Developers said the plant would create up to 9,000 jobs during the construction phase and have a 60-year operational life. Campaigners against the project - a replacement for the original Wylfa plant shut in 2015 after 44 years of service - welcomed Hitachi's move claiming a ""nuclear power station would have endangered lives on Anglesey and beyond"". The People Against Wylfa B action group said: ""It would have ruined the environment over an area which is 10 times greater than the current site."" It called on Hitachi to ""ensure that no nuclear scheme will happen on the site in the future"" and return the site to its ""former state, for community benefit"". ""Proposals to develop green energy schemes would be an area where Hitachi's expertise could create many jobs here,"" the group added. Anglesey council has called for a meeting with the Welsh and UK governments to discuss the future of the site. A two-reactor plant at Wylfa was earmarked as having thepotential to power up to five million homes, but the project was put on hold as the upfront costs rose. With 9,000 workers ready to start the construction phase, the decision in January 2019 was described as ""a tremendous blow"" to the Welsh economy by business leaders. The company said in June it was hoping to secure extra funding from the UK government to resume the project but has now thrown in the towel. As one of Wales' biggest proposed construction projects, Wylfa Newydd has faced turbulent times. The company behind it, Hitachi, has always been concerned about the costs of building the new nuclear power plant. The UK government went some way in offering financial support to the project but it wasn't enough to satisfy Hitachi's concerns over the financial risks. The UK government also held a consultation on plans that would see energy customers pay upfront for the costs of construction. The industry has been waiting for months for an outcome to that. When the UK government said nuclear was part of its push for green energy, the industry thought it was a positive sign for Wylfa Newydd. But critics question how green nuclear energy really is, not to mention how safe it is. Wales has been called the ""land of artists' impressions"" with many big schemes that are talked about and never happen. Supporters of Wylfa Newydd will be concerned it will become another of those, while its critics would be glad to see the back of the plans. Economist Edward Jones said people were learning new skills in the hope of finding work at Wylfa Newydd The decision will have ""a big effect on the economy"", according to Edward Jones, lecturer in economics at Bangor University. ""We are currently feeling the effect of Covid-19 and Brexit is around the corner, and we will feel the negative impact of that on the economy,"" he said. ""A lot of people were investing in learning new skills with the thought of getting jobs at Wylfa. ""We know businesses are investing in new production methods to be part of the supply chain of the nuclear power plant. ""The challenge now is to find other projects that can make use of these skills."" Mr Jones said other energy projects on the island, such asthe Morlais tidal energy scheme, could make use of the investment already made.

"This video can not be played Miliband to Johnson: ""He hasn't read the bill"" A proposed law giving Boris Johnson's government the power to override parts of the Brexit agreement with the EU has passed its first hurdle in the Commons. MPs backed the Internal Market Bill by 340 votes to 263. Ministers say it contains vital safeguards to protect Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, if negotiations on a future trade deal break down. But critics, including a number of Tory MPs, warned it risks damaging the UK by breaching international law. Two Tory MPs voted against the bill on Monday night - Sir Roger Gale and Andrew Percy - while a further 30 abstained, although some of those may not have been for political reasons. Although the government has a majority of 80 in the Commons, it is braced for further rebellions in the coming weeks as the legislation receives detailed scrutiny. Several prominent Conservatives, including former Chancellor Sajid Javid - who appeared to abstain on Monday - have said they could not support the final bill unless it is amended. But Home Secretary Priti Patel insisted it put the ""safeguards and mechanisms in place to ensure that we stay true to the people of Northern Ireland"". Sir Roger Gale, the Tory MP for North Thanet in Kent, told the BBC's Newsnight he had voted against the bill as a ""matter of principle"" to uphold international law. Johnson says bill protects UK's economic borders How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? What's the truth about EU blockade claims? ""I think that this is damaging our international reputation for honest and straight-dealing at a time when we are about to embark on a series of trade negotiations. I took a view that you fight this tooth and nail at every step."" He suggested other colleagues were ""holding their fire"" until later in the bill's passage, with a group led by ex-minister Sir Bob Neill pressing for a ""parliamentary lock"" on the government's ability to exercise the powers. ""I'm not remotely surprised that I am a tiny minority. I think that may change next Tuesday,"" he added. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalformer Conservative leader Lord Hague also warned against breaching international law, saying it would be ""a serious foreign policy error"". ""It would have a lasting and damaging effect on our international reputation and standing, diminishing our ability to exert our influence and protect our interests."" Ms Patel told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government was still working closely with the EU to ""settle on our future relationship"". But she defended the bill, saying it stood by the party's manifesto commitments from the 2019 election to ""ensure peace, security and good governance for the whole of the United Kingdom"". Bill's remit The bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union on 1 January. But, controversially, it gives the government the power to change aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement, a legally-binding deal governing the terms of the UK's exit from the EU earlier this year. Ministers say this is a failsafe mechanism in case the EU interprets the agreement, in particular the Northern Ireland Protocol designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, in an ""extreme and unreasonable"" way. Boris Johnson's government has a hefty majority. It was never going to lose Monday night's vote in the Commons. Downing Street calculates that most of the public won't pay that much attention to yet more Westminster argy-bargy about the Brexit process. In turn, many Tory MPs are sure that the wrangling over the UK Internal Market Bill won't filter through to their constituents. And where it does, they would much more likely take the side of the government taking a tough line with the EU than share the concerns of former prime ministers or august lawyers foaming about the government's behaviour. And yet -  first off, to state the obvious, opposition from former occupants of No 10, former chancellors and former cabinet ministers is not exactly a sign of peace and harmony. But the resistance to No 10 goes beyond the usual suspects this time. Read more from Laura During a five-hour debate, Mr Johnson claimed the EU's current approach could lead to excessive checks and even tariffs on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He said the bill would ensure the UK's ""economic and political integrity"", accusing the EU of making unfair demands to ""exert leverage"" in the trade talks - including a threat to block food exports. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I have absolutely no desire to use these measures"" But ministers also said they would listen to concerns, insisting that the powers being sought would only be used if other legal avenues had been exhausted and only if MPs explicitly voted to activate them. A government spokesman said it was vital the bill - which is expected to face stern opposition in the House of Lords - becomes law by the end of the year when EU law will cease to have effect in the UK. ""It will protect the territorial integrity of the UK and the peace in Northern Ireland, safeguarding trade and jobs across all four corners of the UK following the end of the transition period,"" he said. The PM also held a call with Conservative members of the House of Lords on Monday night. Labour said the PM was reneging on a deal he himself signed earlier this year, and on which Conservative MPs campaigned in the 2019 election, and was ""trashing"" the UK's reputation. But the Commons also voted against a Labour amendment to reject the bill entirely by 349 votes to 213. MPs will now begin detailed scrutiny of the bill on Tuesday with Conservative MPs seeking further assurances that the UK will not betray its treaty obligations.

"Carole Baskin runs the Big Cat Rescue sanctuary Tiger King's Carole Baskin's debut on Dancing With The Stars was overshadowed by an advert shown in the break. It was paid for by the family of the Netflix star's ex-husband Don Lewis, who is missing and presumed dead. The family asked viewers to pass on information about his disappearance or Carole Baskin's alleged involvement. In the Tiger King series, it was suggested she fed him to tigers at Big Cat Rescue - somethingshe has deniedmultiple times. Allow YouTube content?

It featured Don Lewis' three daughters - Gale, Lynda and Donna - plus his former assistant, Anne McQueen. In the short film the eldest daughter Donna says: ""We need to know what happened to our father."" The family lawyer John Phillips also speaks and specifically names Carole Baskin. ""Don Lewis mysteriously disappeared in 1997, his family deserves answers, they deserve justice. Do you know who did this or if Carole Baskin was involved?"" he asks. The family then offer a $100,000 (Â£78,000) reward for information and asked viewers to call a phone line. Don Lewis went missing 23 years ago. He disappeared a day before a scheduled trip to Costa Rica, and was declared legally dead in 2002. The star of Tiger King, Joe Exotic, has repeatedly accused Carole of killing Don Lewis to get his money He and Baskin started an animal sanctuary together in Tampa, Florida, which later became Big Cat Rescue Corporation. They were married at the time of his disappearance, but he had filed for a restraining order against her two months earlier. Theories about what happened to him formed part of the hit Netflix series, including suggestions that Baskin, who received most of his $6m (Â£4.5m) estate, was responsible for his disappearance. She has strongly and repeatedly denied having anything to do with it. ""The unsavoury lies are better for getting viewers,"" she has said.

"The genetically modified goats are a ""proof in principle"", say scientists Scientists have produced gene-edited animals they say could serve as ""super dads"" or ""surrogate sires"". The pigs, goats, cattle and mice make sperm carrying the genetic material of donor animals. The researchers used a hi-tech gene editing tool to knock out a male fertility gene in animal embryos. The animals were born sterile, but began producing sperm after an injection of sperm-producing cells from donor animals. The technique would enable surrogate males to sire offspring carrying the genetic material of valuable elite animals such as prize bulls, said a US-UK team. This would be a step towards genetically enhancing livestock to improve food production, they added. Prof Jon Oatley, of Washington State University's College of Veterinary Medicine, said: ""This can have a major impact on addressing food insecurity around the world. If we can tackle this genetically, then that means less water, less feed and fewer antibiotics we have to put into the animals."" Bull ""super dads"" could be used to sire healthier or meatier cows The surrogate sires were confirmed to have active donor sperm. And the mice fathered healthy offspring that carried the genes of the sperm donor. The larger animals have not yet been bred. But Prof Bruce Whitelaw of the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh said the study provided a powerful proof of concept. ""This shows the world that this technology is real. It can be used,"" he said. ""We now have to go in and work out how best to use it productively to help feed our growing population."" According to the researchers, the technology could also help in the conservation of endangered species. It might be possible, for example, to use the frozen sperm of an endangered rhino to regenerate the species. But they said the speed at which the science could be put into action will be influenced by policymakers. Gene-edited livestock have yet to be granted approval for human consumption, with concerns over product safety, ethics, and animal welfare. Prof Jon Oatley says genetic techniques could address food insecurity Gene editing involves deleting or changing coding in embryos. One example of current technology is CRISPR, a biological system for altering DNA discovered in 2012. CRISPR scans the genome looking for the location of a certain gene and then uses ""molecular scissors"" to snip through the DNA. While effective in the lab, the process is less than perfect and can cut out too much DNA. These unwanted edits could alter other important genes. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics is examining the ethical issues raised by the use of gene-editing techniques in farmed animals. Potential applications of gene-editing technology include genetically hornless cows, and pigs or chickens that are resistant to diseases. Gene-editing could form part of the response to many of the challenges facing societies in different parts of the world, including securing access to healthy and nutritious food, said director Hugh Whittall. ""Whether and to what extent genome editing can and should be deployed outside the research setting will depend on further research and development progressing in alignment with societal values and interests that have, in many cases, yet to be clearly defined,"" he told BBC News. ""These are among the questions that we are exploring in our current inquiry on genome editing and farmed animals."" The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"The UK government should consider a targeted extension of its furlough scheme, MPs have said. The coronavirus crisis risks mass long-term unemployment and viable firms could go under without support, the Treasury Select Committee has warned. However, a blanket retention of the scheme would not be good value for money, it added. The Treasury said it would ""continue to innovate in supporting incomes and employment."" The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is due to end on 31 October. Under it, workers placed on leave have received 80% of their pay up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. At first, this was all paid for by the government. Butfirms had to start making a contribution to wagesin September as the scheme began to wind down. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said that extending furlough past October would only keep people ""in suspended animation"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak also ruled out an extension, instead saying thatfirms will be given Â£1,000 for every furloughed workerstill in employment at the end of January. Coronavirus: What happens when the furlough scheme ends? Extend furlough scheme 'or risk second wave of job cuts' But the committee's chairman, Mel Stride, said the chancellor ""should carefully consider targeted extensions"" to the scheme. ""The key will be assisting those businesses who, with additional support, can come through the crisis as sustainable enterprises, rather than focusing on those that will unfortunately just not be viable in the changed post-crisis economy."" In the second report of its inquiry into the economic impact of Covid-19, the committee also warned that the pandemic risked widening the gender pay gap due to the differences in hours of paid work in lockdown - especially if work patterns are changed permanently. The MPs also said people should be able to reskill, and that small businesses should be able to fully participate in the government's Kickstart Scheme, which aims to create work placements for young people on universal credit. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) trade body said with the furlough scheme winding down, ""policymakers will need to look closely at measures to stem mass unemployment, including a successor scheme."" FSB national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""The priority should be protecting viable small businesses - and all the jobs they provide - that have been disproportionately [hit] by the coronavirus crisis, including those caught by local lockdowns, subject to continued national restrictions, or with staff that have directly suffered because of Covid."" This video can not be played Julie changed jobs before lockdown - then became unemployed and ineligible for the furlough scheme The Resolution Foundation, which campaigns on living standards, said that ""extending support for the hardest-hit sectors of the economy will be essential to limit the rise in unemployment Britain faces in the months ahead."" Torsten Bell, the think tank's chief executive, said: ""This authoritative account of the economic impact of coronavirus should be required reading for Treasury officials planning the Autumn Budget against the highly uncertain backdrop of rising coronavirus case numbers. ""The chancellor will need to reconsider his plans to swiftly phase out support given the painful reality that the economic crisis is here to stay."" This week leading business groups warned that the UKrisks a second wave of job cutsand a slower economic recovery if it does not extend its furlough scheme. Germany, Belgium, Australia and France have all decided to extend or launch new wage support schemes into next year. Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown told the BBC that the UK should emulate other countries' short-term working schemes. Mr Brown said the end of the furlough scheme on 31 October was a ""cliff-edge"" that could trigger ""a tsunami of unemployment"". ""The government's got to change course here,"" he told the Today programme. Short-term working schemes would allow firms to reduce employees' working hours while keeping them in jobs, with the state topping up their salaries. ""You have got to send a signal that unemployment matters,"" he said. ""We don't want to destroy any more capacity and skills in the economy."" A Treasury spokesperson said that by the time the UK scheme closes it will have helped to pay for 9.6 million jobs. ""We will continue to innovate in supporting incomes and employment,"" the spokesperson said. ""We're helping employees get back to work, where they want to be, through a Â£1,000 retention bonus. ""And we are creating new roles for young people with our Kickstart Scheme, creating incentives for training and apprenticeships, and supporting and protecting jobs in the tourism and hospitality sectors through our VAT cut and last month's Eat Out to Help Out scheme."" The UK's unemployment rate has been at 3.9% since the lockdown was introduced. But the Bank of England expects that rate to double to 7.5% by the end of the year when the government-funded support schemes come to an end. Thousands of job cuts have already been announced by firm such as Rolls-Royce, Costa Coffee, Pret A Manger, Pizza Express, British Airways and BP.

"One court case awarded home carers in London more than Â£100,000 The government should guarantee that care workers are paid fairly, the UK's largest union has demanded. Unison's statement comes on the heels of a legal victory it helped win for homecare workers in north London. General secretary Dave Prentis said: ""It's time the skills and experience of care staff were respected instead of them being underpaid and undervalued."" A government spokesperson said it was ""clear"" that care workers must be paid at least the national minimum wage. Companies contracted by Haringey Council were found to have breached wage rules after some carers were paid less than Â£4 per hour. A court awarded the carers more than Â£100,000 in backdated earnings following an employment tribunal ruling. Care service companies, Kaamil Education Limited, Diligent Care Services Limited and Premier Carewaiting Limited say they inherited the case when they took over the work contract from care provider, Sevacare. The court found that when the employees were working with Sevacare, they should have been paid for travel time spent moving between patient visits during their working day. The firms who took over the contracts were ordered to pay the claimants. Self-isolating care workers 'to have wages topped up' Care homes ask for insurance cost help From working in retail to becoming a carer When travel time was not paid, some carers worked up to 14 hours a day, but the average hourly pay recorded on their payslips was well below the legal minimum hourly rate. The 10 claimants will receive an average settlement of Â£10,000 each, after a four-year legal battle. The judgement said that travelling and waiting time of up to an hour between appointments should be compensated as working time. Mr Prentis said: ""This is a major victory for these dedicated workers who dared take on their employers. ""These are the very same care staff who were applauded during the lockdown. They shouldn't have to work in a system that breeds such awful treatment,"" he added. Jess (not her real name) also heralded the victory as ""great news and a big win"". She still works for one of the firms and told the BBC that the outcome offered every key worker a voice. She hopes that the precedent set by the union's case would help others like her. However, she says that she still struggles on low wages. ""They were all clapping for us, but now it's all gone back to normal. And I think that is very bad. We work so hard,"" she says. ""It is difficult to make ends meet"", Jess adds. Any unexpected expenses push her over the edge and it takes longer to recover financially. Together with others who were fighting the court case, she had gone to Parliament to testify about their working conditions and was told she was doing a ""fantastic job"". Jess says that politicians ""only tell you what you want to hear"". She adds: ""I've been here for ten years and it's not easy."" A Local Government Association spokesperson told the BBC: ""We will consider this ruling carefully to assess any implications for local authorities"". They added: ""Before the pandemic, adult social care services faced a funding gap of almost Â£4bn by 2025. ""Social care needs parity of esteem with the NHS, backed up by a genuine, long-term and sustainable funding settlement, which councils have been calling for long before the current crisis."" More than one million people work in social care and the majority, 83% are female, according to figures from the Resolution Foundation. A study the think tank did in April 2020 found that more than half of workers are paid less than the voluntary living wage and were five times more likely to be on a zero-hours contract. The overwhelming majority of those working in social care are female, according to a think tank Jess will remain in her job, but hopes things will change. ""Some of us, we can do more than key worker work, but we are doing it for a purpose. To give back. Some of my patients were key workers themselves."" She says it is time for the government to show care workers their support. ""Pay us some proper wages, so that we can feed our kids and pay our bills,"" says Jess. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are very clear that social care workers must be paid at least the national minimum wage, with those over 25 earning at least the national living wage, and they should be paid for the time spent caring for clients, travelling to appointments and waiting for them to start. ""We know there is a need for a long-term solution for social care and are looking at a range of proposals as part of our commitment to bringing forward a plan that puts the sector on a sustainable footing for the future.""

"This video can not be played ""I'm a victim but feel like an inconvenience"" A dentist who was secretly stalked by a former patient has spoken of his shock that he was not told immediately his stalker had been released from custody. Prosecutors said Thomas Baddeley - who was found with a ""murder kit"" - could only be charged with a minor offence because his victim Dr Ian Hutchinson had been unaware he was being stalked. A scheme for informing victims when an offender is released did therefore not apply, the Ministry of Justice said. They said protocols had been followed. Baddeley, 42, from Bristol, secretly stalked the dentist for more than four years and was jailed for a total of 16 months in August after admitting stalking without fear, harm or intimidation and two counts of possessing offensive weapons. An indefinite restraining order was imposed, including a ban on entering parts of Monmouthshire, with Baddeley facing up to five years' imprisonment if he breaches it. Thomas Baddeley is now subject to an indefinite restraining order Earlier this month Chepstow dentistDr Hutchinson told BBC Waleshe felt ""let down by the law"" that Baddeley could not be charged with a more serious offence despite conducting ""systematic surveillance"" and having a ""murder kit"" of weaponry, bleach and plastic sheeting in his car. Dr Hutchinson had been assured he would be informed when Baddeley was released, which was expected to happen sometime in the coming weeks. Stalking: My ex-partner sent me 4,000 emails Stalking victim: 'When he's not in prison, I'm a wreck' But following the BBC Wales report he received a call from the probation service to let him know Baddeley had in fact been released straight after sentencing nearly four weeks earlier, due to time served on remand and delays hearing the case. Gwent Police special protection officers are now discussing security measures with Dr Hutchinson - including the option of changing his identity and moving away. A crossbow was among the weapons found in Thomas Baddeley's car Dr Hutchinson said it had left him feeling angry with the system and as a victim he had been treated as an ""inconvenience"". He called for changes to the law to better reflect the risk posed by his stalker. ""Going equipped to commit a burglary is an offence. But going equipped to murder isn't. And that is just not acceptable,"" he said. The victim ""could not have been more let down"", said Victims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird The Victims' Commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, said, ""As a victim this dentist could not have been more let down by the criminal justice system. ""I think the laws proved quite inadequate - he was clearly going to do serious harm if he had carried through what he wanted to do, and there is no charge that represents that."" Dame Vera said she was now considering raising this with the attorney general, and Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville-Roberts has written to the director of public prosecutions to see if this case is indicative of a wider problem. ""You get no reassurance from any of this,"" added Dame Vera. ""From the inadequacy of the charge, the weakness of the sentence which follows, and then the absolute failure to tell him that theoretically this man is out, and not far away."" Stalking can escalate quickly, said Katy Bourne, police and crime commissioners' national lead on stalking Katy Bourne, the police and crime commissioners' national lead on stalking, was herself a victim of the crime. She said victims must be safeguarded throughout the criminal justice process. ""Often the perpetrator may not actually approach the victim physically, but it's the fear of what they might do that really weighs heavily on the victim's mind,"" she said. ""I've spoken to victims [who] feel they'll only be taken seriously if something physical happens against them."" The Home Office said they were determined to tackle stalking. ""We introduced stalking protection orders in January, which protect victims and address the perpetrator's behaviour at the earliest opportunity,"" a spokesman said. ""We've also doubled the maximum sentences for stalking and harassment to 10 years.""

Families in Oldham,external, where there has been particular concern about the spread of coronavirus, are boiling over with frustration that they can't access tests. Not least a government that promised the public its testing system would be better than any other country's. Not least a government that believes a properly functioning testing system is vital to keeping kids back in school and climbing out of recession as quickly as possible. Not least a government that knows testing is a crucial way to monitor and control the virus that saw such a terrible loss of life in the grim spring that we have all just lived through. Read more.

EFL clubs were asked to put in requests by Tuesday in order for their plans to be signed off in time. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden will meet with sports bodies later this week to discuss the planned return of spectators to sport from 1 October. Last week, the governmentrestricted pilot events to 1,000 spectatorsafter a rise in coronavirus cases, and said plans for grounds to be up to a third full from 1 October would be reviewed.

With Yom Kippur to follow on Monday week, how will the UK's new coronavirus restrictions affect Jewish celebrations? For Dr Katrina Lester, who is due to give birth in eight weeks, this year will be a ""very lonely time"", spent away from relatives and the synagogue. Like millions of others, her family has been looking forward to the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah - which marks the Jewish new year - and Yom Kippur - a solemn day of atonement, involving a 25-hour fast and continuous prayer throughout the day. But this year, certain rituals and customs will have to be adapted to meet Covid-19 guidelines. The government has issued highly detailed guidancefor the Jewish community as they observe the festivals, with measures including the removal of communal items, such as prayer books, in synagogues; andthe use of microphones for devotions or sermons to avoid shouting,external.

Ministers have been defending the NHS Test and Trace system for England and have claimed testing capacity is increasing. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""The government has been consistently increasing testing capacity, but also laboratory capacity."" She is correct that government data shows that both testing capacity and laboratory capacity have increased considerably since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there has been a sizeable gap between how many tests labs are able to process (""capacity"") and the number of tests actually processed.

It says deep cuts made to addiction services could mean patients will miss out on life-saving care. Read more. Yogita LimayeMumbai correspondent, BBC News India has now recorded more than five million confirmed cases of coronavirus. It is the second worst affected country in the world, but the virus is spreading much faster there than in the US, which is in the top spot. More than 82,000 people have died with the virus in India, with more than 1,000 dying each day. Hospitals in many cities are running out of intensive
care bedsand oxygen supplies. But the government has been pointing out that the number
of Indians dying with Covid-19 relative to the size of its population is a lot
lower than in other badly hit countries. ""Non-life-sustainingâ businesses were ordered to shut down in Pennsylvania Some of the lockdown provisions put in place by Pennsylvaniaâs Democratic Governor Tom Wolf are unconstitutional, a US federal judge has ruled. Judge William Stickman found in favour of two Republican politicians and several business owners, who said ongoing restrictions threatened livelihoods. He said Governor Wolf did not have the right to infringe civil liberties, even if he was acting with good intentions. Mr Wolf had already lifted some restrictions after infections in Pennsylvania began to fall.They had required people to stay at home, placed limits on the size of indoor and outdoor gatherings and ordered ânon-life-sustainingâ businesses to shut down. The lawsuit is one of hundreds brought across America challenging local lockdown rules. The Wolf administration said it would appeal: âThe actions taken by the administration were mirrored by governors across the country and saved, and continue to save lives in the absence of federal action,"" a spokeswoman for Mr Wolf said. ""This decision is especially worrying as Pennsylvania and the rest of the country are likely to face a challenging time with the possible resurgence of Covid-19 and the flu in the fall and winter,â she added. Another person awaiting test results is Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who will not take part in Prime Minister's Quesions tomorrow as he is ""still awaiting"" a coronavirus test result for a member of his family, a spokesman said. The spokesman said he would remain in self-isolation and deputy leader Angela Rayner would take his place. The Labour leaderhas been self-isolating since Monday, after a member of his household showed symptoms. They were tested the same day. Starmer is not reported to have shown any symptoms himself. Scott said he tried hundreds of times to book a test for his family Schools are back, businesses are reopening and winter bugs are starting to spread - meaning more and more people are asking for a coronavirus test. Scott Vining's daughter fell ill with a temperature on Saturday. By Sunday, the rest of the family, who live near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, had also developed symptoms. ""We've tried hundreds of times,"" he told the BBC about trying to book a test. ""We started to try and book tests for my daughter on Sunday, to no avail, and then we started at 08:00 on Monday morning for us all."" At one point Scott was offered a test in Warwickshire, 65 miles away from his home, through the government website. But by the time he'd entered the details of his family of four, the spaces had disappeared. Scott eventually managed to secure a test for his wife today in Luton. He has since managed to book tests for himself and his children at a separate testing centre, in Bedford. Read more about Scott and other families' experienceshere. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor ""A tricky balancing act"" is how the chancellor himself described to me the next stage of support to an economy that will continue to be affected by the pandemic. He dropped his heaviest hint yet that this will include a new measure or scheme to boost job creation, as the jobless numbers start their inevitable turn upwards. That task, he says, is his ""number one priority"" and he told me on a visit to a pottery factory in Stoke: ""I'm always looking for interesting creative, innovative and effective new ways to support jobs and employment."" What it is not is the extension to the current furlough scheme. The purpose of the visit to the Emma Bridgewater factory was to celebrate the return to work from furlough of its staff. The Treasury calculates that half of those furloughed are now back in their jobs, and the chancellor is adamant that people are ""itching to get back to work"". Read morefrom Faisal here.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst As China celebrates 30 days without any domestic cases of
Covid-19, Chinaâs top health body says it is now going to roll out counselling
to people who have recovered from Covid-19. According to the official China Daily,social
workers, volunteers and therapists will be made available to former patients,external,
to help understand any physical, mental or financial help they might
need. Their data will be held
on local medical databases, under a system that âemphasises the importance of
protecting their privacyâ. Local health centres will also offer mental health assessments
âbased on informed consent and voluntary participationâ. In China, more than 80,000 people have recovered from Covid-19
since the beginning of the year.Mental health hotlines have been open since as early as January,external. But mental health is a major concern in China. The official Xinhua news agency estimated last year thatone in 10 Chinese people had mental health problems,external. That is 140 million people. People on Chinese social media have spoken often in recent months
about how they have struggled as a result of strict lockdown procedures,
working/studying at home, and finding work. The government is particularly concerned that those who have
recovered have experienced work and social stigma. However, it has urged people
to be transparent if they have any ailments rather than hide their
symptoms and risk the event of another localised outbreak. School attendance figures ""should reassure parents"" about sending their children back to classrooms, Downing Street has said. The first official figures for England,published earlier today, showed 88% of pupils went back for the autumn term. This is a higher absence rate than the usual figure of about 5% but it is not broken down to show whether pupils were at home because of Covid-19 outbreaks. The prime minister's spokesman said the government acknowledged it may take time for some parents to feel confident enough to send their children back to school and fines would only be used ""as a last resort, where there's no valid reason for absence"". It is understood no fines have been issued since schools returned. BBC Radio 5 Live There are a lot of reports of people struggling to get a coronavirus test. Gaynor Hope in south west London got her 16-year-old son a test after four days of trying. But test site workers were only able to grant him one by using a postcode from over 500 miles away. âWe drove up to the test centre, no queue, two other carsâ¦ but the steward said we had to use an Aberdeen postcode to get a QR code for a testâ, she told BBC Radio 5 Live. âThey were on their handheld devices, searching for any postcode they could useâ¦ itâs just so frustrating.â Gaynorâs MP, Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson,asked the health secretary about this issue in Parliament this afternoon,external.

"Blowing a ram's horn is a key feature of Rosh Hashanah - but extra care must be taken this year The government has issued highly detailed dos and don'ts for the UK Jewish community as it celebrates its most important festivals of the year. Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Sukkot normally involve packed synagogues and large family gatherings. This year, synagogues will have to ensure social distancing and avoid communal prayer shawls and books. The person blowing the shofar (ram's horn) for Rosh Hashanah should keep 2m from other worshippers. Hope for better times as festivals begin Beginning on Friday, the three-week period known as the Days of Awe is the central feature of the Jewish religious year, but many of its traditions will be impossible this year. A long checklist,externalmakes clear that synagogues can be used as long as Covid secure measures are in place. 'Religion helped me through lockdown' What are the changes to places of worship? What is the future of religious worship in the UK? But communal prayer books and prayer shawls, normally strewn around the synagogue, must be removed with worshippers told to bring their own prayer books. Microphones should be used where possible, though these would normally be unacceptable in orthodox synagogues. Mask-wearing is advised, and people should not mix in groups of more than six in line with the new limits on social gatherings. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries The guidance acknowledges that the ""rule of six"" will have a particular impact on the tradition of hospitality around Sukkot - the Feast of Tabernacles, which marks the end of harvest and commemorates the Exodus from Egypt. Running from 2 October to 9 October this year, the festival normally involves constructing ""sukkah"" the little shelter many Jews build in their gardens to eat in during the eight-day Succot festival. Normally guests would be invited and crammed inside, but now the limit is six people - unless the social bubble is bigger than that. Sharing food or cutlery is out, as are social gatherings in a communal sukkah and ""sukkah crawls"" across the community. A central feature of Rosh Hashanah - the Jewish New Year - is the blowing of the shofar, a musical instrument made from a ram's horn that may present a risk for a virus spread through droplets. To reduce the risk, the guidance says the shofar blower must be at least 2m from anyone else, and it should not be blown towards anyone. There is also detailed guidance for a ceremony known as Tashlich, where on Rosh Hashanah worshippers go to a body of moving water like a river and figuratively throw away their sins. This video can not be played Losing a âbeacon of lightâ of the UKâs ultra-Orthodox community to coronavirus As well as the rule of six and social distancing, the guidance says items used during the ceremony should not be shared, such as prayer books or the breadcrumbs that some worshippers cast on the water. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales has been appointed patron of a Jewish youth organisation as it celebrates in 125th year.

"One court case awarded home carers in London more than Â£100,000 The government should guarantee that care workers are paid fairly, the UK's largest union has demanded. Unison's statement comes on the heels of a legal victory it helped win for homecare workers in north London. General secretary Dave Prentis said: ""It's time the skills and experience of care staff were respected instead of them being underpaid and undervalued."" A government spokesperson said it was ""clear"" that care workers must be paid at least the national minimum wage. Companies contracted by Haringey Council were found to have breached wage rules after some carers were paid less than Â£4 per hour. A court awarded the carers more than Â£100,000 in backdated earnings following an employment tribunal ruling. Care service companies, Kaamil Education Limited, Diligent Care Services Limited and Premier Carewaiting Limited say they inherited the case when they took over the work contract from care provider, Sevacare. The court found that when the employees were working with Sevacare, they should have been paid for travel time spent moving between patient visits during their working day. The firms who took over the contracts were ordered to pay the claimants. Self-isolating care workers 'to have wages topped up' Care homes ask for insurance cost help From working in retail to becoming a carer When travel time was not paid, some carers worked up to 14 hours a day, but the average hourly pay recorded on their payslips was well below the legal minimum hourly rate. The 10 claimants will receive an average settlement of Â£10,000 each, after a four-year legal battle. The judgement said that travelling and waiting time of up to an hour between appointments should be compensated as working time. Mr Prentis said: ""This is a major victory for these dedicated workers who dared take on their employers. ""These are the very same care staff who were applauded during the lockdown. They shouldn't have to work in a system that breeds such awful treatment,"" he added. Jess (not her real name) also heralded the victory as ""great news and a big win"". She still works for one of the firms and told the BBC that the outcome offered every key worker a voice. She hopes that the precedent set by the union's case would help others like her. However, she says that she still struggles on low wages. ""They were all clapping for us, but now it's all gone back to normal. And I think that is very bad. We work so hard,"" she says. ""It is difficult to make ends meet"", Jess adds. Any unexpected expenses push her over the edge and it takes longer to recover financially. Together with others who were fighting the court case, she had gone to Parliament to testify about their working conditions and was told she was doing a ""fantastic job"". Jess says that politicians ""only tell you what you want to hear"". She adds: ""I've been here for ten years and it's not easy."" A Local Government Association spokesperson told the BBC: ""We will consider this ruling carefully to assess any implications for local authorities"". They added: ""Before the pandemic, adult social care services faced a funding gap of almost Â£4bn by 2025. ""Social care needs parity of esteem with the NHS, backed up by a genuine, long-term and sustainable funding settlement, which councils have been calling for long before the current crisis."" More than one million people work in social care and the majority, 83% are female, according to figures from the Resolution Foundation. A study the think tank did in April 2020 found that more than half of workers are paid less than the voluntary living wage and were five times more likely to be on a zero-hours contract. The overwhelming majority of those working in social care are female, according to a think tank Jess will remain in her job, but hopes things will change. ""Some of us, we can do more than key worker work, but we are doing it for a purpose. To give back. Some of my patients were key workers themselves."" She says it is time for the government to show care workers their support. ""Pay us some proper wages, so that we can feed our kids and pay our bills,"" says Jess. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are very clear that social care workers must be paid at least the national minimum wage, with those over 25 earning at least the national living wage, and they should be paid for the time spent caring for clients, travelling to appointments and waiting for them to start. ""We know there is a need for a long-term solution for social care and are looking at a range of proposals as part of our commitment to bringing forward a plan that puts the sector on a sustainable footing for the future.""

"The torch relay toured the UK for 70 days ahead of the London 2012 Olympic Games An automotive firm that made the 2012 London Olympic torch has gone into liquidation.

In the May to July quarter there was a particularly significant drop in the number of young people in employment. Overall, the unemployment rate grew to 4.1%, up from the previous figure of 3.9%.

It would be similar to that in Germany -explained here- rewarding employers who give people hours rather than cut jobs; providing training and support for those who can't come back full time, and targeting sectors most in need such as retail and aviation. The government says it's already implementing a plan to protect jobs -here we consider the likelihood of any extension to that.

"The UK unemployment rate has risen to its highest level for two years, official figures show. The unemployment rate grew to 4.1% in the three months to July, compared with 3.9% previously. Young people were particularly hard hit, with those aged 16 to 24 suffering the biggest drop in employment compared with other age groups. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said ""helping people get back into, or finding new work"" was his ""number one priority"". But in a briefing to the Cabinet on the economy, he reaffirmed a decision not to extend the government's Job Retention Scheme which ends on 31 October. Mr Sunak told colleagues that ""indefinitely keeping people out of work is not the answer"", but added that he would ""be creative"" in finding ways of helping people. New data from the Office for National Statistics,externalshowed that firms continued to remove staff from payrolls as they prepare for the end of the scheme. Some 695,000 UK workers disappeared from the payrolls of British companies since March, when the coronavirus lockdown began. Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? Meanwhile, there were 156,000 fewer young people in employment in the three months to July compared to the previous quarter. ""Generation Z has been hit particularly hard by the economic fall out of the pandemic as the retail and hospitality sectors, which have taken such a battering, are often relied on to help school and university leavers find an entry-level job, and get started in the world of work,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Sadly, this may not just be a bump in the road but could have long term consequences for the path of their careers."" The government haslaunched a scheme called Kickstartto create work placements for unemployed young people. Employers will be paid Â£1,500 for every 16-24 year old they train. The unemployment rate has risen slightly, but experts say it does not yet fully illustrate the full impact of the economic crisis on jobs, with the furlough scheme helping keep the numbers down. The government's Job Retention Scheme begins tapering off this month before ending on 31 October. Under the scheme - which has seen9.6 million people furloughed,external- the government initially paid 80% of a person's wages up to Â£2,500 a month. The women who started businesses in lockdown What's the best way to find a new job? Could UK adopt German or French scheme? Since the start of September, the state's contribution has fallen to 70%, with employers expected to make up the remainder of pay before the scheme ends on 31 October. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics research group, said he expected that ""employment will fall more sharply and unemployment will increase more quickly as the furlough scheme continues to unwind and ceases at the end of October"". ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said that there had been some signs that the economy ""reopened"" in July as businesses including restaurants, pubs and hairdressers were allowed to trade again. As people returned to work from being paid under the furlough scheme, the rate of decline in employee pay growth slowed. Meanwhile, job vacancies in the three months to August jumped by 30% to 434,000. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The family hit hard by unemployment However, the number of vacancies is still significantly below pre-virus levels. Mr Morgan said: ""With the number of employees on the payroll down again in August and both unemployment and redundancies sharply up in July, it is clear that coronavirus is still having a big impact on the world of work,"" he said. Mr Sunak told colleagues that it was important to remember that the ""significant support"" that had already been put in place had ""come at a cost"" and the economy was still nowhere near pre-Covid levels. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - addressing the TUC conference by video link, as he is self-isolating - called for an extension of part-time working as furlough comes to an end, with rewards for employers who keep people on, though he gave no detail of these rewards. He also called for targeted support for vulnerable sectors such as hospitality and aviation. He urged ministers to ""outlaw fire-and-rehire tactics"" where workers are made redundant, then taken on in worse conditions. Unfortunately, this is the start of the official unemployment numbers starting to go up, just ahead of the furlough scheme being phased out. While the headline unemployment rate went up to 4.1%, this is still low by historic and international standards. Digging a little deeper, however, shows a more considerable increase of 0.5% to 4.4% solely in July. And in the final week of July, it increased to 4.8%. This is the start of what economists and academics expect will be a sustained rise. The good news for now is that so far, the vast bulk of previously furloughed workers appear to have gone back to their jobs. The other very notable feature is that the overall three-month average rise in unemployment, while still small, was in large part the result of young people losing their jobs. Redundancies also went up to their highest level since the aftermath of the financial crisis. Employment remained at a record, however, and hours worked and vacancies showed a small recovery from massive falls during lockdown. So the climb has started slowly, but the concern now is, where exactly does this go? Orrean Jacob recently lost the job he had done for nine years, working at the Mini car factory in Oxford as an agency worker. ""They decided to let people go, and I was one of them,"" he says.Hundreds of workers at the plant were affected. ""It really hurt. When you go to work, it's not just about the money or pay. It's about making something of yourself, making friends and making connections."" Although he found himself in a similar position to many others during the pandemic, a phone call with a friend presented him with an opportunity. They recommended he get in touch with the HS2 rail project about their one-week training programmes. By the end of the following week, he was fully licensed to be on-site and drive a forklift, having completed a course worth about Â£1,000 with one of HS2's sub-contractors. ""This was just the push I needed in the right direction - to find something new, to find a new path to pursue because the other one clearly wasn't working.""

"This video can not be played Priti Patel challenged on coronavirus testing delays A lack of coronavirus tests for NHS staff is leading to staff absences and services being put at risk, hospital bosses have warned. NHS Providers, which represents English hospital trusts, said staff are having to self-isolate because they cannot get tests for themselves or family members. It comes after widespread reports ofpeople struggling to get tested. The home secretary said the government was ""surging capacity"" where it was needed. The government's testing system - part of its test, track and trace operation which Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpromised would be ""world-beating""- has faced criticism in recent weeks. An increase in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with some people beingdirected to test sites hundreds of milesfrom their homes. Meanwhile, there have been fewer than 100 Covid-19 deaths in a week in the UK for the first time since March, according to Office for National Statistics figures. There were 8,996 deaths were registered in the UK in the week of 4 September - 83 of those deaths mentioned coronavirus, the lowest figure since the week of 13 March. How do I get a coronavirus test? Scotland: Why is there a test results backlog? 18,000 Covid-19 test results put online by mistake Motorists have been collecting tests from a centre set up in a park in London Around 220,000 tests are processed each day, according togovernment figures released last week,external, with a testing capacity of more than 350,000 - which includes swab tests and antibody tests. The aim is to increase that to 500,000 a day by the end of October. Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast said: ""I haven't said there's a shortage of tests, what I have said is that we're surging capacity in areas where we've had local lockdowns. ""Clearly there is much more work that needs to be undertaken with Public Health England and the actual public health bodies in those particular local areas, and as a government obviously we work with Public Health England to surge where there is demand in local hotspot areas."" Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there had been ""challenges in access to tests"" but said ""the vast majority of people get their tests rapidly and close to home"". Hesuggested demand from people who did not have symptomswas partly to blame for the shortages. NHS Providers said hospitals in London, Bristol and Leeds had raised concerns over the weekend about staff absences because of a lack of testing. Chris Hopson, NHS Providers chief executive, said it was ""clear"" there were capacity problems. ""It's not just access for tests for staff members themselves, it's also access for their family members as NHS workers have to self-isolate if their family members are unable to confirm if they have Covid-19 or not. ""The problem is that NHS trusts are working in the dark - they don't know why these shortages are occurring, how long they are likely to last, how geographically widespread they are likely to be and what priority will be given to healthcare workers and their families in accessing scarce tests."" YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? Mr Hopson said trusts need to know more detail so they can plan accordingly, for example by creating their own testing facilities. He said patients who are due to come in for treatment should also be prioritised for tests. Some people say they booked tests online only to be turned away from testing centres because they were not sent a QR code - a barcode that can be scanned on a smartphone. One doctor working in a coronavirus hotspot said she applied for a test for herself and her partner after they developed coughs and fevers. After refreshing the website for five hours, she managed to get an appointment but on arrival was told no booking had been made. She had taken screenshots of a confirmation code but was not sent a QR code to scan. ""I showed the screenshots but I was told that the appointments weren't happening,"" she said. ""I have to say I burst into tears. I was meant to be seeing patients and I feel guilty."" This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people trying to get tests at a centre in Oldham A nurse in the South West, whose daughter had a persistent cough and temperature, said he had almost been turned away despite having a test booked. After hours of trying, he had ""eventually"" booked at a site about 50 miles away and been sent a confirmation but no QR code. And on arrival at the testing site, he had been told he could not have a test. ""I was told, 'There is nothing we can do,' at first,"" he said. Eventually, he applied for the first testing appointment he could find anywhere in the country - in this case, about 500 miles away in Dundee - and managed to get a QR code. By Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter NHS Providers said the lack of testing was also hindering preparations for the winter, when hospitals could become busier due to Covid-19 and seasonal flu. Dr Rachel Ward, a GP in Newbury, told BBC Breakfast she was seeing a lot of patients who were struggling to get tests, saying a lot of families were ""at the end of their tether"" as it was ""very stressful when you are faced with two weeks off work"". She said if the staff at her practice were unable to get tests and had to self-isolate it would have a ""huge impact"" on patients as some of their healthcare workers are booked in to administer 100 flu jabs in a day. Shila Rawson, from Leicestershire, told the BBC she has been unable to get a test for her daughter, Leah, who has been displaying symptoms of Covid-19 since Sunday. She said she was told by a 111 clinician, who was unable to arrange a test, ""don't be afraid to call 999 if your daughter's lips turns blue and she has severe difficulty with breathing"". ""I read that as wait and watch until our daughter is near enough to intensive care,"" she said. ""And that is just not acceptable at any level."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check looks at why testing matters Prof Alan McNally, director of the institute of microbiology and infection at the University of Birmingham, who helped set up one testing centre - the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab - told BBC Breakfast there was ""a perfect storm of events that have come together to almost essentially crash the testing system"". Asked about the situation in Birmingham, wherenew lockdown measures have come into force, he said it was ""the exact same as we're hearing in other parts of the country... lots of people struggling to get tests and no real quantity of information on why that's the case"". One professor of medicine who has been advising the government has said that a ""second wave"" of Covid-19 has led to a surge in demand for tests. Sir John Bell, of Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think what has been underestimated was the speed at which the second wave would arrive, but also the pressure put on the system from children returning to school."" Meanwhile, the chairman of the British Medical Association has said the government should focus on the current testing system - rather than its ""Operation Moonshot"" plan which aims to see millions of tests processed every day by using a new type of test which is not yet rolled out. ""Down here on planet Earth, we need a fit for purpose test and trace system in the here and now with capacity, agility and accessibility that doesn't require 100-mile journeys that disadvantage some of the most vulnerable,"" the BMA's Dr Chaand Nagpaul is expected to say in a speech later on Tuesday. Mr Johnsonpreviously saida mass-testing programme could be ready by the spring and could help the UK to avoid a second national lockdown. MINDFUL ESCAPES:Why is breathing so important?

"The government has said it is willing to drop parts of a controversial piece of legislation - the Internal Market Bill - which had the potential to further complicate the already tense trade talks between the UK and the EU. It contains measures relating to the way trade will be done between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the future. They would only come into force if the UK and the EU failed to reach a trade deal. But they would overrule parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement the UK signed with the EU last year. The House of Lordsvoted to remove the offending clausesfrom the bill in November but the House of Commons then voted to reinstate them. The government now says it is willing to withdraw them because of an ""agreement in principle"" on a range of issues affecting Northern Ireland. So, what is the controversy about? The withdrawal agreement (also known as the Brexit ""divorce deal"") includes a section - or protocol - on Northern Ireland, and it is now an international treaty. Article 4 of the agreement says the provisions of the treaty take legal precedence over anything in the UK's domestic law. So if any of the proposals in theInternal Market Bill,externalthat contradict the withdrawal agreement actually became law, it would breach the government's international obligations. That is what the Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis referred to in September when he spoke about breaking international law in a ""very specific and limited way"". Breaking the law, though, is still breaking the law. The overall aim of the Northern Ireland protocol was to avoid the return of a ""hard"" land border between Northern Ireland, in the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, in the EU. All sides agreed they did not want the return of border checks - or other physical infrastructure - that could become a target. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? One of the solutions in the treaty was to keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 It promised to maintain unfettered access for Northern Ireland goods to the rest of the UK but also introduced new bureaucracy for trade across the Irish Sea. The way these measures will be implemented on the ground have been negotiated by UK and EU officials, who have been meeting in a joint committee for the past few months. If there was no agreement by the end of the transition period, on 31 December 2020, and there was no free-trade deal, that is when parts of this new proposed legislation would have come into play. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. For example, the protocol states that companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) would have to fill out export declaration forms. But the government's Internal Market Bill would give ministers the right to overrule or ignore this part of EU customs law. Another part of the protocol says the UK has to follow EU rules on state aid - the financial support governments give to businesses - for goods related to Northern Ireland. But the Internal Market Bill would give ministers power to interpret what that means and says this should not be done in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Justice. The EU said this was trying to change parts of a recently-agreed international treaty unilaterally. And when the legislation was first published, US President-elect Joe Biden warned that the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland ""cannot become a casualty of Brexit"". But on 8 December, the UK and EU announced an""an agreement in principle"",externalon issues including border control posts, the supply of food and medicines and clarification around state aid in Northern Ireland. As a result, the government said it would drop the controversial clauses in the bill. The Internal Market Bill only deals with trade from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, but the debate about goods moving in the opposite direction is equally sensitive. The protocol says the joint committee is supposed to determine which goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are ""at risk"" of being exported over the Irish border to the EU and should therefore have tariffs - taxes on imports - imposed on them. If there was no agreement between the two sides, then the default position would be tariffs paid on all goods. The UK had plans, due to be introduced in a Taxation Bill, to allow UK ministers to make unilateral decisions on which goods could be deemed as ""at risk"" - after 1 January. But, as a result of the ""agreement in principle"" - the government says these measures won't now be introduced. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The genetically modified goats are a ""proof in principle"", say scientists Scientists have produced gene-edited animals they say could serve as ""super dads"" or ""surrogate sires"". The pigs, goats, cattle and mice make sperm carrying the genetic material of donor animals. The researchers used a hi-tech gene editing tool to knock out a male fertility gene in animal embryos. The animals were born sterile, but began producing sperm after an injection of sperm-producing cells from donor animals. The technique would enable surrogate males to sire offspring carrying the genetic material of valuable elite animals such as prize bulls, said a US-UK team. This would be a step towards genetically enhancing livestock to improve food production, they added. Prof Jon Oatley, of Washington State University's College of Veterinary Medicine, said: ""This can have a major impact on addressing food insecurity around the world. If we can tackle this genetically, then that means less water, less feed and fewer antibiotics we have to put into the animals."" Bull ""super dads"" could be used to sire healthier or meatier cows The surrogate sires were confirmed to have active donor sperm. And the mice fathered healthy offspring that carried the genes of the sperm donor. The larger animals have not yet been bred. But Prof Bruce Whitelaw of the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh said the study provided a powerful proof of concept. ""This shows the world that this technology is real. It can be used,"" he said. ""We now have to go in and work out how best to use it productively to help feed our growing population."" According to the researchers, the technology could also help in the conservation of endangered species. It might be possible, for example, to use the frozen sperm of an endangered rhino to regenerate the species. But they said the speed at which the science could be put into action will be influenced by policymakers. Gene-edited livestock have yet to be granted approval for human consumption, with concerns over product safety, ethics, and animal welfare. Prof Jon Oatley says genetic techniques could address food insecurity Gene editing involves deleting or changing coding in embryos. One example of current technology is CRISPR, a biological system for altering DNA discovered in 2012. CRISPR scans the genome looking for the location of a certain gene and then uses ""molecular scissors"" to snip through the DNA. While effective in the lab, the process is less than perfect and can cut out too much DNA. These unwanted edits could alter other important genes. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics is examining the ethical issues raised by the use of gene-editing techniques in farmed animals. Potential applications of gene-editing technology include genetically hornless cows, and pigs or chickens that are resistant to diseases. Gene-editing could form part of the response to many of the challenges facing societies in different parts of the world, including securing access to healthy and nutritious food, said director Hugh Whittall. ""Whether and to what extent genome editing can and should be deployed outside the research setting will depend on further research and development progressing in alignment with societal values and interests that have, in many cases, yet to be clearly defined,"" he told BBC News. ""These are among the questions that we are exploring in our current inquiry on genome editing and farmed animals."" The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"Polly has lived in a small campervan for more than a year ""I don't want to live like this, no-one should live like this - but I don't have any options,"" says Polly Richardson who finds herself at the sharp end of the lack of affordable homes in England. For more than a year, she has lived out of a small camper van. ""This is my home. I've two sets of clothes in a box. I've got my cups and saucers in this drawer, my pans under this bed, and I have a little camping cooker. ""Winter time was horrendous because there was no heating."" The 59-year-old grandmother of four from East Yorkshire is one of half-a-million households that aren't even counted as waiting for a council or housing association property, according to the National Housing Federation. New research commissioned by the Federation from Heriot-Watt University says the real number of people in England waiting for such homes is 3.8 million, representing 1.6 million households, or 500,000 more than is indicated by official government data. ""I've got belongings in people's garages,"" says Polly. She spent years working as a retail manager but after taking time off to look after her sick father, and then having a big argument with her sister, she found herself being forced to move into the van in March 2019. ""Without a job, you can't have a house. Without a house, they won't give you a job. I'm hoping somebody out there will give me a job,"" she says. Landlords 'ban' benefits claimants despite ruling Coronavirus: Call to lift benefits to help renters Legal victories over 'No DSS' letting agents The National Housing Federation say 90,000 homes for social rent need to be built each year for the next decade to meet demand but, according to official figures, just 6,338 such homes were completed in 2018-19, down 84% since 2010-11. The main advantage of social housing - where either the local council or a housing association are the landlord - is that it's more affordable than private rented accommodation, typically around 50% of market rents, and usually offers a more secure tenancy. ""What we are seeing is an escalating need for social housing and a lack of supply,"" says Kate Henderson, chief executive of the National Housing Federation. ""Investing in social housing would boost the economy, it would create thousands of jobs, it would support supply chains in the construction industry and it would provide better, more secure, safe housing for people in need."" The lack of suitable properties leaves large numbers of families living in overcrowded accommodation. Abigail McManus, a 27-year-old single mother lives in a two-bedroom flat in Leeds with her three young children - two daughters aged six and two and a little boy who's five months old. Leaving her house is a daily grind as she struggles to manoeuvre her double buggy down the stairs. Abigail has been bidding weekly for a three-bedroomed ground floor property for years, without success. She says the council are encouraging her to search further afield to increase her chances being allocated somewhere suitable to live. But she says: ""My whole family live on this estate, so I'd like to try and stay as close as possible. ""As a single parent, who doesn't drive, it would be hard for me to get anywhere and I'd feel more isolated than I already do, if I move too far from this area."" Mum of three Abigail McManus struggles to get her double buggy into her flat When she was prime minister, Theresa May altered the way in which councils could use funding to allow them to build more homes. Her government predicted the change would lead to 10,000 new council houses each year, a figure that hasn't been reached since 2013-14. While local authorities believe building that number is possible, experts say the pandemic could create problems in the construction industry. The Ministry of Housing said it ""didn't recognise"" the figures in the new analysis carried out by the National Housing Federation, describing them as a ""major overestimation"". It also highlighted its Â£11.5bn investment in affordable homes, to be spent between 2021 and 2026, some of which will be used on building homes for social rent.

"German carmaker Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz, has agreed to pay $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) to resolve US government claims that it designed its diesel vehicles to cheat air pollution tests. The firm was investigated for installing software to evade emissions laws in 250,000 Mercedes cars and vans. US officials said they hoped the fine would deter future misbehaviour. Daimler called the deal an ""important step"" towards resolving diesel proceedings but denied the claims. ""By resolving these proceedings, Daimler avoids lengthy court actions with respective legal and financial risks,"" the company said. In addition to the $1.5bn settlement with US authorities, Daimler said it had agreed to pay $700m to settle a class action lawsuit brought by owners. It also disclosed ""further expenses of a mid three-digit-million EUR amount to fulfil requirements of the settlements."" The deals, which Daimler had said it was nearing last month, conclude an investigation that the US started in 2016, after ""defeat devices"" were discovered through testing. Officials said that an $875m fine included in the $1.5bn settlement with authorities is the second-largest civil penalty the US has ever imposed under its Clear Air Act and the largest if measured on a per-vehicle basis. Daimler has also agreed to fix the affected cars, which were sold between 2009 and 2016, at no cost to their owners. US officials said that commitment was worth about $400m. At a press conference on Monday, Andrew Wheeler, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, said: ""The message we are sending today is clear: We will enforce the law. ""If you try to cheat the system and mislead the public, you will be caught. Those whoÂ violate public trust in pursuit of profits will forfeit both."" The penalties are the latest in a wide-ranging scandal that has cast a cloud over the motor industry since 2015, whenVolkswagen admitted to installing secret softwareon vehicles sold in the US. The system allowed the cars to emit up to 40 times legally permitted emissions and evade detection during tests. Volkswagen later admitted the devices affected more than 11 million vehicles globally. The company more than $20bn to resolve claims in the US alone. But investigations soon widened to other companies, including Ford, Mitsubishi, and Nissan.
