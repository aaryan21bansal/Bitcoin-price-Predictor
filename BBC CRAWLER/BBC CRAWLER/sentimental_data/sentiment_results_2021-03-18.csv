"The sprawling Waterside complex opened in the 1990s. British Airways will let staff split their working lives between the head office and home in another example of big firms offering flexible employment. The airline is also exploring the sale of its huge Waterside HQ near Heathrow Airport, where 2,000 people worked before the coronavirus lockdown. ""It's not clear if such a large office will play a part in our future,"" BA said in a message to staff. The firm is in a race to cut costs after the virus led travel to collapse. BA, part of the IAG airline group that also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, has shed more than 10,000 jobs and is raising billions of pounds of extra cash from shareholders to shore up its finances. 'Hybrid working will become the norm' BP staff set to work from home two days a week Stuart Kennedy, the airline's director of people, said in his message to staff that one of the very few positives to come out of the pandemic was how well staff had coped with working from home. ""We'll want to consider what the ideal office layout for the future will be. Perhaps it's less fixed desks and more casual meeting areas, and we need to consider colleague wellbeing, too,"" he said. However, he emphasised that plans to sell Waterside were still at a very early stage. It is thought the airline has only recently hired property consultants to evaluate options. In a separate statement to the BBC, BA said on Thursday: ""The global pandemic has shown us that many of our colleagues enjoy working remotely and want to continue, and this has accelerated our approach to offering more agile and flexible ways of working. ""Our aim is to find a hybrid working model that suits our business, blending the best of office and remote working for our people. We've also re-structured our business to emerge from the crisis and are considering whether we still have the need for such a large headquarters building."" The move to hybrid working after the pandemic is growing. The Nationwide building society has indicated that it does not intend to force people to return to the office if they have been successfully able to work from home during the pandemic. Oil giant BP has told office-based staff they can spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease. And banks HSBC and Lloyds are among many other companies looking into split working arrangements. Earlier this month the boss of IWG, which provides office space across the world, told the BBC he expected hybrid working ""to become the norm"" for many companies. Mark Dixon said: ""It works for companies, because it's a lot cheaper. It's also much, much better for the environment.""

"Merthyr Tydfil has a seven-day case rate of 159.1 per 100,000 population compared to the Wales average of 43.3 Extended households and workplaces are behind a rise in Covid cases in Merthyr Tydfil, a health chief has said. The flare-up was down to ""a bit of a loss of discipline"" said Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, director of public health for Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board. Localised hotpot Gellideg and Merthyr Town has had 44 cases in the past week, nearly half of those in the local area. The county has a seven-day case rate of 159.1 per 100,000 population compared to the Wales average of 43.3. This was the fourth highest case rate in the UK on Thursday. Covid rules currently allow most people toonly meet indoors with people they live with. Merthyr council has responded by setting up a mobile testing unit at the Swansea Road estate. Merthyr Tydfil's 'closeness and community' spreading virus The hotspot in Gellideg and Town is at a rate of 625.6 per 100,000 for the past seven days, by far the highest of these localised case rates in Wales. Dr Nnoaham toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: ""We have identified about four different clusters that are largely responsible for the increase in cases that we have had. ""We know that a number of workplaces have been involved in this cluster, we know there has been an extended household cluster in one of the areas. ""I think we understand exactly why this has happened and I just want to use the opportunity to appeal to people out there that whilst we're making progress in the vaccination programme we're by no means home and dry and we still need to maintain those precautions and be extra vigilant."" Covid-19 cases are rising in Merthyr Tydfil He said the spread was largely down to young people in the area. ""When we looked at the age profile of the majority of the cases and these clusters, what we're talking about is largely young people who have not had their vaccination,"" he said. ""And secondly, it does appear that the loss of discipline around the social distancing [and] face masks has been more likely in the younger populations. ""There's a bit of a loss of discipline that has happened more recently"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Town's schools could shut to curb Covid flare-up Vaccine supplies to be delayed 'up to four weeks' He urged people to watch Saturday's Grand Slam between Wales and Franceat home and not with friends and family. Only those who live alone, are single and live in a house share, single parents, families with babies and 16 and 17-year-olds who do not live with an adult had been able to form a so-called ""support bubble"". Four people from two households can meet outdoors to socialise, including in gardens. A graffiti artist hopes his work around valleys communities will remind people to wear their masks The case rate in Merthyr Tydfil was again the highest case rate in Wales. This is the highest point reached locally in the past six weeks, but still a long way from the levels seen in previous months. Cases in the area hit a peak of 1,349 per 100,000 on 18 December,two days before Wales was placed under a national lockdown, with the county having the worst case rate in the UK. At the time officials blamed the spike in cases on the""closeness"" and ""tight-knit"" nature of valleys communities, with people living close to extended family and friends and popping round to check on their neighbours. In an area with high rates of deprivation, there were also concerns about people having to make tough choices between going to work to get paid and isolating if contacted by tracers. At the start of February there was a feeling of hope as case rates fell to some of the lowest in Wales, but there were warnings they could rise again as people became weary of lockdown measures.

"Adele Thomas and her partner Stephen got to hold Zak before he died while he was on life support There was a ""gross failure in basic care"" which led to a baby being starved of oxygen during birth, a coroner said. Zak Ezra Carter died at the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, two days after being born in July 2018 at Ystrad Fawr Hospital in Caerphilly county. Gwent coroner Caroline Saunders said the monitoring of Zak and his mother Adele Thomas fell ""well below the standards expected"". She said she was reassured the health board had taken steps to improve care. Ms Thomas told the Newport hearing she felt ""scared"" and staff ""didn't care"" when she arrived to give birth on 20 July 2018. In a statement to the inquest she described being turned away from the centre after going into labour on three occasions, before being admitted on the fourth. On one occasion, she said she was told she might benefit from a walk around a nearby Tesco store. Ms Thomas said she was initially offered paracetamol as pain relief at the midwife-led centre. She described ""a lot of arguing between nurses"", one of whom was ""bolshie and rude and rough handled me"", adding the midwives ""did not appear to be in any rush"". When Zak was born, he was described as being ""white and pale"" and without a heartbeat. He did not cry and was taken away to a room for resuscitation. Zak was transferred to the Royal Gwent Hospital where he died two days later. Ms Thomas gave birth at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly county The inquest heard Anthony Ridge Blackwell, an operating department practitioner from elsewhere in the hospital, was called to the birthing centre while paramedics were on their way. In a statement, he said he was initially unable to access the unit because the doors were locked. He said the ""lack of urgency was very apparent"" among staff, who he described as ""clearly upset and hugging each other"". Mr Blackwell said he had to search for equipment among ""very limited resources"" before providing basic life support to Zak until paramedics arrived with more equipment. Midwife Theresa Ward told the coroner she came into the birthing room to assist midwife Lisa Gibson, who has been off work with stress since. She said she had previously raised concerns about Ms Gibson's work with her superiors, and so on this occasion went in earlier than she normally would to help with the birth. In a statement, Ms Gibson said she had retrospectively recorded observations taken during labour. Ms Ward said the chart used to keep a record of the observations was not in the birthing room when she went in and ""didn't think to get it"". She said she did not ""go in and take over"" but suggested Ms Thomas changed her position to help with the birth. At one point, Ms Ward said she could not hear a heartbeat but Ms Gibson said she could faintly hear one. When she checked again five minutes later and still could not hear a heartbeat, Ms Ward said she told Ms Gibson to ""get the baby out"" by carrying out an episiotomy. Adele Thomas' son Zak was born ""white and pale"" without a heartbeat, she told an inquest The coroner heard Ms Gibson spent time looking for the equipment and words were exchanged about the urgency. When she was asked why she did not take over, Ms Ward said she did not know why she did not. Before the episiotomy was carried out, the inquest heard Zak's head and shoulders had emerged. Ms Ward said once he was born she carried Zak to the resuscitation area and attempted to revive him until two men she did not know arrived and took over. She said they did not have some of the equipment the men asked for and there were no drugs for babies on the birthing unit, only for mothers. Dr David Phillips, a consultant anaesthetist, was asked to go to the birthing unit and said he found internal doors were locked and had received ""vague instructions"" about how to find Zak. Dr Phillips told the coroner he did not recall ""any active resuscitation"" when he arrived, and Zak was grey and lifeless so he and Mr Blackwell immediately started CPR. He said he was not given any handover or description of the circumstances of the birth, adding ""communication was quite difficult"". The two members of staff seemed to be too emotional to help - one or both were in tears, he said. Dr Phillips said some of the equipment he would have expected was not available until paramedics arrived. He said a combination of CPR, adrenaline, defibrillation and intubation led to Zak's condition improving enough to be transferred to the Royal Gwent Hospital. Julia Sanders, a professor of clinical nursing and midwifery with Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, carried out an independent investigation into what happened. Prof Sanders told the coroner there was nothing to indicate the birthing centre at Ystrad Fawr Hospital was an inappropriate place for Ms Thomas to give birth. During the first stage of labour, Prof Sanders said ""everything was progressing at a normal healthy rate and the fetal heart rate was recorded as completely normal"". But she said it was ""highly unusual"" for the heart rate to not be documented contemporaneously, and the midwives had not been able to explain why they had not done so. Louise Taylor, a consultant midwife at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, told the hearing an action plan had been implemented to address many of the concerns raised by the hearing and investigation. Recording a narrative conclusion, Ms Saunders said the monitoring of Ms Thomas and her baby had ""fallen well below the standards expected"", leading to a ""gross failure in basic care"" of them in the later stages of labour. The coroner said she was satisfied that when Dr Phillips arrived in the birthing unit ""no-one was resuscitating Zak and no-one voluntarily handed over what had happened"". However, she said she was reassured Aneurin Bevan University health board had taken steps to improve and monitor the care provided in the future. Speaking after the hearing, Zak's parents said they were disappointed with the conclusion. Ms Thomas, who has since gone on to have a baby girl, said she had felt helpless during Zak's birth. She said she was ""angry"", ""bitter"" and sad following the ""dark few months of the immediate aftermath"". She said the new baby had ""definitely saved us"". Ms Thomas added: ""We think of Zak every single day... we'll never forget him."" A spokesman for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said: ""Our condolences and deepest sympathy continue to be with Zak's parents and family. ""This matter was fully investigated by the health Board and failings in care were identified. The investigation findings were shared openly with Zak's parents and the health board has sincerely apologised to them. ""We recognise however, that an apology will never make up for the pain and suffering they have experienced losing a child."" It said neither of the two midwives still worked for the health board but added it was ""determined to learn from this tragic incident to prevent this from happening again"".

"Some 1,200 people are said to be in intensive care in hospitals across Paris The French capital is set to go into a month-long Covid lockdown as the country fears a third wave. Some 21 million people in 16 areas of France will be placed under the measures from midnight on Friday. These measures will not be as strict as the previous lockdown, Prime Minister Jean Castex said, with people allowed to exercise outdoors. France has recorded more than 35,000 new infections within the past 24 hours. Mr Castex said a ""third wave"" of infections in the country was looking increasingly likely. The situation in Paris is particularly worrying with 1,200 people in intensive care there, more than at the peak of the second wave in November, Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said. Under the new measures, non-essential businesses will be forced to close, but schools will remain open, along with hairdressers if they follow a ""particular sanitary protocol"". Government spokesman Gabriel Attal stressed there would be differences with the two earlier lockdowns and said further details would be given of which business could stay open or would have to shut. People will be allowed to exercise outdoors within 10km (6 miles) of their home and are not allowed to travel to other parts of the country unless they have a valid reason. Those in the affected areas will have to fill out a form to explain why they have left their homes. There is a weary resignation about Paris, as people prepare for another four weeks of tedium. Yes, we know this third lockdown won't be quite as bad as the second - which was itself a lighter version of the first. But still. Another month of bits of paper for the police; another month of having to justify a trip to the supermarket; another month without meaningful social contact. It's enough to drive you to distraction. France's SNCF train company reported a surge in bookings ahead of the new lockdown Except it hasn't. In general, most Parisians simply knuckle under. Those who can are leaving by train or car, but because schools are staying open, most families will stick it out in the city. Everyone's made the calculation. The long Easter weekend in two weeks is a bust. But the Paris school holidays start on 17 April - exactly when the lockdown is supposed to end. That's the light that will keep people going. Spring break. As well as the greater Paris region, the northern Hauts-de-France, Seine-Maritime and Eure areas will go under lockdown as well as the Alpes-Maritimes on the French Riviera. France's nationwide curfew will remain in place. However, it will begin an hour later at 19:00 (18:00 GMT), taking into account the longer hours of daylight. Europe in vaccine race to save summer EU agency says AstraZeneca is 'safe and effective' This video can not be played French lockdown highlights small business struggles (November 2020 report) Fears of a third wave come as the French government faces criticism for its slow vaccine rollout. From Friday, France will resume vaccinating using the AstraZeneca jabfollowing the EMA's announcement that it was fit for use. Mr Castex said he would be getting the vaccine straight away to prove that it was OK. France had suspended the jab after a number of people in Europe reported blood clots developing after the vaccine was administered. A survey conducted just as the suspension was announced found that only 20% of the French have confidence in AstraZeneca.

"Faith, 17, was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder aged 14, after having symptoms for many years Since she was a child, Faith has suffered from intrusive thoughts. The 17-year-old from Wrexham, who was the Wales winner of theBBC Young Reporter competition, was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) after many years of symptoms. Since her diagnosis, Faith has become a young ambassador for the charity OCD-UK. Here she shares her experiences of OCD and highlights what help is available to help others with the condition. This video can not be played Faith lived with undiagnosed OCD for about five years My name is Faith and I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. OCD affects about 750,000 people in the UK alone. Thoughts and images are involuntary. It's a way anxious brains try and overcompensate to make sure you don't have accidents. I had undiagnosed OCD for about five years at least. I didn't know what it was so I didn't know how to cope with it properly. I assumed it was some sort of depression or anxiety disorder, I had no idea it was OCD. Most people think of the stereotypical ""oh, I like things nice and tidy"" and I had that perception too, but that's not all OCD is. I thought trying to fight my thoughts would make them go away, but it didn't. Whatever points you try and make, OCD comes up with a completely absurd answer for everything. I would describe myself as having ""pure O"".  It's not a medical term, it's definitely more colloquial. But it basically refers to people with OCD whose compulsions are mainly mental and that's me. Intrusive thoughts have many different themes and they're different for everyone. Everyone gets intrusive thoughts whether they have OCD or not. But while everyone gets them, people with OCD react very differently because of our brain chemistry. OCD: 'It's not about being tidy' Call for further improvement in mental health care Love Island star: Talking may have saved brother I'd develop this dependency on other people to fight my anxiety for me, which isn't a long-term coping mechanism, sadly. The saddest thing is that everyone with OCD just wants to be happy and this is why we perform the compulsions even though we know they're irrational -  they're a safety blanket. But they make everything a million times worse. They feed the cycle of compulsions feeding the obsessions and it's very time-consuming and painful. The danger with mental compulsions is that they are completely invisible to most people and they don't know that they're a symptom of OCD. As they're so shameful, people don't talk about them and it goes undiagnosed in a lot of cases. OCD is a mental illness so you can't just take medication and it goes away, but you can effectively recover from it to a point where it doesn't affect your life anymore. This is achieved through medication, exposure, response prevention and cognitive behaviour therapy, a mix of any of those can really help improve your quality of life. As an OCD-UK young ambassador, we have a group chat and we talk to each other every day. We know how each other is getting on and know how to help each other. We don't give in to our compulsions, we work together. It's an amazing little community that I'm very proud to be part of. This story has been produced as part of BBC Young Reporter scheme. The project works with thousands of young people every year - giving them the chance to get involved in media skills and training, as well as opportunities to tell their own stories.

"BBC director general Tim Davie has said the plans will ""get us closer to audiences, create jobs and investment"" The BBC is to move some of its key departments and staff outside London to make the corporation more reflective of the UK as a whole. It said its plans represent a ""top-to-bottom change"" and its biggest transformation in decades. Entire departments and news divisions will be moved to Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Glasgow and Salford. The BBC's 22,000 employees, many of whom are currently working from home, were briefed on the plans on Thursday. The plans include: A new version of BBC One tailored for audiences in Yorkshire, the North West and the North East of England. Two new soap-style network drama series - one from the North of England and another from one of the Nations - produced over the next three years. The BBC has a commitment to commission and produce ""a clear majority"" of TV programmes across the UK and not in London ""Our mission must be to deliver for the whole of the UK and ensure every household gets value from the BBC,"" said director general Tim Davie. ""These plans will get us closer to audiences, create jobs and investment, and develop and nurture new talent."" Other changes to the corporation will include: News and current affairs programmes like BBC Two's Newsnight being presented from different UK bases through the year. Radio 4's flagship Today programme to be co-presented from outside London for at least 100 episodes a year. Key daytime strands on Radio 1, 1Xtra and Radio 2 will be moved from London and made across the UK. Radio 3 will be rooted in Salford, along with the majority of 6 Music. Radio 1's Newsbeat team will relocate to Birmingham, which will also be the base for the Asian Network. BBC News's Climate and Science team will move to Cardiff, while the Technology team will shift to Glasgow. The Learning and Identity News team will go to Leeds. The BBC World Service Business team will be moved to Salford, with cuts to global business and economics coverage. A new generation of 100 new reporters to be based in towns and areas that have never had a regional TV presence. The BBC Concert Orchestra and some Proms to leave London, plus a music events calendar more rooted across the UK. Mr Davie said the BBC had been ""an essential part of the UK's culture, democracy and creativity for almost a century"" and had faced some of its ""toughest moments"" over the last year. ""Now, as we look to the future, we must play our part in supporting social and economic recovery; rebuilding the creative sector and telling the stories that need to be heard from all corners of the UK."" The BBC newsroom is based in New Broadcasting House, London Plans set out in detail in the BBC's 13-page Across the UK document include: A commitment to commission and produce ""a clear majority"" of TV programmes across the UK and not in London. A commitment to locate 50% of the money spent on network radio and music outside London by 2028. The moving of major parts of BBC News to locations across the UK. More investment in BBC local reporting and apprenticeships. An upgrade of the BBC's Belfast headquarters. In an address to staff on Thursday morning, Mr Davie said the plans would make the BBC ""a genuinely UK-wide organisation"" and ""a post-Covid success story admired worldwide"". ""People must feel we are closer to them,"" he said. ""This shift will create a much more distributed model that moves not just people, but power and decision-making to the UK's Nations and regions. ""Taken together, our proposals mean the BBC will cumulatively spend at least an extra Â£700m outside London by 2027/28."" Broadcasting trade union Bectu said it was ""good to see the BBC wanting to build on its strong local offering and prioritise getting closer to communities"". But its ""immediate concern"" was how the plans would affect is members, adding ""the devil will be in the detail"". It said it would examine the proposals closely to ensure ""workers are properly supported through these changes and that the need for redundancies is minimised"". MP Julian Knight, chairman of the DCMS committee, said it welcomed the BBC's decision to ""rebalance"" and ""give licence fee payers greater bang for their buck"". He expressed caution over the financial implications, however, saying he hoped the BBC would not repeat ""some of the costly mistakes made by the BBC in its previous move to Salford"". When Mr Davie was named the BBC's new director general last June, he said the BBC's mission had ""never been more relevant, important or necessary"". ""Looking forward, we will need to accelerate change so that we serve all our audiences in this fast-moving world,"" he said. When he took over the job later in the year, he said there had to be ""a radical shift"" in the BBC's focus to ensure everyone got value from the licence fee. ""If current trends continue, we will not feel indispensable enough to all our audience,"" he said. ""We must evolve to protect what we cherish.""

"Ms Sturgeon gave evidence to the inquiry in a marathon eight-hour session earlier this month A majority of MSPs on the Alex Salmond committee have said Nicola Sturgeon misled their inquiry, sources have told the BBC. It is understood MSPs on the committee voted by five to four that the SNP leader had given them an inaccurate account. The committee's final report is expected to be published next Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon has insisted she stands by all of the evidence she gave to the committee earlier this month. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has called for the first minister to resign. However, Ms Sturgeon told Sky News: ""What has been clear is that opposition members of this committee made their minds up before I uttered a single word of evidence. Their public comments have made that clear. Laura Kuenssberg: 'More than Nicola Sturgeon's future' ""So this very partisan leak tonight before they've actually finalised the report is not that surprising. ""Let's wait and see the final report, but more importantly the question of whether or not I breached the ministerial code is being considered independently by James Hamilton and I hope and expect he will publish that report soon."" Mr Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer, has been specifically examining whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code, which says that any minister who knowingly misleads parliament would be ""expected to offer their resignation"". His inquiry is separate from the committee and is also expected to publish its report in the coming days. What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon? Watch - Panorama: Salmond V Sturgeon The cross-party committee includes four SNP MSPs, two Conservatives, one Labour, one Liberal Democrat and independent Andy Wightman. A spokesman for the Scottish Parliament said the committee was still finalising its report, and it would not make any comment until it was published. Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond - her predecessor as first minister and SNP leader - have both taken part  in lengthy evidence sessions in front of the committee in recent weeks. Mr Salmond claimed to have been the victim of a ""malicious scheme"" drawn up by figures within the SNP who are close to Ms Sturgeon. Mr Salmond was Ms Sturgeon's political mentor, but the pair have been embroiled in an increasingly bitter war of words But Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that any suggestion there had been conspiracy were ""absurd"", and insisted she had not been out to ""get"" Mr Salmond. She told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that Mr Salmond and his ""cronies"" In the ""old boys' club"" had been spinning ""conspiracy theories"" which opposition politicians had bought into. It came after Conservative MP David Davis - a longstanding friend of Mr Salmond - used parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons to read out messages that he suggested showed a ""concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints"" against the former first minister. Nicola Sturgeon did not intervene in the investigation into harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. The dispute is about whether or not she was ever prepared to. Alex Salmond claims she was and is backed up in that by his lawyer, Duncan Hamilton who went with him to see Nicola Sturgeon on 2 April 2018. Nicola Sturgeon claims she made clear an intervention would not be possible, although she has also acknowledged that in trying to let Mr Salmond down gently she may not have been blunt enough. Her testimony is understood to be supported by written evidence from one of her colleagues, shared with the committee in private. The opposition majority appears to have found Team Salmond's evidence more persuasive. SNP members refuse to accept Team Sturgeon has given a misleading account. With the committee divided along party lines over the first minister's conduct, the conclusions of James Hamilton - the Irish lawyer who's independently examining the evidence - gain ever greater importance. Some MSPs on the committee - including the SNP MSP who chairs it - have accused the government of attempting to frustrate its work Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""All the evidence points to the fact that Nicola Sturgeon misled parliament, misled the people of Scotland and has to resign. ""I have said for weeks that evidence against Nicola Sturgeon has been mounting, it has been growing and it is clear she has breached the ministerial code. ""You cannot continue as first minister of Scotland if you have misled Parliament and breached the ministerial code."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said it would be ""incredibly serious"" if the committee concluded that the first minister had misled parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code. He added: ""This is about the integrity of our Scottish Parliament and upholding standards in public life.""

"India has been conducting door-to-door vaccination campaigns India has missed the target of giving its entire adult population of 940 million two vaccinations by the end of 2021. The target was first announced by Prakash Javadekar in May, who was a minister in the federal government at the time. ""Vaccination in India will be completed by December 2021,"" he said. As of 30 December, 64% of India's adult population was fully vaccinated and around 90% had received the first dose. Experts said achieving full vaccination coverage would take a long time. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and health systems specialist, says the target set by the government was ""unrealistic"" because achieving 100% vaccine coverage at any given point would not be possible. ""There would always be some people who are unwilling to get vaccinated for various reasons,"" he said. Weekly vaccinations have slowed since the first week of December,according to India's vaccine dashboard - CoWin.,external Since mid-October, more second doses have been given than first doses. The daily vaccination numbers have been fluctuating with the highest number achieved on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on 17 September. Over 20 million jabs were administered on that day, but the country has not been able to achieve the same number since. The monthly average for September was around 8.1 million doses a day, but fell to 5.4 million in October and was 5.7 million in November. Some experts say that if the September momentum had been kept up, India could have been closer to the target, but that demand would eventually have fallen. The vaccination drive, which started in January, faced challenges such as supply constraints due to raw materials shortages, logistical issues and vaccine hesitancy. Is the world's vaccine powerhouse running out of doses? How do you vaccinate a billion people? By the second half of the year, the supply constraints had been addressed. The challenge is now demand rather than the supply. ""The vaccination drive has slowed down now because people are hesitant to take the vaccine,"" says Dr Lahariya. On 3 November, the government launched a programme to conduct at-home inoculations. A door-to-door campaign in Tamil Nadu state A month after the programme was announced, first dosecoverage had only increased by 6% and second dose coverage by 12%,external. Mr Modi has now asked states to ramp up vaccinations in districts with low uptake amid fears about the spread of the more transmissible Omicron variant. Over the past few months, the 100% target has not been mentioned in any of the press conferences by the health ministry. We asked the ministry about missing the target, but did not hear back. India is currently administering two locally-manufactured vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, and the Russian vaccine, Sputnik. India's largest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India (SII), was manufacturing 250 million doses of Covishield a month before the company announced production cuts in December due to a lack of orders. It now produces between 125 and 150 million doses a month. Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, makes 50 to 60 million doses a month. India's health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, recently said in parliament that states had a stock of 170 million vaccines as of 20 December. He added that vaccine manufacturing capacity would rise from the current 310 million doses a month to 450 million doses a month in the next two months. This may include vaccines from other manufacturers. The junior minister of health, Dr Bharati Pawar, said: ""Both companies [Bharat Biotech and SII] have achieved 90% of their production capacity."" The government has announced jabs for children aged 15 to 18 years and a booster programme for health workers and those above 60 years with other health conditions starting this month. SII chief, Adar Poonawalla, said earlier this month that the company has 500 million vaccines in stock in case the government announces a booster programme. The health ministry has said that around 6.2 million doses have been wasted since the start of the vaccine programme, which is considerably below the number thatthe World Health Organisation (WHO) would expect to be wasted,external. There are other Indian-made vaccines expected to be used against Covid. Vaccine production needs highly specialised raw materials Novavax, developed in the US and named Covavax in India, is being manufactured by SII - and has been granted emergency use listing by the WHO. It has also been granted approval by India. SII has told the BBC that it is currently stockpiling these vaccine doses, and the capacities to manufacture this vaccine would be separate from Covishield. Bharat Biotech has sought approval for trials of its intranasal vaccine as a booster shot. Corbevax, manufactured by Biological-E, has also been granted approval in India. India did give emergency use approval to the US-made Moderna vaccine in June, but so far no doses have been sent to India. Johnson & Johnson's single dose vaccine was granted approval in August, but so far it hasn't been administered. Supplies of foreign-made vaccines are facing legal hurdles over the manufacturers' desire for protection against potential claims arising out of using the vaccines - something no vaccine maker in India has at the moment. A health worker administers Covid vaccine to a woman in a bus in Maharashtra What about vaccine exports? With vaccine demand in India slowing and daily cases falling, SII resumed exporting vaccines in November to Covax, the global vaccine-sharing programme. Before exports were halted by India in April, Covax was reliant on supplies from SII to support the vaccine programmes in low and middle-income countries. But exports have been slow and Covax has since relied on other vaccines. Of the 700 million vaccines that have been delivered to 144 countries by Covax as of 14 December, around 40 million doses were provided by SII. Around 28 million of those doses were supplied between January and April 2021, according to Covax.

"Scotland has delivered more than two million doses of the coronavirus vaccine Scotland is to get 500,000 fewer vaccine doses over the next month due to UK supply issues. However, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the country remains on track to meet its targets despite the shortfall. UK ministers have faced calls to explain why there would be a significant reduction in incoming vaccines from the end of March. It is partlydue to a delay in a deliveryfrom India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs: ""We expect that over the next month we will have approximately 500,000 fewer doses than we had previously anticipated. ""For that reason there may be periods in April where we need to prioritise second doses."" Second doses should be administered within 12 weeks of a first dose. UK vaccine supply hit by India delivery delay Two million Scots have received first Covid jab Ms Sturgeon added that the government still intends to offer first doses to all people in the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) top priority groups by mid-April. This covers everyone aged over 50, unpaid carers and people with underlying health conditions. The first minister said she ""still expects"" to offer a dose to all adults in the population by the end of July. She added: ""We have always known that supplies will be subject to some volatility but the roll-out of the programme overall continues to be really encouraging and it does give us real cause for optimism now about the months ahead."" Earlier, Scotland's national clinical director told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that targets should be met despite a ""significant reduction"" in UK vaccine supplies. Professor Jason Leitch said ministers may have to think about ""who comes next and when they come next"" after April. He added: ""We do not anticipate it will affect our second doses at all because we can prioritise them and just now they are mainly Pfizer."" Prof Leitch said there is no suggestion from either Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca that they will not be able to meet their end targets. The national clinical director has made it clear that disruption to the vaccine supply will not affect two key targets. All those over 50 or with underlying health conditions should still get their first jab by mid April, and the whole of the adult population should still be offered a jab by July. One big question is when people in their 40s with no underlying health conditions - who may have been assuming they would be vaccinated in mid to late April - will now get their jab. Another is whether disruption to the supply will have any effect on the easing of lockdown. As the plan was to vaccinate over-50s by mid April and it takes three weeks for someone to get as much protection as one dose offers, it would seem unlikely that there will be any effect on the changes planned for 5 and 26 April. But will progress be sufficient to allow other restrictions to ease in May and June as hoped? The groups who will be vaccinated by mid-April account account for 99% of Covid deaths and the overwhelming majority of hospital admissions. But with a growing amount of evidence that vaccination also reduces transmission, immunising younger people will also play a part in keeping case numbers down and providing even more protection to those most at risk. It will be well worth watching the numbers in the coming weeks. The UK government said neither a single factory nor a country was responsible for the expected slow down. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC that UK supplies would be lower ""than we might have hoped for in the coming weeks"", but this was expect to increase in April. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, said the supply issues meant efforts would focus on the first phase of the programme to vaccinate the over 50s. Second doses for those immunised earlier in the year would also be prioritised The Bristol University academic told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandthat phase two - to vaccinate the remaining adult population - would move forward when supplies were restored. Prof Finn said: ""We have seen this in the past with other vaccines. Because they are biological agents rather than straightforward drugs they are more difficult to manufacture at scale. ""So we always try and make sure that we have got more than one supplier for vaccination against any particular disease."" Prof Finn said the issues should only result in a ""partial interruption"" to UK's vaccination programme and said it remains ""on track"". The Scottish government said that ""appointments will be fulfilled"" for anyone already scheduled to have their first dose or second dose. A spokesman added: ""Supplies of the vaccine have dipped before and our vaccination programme will continue to manage the stock available to get vaccines into arms as fast as possible."" On Wednesday it was announced thatmore than two million peoplein Scotland had received their first dose of the vaccine. The Scottish government said the milestone meant that 44% of the eligible population had been reached. Latest vaccination figures reveal 2,023,002 had received their first dose of the vaccine - an increase of 41,184 - as of 08:30 on Thursday. A total of 192,100 people have so far received a second dose of the vaccine, an increase of 10,221. That means 51,405 received vaccinations on Wednesday. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The government is to cut grants aimed at encouraging people to buy electric vehicles in a move that has been criticised by the motor industry. The Department for Transport will reduce the grant from Â£3,000 to Â£2,500 and restrict it to cars under Â£35,000. But Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said it is ""the wrong move at the wrong time"". It said the decision goes against the government's zero emissions ambitions. ""This sends the wrong message to the consumer, especially private customers, and to an industry challenged to meet the government's ambition to be a world leader in the transition to zero emission mobility,"" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes. Ban on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030 under PM's green plan Electric cars: Rollout of charging points still too slow Ford of Britain said the grant cut was ""disappointing and is not conducive to supporting the zero emissions future we all desire."" ""Robust incentives - both purchase and usage incentives - that are consistent over time are essential if we are to encourage consumers to adopt new technologies,"" the carmaker's chairman Graham Hoare said. Business group the CBI also criticised the move, saying ""this is the wrong time to stunt a green recovery by making a sudden change to the grants on offer."" Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said ""we must avoid sending mixed messages to consumers and businesses."" ""Switching to an electric vehicle still has many barriers, including high upfront costs and availability of reliable charging points. ""A clear and consistent pathway for incentives will ensure business can continue to deliver the government's ambitions for reducing transport emissions,"" Mr Fell added. 'Increasing choice' The government said that higher-priced vehicles are typically bought by drivers who can afford to switch to electric vehicles without a subsidy. It said the changes will allow funding for the grant to go further. Transport minister Rachel Maclean said: ""We want as many people as possible to be able to make the switch to electric vehicles."" ""The increasing choice of new vehicles, growing demand from customers, and rapidly rising number of chargepoints means that while the level of funding remains as high as ever, given soaring demand, we are re-focusing our vehicle grants on the more affordable zero emission vehicles."" The government will also alter how it calculates the plug-in van grant, and change the eligibility for the grant to vehicles that are able to travel for 60 miles without any emissions. The plug-in car grant was introduced a decade ago, and was designed to reduce the price of electric cars, which generally cost more to make than petrol or diesel equivalents, to encourage more people to buy them. Electric cars are expensive to make and expensive to buy compared with traditional vehicles. The grant was introduced to reduce the price difference between electric models and conventional cars, to encourage people to buy them. The government's argument is that now battery prices are falling, and with a range of cheaper cars coming onto the market, the size and scope of the grant can be reined in, and the available money can be better spent. The market has certainly changed since the grant was introduced a decade ago. Electric car sales are now rising rapidly and relatively affordable vehicles with a practical range are becoming much more common. With the government now planning to ban the sale of new non-hybrid petrol and diesel cars from 2030, it seems to be relying less on incentives and more on compulsion to bring about change. Less carrot and more stick. But the industry believes this approach is wrong and that reducing the grant threatens to choke off the growth in electric car use, at a time when many other countries are offering much bigger subsidies. Since 2018, the government has been narrowing the scope of the grant, bringing the level down in stages from Â£5,000 and tightening the eligibility criteria. It said in 2018 that it wanted to gradually get rid of the grants. In March 2020, it extended the grant schemes for three years with Â£582m funding. Charging concerns Sales of electric cars have increased rapidly over the past year, but remain a relatively small proportion of all cars sold. The government says that by 2030 it wants to ban the sale of new cars powered only by petrol or diesel engines. As part of a plan to make the UK carbon neutral, it unveiled a Â£2.8bn package to support the switch to greener cars, including Â£1.3bn for charging infrastructure. But in February, the Policy Exchange think tank said the rollout of charging pointshad fallen behind what was neededto meet the planned ban on diesel and petrol cars. It said there was a risk of ""charging blackspots"" in small towns and rural areas unless the rollout speeds up. Price comparison site Carwow said cutting the subsidy for electric vehicles was a ""strange direction"" for the UK to take. ""For the most part, electric vehicle variants still carry a notable price premium versus  traditional petrol or diesel variants,"" said Sepi Arani, commercial lead at Carwow. ""The lowering of the cap to Â£35,000 limits the support to a much smaller proportion of cars, which in turn will no doubt have an effect on the UK's electric vehicle adoption. ""It's difficult to see why the grant scheme does not instead work on a tapered scheme, where the amount offered is staggered for different price points instead,"" Mr Arani added.

Ban on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030 under PM's green plan Electric cars: Rollout of charging points still too slow Ford of Britain said the grant cut was ""disappointing and is not conducive to supporting the zero emissions future we all desire."" ""Robust incentives - both purchase and usage incentives - that are consistent over time are essential if we are to encourage consumers to adopt new technologies,"" the carmaker's chairman Graham Hoare said. Business group the CBI also criticised the move, saying ""this is the wrong time to stunt a green recovery by making a sudden change to the grants on offer."" Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said ""we must avoid sending mixed messages to consumers and businesses."" ""Switching to an electric vehicle still has many barriers, including high upfront costs and availability of reliable charging points. ""A clear and consistent pathway for incentives will ensure business can continue to deliver the government's ambitions for reducing transport emissions,"" Mr Fell added. 'Increasing choice' The government said that higher-priced vehicles are typically bought by drivers who can afford to switch to electric vehicles without a subsidy. It said the changes will allow funding for the grant to go further. Transport minister Rachel Maclean said: ""We want as many people as possible to be able to make the switch to electric vehicles."" ""The increasing choice of new vehicles, growing demand from customers, and rapidly rising number of chargepoints means that while the level of funding remains as high as ever, given soaring demand, we are re-focusing our vehicle grants on the more affordable zero emission vehicles."" The government will also alter how it calculates the plug-in van grant, and change the eligibility for the grant to vehicles that are able to travel for 60 miles without any emissions. The plug-in car grant was introduced a decade ago, and was designed to reduce the price of electric cars, which generally cost more to make than petrol or diesel equivalents, to encourage more people to buy them. Electric cars are expensive to make and expensive to buy compared with traditional vehicles. The grant was introduced to reduce the price difference between electric models and conventional cars, to encourage people to buy them. The government's argument is that now battery prices are falling, and with a range of cheaper cars coming onto the market, the size and scope of the grant can be reined in, and the available money can be better spent. The market has certainly changed since the grant was introduced a decade ago. Electric car sales are now rising rapidly and relatively affordable vehicles with a practical range are becoming much more common. With the government now planning to ban the sale of new non-hybrid petrol and diesel cars from 2030, it seems to be relying less on incentives and more on compulsion to bring about change. Less carrot and more stick. But the industry believes this approach is wrong and that reducing the grant threatens to choke off the growth in electric car use, at a time when many other countries are offering much bigger subsidies. Since 2018, the government has been narrowing the scope of the grant, bringing the level down in stages from Â£5,000 and tightening the eligibility criteria. It said in 2018 that it wanted to gradually get rid of the grants. In March 2020, it extended the grant schemes for three years with Â£582m funding. Charging concerns Sales of electric cars have increased rapidly over the past year, but remain a relatively small proportion of all cars sold. The government says that by 2030 it wants to ban the sale of new cars powered only by petrol or diesel engines. As part of a plan to make the UK carbon neutral, it unveiled a Â£2.8bn package to support the switch to greener cars, including Â£1.3bn for charging infrastructure. But in February, the Policy Exchange think tank said the rollout of charging pointshad fallen behind what was neededto meet the planned ban on diesel and petrol cars. It said there was a risk of ""charging blackspots"" in small towns and rural areas unless the rollout speeds up. Price comparison site Carwow said cutting the subsidy for electric vehicles was a ""strange direction"" for the UK to take. ""For the most part, electric vehicle variants still carry a notable price premium versus  traditional petrol or diesel variants,"" said Sepi Arani, commercial lead at Carwow. ""The lowering of the cap to Â£35,000 limits the support to a much smaller proportion of cars, which in turn will no doubt have an effect on the UK's electric vehicle adoption. ""It's difficult to see why the grant scheme does not instead work on a tapered scheme, where the amount offered is staggered for different price points instead,"" Mr Arani added.

"There is no evidence the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine causes blood clots, UK and EU regulators say Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is getting the AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday There will be no change to the roadmap out of lockdown as a result of supply delays, he says Five million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, produced in India, have been held up by four weeks Health Secretary Matt Hancock says there will be no weeks in April with no first doses because of shortages - and no cancelled appointments He tells the Commons a batch of 1.7 million doses has been delayed because of the need to retest stability The government says it's still on track to offer a first dose to over-50s by 15 April and all adults by the end of July Tanzania's president dies following rumours he had contracted Covid-19 Edited by Vanessa Barford and James Clarke That's it from us for today - thanks for joining us. We'll be back with another coronavirus live page tomorrow morning. The writers today were: Becky Morton, Alice Evans, George Wright, Richard Morris, Kate Whannel and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here is a recap of the main stories from today.  Patience AtuhaireBBC News, Kampala Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has sued a leading independent newspaper for defamation after accusing it of publishing a ""malicious"" allegation against him about Covid-19 vaccines. The Daily Monitor quoted a report in the US-based Wall Street Journal alleging Museveni and his inner circle had secretly been inoculated before the rest of the population. The president denied the report, published on 23 February, and in two separate national addresses over the past couple of weeks, he has demanded a front-page apology from the Daily Monitor. It issued a ""clarification"" earlier this week. The president's petition, filed in the High Court, described the story as intentionally reckless and malicious, and said it had painted him as a dishonest person. In a televised address on Sunday, Museveni said he was still considering which of the globally-approved vaccines to take. He added he wanted people who are most at risk, such as health workers, to be vaccinated first. Uganda has so far received more than 860,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. More than 4,000 people, most of them frontline workers, have already been vaccinated. This video can not be played PM: Roadmap will not be disrupted by vaccine supply issues Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a Downing Street coronavirus briefing that delays to vaccine supply next month willnot affect England's roadmap out of lockdown. Watch more in the above clip. The NHS Louisa Jordan temporary hospital in Glasgow is to close at the end of March. The Â£38m hospital at the Scottish Event Campus was built in just two weeks early in the pandemic amid fears the NHS could be overwhelmed. Its main role, however, has been in the delivery of vaccinations to about 175,000 people and as a base for outpatient appointments - it was not needed to treat patients with the virus. The nearby SSE Hydro will take over its role as a mass vaccination centre. Staff based at NHS Louisa Jordan will return to their health boards or the vaccination programme. The building itself will revert to being an events and conference centre, and is due to play a key role in the COP26 climate change conference later this year. Read more France is to resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab France will resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from tomorrow, Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced. A number of European countries suspended the use of the jab following reports of blood clots in some recipients. But a review by the EU's medicines regulator todayconcluded the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is ""safe and effective"". ""I will be vaccinated tomorrow afternoon with this vaccine to show that we can fully trust it,"" Castex says.  Jean Castex says he will have the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine tomorrow It comes as he announced new restrictions for 16 departments - or administrative regions - in France. The Paris region, the Hauts-de-France region, and the departments of Alpes-Maritimes, Seine-Maritime and Eure will be in lockdown, starting from Friday midnight and for four weeks. Like in March and in November, only essential shops will be able to open but this time bookshops and record stores will be allowed to stay open. The schools will remain open as well as middle schools. ""The progression of the epidemic is accelerating"" says the PM this evening, with 35,000 new cases in the past 24 hours and a 23.6% increase in new cases in one week. He says this is caused by the British variant, which represents three quarters of the new cases. You can read more about the situation in France here. Wales expects to have 250,000 fewer doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the coming weeks due to supply disruption, Mark Drakeford says. The first minister says he hopes the top nine priority groups will still be offered the vaccine by mid-April. But Mr Drakeford tells Newyddion S4C he cannot rule out those who already have appointments being affected. ""Losing a quarter of a million doses - you can't do that without it having some impact,"" he says.

In a letter to parents, Bricknell Primary School acting head teacher Nicola Waites says they are also awaiting the results of further tests. The 630-pupil school is being deep-cleaned today and tomorrow ahead of re-opening on Monday, she adds. Hull City Council says a third of schools in the city have closed some educational ""bubbles"". Ms Waites says a number of members of the ""school community"" returned positive Covid-19 tests at the end of last week, with more this week. Read more Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, warned the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet Avoid crowds, only hang out with your closest circle and keep following Swedenâs coronavirus rules and recommendations. That was the message sternly delivered by Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, at a news conference in Stockholm this evening. The Swedish leader warned citizens the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet and the virus doesnât take a break during public holiday weekends. People should be mindful about avoiding activities that could cause an increase in infection, he said. Sweden is continuing to report high numbers of new coronavirus cases and more than 13,000 people have died in the country of just 10 million. At the news conference, Johan Carlson, head of the Swedish Public Health Agency, repeated warnings made by the countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, earlier this month that Sweden risks plunging into a third wave if the public does not continue to follow its guidelines. However, Carlson stopped short of asking people to stop domestic travel altogether over Easter, merely asking people to âsocialise safelyâ if they chose to travel to meet others. Sweden has never had a lockdown but has toughened its approach in recent months. Shops and gyms must limit numbers to make at least 10 metres of space available per customer and thereâs a rule-of-four in restaurants and bars, reduced to one person per table in cafes inside shopping malls and large retail stores. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris Two children in the group appealed to the Algerian president to help them go home Twenty-six Algerians returning home from the UK have been stuck in transit at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris for the past three weeks. The group, including two young girls and a 75-year-old woman, flew from Heathrow Airport on 26 February. In Paris they were told by Air Algeria they could not continue their journey, reportedly because of Covid measures. They have since been living rough in the transit area of Terminal 2 at Charles de Gaulle. The 26 men, women and children have been sleeping on chairs or on the floor, eating food provided by sympathisers. Air Algeria initially gave them food vouchers, but stopped when they refused the company's offer to fly them back to London. They have access to showers in a zone of the airport where there is a hotel, but they are charged â¬20 (Â£17; $24) to use them. They also receive a doctor's visit every day. Read more here. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been giving a coronavirus news conference at Downing Street. Here are some of the key points: Alex Brown of The Scotsman asks when the 800,000 Scots living in England will be able to go home to see their families. He also asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if it is found she broke the ministerial code. (You can read some background on this here.) Boris Johnson says there is no change in the roadmap adding that everyone should ""use commons sense in the application of rules"". On the Nicola Sturgeon question, he says that is a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish electorate. And there the briefing ends. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if there is any evidence that the suspension of the Oxford vaccine in some European countries has had an impact on people not turning up for vaccination appointments or asking for another vaccine. He also asks if the PM will observe a silence to mark the anniversary of the start of the first lockdown. Prof Whitty says there are ""anecdotal reports"" that a small number of people have not turned up following the news. He says in contrast ""almost record numbers"" of people have been taking up the vaccine. He says anyone who is doubtful should think about the danger of Covid and the safety of vaccines. The PM says he will ""of course"" mark the anniversary of the first lockdown. He adds that the government is looking into the idea of a memorial for those who have died as a result of Covid-19. Steven Swinford from the Times asks Prof Whitty how confident he is that England will be able to proceed with its next stage of lockdown easing, on 12 April, now that children have been able to return to classrooms. Prof Whitty thanks teachers and other school staff who have done a ""really terrific job"" to make schools as safe as possible and keep transmission of the virus low. He is expecting that schools going back will put some upward pressure on the R rate, he says, but ""the roadmap was planned with that possibility absolutely in mind"". Whitty says it's too soon to say what the ""full impact"" is of schools reopening again, as it takes a while for data to come in and be analysed fully. ""It is important that we stick to this 'data not dates' approach, but there is nothing at the moment that is flashing red lights beyond what you'd expect,"" he says, adding: ""We'll just have to see what the data show."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asks if GPs are banned from vaccinating under-50s even if they have stock and have done all their priority groups. He also asks if the Indian government was involved in blocking the delivery of vaccines from India to the UK. To the first question, Prof Chris Whitty says it is important to ensure people aren't left behind ""because we're racing down the age groups"". He adds the key priority is to contact all those in the high-risk groups. ""We absolutely then want to move down the ages,"" he adds. On the second question, Boris Johnson says the Indian government hasn't stopped any exports. He praises the Serum Institute (the Indian firm making some of the vaccines) and says the delay is due to various technical reasons. Helen CattPolitical correspondent It's been a week when the vaccine programme has hit its first really major bump
since the start of the rollout. Concerns
voiced in Europe risk threatening another, if they put people off getting their
vaccine. So
there's a real effort by the Prime Minister to reassure on three fronts this
evening: Emily Morgan from ITV asks if the vaccine supply issue might mean the government fails one of the tests it has set itself to ease restrictions. The PM says ""no"". ""We'll be able to meet the targets in exactly the way I've described,"" he adds. He says easing restrictions on 12 April will enable the government to ""get on"" with its timetable for unlocking restrictions. But he says this still remains dependent on the four tests the government has set out continuing to be met. Prof Chris Whitty says the British people understand the vaccine is effective The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the safety concerns over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might have put some people off having their jab. The PM says the best testimony he can give is of the views of the medical professionals around him - as well as of the European medicine regulator, which earlier today published new findings to confirm there was no additional risk of blood clots in people who have had the jab. Prof Whitty adds the ""overwhelming professional view"" in the global scientific comunity is that the vaccines are very safe and effective. ""It is clear that the British public also have taken that message,"" he says, pointing to figures which suggest the uptake of the jab has been over 90% in the age groups that have already been offered the vaccine. ""The general public is, as always, sensible and steady on this - they understand this is a dangerous disease and [an] effective vaccine,"" he adds. The panel are now asked if supply will be at risk, if the EU blocks vaccine exports. ""People should be under no anxiety about that,"" the PM replies. He says the vaccines are part of ""a multi-national effort, produced as a result of international co-operation"". ""We will continue to co-operate with our European friends,"" he adds. Jane from Buckinghamshire asks if the UK can provide stats to prove the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe. Dr Raine says ""yes we can - we're committed to transparency"". She says the MHRA publishes all of the adverse drug reactions. Prof Chris Whitty, England's deputy chief medical officer, says all drugs come with some risk, explaining that even aspirin can cause problems. He says the risk benefit of the AstraZeneca jab is ""really in favour"" of getting vaccinated.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Delays to the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April will not affect people getting their second doses or England's roadmap out of lockdown, the health secretary says. Matt Hancock told MPs: ""We are on track for the dates in the roadmap and there is no impact"" to the planned easing of coronavirus restrictions. The UK's supply has been affected by a delayed shipment from India, he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the delays were ""a cause of concern"". NHS Englandwarned of a reduction in supply in Aprilin a letter sent to local health organisations on Wednesday. Why are India's vaccine makers struggling to meet demand? What is the Serum Institute of India? When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hancock also revealed that a separate batch of 1.7 million doses was held up as it needed to be retested. He said the government was still ""on track"" to deliver on the ""targets to offer the vaccine to everyone 50 and over, and all adults by the end of July"". He added that he wanted to give reassurance that ""there will be no weeks in April with no first doses"". ""There will be no cancelled appointments as a result of supply issues - second doses will go ahead as planned,"" he said. Around 12 million people will receive their second dose next month, Mr Hancock said, adding that they could not be delayed as they had to be delivered within 12 weeks of the first dose. Dates in England's roadmap for easing coronavirus restrictions are conditional on four tests being met, including the vaccine programme continuing to go to plan. Mr Hancock said the roadmap had not been affected by the ""changes to vaccine supply that we've been detailing in the last 24 hours"". Sir Keir said the vaccine rollout had ""been going really, really well"" and he was ""concerned about the delays"". Speaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Edinburgh, he said: ""We need to get to the bottom of it and we need transparency from the government about what the problem is."" An expected reduction in the UK's supply in April is partly due toa delay in the delivery from the Serum Institute of India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses,which has been held up by four weeks. A spokesperson for the Serum Institute said: ""Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India."" More than25 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, while around 1.7 million have had a second jab. Afteropening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April. The Scottish government has said it is""confident"" vaccine targets will be met,while the governments in Wales andNorthern Irelandsaid they were examining how their own vaccine programmes could be affected. The rest of the UK's AstraZeneca doses are being produced domestically and the company says there are no supply issues. Pfizer, which produces its vaccine in Belgium, says its deliveries to the NHS are also on track. The UK has also approved a third vaccine, made by Moderna, and Mr Hancock said he is expecting supplies ""in the coming weeks"". More than 400 million doses of Covid vaccines have been ordered by the UK,including jabs made by Valneva, GlaxoSmithKline, Novavax and Janssen, which are yet to be approved. Predicting what supply is available in the future is difficult. Vaccine production is a biological process so manufacturers can never absolutely guarantee how much will be available. When you are relying on supplies from abroad there's an added element of complexity. The UK only has two plants that are currently producing an approved vaccine - both make the AstraZeneca jab. Stocks of Pfizer come from Belgium. Both these supply routes are currently delivering what has been forecast. A deal was done with India to supply 10 million doses. But it was always made clear the exact date of shipment could not be absolutely guaranteed. The government had understood the full shipment would arrive in time for mid-March and felt it needed to get vaccination clinics ready to do extra doses. They have now had to be stood down. It comes after expectations were ramped up at the weekend after briefing to the media that the target to offer all adults a jab by the end of July could be hit a month early. Those hopes now seem to have been dashed. Another reminder of just how fragile supply is. The Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries. Its chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been""directed to prioritise the huge needs of India"".,external He has also raised concerns about raw material shortages,attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines,,externalsuch as specialised bags and filters. Earlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest delayed for several weeks. On Monday NHS sources said there would bea big increase in the number of people being offered vaccinations in the coming daysafter the UK received the first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said over the next two weeks the NHS would be pushing on with vaccinating over-50s and vulnerable people while it had a ""bumper supply"". He said the announcement of a shortage was ""disappointing"" news and it would impact ""the group we were hoping to start on in April which is the people under the age of 50 without any pre-existing conditions"" who would now have to wait until May.

"The outlook for the UK economy remains ""unusually uncertain"" despite the rapid rollout of the vaccine programme, the Bank of England has said. It said it expected an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures were eased and government support for jobs continued. But it said the recovery still depended on the ""evolution of the pandemic"" and measures to protect public health. It came as the Bankheld interest rates at historic lows,externalof 0.1%. According to official figures, the UK economy shrank by 2.9% in January amid the third lockdown, as restaurants and non-essential shops were shuttered. But the drop was much smaller than expected, suggesting businesses have adapted to trading in lockdown. It's added to growing expectations that the recovery will be stronger than previously expected, thanks in large part to the vaccine programme. Despiteconcerns about supply, everyone above the age of 50 and all adults in risk groups are set to have their first jab by the end of May, followed by all adults by the end of July. Last week, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC that he expected the economy to ""get back at the end of this year to where it was at the end of 2019"". Meanwhile, the government's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecasts that unemployment will peak at 6.5% instead of the 11.9% predicted last July. However, an official statement on Thursday from the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, was more cautious. It said recent plans to ease lockdown ""may be consistent with a slightly stronger outlook"" in the near term, but it was unclear whether they would make a difference in the medium-term. ""The outlook for the UK economy, and particularly the relative movement in demand and supply during the recovery from the pandemic, remains unusually uncertain,"" it added. ""It continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond to these developments."" Tax rises needed to stop 'irresponsible' debt Silvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at the International Business of Federated Hermes, said the cautious tone of the MPC's statement was in line with other central banks. ""The Bank of England is facing the same cross-currents. Since its previous meeting in February, most developments - notably fresh rounds of fiscal stimulus domestically and abroad - have had positive implications for the economic outlook, but downside risks and uncertainty concerning the evolution of the pandemic are still prominent."" There have been warnings that inflation could breach the Bank's 2% target this year, but Mr Bailey has played the threat down. On Thursday, the MPC said it would continue to monitor the situation closely but had no immediate plans tighten monetary policy. But it said if the outlook for inflation weakens, ""the committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit"". On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve also played down warnings of rising inflation,saying any increases above its own 2% target were likely to be ""transient"". Today's Monetary Policy Report plays down the risk of a rate rise any time soon. And the BoE has more than one reason to do so. The pandemic has brought weirdness to many of our lives. The same applies to the Bank of England. It continues to insist it doesn't engage in monetary financing, where the central bank simply creates money from nothing (once upon a time you could say ""prints money"" but now it's digital) and ""lends"" it to the government. However, what's happening now is not much different. As the Financial Times has noted, of the money being borrowed by the government this financial year by issuing gilts - a sort of IOU note also known as a government bond - 92.7% of it will be owed to the Bank of England. Not only is the government ""borrowing"" most of its money from another branch of the public sector. If it pays interest on that debt it gets it straight back. Easy money. But the money the BoE creates from nothing is used to buy gilts from big City players like pension funds, hoping they'll invest the cash in productive industry (the last 12 years by no means supports that hope). What they get in exchange is BoE reserves, which pay interest at the official rate. So if rates rose, the BoE - underwritten by the Treasury - would be one of the biggest losers.

Meanwhile, the government's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecasts that unemployment will peak at 6.5% instead of the 11.9% predicted last July. However, an official statement on Thursday from the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, was more cautious. It said recent plans to ease lockdown ""may be consistent with a slightly stronger outlook"" in the near term, but it was unclear whether they would make a difference in the medium-term. ""The outlook for the UK economy, and particularly the relative movement in demand and supply during the recovery from the pandemic, remains unusually uncertain,"" it added. ""It continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond to these developments."" Tax rises needed to stop 'irresponsible' debt Silvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at the International Business of Federated Hermes, said the cautious tone of the MPC's statement was in line with other central banks. ""The Bank of England is facing the same cross-currents. Since its previous meeting in February, most developments - notably fresh rounds of fiscal stimulus domestically and abroad - have had positive implications for the economic outlook, but downside risks and uncertainty concerning the evolution of the pandemic are still prominent."" There have been warnings that inflation could breach the Bank's 2% target this year, but Mr Bailey has played the threat down. On Thursday, the MPC said it would continue to monitor the situation closely but had no immediate plans tighten monetary policy. But it said if the outlook for inflation weakens, ""the committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit"". On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve also played down warnings of rising inflation,saying any increases above its own 2% target were likely to be ""transient"". Today's Monetary Policy Report plays down the risk of a rate rise any time soon. And the BoE has more than one reason to do so. The pandemic has brought weirdness to many of our lives. The same applies to the Bank of England. It continues to insist it doesn't engage in monetary financing, where the central bank simply creates money from nothing (once upon a time you could say ""prints money"" but now it's digital) and ""lends"" it to the government. However, what's happening now is not much different. As the Financial Times has noted, of the money being borrowed by the government this financial year by issuing gilts - a sort of IOU note also known as a government bond - 92.7% of it will be owed to the Bank of England. Not only is the government ""borrowing"" most of its money from another branch of the public sector. If it pays interest on that debt it gets it straight back. Easy money. But the money the BoE creates from nothing is used to buy gilts from big City players like pension funds, hoping they'll invest the cash in productive industry (the last 12 years by no means supports that hope). What they get in exchange is BoE reserves, which pay interest at the official rate. So if rates rose, the BoE - underwritten by the Treasury - would be one of the biggest losers.

"Evha Jannath, 11, died while on a school trip to the theme park in May 2017 The former operator of a theme park has been fined Â£1m after a girl died on a ride, but the penalty will never be paid as it is in administration. Evha Jannath, 11, was on the Splash Canyon rapids ride at Drayton Manor during a school trip in May 2017 when she was ""propelled"" into the water. Evha, who could not swim, fell from the boat at the park in Tamworth, Staffordshire, when it hit a barrier. In 2019 an inquest juryconcluded she died accidentally. During a sentencing hearing at Stafford Crown Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Spencer said: ""This was an utterly tragic waste of a young life."" He added there was ""no prospect of the fine being paid"" given the company operating the park at the time had sincegone into administration. The park has been sold to Looping Group, which runs attractions in Europe and the UK including West Midland Safari Park and Pleasurewood Hills. ""It is important that lessons are learned and the seriousness of the defendant company's failing in this case is marked by an appropriate punishment,"" Mr Justice Spencer said. Drayton Manor Park Ltd previously admitted a breach under Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act, after the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) brought the prosecution. The Splash Canyon ride has remained closed since Evha's death The park had a history offailings on the same ridebefore the death of Evha, from Leicester, the court was told during the two-day hearing. At the start of the hearing on Wednesday, James Puzey, barrister for the HSE, told the judge the accident had happened ""in context of the systemic failures of safety on this ride"". ""The control measures they had were failing every day,"" he added. Between 2011-2013, park records show there were four instances of people falling into the water at the ride before it was closed following Evha's death. One of the incidents was in 2013, when10-year-old Patrick Treacy fell into the Splash Canyonattraction and had to be rescued by a member of the public. Evha, who was on an end-of-year school trip with Jameah Girls Academy, was unsupervised on the ride and at times, along with other pupils, was standing up. Mr Justice Spencer said: ""The public and Evha's family must not be led to think that this serious offence, which resulted in the death of a child, can properly be met by only a nominal [financial] penalty. ""In my judgment it would be wholly inappropriate to do other than impose the fine which the offence merited,"" he added. ""No sentence of the court can begin to reflect the tragedy of this case for Evha's family."" Evha drowned while she was on an end-of-year school trip with friends from Jameah Girls Academy Victim impact statements from Evha's father and brother were not read out to the court but Mr Puzey spoke of the ""devastating impact"" on Evha's family. ""She was a bright and promising student who had spoken of wanting to become a teacher herself,"" he said. The former Leicester East MP Keith Vaz, who has supported Evha's family, said they had gone through ""torture"" and that ""lessons need to be learned"". ""No-one has lost their jobs as a result of this, the company will not pay this fine, no individual has said they are responsible, but there remains a hole in the heart of the family,"" he added. Latest news from the West Midlands Speaking after the hearing, HSE principal inspector Lyn Spooner said Evha died ""at the end of what should have been a fun day out"". Ms Spooner added: ""The risks from ejection from the raft had been evident to Drayton Manor for some time, yet they still failed to take the action that could have prevented Evha's death.""

"Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven others died when a helicopter crashed in California last year The widow of Kobe Bryant has published the names of Los Angeles County police officers who she said shared graphic photos of the scene of her husband's death in a helicopter crash last year. Vanessa Bryant is suing the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for negligence and invasion of privacy. ""We will refrain from trying this case in the media,"" the sheriff said in response. Basketball star Bryant died with his daughter and seven others in the crash. On Wednesday Vanessa Bryant, 38, posted on Instagram the names of four sheriff's deputies. She says they took graphic pictures of the nine people who died in the crash close to Calabasas, California, in January last year. She alleges that one of the officers shared with a bartender photos of Kobe Bryant's body and theothers distributed ""gratuitous photos of the dead children, parents, and coaches"".,external The Los Angeles Times newspaper reported in February last year thatan internal police investigation found officers shared photos of victims' remains,external. She claims the pictures, including those of her 13-year-old daughter Gianna, were taken and shared ""for no reason other than morbid gossip"". Last week a judge rejected an attempt to stop publication of the officer's names, allowing Bryant to disclose them. LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva responded on Twitter to Bryant's post, saying that the department would wait for a court to decide the outcome of the case. Allow Twitter content?

A giant who had his controversies Gianna Bryant: Young basketball talent killed alongside father Vanessa Bryant, her mother's lawsuit and the value of childcare In February safety investigators said thehelicopter pilot, Ara Zobayan, may have become disoriented in fogbefore the aircraft smashed into a hillside. An investigation found the pilot in the helicopter crash had probably become disoriented The US National Transportation Safety Board said the main cause of the crash was most likely the pilot's decision to keep flying in inclement conditions ""which resulted in the pilot's spatial disorientation and loss of control"". As well as Bryant, his daughter and the pilot, those killed included two of Gianna's basketball teammates, their relatives and a coach. The group were on their way to a tournament in Thousand Oaks where Bryant had been set to coach. The fatal crash prompted a global outpouring of support for the NBA star and his family  as well as a number of lawsuits. Mrs Bryant has also sued the estate of the pilot, Mr Zobayan, and the companies that owned and operated the helicopter for alleged negligence and wrongful death. Families of the other victims sued the helicopter companies,  but not Mr Zobayan's estate.

"There is no evidence the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine causes blood clots, UK and EU regulators say Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is getting the AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday There will be no change to the roadmap out of lockdown as a result of supply delays, he says Five million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, produced in India, have been held up by four weeks Health Secretary Matt Hancock says there will be no weeks in April with no first doses because of shortages - and no cancelled appointments He tells the Commons a batch of 1.7 million doses has been delayed because of the need to retest stability The government says it's still on track to offer a first dose to over-50s by 15 April and all adults by the end of July Tanzania's president dies following rumours he had contracted Covid-19 Edited by Vanessa Barford and James Clarke That's it from us for today - thanks for joining us. We'll be back with another coronavirus live page tomorrow morning. The writers today were: Becky Morton, Alice Evans, George Wright, Richard Morris, Kate Whannel and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here is a recap of the main stories from today.  Patience AtuhaireBBC News, Kampala Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has sued a leading independent newspaper for defamation after accusing it of publishing a ""malicious"" allegation against him about Covid-19 vaccines. The Daily Monitor quoted a report in the US-based Wall Street Journal alleging Museveni and his inner circle had secretly been inoculated before the rest of the population. The president denied the report, published on 23 February, and in two separate national addresses over the past couple of weeks, he has demanded a front-page apology from the Daily Monitor. It issued a ""clarification"" earlier this week. The president's petition, filed in the High Court, described the story as intentionally reckless and malicious, and said it had painted him as a dishonest person. In a televised address on Sunday, Museveni said he was still considering which of the globally-approved vaccines to take. He added he wanted people who are most at risk, such as health workers, to be vaccinated first. Uganda has so far received more than 860,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. More than 4,000 people, most of them frontline workers, have already been vaccinated. This video can not be played PM: Roadmap will not be disrupted by vaccine supply issues Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a Downing Street coronavirus briefing that delays to vaccine supply next month willnot affect England's roadmap out of lockdown. Watch more in the above clip. The NHS Louisa Jordan temporary hospital in Glasgow is to close at the end of March. The Â£38m hospital at the Scottish Event Campus was built in just two weeks early in the pandemic amid fears the NHS could be overwhelmed. Its main role, however, has been in the delivery of vaccinations to about 175,000 people and as a base for outpatient appointments - it was not needed to treat patients with the virus. The nearby SSE Hydro will take over its role as a mass vaccination centre. Staff based at NHS Louisa Jordan will return to their health boards or the vaccination programme. The building itself will revert to being an events and conference centre, and is due to play a key role in the COP26 climate change conference later this year. Read more France is to resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab France will resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from tomorrow, Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced. A number of European countries suspended the use of the jab following reports of blood clots in some recipients. But a review by the EU's medicines regulator todayconcluded the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is ""safe and effective"". ""I will be vaccinated tomorrow afternoon with this vaccine to show that we can fully trust it,"" Castex says.  Jean Castex says he will have the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine tomorrow It comes as he announced new restrictions for 16 departments - or administrative regions - in France. The Paris region, the Hauts-de-France region, and the departments of Alpes-Maritimes, Seine-Maritime and Eure will be in lockdown, starting from Friday midnight and for four weeks. Like in March and in November, only essential shops will be able to open but this time bookshops and record stores will be allowed to stay open. The schools will remain open as well as middle schools. ""The progression of the epidemic is accelerating"" says the PM this evening, with 35,000 new cases in the past 24 hours and a 23.6% increase in new cases in one week. He says this is caused by the British variant, which represents three quarters of the new cases. You can read more about the situation in France here. Wales expects to have 250,000 fewer doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the coming weeks due to supply disruption, Mark Drakeford says. The first minister says he hopes the top nine priority groups will still be offered the vaccine by mid-April. But Mr Drakeford tells Newyddion S4C he cannot rule out those who already have appointments being affected. ""Losing a quarter of a million doses - you can't do that without it having some impact,"" he says.

Read more Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, warned the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet Avoid crowds, only hang out with your closest circle and keep following Swedenâs coronavirus rules and recommendations. That was the message sternly delivered by Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, at a news conference in Stockholm this evening. The Swedish leader warned citizens the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet and the virus doesnât take a break during public holiday weekends. People should be mindful about avoiding activities that could cause an increase in infection, he said. Sweden is continuing to report high numbers of new coronavirus cases and more than 13,000 people have died in the country of just 10 million. At the news conference, Johan Carlson, head of the Swedish Public Health Agency, repeated warnings made by the countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, earlier this month that Sweden risks plunging into a third wave if the public does not continue to follow its guidelines. However, Carlson stopped short of asking people to stop domestic travel altogether over Easter, merely asking people to âsocialise safelyâ if they chose to travel to meet others. Sweden has never had a lockdown but has toughened its approach in recent months. Shops and gyms must limit numbers to make at least 10 metres of space available per customer and thereâs a rule-of-four in restaurants and bars, reduced to one person per table in cafes inside shopping malls and large retail stores. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris Two children in the group appealed to the Algerian president to help them go home Twenty-six Algerians returning home from the UK have been stuck in transit at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris for the past three weeks. The group, including two young girls and a 75-year-old woman, flew from Heathrow Airport on 26 February. In Paris they were told by Air Algeria they could not continue their journey, reportedly because of Covid measures. They have since been living rough in the transit area of Terminal 2 at Charles de Gaulle. The 26 men, women and children have been sleeping on chairs or on the floor, eating food provided by sympathisers. Air Algeria initially gave them food vouchers, but stopped when they refused the company's offer to fly them back to London. They have access to showers in a zone of the airport where there is a hotel, but they are charged â¬20 (Â£17; $24) to use them. They also receive a doctor's visit every day. Read more here. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been giving a coronavirus news conference at Downing Street. Here are some of the key points: Alex Brown of The Scotsman asks when the 800,000 Scots living in England will be able to go home to see their families. He also asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if it is found she broke the ministerial code. (You can read some background on this here.) Boris Johnson says there is no change in the roadmap adding that everyone should ""use commons sense in the application of rules"". On the Nicola Sturgeon question, he says that is a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish electorate. And there the briefing ends. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if there is any evidence that the suspension of the Oxford vaccine in some European countries has had an impact on people not turning up for vaccination appointments or asking for another vaccine. He also asks if the PM will observe a silence to mark the anniversary of the start of the first lockdown. Prof Whitty says there are ""anecdotal reports"" that a small number of people have not turned up following the news. He says in contrast ""almost record numbers"" of people have been taking up the vaccine. He says anyone who is doubtful should think about the danger of Covid and the safety of vaccines. The PM says he will ""of course"" mark the anniversary of the first lockdown. He adds that the government is looking into the idea of a memorial for those who have died as a result of Covid-19. Steven Swinford from the Times asks Prof Whitty how confident he is that England will be able to proceed with its next stage of lockdown easing, on 12 April, now that children have been able to return to classrooms. Prof Whitty thanks teachers and other school staff who have done a ""really terrific job"" to make schools as safe as possible and keep transmission of the virus low. He is expecting that schools going back will put some upward pressure on the R rate, he says, but ""the roadmap was planned with that possibility absolutely in mind"". Whitty says it's too soon to say what the ""full impact"" is of schools reopening again, as it takes a while for data to come in and be analysed fully. ""It is important that we stick to this 'data not dates' approach, but there is nothing at the moment that is flashing red lights beyond what you'd expect,"" he says, adding: ""We'll just have to see what the data show."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asks if GPs are banned from vaccinating under-50s even if they have stock and have done all their priority groups. He also asks if the Indian government was involved in blocking the delivery of vaccines from India to the UK. To the first question, Prof Chris Whitty says it is important to ensure people aren't left behind ""because we're racing down the age groups"". He adds the key priority is to contact all those in the high-risk groups. ""We absolutely then want to move down the ages,"" he adds. On the second question, Boris Johnson says the Indian government hasn't stopped any exports. He praises the Serum Institute (the Indian firm making some of the vaccines) and says the delay is due to various technical reasons. Helen CattPolitical correspondent It's been a week when the vaccine programme has hit its first really major bump
since the start of the rollout. Concerns
voiced in Europe risk threatening another, if they put people off getting their
vaccine. So
there's a real effort by the Prime Minister to reassure on three fronts this
evening: Emily Morgan from ITV asks if the vaccine supply issue might mean the government fails one of the tests it has set itself to ease restrictions. The PM says ""no"". ""We'll be able to meet the targets in exactly the way I've described,"" he adds. He says easing restrictions on 12 April will enable the government to ""get on"" with its timetable for unlocking restrictions. But he says this still remains dependent on the four tests the government has set out continuing to be met. Prof Chris Whitty says the British people understand the vaccine is effective The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the safety concerns over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might have put some people off having their jab. The PM says the best testimony he can give is of the views of the medical professionals around him - as well as of the European medicine regulator, which earlier today published new findings to confirm there was no additional risk of blood clots in people who have had the jab. Prof Whitty adds the ""overwhelming professional view"" in the global scientific comunity is that the vaccines are very safe and effective. ""It is clear that the British public also have taken that message,"" he says, pointing to figures which suggest the uptake of the jab has been over 90% in the age groups that have already been offered the vaccine. ""The general public is, as always, sensible and steady on this - they understand this is a dangerous disease and [an] effective vaccine,"" he adds. The panel are now asked if supply will be at risk, if the EU blocks vaccine exports. ""People should be under no anxiety about that,"" the PM replies. He says the vaccines are part of ""a multi-national effort, produced as a result of international co-operation"". ""We will continue to co-operate with our European friends,"" he adds. Jane from Buckinghamshire asks if the UK can provide stats to prove the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe. Dr Raine says ""yes we can - we're committed to transparency"". She says the MHRA publishes all of the adverse drug reactions. Prof Chris Whitty, England's deputy chief medical officer, says all drugs come with some risk, explaining that even aspirin can cause problems. He says the risk benefit of the AstraZeneca jab is ""really in favour"" of getting vaccinated.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts. The UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that ""adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine"". Data from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now. The risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Based on the current data, the following is advised: Anyone who experiences clotting after a first dose of the vaccine should not receive a second dose People with a history of blood disorders (at risk of clotting) should only have the AstraZeneca when the benefits outweigh the risks Pregnant women should talk to their GPs about the benefits and risks The MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. It found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April. The MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate. And the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. Its head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was ""firming up"", more evidence would be needed. The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more ""finely balanced"". 'Encouraging' antibody boost after both Covid jabs The MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. Among these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke. The clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. The MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice: A severe or persistent headache Blurred vision Chest pain Shortness of breath Swollen legs Persistent abdominal pain Unusual skin bruising Pinpoint spots (not including the injection site) Covid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clottingshould be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect. After a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link. Nevertheless,Denmarkhas stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - andGermany,Spain, Italy andIrelandhave suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. France is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, whileAustraliasays people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness. Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus. How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? How do the Covid vaccines compare? Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. The government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines appear to beeffective against the Kent variantwhich is dominant in the UK. There is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. However astudy of around 2,000 peoplesuggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease.

"There is no evidence the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine causes blood clots, UK and EU regulators say Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is getting the AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday There will be no change to the roadmap out of lockdown as a result of supply delays, he says Five million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, produced in India, have been held up by four weeks Health Secretary Matt Hancock says there will be no weeks in April with no first doses because of shortages - and no cancelled appointments He tells the Commons a batch of 1.7 million doses has been delayed because of the need to retest stability The government says it's still on track to offer a first dose to over-50s by 15 April and all adults by the end of July Tanzania's president dies following rumours he had contracted Covid-19 Edited by Vanessa Barford and James Clarke That's it from us for today - thanks for joining us. We'll be back with another coronavirus live page tomorrow morning. The writers today were: Becky Morton, Alice Evans, George Wright, Richard Morris, Kate Whannel and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here is a recap of the main stories from today.  Patience AtuhaireBBC News, Kampala Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has sued a leading independent newspaper for defamation after accusing it of publishing a ""malicious"" allegation against him about Covid-19 vaccines. The Daily Monitor quoted a report in the US-based Wall Street Journal alleging Museveni and his inner circle had secretly been inoculated before the rest of the population. The president denied the report, published on 23 February, and in two separate national addresses over the past couple of weeks, he has demanded a front-page apology from the Daily Monitor. It issued a ""clarification"" earlier this week. The president's petition, filed in the High Court, described the story as intentionally reckless and malicious, and said it had painted him as a dishonest person. In a televised address on Sunday, Museveni said he was still considering which of the globally-approved vaccines to take. He added he wanted people who are most at risk, such as health workers, to be vaccinated first. Uganda has so far received more than 860,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. More than 4,000 people, most of them frontline workers, have already been vaccinated. This video can not be played PM: Roadmap will not be disrupted by vaccine supply issues Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a Downing Street coronavirus briefing that delays to vaccine supply next month willnot affect England's roadmap out of lockdown. Watch more in the above clip. The NHS Louisa Jordan temporary hospital in Glasgow is to close at the end of March. The Â£38m hospital at the Scottish Event Campus was built in just two weeks early in the pandemic amid fears the NHS could be overwhelmed. Its main role, however, has been in the delivery of vaccinations to about 175,000 people and as a base for outpatient appointments - it was not needed to treat patients with the virus. The nearby SSE Hydro will take over its role as a mass vaccination centre. Staff based at NHS Louisa Jordan will return to their health boards or the vaccination programme. The building itself will revert to being an events and conference centre, and is due to play a key role in the COP26 climate change conference later this year. Read more France is to resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab France will resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from tomorrow, Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced. A number of European countries suspended the use of the jab following reports of blood clots in some recipients. But a review by the EU's medicines regulator todayconcluded the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is ""safe and effective"". ""I will be vaccinated tomorrow afternoon with this vaccine to show that we can fully trust it,"" Castex says.  Jean Castex says he will have the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine tomorrow It comes as he announced new restrictions for 16 departments - or administrative regions - in France. The Paris region, the Hauts-de-France region, and the departments of Alpes-Maritimes, Seine-Maritime and Eure will be in lockdown, starting from Friday midnight and for four weeks. Like in March and in November, only essential shops will be able to open but this time bookshops and record stores will be allowed to stay open. The schools will remain open as well as middle schools. ""The progression of the epidemic is accelerating"" says the PM this evening, with 35,000 new cases in the past 24 hours and a 23.6% increase in new cases in one week. He says this is caused by the British variant, which represents three quarters of the new cases. You can read more about the situation in France here. Wales expects to have 250,000 fewer doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the coming weeks due to supply disruption, Mark Drakeford says. The first minister says he hopes the top nine priority groups will still be offered the vaccine by mid-April. But Mr Drakeford tells Newyddion S4C he cannot rule out those who already have appointments being affected. ""Losing a quarter of a million doses - you can't do that without it having some impact,"" he says. Read more Bricknell Primary School closed following public heath advice A primary school in Hull is being closed for two days following ""several"" positive coronavirus tests. In a letter to parents, Bricknell Primary School acting head teacher Nicola Waites says they are also awaiting the results of further tests. The 630-pupil school is being deep-cleaned today and tomorrow ahead of re-opening on Monday, she adds. Hull City Council says a third of schools in the city have closed some educational ""bubbles"". Ms Waites says a number of members of the ""school community"" returned positive Covid-19 tests at the end of last week, with more this week. Read more Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, warned the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet Avoid crowds, only hang out with your closest circle and keep following Swedenâs coronavirus rules and recommendations. That was the message sternly delivered by Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, at a news conference in Stockholm this evening. The Swedish leader warned citizens the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet and the virus doesnât take a break during public holiday weekends. People should be mindful about avoiding activities that could cause an increase in infection, he said. Sweden is continuing to report high numbers of new coronavirus cases and more than 13,000 people have died in the country of just 10 million. At the news conference, Johan Carlson, head of the Swedish Public Health Agency, repeated warnings made by the countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, earlier this month that Sweden risks plunging into a third wave if the public does not continue to follow its guidelines. However, Carlson stopped short of asking people to stop domestic travel altogether over Easter, merely asking people to âsocialise safelyâ if they chose to travel to meet others. Sweden has never had a lockdown but has toughened its approach in recent months. Shops and gyms must limit numbers to make at least 10 metres of space available per customer and thereâs a rule-of-four in restaurants and bars, reduced to one person per table in cafes inside shopping malls and large retail stores. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris Two children in the group appealed to the Algerian president to help them go home Twenty-six Algerians returning home from the UK have been stuck in transit at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris for the past three weeks. The group, including two young girls and a 75-year-old woman, flew from Heathrow Airport on 26 February. In Paris they were told by Air Algeria they could not continue their journey, reportedly because of Covid measures. They have since been living rough in the transit area of Terminal 2 at Charles de Gaulle. The 26 men, women and children have been sleeping on chairs or on the floor, eating food provided by sympathisers. Air Algeria initially gave them food vouchers, but stopped when they refused the company's offer to fly them back to London. They have access to showers in a zone of the airport where there is a hotel, but they are charged â¬20 (Â£17; $24) to use them. They also receive a doctor's visit every day. Read more here. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been giving a coronavirus news conference at Downing Street. Here are some of the key points: Alex Brown of The Scotsman asks when the 800,000 Scots living in England will be able to go home to see their families. He also asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if it is found she broke the ministerial code. (You can read some background on this here.) Boris Johnson says there is no change in the roadmap adding that everyone should ""use commons sense in the application of rules"". On the Nicola Sturgeon question, he says that is a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish electorate. And there the briefing ends. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if there is any evidence that the suspension of the Oxford vaccine in some European countries has had an impact on people not turning up for vaccination appointments or asking for another vaccine. He also asks if the PM will observe a silence to mark the anniversary of the start of the first lockdown. Prof Whitty says there are ""anecdotal reports"" that a small number of people have not turned up following the news. He says in contrast ""almost record numbers"" of people have been taking up the vaccine. He says anyone who is doubtful should think about the danger of Covid and the safety of vaccines. The PM says he will ""of course"" mark the anniversary of the first lockdown. He adds that the government is looking into the idea of a memorial for those who have died as a result of Covid-19. Steven Swinford from the Times asks Prof Whitty how confident he is that England will be able to proceed with its next stage of lockdown easing, on 12 April, now that children have been able to return to classrooms. Prof Whitty thanks teachers and other school staff who have done a ""really terrific job"" to make schools as safe as possible and keep transmission of the virus low. He is expecting that schools going back will put some upward pressure on the R rate, he says, but ""the roadmap was planned with that possibility absolutely in mind"". Whitty says it's too soon to say what the ""full impact"" is of schools reopening again, as it takes a while for data to come in and be analysed fully. ""It is important that we stick to this 'data not dates' approach, but there is nothing at the moment that is flashing red lights beyond what you'd expect,"" he says, adding: ""We'll just have to see what the data show."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asks if GPs are banned from vaccinating under-50s even if they have stock and have done all their priority groups. He also asks if the Indian government was involved in blocking the delivery of vaccines from India to the UK. To the first question, Prof Chris Whitty says it is important to ensure people aren't left behind ""because we're racing down the age groups"". He adds the key priority is to contact all those in the high-risk groups. ""We absolutely then want to move down the ages,"" he adds. On the second question, Boris Johnson says the Indian government hasn't stopped any exports. He praises the Serum Institute (the Indian firm making some of the vaccines) and says the delay is due to various technical reasons. Helen CattPolitical correspondent It's been a week when the vaccine programme has hit its first really major bump

The PM says the best testimony he can give is of the views of the medical professionals around him - as well as of the European medicine regulator, which earlier today published new findings to confirm there was no additional risk of blood clots in people who have had the jab. Prof Whitty adds the ""overwhelming professional view"" in the global scientific comunity is that the vaccines are very safe and effective. ""It is clear that the British public also have taken that message,"" he says, pointing to figures which suggest the uptake of the jab has been over 90% in the age groups that have already been offered the vaccine. ""The general public is, as always, sensible and steady on this - they understand this is a dangerous disease and [an] effective vaccine,"" he adds. The panel are now asked if supply will be at risk, if the EU blocks vaccine exports. ""People should be under no anxiety about that,"" the PM replies. He says the vaccines are part of ""a multi-national effort, produced as a result of international co-operation"". ""We will continue to co-operate with our European friends,"" he adds. Jane from Buckinghamshire asks if the UK can provide stats to prove the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe. Dr Raine says ""yes we can - we're committed to transparency"". She says the MHRA publishes all of the adverse drug reactions. Prof Chris Whitty, England's deputy chief medical officer, says all drugs come with some risk, explaining that even aspirin can cause problems. He says the risk benefit of the AstraZeneca jab is ""really in favour"" of getting vaccinated.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Delays to the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April will not affect people getting their second doses or England's roadmap out of lockdown, the health secretary says. Matt Hancock told MPs: ""We are on track for the dates in the roadmap and there is no impact"" to the planned easing of coronavirus restrictions. The UK's supply has been affected by a delayed shipment from India, he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the delays were ""a cause of concern"". NHS Englandwarned of a reduction in supply in Aprilin a letter sent to local health organisations on Wednesday. Why are India's vaccine makers struggling to meet demand? What is the Serum Institute of India? When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hancock also revealed that a separate batch of 1.7 million doses was held up as it needed to be retested. He said the government was still ""on track"" to deliver on the ""targets to offer the vaccine to everyone 50 and over, and all adults by the end of July"". He added that he wanted to give reassurance that ""there will be no weeks in April with no first doses"". ""There will be no cancelled appointments as a result of supply issues - second doses will go ahead as planned,"" he said. Around 12 million people will receive their second dose next month, Mr Hancock said, adding that they could not be delayed as they had to be delivered within 12 weeks of the first dose. Dates in England's roadmap for easing coronavirus restrictions are conditional on four tests being met, including the vaccine programme continuing to go to plan. Mr Hancock said the roadmap had not been affected by the ""changes to vaccine supply that we've been detailing in the last 24 hours"". Sir Keir said the vaccine rollout had ""been going really, really well"" and he was ""concerned about the delays"". Speaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Edinburgh, he said: ""We need to get to the bottom of it and we need transparency from the government about what the problem is."" An expected reduction in the UK's supply in April is partly due toa delay in the delivery from the Serum Institute of India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses,which has been held up by four weeks. A spokesperson for the Serum Institute said: ""Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India."" More than25 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, while around 1.7 million have had a second jab. Afteropening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April. The Scottish government has said it is""confident"" vaccine targets will be met,while the governments in Wales andNorthern Irelandsaid they were examining how their own vaccine programmes could be affected. The rest of the UK's AstraZeneca doses are being produced domestically and the company says there are no supply issues. Pfizer, which produces its vaccine in Belgium, says its deliveries to the NHS are also on track. The UK has also approved a third vaccine, made by Moderna, and Mr Hancock said he is expecting supplies ""in the coming weeks"". More than 400 million doses of Covid vaccines have been ordered by the UK,including jabs made by Valneva, GlaxoSmithKline, Novavax and Janssen, which are yet to be approved. Predicting what supply is available in the future is difficult. Vaccine production is a biological process so manufacturers can never absolutely guarantee how much will be available. When you are relying on supplies from abroad there's an added element of complexity. The UK only has two plants that are currently producing an approved vaccine - both make the AstraZeneca jab. Stocks of Pfizer come from Belgium. Both these supply routes are currently delivering what has been forecast. A deal was done with India to supply 10 million doses. But it was always made clear the exact date of shipment could not be absolutely guaranteed. The government had understood the full shipment would arrive in time for mid-March and felt it needed to get vaccination clinics ready to do extra doses. They have now had to be stood down. It comes after expectations were ramped up at the weekend after briefing to the media that the target to offer all adults a jab by the end of July could be hit a month early. Those hopes now seem to have been dashed. Another reminder of just how fragile supply is. The Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries. Its chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been""directed to prioritise the huge needs of India"".,external He has also raised concerns about raw material shortages,attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines,,externalsuch as specialised bags and filters. Earlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest delayed for several weeks. On Monday NHS sources said there would bea big increase in the number of people being offered vaccinations in the coming daysafter the UK received the first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said over the next two weeks the NHS would be pushing on with vaccinating over-50s and vulnerable people while it had a ""bumper supply"". He said the announcement of a shortage was ""disappointing"" news and it would impact ""the group we were hoping to start on in April which is the people under the age of 50 without any pre-existing conditions"" who would now have to wait until May.

"The NHS in England was ill-prepared for the seismic shock of the Covid pandemic, a hospital chief has said. The service was already running at nearly full capacity with long waits for non-urgent operations even before coronavirus arrived, according to Prof Marcel Levi, the University College London Hospitals trust's chief executive. Prof Levi leaves his role at the end of March, after four years, to return to his native Holland to become chief scientific adviser to the Dutch government. In a BBC interview, he argues that it could take ""a very long time"" to clear the backlog of routine surgery and procedures which has built up because of cancellations during the pandemic. He says more money will be needed quickly to run weekend and evening sessions in operating theatres. Prof Levi also believes the most successful responses to the pandemic were those under the control of the NHS - in contrast to those which were run by independent contractors. ""If you want to get something done, ask the NHS and don't outsource it to all these private companies,"" he said. How long can we keep going like this? Inside an ICU fighting Covid-19 Prof Levi started his job in London having been chairman of the executive board of the Academic Medical Centre at the University of Amsterdam. A magazine in the Netherlands named him as Dutchman of the year in 2016. He is a practising consultant, and continued seeing patients as well as carrying out his chief executive role. He believes hospitals coped extremely well in the face of intense pressure when infection rates surged during the second wave in early 2021. ""I do not think there is any country with such a high number of Covid patients presenting with such a steep rise like we've seen in January and February, that were dealt with in any health system in such a proper way,"" he said. ""So I'm very proud of how the NHS behaved and acted with the skill available to provide sufficient hospital care for what patients needed."" Prof Levi is also a working consultant However, the first wave was a very different story. He says the NHS was not as robust as it should have been, a key factor being that the UK was one of the countries with the lowest number of intensive care beds per 1,000 of population. ""You cannot run a healthcare system at the capacity we run the NHS. We are always 95% full, so it's impossible to quickly respond to an emergency situation."" Every winter with influenza circulating there are peaks in demand, resulting in cancellations of operations because there is not enough intensive care space. ""We should have seen that and said this is just flu, what would happen if we had a real pandemic - and then we would probably have been better prepared."" The same argument applies to routine surgery and procedures: there were already long waiting lists even before the pandemic started. More than 300,000 patients have waited more than a year in England, but Prof Levi points out they had waited a long time before Covid forced hospitals to postpone operations. ""Covid is actually a magnifying glass, making it clear that capacity in the NHS is not sufficient - that has now become very obvious. It's going to take, I am afraid, a very long time to get where we want to be."" Prof Levi's comments came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced Â£6.6 billion extra for health and care in England in the first half of the 2021/22 financial year. Mr Hancock told MPs the money was in addition to funding committed as part of the spending review to help the NHS meet additional Covid costs and starting work on the elective recovery. Prof Levi's analysis makes sobering reading, because he has experience of other health systems, and has seen the front line in the UK with a fresh perspective. But he also believes that the NHS has many strengths - and takes a swipe at the use of private contractors in some areas of the Covid response. ""Everything that has been a big success - addressing these massive peaks for patients needing intensive care and also vaccination - was the part done by the NHS. ""Everything that was actually not so successful - test-and-trace, PPE provision, all these things - was outsourced to companies which failed to deliver what they promised. ""That is a reminder for the future - the NHS is a very strong organisation. If you want to get something done ask the NHS and not outsource it to all these private companies."" And the best thing about the NHS? The people who work in it, he said. ""The resilience and the quality and the camaraderie of people I have been working with -  doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, porters, cleaners, teamwork - that's something I have never encountered before.""

"BT has said it will ""build like fury"" to roll out full-fibre internet connections after new rules announced by the UK's telecoms regulator. Ofcom has decided,externalnot to impose price caps on full-fibre connections provided by the firm's Openreach subsidiary. This gives the company the certainty it had been looking for ahead of a planned Â£12bn investment. However, the decision lays Ofcom open to criticism that is has given a near-monopoly operator a generous deal. That could mean more expensive internet connections for the public than might have been the case. Ofcom also froze the price curbs it levels on what Openreach charges internet service providers for its slower copper-based connections. Openreach lays down and maintains the fibre-optic cables involved as well as operating the associated telephone exchanges, and then sells use of these services to individual internet service providers. They in turn sell access to the public. The business has said it can now confirm a plan to build fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) connections to 20 million homes and offices by the mid- to late-2020s. ""Today's regulation will allow us to ramp up to three million premises per year providing vital next generation connectivity for homes and business right across the UK,"" saidOpenreach's chief executive Clive Selley,external. Ofcom's chief executive denied its move would harm consumers. ""It's true we certainly want to make sure that BT can have a fair bet on this investment, but at the core of our approach is that we are trying to get competition into the wholesale network layer, of broadband for the future, really for the first time in quite a new way,"" Dame Melanie Dawes told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""And the reason we believe in competition is we actually think that's best for the consumer. It gives us all more options to choose from, not just on pricing but also on service quality and reliability."" As part of the measures, Ofcom will effectively freeze the wholesale fees Openreach charges for providing ""superfast"" data speeds of up to 40 megabits per second, which rely on copper links via fibre to the cabinet (FTTC) or older technologies. The watchdog had previously forced these to fall by about 20% over recent years. The price Openreach charges for faster and more reliable FTTP connections will remain unregulated. There is, however, one new restriction. Openreach will not be allowed to offer geographic discounts on its full-fibre wholesale services. A similar limitation already existed on its provision of ""superfast"" links. And Ofcom has said it will review all long-term discount arrangements offered by Openreach to its clients, and will intervene if necessary to prevent the firm from stifling investment by rivals. It said it believed its approach should mean about 70% of the UK would still end up with a choice of networks. Virgin Media, CityFibre and Hyperoptic are among alternative providers. Their ability to profit from building rival networks would have come under pressure if they had been required to match new full-fibre price caps imposed on  Openreach. ""Rolling out infrastructure is a costly and time-consuming venture, that comes with a long pay-back on investment,"" commented Kester Mann, an analyst at the tech consultancy CCS Insight. ""This is particularly true in less-densely populated areas where the economics may be considerably less appealing. ""As such, Openreach needed certainty that it would be able to make a sufficient return on investment before embarking on the next stages of roll-out."" Openreach will also be allowed to turn off copper-based networks in areas where faster full-fibre internet connections to properties have already been deployed. This should help reduce its costs by removing the need to maintain two different systems in parallel. Ofcom said this would also help promote take-up of faster fibre services. However, it indicated that any such switch off must be done ""progressively... over a number of years"". And it added that customers would be ""protected"" during the transition to ensure they would continue to have access to the net. Ofcom had to walk a difficult line with this review. If it set regulation too tight by capping wholesale prices at a low level, the risk was that BT and its fibre network rivals would be reluctant to invest the billions needed to roll out ultrafast broadband. If it loosened the reins it would be accused of going soft on BT, sparking anger from the likes of Sky, which use the Openreach network and would have to pass on the higher prices to their retail customers. By opting to impose no price controls on BT's fibre product for a decade, Ofcom has chosen the second option, insisting that it is the only way to spark the frenzy of competitive network building needed to move the UK up into the broadband fast lane. What this review does not do is ensure ultrafast connections reach the 20% of the country where BT and its rivals still don't believe they can make a commercial return. The broadband industry is waiting impatiently to hear how the government plans to spend the Â£1.5bn of public money it has promised by 2025 to spur investment in rural fibre coverage. An announcement on that is expected imminently.

"More pupils will be returning to classrooms over the next few weeks Support in schools needs to be targeted to avoid trying to get children to ""catch up on everything"" when classes resume, according to researchers. Schools are yet to know the impact of months away from face-to-face teaching. Cardiff University researcher Catherine Foster said children from disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to have fallen behind while learning from home. The Welsh government said the equivalent of about 2,000 extra full-time teaching staff had been hired. But opposition parties have said classroom return plans lack detail. Primary school children and some secondary pupils have returned to school after learning from home since before Christmas, butpupils will not all be back in class full time until 12 April. On top of the face-to-face teaching missed this term, pupils also had to learn at home from March to July last year and many spent periods having to isolate, even when they were allowed back in class. Town's schools could shut to curb Covid flare-up Pupils 'excited and nervous' to be back in school Reopening all schools at same time 'not safe' Dr Foster is part of a team at the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research and Data which has surveyed young people in years 7 to 12 about their home learning experiences. She said international research suggested children had fallen behind in terms of educational attainment and ""the progress lost is even worse for children from more disadvantaged backgrounds"". Research suggested many children would not have engaged with their school work and motivation could be a problem when they are back in class, but experiences would differ, she added. ""Everyone has lost something - it varies a lot. But if there's a focus on catching up and trying to say 'well you've got to catch-up on everything you've missed, plus the work you've got to do this year', it's not going to help"", she said ""There's a lot of logic in saying that maybe we should just be identifying what young people need to progress and focusing on filling in those particular gaps, rather than trying to chuck everything at them and expecting them to do two years in one."" This video can not be played Teachers not focussed on ""catch up"" for pupils At Ysgol y Ddraig in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, the school believes that working towards the core aims ofWales' new curriculumwill help with addressing the effects of the pandemic on children. But executive head teacher Ty Golding thinks talk of ""catching-up"" is not helpful. He said: ""I think we're trying to avoid the term catch-up if I'm honest, because it does suggest that learning is a linear process by which if children miss a chunk of work they'll never be able to engage in that level of learning. ""Really for us at the moment it's about the social reconnection, it's about getting the children back into routines"". Gethin Bickerton said some pupils responded well to online learning, but others were the ""polar opposite"" At Ysgol Glan Morfa in Cardiff, Gethin Bickerton has been employed as a teaching assistant since autumn 2020, one of hundreds of extra staff employed through the Welsh government'sRecruit, Recover and Raise Standards,externalprogramme. Before the pandemic, he was an actor travelling around schools helping children learn about figures from Welsh history. Now he uses those skills to do role play with children to improve communication and help small groups with their reading. ""We have a mixture of pupils here. We have some who have engaged really well with online learning and those who can really engage with the work, but then we have the polar opposite,"" he said. Mr Bicketon said the schools main focus is getting the children back into routine and socialising in Welsh Mr Bickerton works with young children in the foundation phase where improving literacy is a key priority. ""The main focus at the moment is getting them back into some sort of routine and getting them back socialising with other people through the medium of Welsh - that's our main aim. ""But also going back to basics with some individuals as well, learning letters, words and forming sentences."" Last summer, the Welsh government announced Â£29m to fund 900 extra teaching staff, followed by afurther Â£72m investment announced earlier this month. It said it had outstripped the recruitment target and so far the equivalent of around 2,000 extra full time staff had been employed. New figures from the government showed that included 472 new full time teaching assistants and 248 new full time teachers, as well as hundreds of part time appointments and existing staff taking on extra hours. A spokesman said an evaluation of recruitment through Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards would be commissioned this year. He added: ""Initial data suggests the funding has supported the recruitment of mostly new, rather than existing, staff. ""1,508 new full-time equivalent posts have been recruited to, compared to 487 (FTE) posts created from increased hours for existing staff."" But opposition parties have said the plans failed to provide a longer-term vision. The Welsh Conservatives' education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said without a detailed roadmap for education recovery ""nobody's sure of how it will be spent and whether it will be spent effectively"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said a recovery plan needed to be part of ""an ambitious plan to invest in teaching"" in the long term. ""What we're hearing from the government is yet more announcements about funding but no plan about how that funding is going to be used.""

"Adele Thomas and her partner Stephen got to hold Zak before he died while he was on life support There was a ""gross failure in basic care"" which led to a baby being starved of oxygen during birth, a coroner said. Zak Ezra Carter died at the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, two days after being born in July 2018 at Ystrad Fawr Hospital in Caerphilly county. Gwent coroner Caroline Saunders said the monitoring of Zak and his mother Adele Thomas fell ""well below the standards expected"". She said she was reassured the health board had taken steps to improve care. Ms Thomas told the Newport hearing she felt ""scared"" and staff ""didn't care"" when she arrived to give birth on 20 July 2018. In a statement to the inquest she described being turned away from the centre after going into labour on three occasions, before being admitted on the fourth. On one occasion, she said she was told she might benefit from a walk around a nearby Tesco store. Ms Thomas said she was initially offered paracetamol as pain relief at the midwife-led centre. She described ""a lot of arguing between nurses"", one of whom was ""bolshie and rude and rough handled me"", adding the midwives ""did not appear to be in any rush"". When Zak was born, he was described as being ""white and pale"" and without a heartbeat. He did not cry and was taken away to a room for resuscitation. Zak was transferred to the Royal Gwent Hospital where he died two days later. Ms Thomas gave birth at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly county The inquest heard Anthony Ridge Blackwell, an operating department practitioner from elsewhere in the hospital, was called to the birthing centre while paramedics were on their way. In a statement, he said he was initially unable to access the unit because the doors were locked. He said the ""lack of urgency was very apparent"" among staff, who he described as ""clearly upset and hugging each other"". Mr Blackwell said he had to search for equipment among ""very limited resources"" before providing basic life support to Zak until paramedics arrived with more equipment. Midwife Theresa Ward told the coroner she came into the birthing room to assist midwife Lisa Gibson, who has been off work with stress since. She said she had previously raised concerns about Ms Gibson's work with her superiors, and so on this occasion went in earlier than she normally would to help with the birth. In a statement, Ms Gibson said she had retrospectively recorded observations taken during labour. Ms Ward said the chart used to keep a record of the observations was not in the birthing room when she went in and ""didn't think to get it"". She said she did not ""go in and take over"" but suggested Ms Thomas changed her position to help with the birth. At one point, Ms Ward said she could not hear a heartbeat but Ms Gibson said she could faintly hear one. When she checked again five minutes later and still could not hear a heartbeat, Ms Ward said she told Ms Gibson to ""get the baby out"" by carrying out an episiotomy. Adele Thomas' son Zak was born ""white and pale"" without a heartbeat, she told an inquest The coroner heard Ms Gibson spent time looking for the equipment and words were exchanged about the urgency. When she was asked why she did not take over, Ms Ward said she did not know why she did not. Before the episiotomy was carried out, the inquest heard Zak's head and shoulders had emerged. Ms Ward said once he was born she carried Zak to the resuscitation area and attempted to revive him until two men she did not know arrived and took over. She said they did not have some of the equipment the men asked for and there were no drugs for babies on the birthing unit, only for mothers. Dr David Phillips, a consultant anaesthetist, was asked to go to the birthing unit and said he found internal doors were locked and had received ""vague instructions"" about how to find Zak. Dr Phillips told the coroner he did not recall ""any active resuscitation"" when he arrived, and Zak was grey and lifeless so he and Mr Blackwell immediately started CPR. He said he was not given any handover or description of the circumstances of the birth, adding ""communication was quite difficult"". The two members of staff seemed to be too emotional to help - one or both were in tears, he said. Dr Phillips said some of the equipment he would have expected was not available until paramedics arrived. He said a combination of CPR, adrenaline, defibrillation and intubation led to Zak's condition improving enough to be transferred to the Royal Gwent Hospital. Julia Sanders, a professor of clinical nursing and midwifery with Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, carried out an independent investigation into what happened. Prof Sanders told the coroner there was nothing to indicate the birthing centre at Ystrad Fawr Hospital was an inappropriate place for Ms Thomas to give birth. During the first stage of labour, Prof Sanders said ""everything was progressing at a normal healthy rate and the fetal heart rate was recorded as completely normal"". But she said it was ""highly unusual"" for the heart rate to not be documented contemporaneously, and the midwives had not been able to explain why they had not done so. Louise Taylor, a consultant midwife at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, told the hearing an action plan had been implemented to address many of the concerns raised by the hearing and investigation. Recording a narrative conclusion, Ms Saunders said the monitoring of Ms Thomas and her baby had ""fallen well below the standards expected"", leading to a ""gross failure in basic care"" of them in the later stages of labour. The coroner said she was satisfied that when Dr Phillips arrived in the birthing unit ""no-one was resuscitating Zak and no-one voluntarily handed over what had happened"". However, she said she was reassured Aneurin Bevan University health board had taken steps to improve and monitor the care provided in the future. Speaking after the hearing, Zak's parents said they were disappointed with the conclusion. Ms Thomas, who has since gone on to have a baby girl, said she had felt helpless during Zak's birth. She said she was ""angry"", ""bitter"" and sad following the ""dark few months of the immediate aftermath"". She said the new baby had ""definitely saved us"". Ms Thomas added: ""We think of Zak every single day... we'll never forget him."" A spokesman for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said: ""Our condolences and deepest sympathy continue to be with Zak's parents and family. ""This matter was fully investigated by the health Board and failings in care were identified. The investigation findings were shared openly with Zak's parents and the health board has sincerely apologised to them. ""We recognise however, that an apology will never make up for the pain and suffering they have experienced losing a child."" It said neither of the two midwives still worked for the health board but added it was ""determined to learn from this tragic incident to prevent this from happening again"".

"An expected reduction in the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses. The shipment, produced by the Serum Institute of India, has been held up by four weeks, the BBC has been told. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said neither a single factory nor a country was responsible for supply issues. The Department of Health insists it is still on track to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July. NHS Englandwarned of a reduction in supply in Aprilin a letter to local health organisations on Wednesday. The Scottish government said it was""seeking clarity"" from the UK Vaccine Taskforce on future supplies,while the governments in Wales andNorthern Irelandsaid they were examining how their own vaccine programmes could be affected. A spokesperson for the Serum Institute said: ""Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India."" A source told the BBC that although the original aim had been to deliver the next five million in March, there was not a stipulated time for the delivery of the doses. Why are India's vaccine makers struggling to meet demand? What is the Serum Institute of India? When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? Mr Jenrick told the BBC that the government had learned of vaccine supply issues ""in the last few days"". He said the UK had less supply of the vaccine ""than we might have hoped for in the coming weeks but we expect it to increase again through the course of April"". The vaccine rollout would be ""slightly slower than we might have hoped but not slower than the target we had set ourselves"" of offering a first dose to all people aged over 50 by 15 April, and all adults by the end of July, he said. Anyone with an appointment for a second jab ""should have complete confidence"" that they will go ahead, he said, adding: ""The month of April will be different - and it was always going to be - because I think this will be the month that second jabs exceed first jabs."" On Monday NHS sources said there would bea big increase in the number of people being offered vaccinations in the coming daysafter the UK received the first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said over the next two weeks the NHS would be pushing on with vaccinating over-50s and vulnerable people while it had a ""bumper supply"". He said the announcement of a shortage was ""disappointing"" news and it would impact ""the group we were hoping to start on in April which is the people under the age of 50 without any pre-existing conditions"" who would now have to wait until May. More than25 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, while around 1.7 million have had a second jab. Afteropening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the government's Joint Committee for Vaccinations and Immunisation (JCVI), said the disruption to supply meant the UK's rollout would be going from ""extremely fast to somewhat less fast"", rather than ""juddering to a halt"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the supply issues could affect infection rates but should not have an impact on hospital admissions, as those who are most vulnerable to Covid-19 were being prioritised for the jab. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock said vaccine supply is ""always lumpy, but we're on course"" The Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries. Its chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been""directed to prioritise the huge needs of India"".,external He has also raised concerns about raw material shortages,attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines,,externalsuch as specialised bags and filters. Earlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest delayed for several weeks. The rest of the UK's AstraZeneca doses are being produced domestically and the company says there are no supply issues. Pfizer, which produces its vaccine in Belgium, says its deliveries to the NHS are also on track. The UK has also approved a third vaccine - Moderna, which is due to start being rolled out in late spring. More than 400 million doses of Covid vaccines have been ordered by the UK,including jabs made by Valneva, GlaxoSmithKline, Novavax and Janssen, which are yet to be approved. Predicting what supply is available in the future is difficult. Vaccine production is a biological process so manufacturers can never absolutely guarantee how much will be available. When you are relying on supplies from abroad there's an added element of complexity. The UK only has two plants that are currently producing an approved vaccine - both make the AstraZeneca jab. Stocks of Pfizer come from Belgium. Both these supply routes are currently delivering what has been forecast. A deal was done with India to supply 10 million doses. But it was always made clear the exact date of shipment could not be absolutely guaranteed. The government had understood the full shipment would arrive in time for mid-March and felt it needed to get vaccination clinics ready to do extra doses. They have now had to be stood down. It comes after expectations were ramped up at the weekend after briefing to the media that the target to offer all adults a jab by the end of July could be hit a month early. Those hopes now seem to have been dashed. Another reminder of just how fragile supply is. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give a statement to MPs in the Commons later on Thursday. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthtweeted that,externalpeople ""across the country"" would be ""anxious and worried"" about news of delays. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is due on Thursday to release the findings of an investigation into cases of blood clots in a handful of Oxford-AstraZeneca jab recipients. Several European countries have paused the use of the vaccine but the regulator has saidthere was ""no indication"" it caused the clots. The World Health Organization has urged countries not to halt vaccinations. A further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to figures updated on Wednesday from theUK government.,externalA further 5,758 people have tested positive.

"Delays to the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April will not affect people getting their second doses or England's roadmap out of lockdown, the health secretary says. Matt Hancock told MPs: ""We are on track for the dates in the roadmap and there is no impact"" to the planned easing of coronavirus restrictions. The UK's supply has been affected by a delayed shipment from India, he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the delays were ""a cause of concern"". NHS Englandwarned of a reduction in supply in Aprilin a letter sent to local health organisations on Wednesday. Why are India's vaccine makers struggling to meet demand? What is the Serum Institute of India? When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hancock also revealed that a separate batch of 1.7 million doses was held up as it needed to be retested. He said the government was still ""on track"" to deliver on the ""targets to offer the vaccine to everyone 50 and over, and all adults by the end of July"". He added that he wanted to give reassurance that ""there will be no weeks in April with no first doses"". ""There will be no cancelled appointments as a result of supply issues - second doses will go ahead as planned,"" he said. Around 12 million people will receive their second dose next month, Mr Hancock said, adding that they could not be delayed as they had to be delivered within 12 weeks of the first dose. Dates in England's roadmap for easing coronavirus restrictions are conditional on four tests being met, including the vaccine programme continuing to go to plan. Mr Hancock said the roadmap had not been affected by the ""changes to vaccine supply that we've been detailing in the last 24 hours"". Sir Keir said the vaccine rollout had ""been going really, really well"" and he was ""concerned about the delays"". Speaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Edinburgh, he said: ""We need to get to the bottom of it and we need transparency from the government about what the problem is."" An expected reduction in the UK's supply in April is partly due toa delay in the delivery from the Serum Institute of India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses,which has been held up by four weeks.

"India has been conducting door-to-door vaccination campaigns India has missed the target of giving its entire adult population of 940 million two vaccinations by the end of 2021. The target was first announced by Prakash Javadekar in May, who was a minister in the federal government at the time. ""Vaccination in India will be completed by December 2021,"" he said. As of 30 December, 64% of India's adult population was fully vaccinated and around 90% had received the first dose. Experts said achieving full vaccination coverage would take a long time. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and health systems specialist, says the target set by the government was ""unrealistic"" because achieving 100% vaccine coverage at any given point would not be possible. ""There would always be some people who are unwilling to get vaccinated for various reasons,"" he said. Weekly vaccinations have slowed since the first week of December,according to India's vaccine dashboard - CoWin.,external Since mid-October, more second doses have been given than first doses. The daily vaccination numbers have been fluctuating with the highest number achieved on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on 17 September. Over 20 million jabs were administered on that day, but the country has not been able to achieve the same number since. The monthly average for September was around 8.1 million doses a day, but fell to 5.4 million in October and was 5.7 million in November. Some experts say that if the September momentum had been kept up, India could have been closer to the target, but that demand would eventually have fallen. The vaccination drive, which started in January, faced challenges such as supply constraints due to raw materials shortages, logistical issues and vaccine hesitancy. Is the world's vaccine powerhouse running out of doses? How do you vaccinate a billion people? By the second half of the year, the supply constraints had been addressed. The challenge is now demand rather than the supply. ""The vaccination drive has slowed down now because people are hesitant to take the vaccine,"" says Dr Lahariya. On 3 November, the government launched a programme to conduct at-home inoculations. A door-to-door campaign in Tamil Nadu state A month after the programme was announced, first dosecoverage had only increased by 6% and second dose coverage by 12%,external. Mr Modi has now asked states to ramp up vaccinations in districts with low uptake amid fears about the spread of the more transmissible Omicron variant. Over the past few months, the 100% target has not been mentioned in any of the press conferences by the health ministry. We asked the ministry about missing the target, but did not hear back. India is currently administering two locally-manufactured vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, and the Russian vaccine, Sputnik. India's largest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India (SII), was manufacturing 250 million doses of Covishield a month before the company announced production cuts in December due to a lack of orders. It now produces between 125 and 150 million doses a month. Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, makes 50 to 60 million doses a month. India's health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, recently said in parliament that states had a stock of 170 million vaccines as of 20 December. He added that vaccine manufacturing capacity would rise from the current 310 million doses a month to 450 million doses a month in the next two months. This may include vaccines from other manufacturers. The junior minister of health, Dr Bharati Pawar, said: ""Both companies [Bharat Biotech and SII] have achieved 90% of their production capacity."" The government has announced jabs for children aged 15 to 18 years and a booster programme for health workers and those above 60 years with other health conditions starting this month. SII chief, Adar Poonawalla, said earlier this month that the company has 500 million vaccines in stock in case the government announces a booster programme. The health ministry has said that around 6.2 million doses have been wasted since the start of the vaccine programme, which is considerably below the number thatthe World Health Organisation (WHO) would expect to be wasted,external. There are other Indian-made vaccines expected to be used against Covid. Vaccine production needs highly specialised raw materials Novavax, developed in the US and named Covavax in India, is being manufactured by SII - and has been granted emergency use listing by the WHO. It has also been granted approval by India. SII has told the BBC that it is currently stockpiling these vaccine doses, and the capacities to manufacture this vaccine would be separate from Covishield. Bharat Biotech has sought approval for trials of its intranasal vaccine as a booster shot. Corbevax, manufactured by Biological-E, has also been granted approval in India. India did give emergency use approval to the US-made Moderna vaccine in June, but so far no doses have been sent to India. Johnson & Johnson's single dose vaccine was granted approval in August, but so far it hasn't been administered. Supplies of foreign-made vaccines are facing legal hurdles over the manufacturers' desire for protection against potential claims arising out of using the vaccines - something no vaccine maker in India has at the moment. A health worker administers Covid vaccine to a woman in a bus in Maharashtra What about vaccine exports? With vaccine demand in India slowing and daily cases falling, SII resumed exporting vaccines in November to Covax, the global vaccine-sharing programme. Before exports were halted by India in April, Covax was reliant on supplies from SII to support the vaccine programmes in low and middle-income countries. But exports have been slow and Covax has since relied on other vaccines. Of the 700 million vaccines that have been delivered to 144 countries by Covax as of 14 December, around 40 million doses were provided by SII. Around 28 million of those doses were supplied between January and April 2021, according to Covax.

We'll be back with another coronavirus live page tomorrow morning. The writers today were: Becky Morton, Alice Evans, George Wright, Richard Morris, Kate Whannel and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here is a recap of the main stories from today.  Patience AtuhaireBBC News, Kampala Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has sued a leading independent newspaper for defamation after accusing it of publishing a ""malicious"" allegation against him about Covid-19 vaccines. The Daily Monitor quoted a report in the US-based Wall Street Journal alleging Museveni and his inner circle had secretly been inoculated before the rest of the population. The president denied the report, published on 23 February, and in two separate national addresses over the past couple of weeks, he has demanded a front-page apology from the Daily Monitor. It issued a ""clarification"" earlier this week. The president's petition, filed in the High Court, described the story as intentionally reckless and malicious, and said it had painted him as a dishonest person. In a televised address on Sunday, Museveni said he was still considering which of the globally-approved vaccines to take. He added he wanted people who are most at risk, such as health workers, to be vaccinated first. Uganda has so far received more than 860,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. More than 4,000 people, most of them frontline workers, have already been vaccinated. This video can not be played PM: Roadmap will not be disrupted by vaccine supply issues Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a Downing Street coronavirus briefing that delays to vaccine supply next month willnot affect England's roadmap out of lockdown. Watch more in the above clip. The NHS Louisa Jordan temporary hospital in Glasgow is to close at the end of March. The Â£38m hospital at the Scottish Event Campus was built in just two weeks early in the pandemic amid fears the NHS could be overwhelmed. Its main role, however, has been in the delivery of vaccinations to about 175,000 people and as a base for outpatient appointments - it was not needed to treat patients with the virus. The nearby SSE Hydro will take over its role as a mass vaccination centre. Staff based at NHS Louisa Jordan will return to their health boards or the vaccination programme. The building itself will revert to being an events and conference centre, and is due to play a key role in the COP26 climate change conference later this year. Read more France is to resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab France will resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from tomorrow, Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced. A number of European countries suspended the use of the jab following reports of blood clots in some recipients. But a review by the EU's medicines regulator todayconcluded the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is ""safe and effective"". ""I will be vaccinated tomorrow afternoon with this vaccine to show that we can fully trust it,"" Castex says.  Jean Castex says he will have the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine tomorrow It comes as he announced new restrictions for 16 departments - or administrative regions - in France. The Paris region, the Hauts-de-France region, and the departments of Alpes-Maritimes, Seine-Maritime and Eure will be in lockdown, starting from Friday midnight and for four weeks. Like in March and in November, only essential shops will be able to open but this time bookshops and record stores will be allowed to stay open. The schools will remain open as well as middle schools. ""The progression of the epidemic is accelerating"" says the PM this evening, with 35,000 new cases in the past 24 hours and a 23.6% increase in new cases in one week. He says this is caused by the British variant, which represents three quarters of the new cases. You can read more about the situation in France here. Wales expects to have 250,000 fewer doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the coming weeks due to supply disruption, Mark Drakeford says. The first minister says he hopes the top nine priority groups will still be offered the vaccine by mid-April. But Mr Drakeford tells Newyddion S4C he cannot rule out those who already have appointments being affected. ""Losing a quarter of a million doses - you can't do that without it having some impact,"" he says.

In a letter to parents, Bricknell Primary School acting head teacher Nicola Waites says they are also awaiting the results of further tests.

Ms Waites says a number of members of the ""school community"" returned positive Covid-19 tests at the end of last week, with more this week. Read more Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, warned the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet Avoid crowds, only hang out with your closest circle and keep following Swedenâs coronavirus rules and recommendations. That was the message sternly delivered by Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, at a news conference in Stockholm this evening. The Swedish leader warned citizens the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet and the virus doesnât take a break during public holiday weekends. People should be mindful about avoiding activities that could cause an increase in infection, he said. Sweden is continuing to report high numbers of new coronavirus cases and more than 13,000 people have died in the country of just 10 million. At the news conference, Johan Carlson, head of the Swedish Public Health Agency, repeated warnings made by the countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, earlier this month that Sweden risks plunging into a third wave if the public does not continue to follow its guidelines. However, Carlson stopped short of asking people to stop domestic travel altogether over Easter, merely asking people to âsocialise safelyâ if they chose to travel to meet others. Sweden has never had a lockdown but has toughened its approach in recent months. Shops and gyms must limit numbers to make at least 10 metres of space available per customer and thereâs a rule-of-four in restaurants and bars, reduced to one person per table in cafes inside shopping malls and large retail stores. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris Two children in the group appealed to the Algerian president to help them go home Twenty-six Algerians returning home from the UK have been stuck in transit at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris for the past three weeks. The group, including two young girls and a 75-year-old woman, flew from Heathrow Airport on 26 February. In Paris they were told by Air Algeria they could not continue their journey, reportedly because of Covid measures. They have since been living rough in the transit area of Terminal 2 at Charles de Gaulle. The 26 men, women and children have been sleeping on chairs or on the floor, eating food provided by sympathisers. Air Algeria initially gave them food vouchers, but stopped when they refused the company's offer to fly them back to London. They have access to showers in a zone of the airport where there is a hotel, but they are charged â¬20 (Â£17; $24) to use them. They also receive a doctor's visit every day. Read more here. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been giving a coronavirus news conference at Downing Street. Here are some of the key points: Alex Brown of The Scotsman asks when the 800,000 Scots living in England will be able to go home to see their families. He also asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if it is found she broke the ministerial code. (You can read some background on this here.) Boris Johnson says there is no change in the roadmap adding that everyone should ""use commons sense in the application of rules"". On the Nicola Sturgeon question, he says that is a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish electorate. And there the briefing ends. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if there is any evidence that the suspension of the Oxford vaccine in some European countries has had an impact on people not turning up for vaccination appointments or asking for another vaccine. He also asks if the PM will observe a silence to mark the anniversary of the start of the first lockdown. Prof Whitty says there are ""anecdotal reports"" that a small number of people have not turned up following the news. He says in contrast ""almost record numbers"" of people have been taking up the vaccine. He says anyone who is doubtful should think about the danger of Covid and the safety of vaccines. The PM says he will ""of course"" mark the anniversary of the first lockdown. He adds that the government is looking into the idea of a memorial for those who have died as a result of Covid-19. Steven Swinford from the Times asks Prof Whitty how confident he is that England will be able to proceed with its next stage of lockdown easing, on 12 April, now that children have been able to return to classrooms. Prof Whitty thanks teachers and other school staff who have done a ""really terrific job"" to make schools as safe as possible and keep transmission of the virus low. He is expecting that schools going back will put some upward pressure on the R rate, he says, but ""the roadmap was planned with that possibility absolutely in mind"". Whitty says it's too soon to say what the ""full impact"" is of schools reopening again, as it takes a while for data to come in and be analysed fully. ""It is important that we stick to this 'data not dates' approach, but there is nothing at the moment that is flashing red lights beyond what you'd expect,"" he says, adding: ""We'll just have to see what the data show."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asks if GPs are banned from vaccinating under-50s even if they have stock and have done all their priority groups. He also asks if the Indian government was involved in blocking the delivery of vaccines from India to the UK. To the first question, Prof Chris Whitty says it is important to ensure people aren't left behind ""because we're racing down the age groups"". He adds the key priority is to contact all those in the high-risk groups. ""We absolutely then want to move down the ages,"" he adds. On the second question, Boris Johnson says the Indian government hasn't stopped any exports. He praises the Serum Institute (the Indian firm making some of the vaccines) and says the delay is due to various technical reasons. Helen CattPolitical correspondent It's been a week when the vaccine programme has hit its first really major bump
since the start of the rollout. Concerns
voiced in Europe risk threatening another, if they put people off getting their
vaccine. So
there's a real effort by the Prime Minister to reassure on three fronts this
evening: Emily Morgan from ITV asks if the vaccine supply issue might mean the government fails one of the tests it has set itself to ease restrictions. The PM says ""no"". ""We'll be able to meet the targets in exactly the way I've described,"" he adds. He says easing restrictions on 12 April will enable the government to ""get on"" with its timetable for unlocking restrictions. But he says this still remains dependent on the four tests the government has set out continuing to be met. Prof Chris Whitty says the British people understand the vaccine is effective The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the safety concerns over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might have put some people off having their jab. The PM says the best testimony he can give is of the views of the medical professionals around him - as well as of the European medicine regulator, which earlier today published new findings to confirm there was no additional risk of blood clots in people who have had the jab. Prof Whitty adds the ""overwhelming professional view"" in the global scientific comunity is that the vaccines are very safe and effective. ""It is clear that the British public also have taken that message,"" he says, pointing to figures which suggest the uptake of the jab has been over 90% in the age groups that have already been offered the vaccine. ""The general public is, as always, sensible and steady on this - they understand this is a dangerous disease and [an] effective vaccine,"" he adds. The panel are now asked if supply will be at risk, if the EU blocks vaccine exports. ""People should be under no anxiety about that,"" the PM replies. He says the vaccines are part of ""a multi-national effort, produced as a result of international co-operation"". ""We will continue to co-operate with our European friends,"" he adds. Jane from Buckinghamshire asks if the UK can provide stats to prove the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe. Dr Raine says ""yes we can - we're committed to transparency"". She says the MHRA publishes all of the adverse drug reactions. Prof Chris Whitty, England's deputy chief medical officer, says all drugs come with some risk, explaining that even aspirin can cause problems. He says the risk benefit of the AstraZeneca jab is ""really in favour"" of getting vaccinated.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"An expected reduction in the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses. The shipment, produced by the Serum Institute of India, has been held up by four weeks, the BBC has been told. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said neither a single factory nor a country was responsible for supply issues. The Department of Health insists it is still on track to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July. NHS Englandwarned of a reduction in supply in Aprilin a letter to local health organisations on Wednesday. The Scottish government said it was""seeking clarity"" from the UK Vaccine Taskforce on future supplies,while the governments in Wales andNorthern Irelandsaid they were examining how their own vaccine programmes could be affected. A spokesperson for the Serum Institute said: ""Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India."" A source told the BBC that although the original aim had been to deliver the next five million in March, there was not a stipulated time for the delivery of the doses. Why are India's vaccine makers struggling to meet demand? What is the Serum Institute of India? When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? Mr Jenrick told the BBC that the government had learned of vaccine supply issues ""in the last few days"". He said the UK had less supply of the vaccine ""than we might have hoped for in the coming weeks but we expect it to increase again through the course of April"". The vaccine rollout would be ""slightly slower than we might have hoped but not slower than the target we had set ourselves"" of offering a first dose to all people aged over 50 by 15 April, and all adults by the end of July, he said. Anyone with an appointment for a second jab ""should have complete confidence"" that they will go ahead, he said, adding: ""The month of April will be different - and it was always going to be - because I think this will be the month that second jabs exceed first jabs."" On Monday NHS sources said there would bea big increase in the number of people being offered vaccinations in the coming daysafter the UK received the first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said over the next two weeks the NHS would be pushing on with vaccinating over-50s and vulnerable people while it had a ""bumper supply"". He said the announcement of a shortage was ""disappointing"" news and it would impact ""the group we were hoping to start on in April which is the people under the age of 50 without any pre-existing conditions"" who would now have to wait until May. More than25 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, while around 1.7 million have had a second jab. Afteropening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the government's Joint Committee for Vaccinations and Immunisation (JCVI), said the disruption to supply meant the UK's rollout would be going from ""extremely fast to somewhat less fast"", rather than ""juddering to a halt"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the supply issues could affect infection rates but should not have an impact on hospital admissions, as those who are most vulnerable to Covid-19 were being prioritised for the jab. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock said vaccine supply is ""always lumpy, but we're on course"" The Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries. Its chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been""directed to prioritise the huge needs of India"".,external He has also raised concerns about raw material shortages,attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines,,externalsuch as specialised bags and filters. Earlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest delayed for several weeks. The rest of the UK's AstraZeneca doses are being produced domestically and the company says there are no supply issues. Pfizer, which produces its vaccine in Belgium, says its deliveries to the NHS are also on track. The UK has also approved a third vaccine - Moderna, which is due to start being rolled out in late spring. More than 400 million doses of Covid vaccines have been ordered by the UK,including jabs made by Valneva, GlaxoSmithKline, Novavax and Janssen, which are yet to be approved. Predicting what supply is available in the future is difficult. Vaccine production is a biological process so manufacturers can never absolutely guarantee how much will be available. When you are relying on supplies from abroad there's an added element of complexity. The UK only has two plants that are currently producing an approved vaccine - both make the AstraZeneca jab. Stocks of Pfizer come from Belgium. Both these supply routes are currently delivering what has been forecast. A deal was done with India to supply 10 million doses. But it was always made clear the exact date of shipment could not be absolutely guaranteed. The government had understood the full shipment would arrive in time for mid-March and felt it needed to get vaccination clinics ready to do extra doses. They have now had to be stood down. It comes after expectations were ramped up at the weekend after briefing to the media that the target to offer all adults a jab by the end of July could be hit a month early. Those hopes now seem to have been dashed. Another reminder of just how fragile supply is. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give a statement to MPs in the Commons later on Thursday. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthtweeted that,externalpeople ""across the country"" would be ""anxious and worried"" about news of delays. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is due on Thursday to release the findings of an investigation into cases of blood clots in a handful of Oxford-AstraZeneca jab recipients. Several European countries have paused the use of the vaccine but the regulator has saidthere was ""no indication"" it caused the clots. The World Health Organization has urged countries not to halt vaccinations. A further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to figures updated on Wednesday from theUK government.,externalA further 5,758 people have tested positive.

"The government is to cut grants aimed at encouraging people to buy electric vehicles in a move that has been criticised by the motor industry. The Department for Transport will reduce the grant from Â£3,000 to Â£2,500 and restrict it to cars under Â£35,000. But Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said it is ""the wrong move at the wrong time"". It said the decision goes against the government's zero emissions ambitions. ""This sends the wrong message to the consumer, especially private customers, and to an industry challenged to meet the government's ambition to be a world leader in the transition to zero emission mobility,"" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes. Ban on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030 under PM's green plan Electric cars: Rollout of charging points still too slow Ford of Britain said the grant cut was ""disappointing and is not conducive to supporting the zero emissions future we all desire."" ""Robust incentives - both purchase and usage incentives - that are consistent over time are essential if we are to encourage consumers to adopt new technologies,"" the carmaker's chairman Graham Hoare said. Business group the CBI also criticised the move, saying ""this is the wrong time to stunt a green recovery by making a sudden change to the grants on offer."" Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said ""we must avoid sending mixed messages to consumers and businesses."" ""Switching to an electric vehicle still has many barriers, including high upfront costs and availability of reliable charging points. ""A clear and consistent pathway for incentives will ensure business can continue to deliver the government's ambitions for reducing transport emissions,"" Mr Fell added. 'Increasing choice' The government said that higher-priced vehicles are typically bought by drivers who can afford to switch to electric vehicles without a subsidy. It said the changes will allow funding for the grant to go further. Transport minister Rachel Maclean said: ""We want as many people as possible to be able to make the switch to electric vehicles."" ""The increasing choice of new vehicles, growing demand from customers, and rapidly rising number of chargepoints means that while the level of funding remains as high as ever, given soaring demand, we are re-focusing our vehicle grants on the more affordable zero emission vehicles."" The government will also alter how it calculates the plug-in van grant, and change the eligibility for the grant to vehicles that are able to travel for 60 miles without any emissions. The plug-in car grant was introduced a decade ago, and was designed to reduce the price of electric cars, which generally cost more to make than petrol or diesel equivalents, to encourage more people to buy them. Electric cars are expensive to make and expensive to buy compared with traditional vehicles. The grant was introduced to reduce the price difference between electric models and conventional cars, to encourage people to buy them. The government's argument is that now battery prices are falling, and with a range of cheaper cars coming onto the market, the size and scope of the grant can be reined in, and the available money can be better spent. The market has certainly changed since the grant was introduced a decade ago. Electric car sales are now rising rapidly and relatively affordable vehicles with a practical range are becoming much more common. With the government now planning to ban the sale of new non-hybrid petrol and diesel cars from 2030, it seems to be relying less on incentives and more on compulsion to bring about change. Less carrot and more stick. But the industry believes this approach is wrong and that reducing the grant threatens to choke off the growth in electric car use, at a time when many other countries are offering much bigger subsidies. Since 2018, the government has been narrowing the scope of the grant, bringing the level down in stages from Â£5,000 and tightening the eligibility criteria. It said in 2018 that it wanted to gradually get rid of the grants. In March 2020, it extended the grant schemes for three years with Â£582m funding. Charging concerns Sales of electric cars have increased rapidly over the past year, but remain a relatively small proportion of all cars sold. The government says that by 2030 it wants to ban the sale of new cars powered only by petrol or diesel engines. As part of a plan to make the UK carbon neutral, it unveiled a Â£2.8bn package to support the switch to greener cars, including Â£1.3bn for charging infrastructure. But in February, the Policy Exchange think tank said the rollout of charging pointshad fallen behind what was neededto meet the planned ban on diesel and petrol cars. It said there was a risk of ""charging blackspots"" in small towns and rural areas unless the rollout speeds up. Price comparison site Carwow said cutting the subsidy for electric vehicles was a ""strange direction"" for the UK to take. ""For the most part, electric vehicle variants still carry a notable price premium versus  traditional petrol or diesel variants,"" said Sepi Arani, commercial lead at Carwow. ""The lowering of the cap to Â£35,000 limits the support to a much smaller proportion of cars, which in turn will no doubt have an effect on the UK's electric vehicle adoption. ""It's difficult to see why the grant scheme does not instead work on a tapered scheme, where the amount offered is staggered for different price points instead,"" Mr Arani added.

"Donald Trump's net worth dropped by about $700m to $2.3bn (Â£1.65bn) during his time as president, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Covid-19 pandemic hit his fortunes hard, with Mr Trump's office buildings, branded hotels and resorts losing revenue and falling in value. His fleet of planes and golf courses have also seen drops in their value. Mr Trump is currently under a criminal investigation into his financial affairs and his family business. Trumpâs taxes: Why they matter to a criminal probe Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded Donald Trump 'paid $750 in federal income taxes' Bloomberg analysed financial documents and other filings from May 2016 and January 2021 to calculate Mr Trump's wealth before and after he became US president. Mr Trump's commercial real estate accounts for about three-quarters of his net worth. The office towers he owns or co-owns have seen big drops in valuations as more people work from home, a trend that could last in the long term. Bloomberg, which provides financial news and data, estimates a 26% drop in the value of his main commercial property holdings. He also owns, manages or licenses his name to about a dozen hotels and resorts, plus 19 golf courses. Although golf has become popular during the pandemic as a socially distanced outdoor sport, Mr Trump's two courses in Scotland have consistently lost money, filings show. After the Capitol Hill siege in January, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) of America ended an agreement to host its 2022 championship tournament at Mr Trump's New Jersey golf course, saying it would hurt the group's brand. This video can not be played Trump describes allegations he avoided taxes as ""fake news"" Deutsche Bank, the only bank willing to lend to him after his bankruptcies in the 1990s, also said after the riots that it would not do business with him again. Mr Trump also owns a fleet of planes that includes a Boeing 757. These planes are decades old and have been marked down in value over the years, according to financial disclosures seen by Bloomberg. Seven planes were valued at around $59m in 2015 and five were valued at about $6.5m in 2020. The value of Mr Trump's aircraft has dropped over the years, in part because he has sold some of his fleet. During his presidency, Mr Trump's finances were regularly in the spotlight and he has been very secretive about how much tax he pays. Last month the Supreme Court ordered Mr Trump to hand over his tax returns and other financial records to prosecutors in New York. For months they have been trying to obtain eight years' worth of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns. The investigation was originally started in 2018 to examine the Trump Organization's role in hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had had affairs with Mr Trump. As a former president, Donald Trump can expect to sign some lucrative media deals to recover some of his lost wealth, such as a post-presidential memoir. Barack and Michelle Obama reportedly got paid about $65m for their memoirs, while Bill Clinton earned a $15m advance for his 2004 book. Bloomberg says the most obvious way Mr Trump can profit post-presidency is with a news channel or social media platform that would appeal to his 74m voters in the 2020 election.

"There is no evidence the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine causes blood clots, UK and EU regulators say Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is getting the AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday There will be no change to the roadmap out of lockdown as a result of supply delays, he says Five million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, produced in India, have been held up by four weeks Health Secretary Matt Hancock says there will be no weeks in April with no first doses because of shortages - and no cancelled appointments He tells the Commons a batch of 1.7 million doses has been delayed because of the need to retest stability The government says it's still on track to offer a first dose to over-50s by 15 April and all adults by the end of July Tanzania's president dies following rumours he had contracted Covid-19 Edited by Vanessa Barford and James Clarke That's it from us for today - thanks for joining us. We'll be back with another coronavirus live page tomorrow morning. The writers today were: Becky Morton, Alice Evans, George Wright, Richard Morris, Kate Whannel and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here is a recap of the main stories from today.  Patience AtuhaireBBC News, Kampala Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has sued a leading independent newspaper for defamation after accusing it of publishing a ""malicious"" allegation against him about Covid-19 vaccines. The Daily Monitor quoted a report in the US-based Wall Street Journal alleging Museveni and his inner circle had secretly been inoculated before the rest of the population. The president denied the report, published on 23 February, and in two separate national addresses over the past couple of weeks, he has demanded a front-page apology from the Daily Monitor. It issued a ""clarification"" earlier this week. The president's petition, filed in the High Court, described the story as intentionally reckless and malicious, and said it had painted him as a dishonest person. In a televised address on Sunday, Museveni said he was still considering which of the globally-approved vaccines to take. He added he wanted people who are most at risk, such as health workers, to be vaccinated first. Uganda has so far received more than 860,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. More than 4,000 people, most of them frontline workers, have already been vaccinated. This video can not be played PM: Roadmap will not be disrupted by vaccine supply issues Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a Downing Street coronavirus briefing that delays to vaccine supply next month willnot affect England's roadmap out of lockdown. Watch more in the above clip. The NHS Louisa Jordan temporary hospital in Glasgow is to close at the end of March. The Â£38m hospital at the Scottish Event Campus was built in just two weeks early in the pandemic amid fears the NHS could be overwhelmed. Its main role, however, has been in the delivery of vaccinations to about 175,000 people and as a base for outpatient appointments - it was not needed to treat patients with the virus. The nearby SSE Hydro will take over its role as a mass vaccination centre. Staff based at NHS Louisa Jordan will return to their health boards or the vaccination programme. The building itself will revert to being an events and conference centre, and is due to play a key role in the COP26 climate change conference later this year. Read more France is to resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab France will resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from tomorrow, Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced. A number of European countries suspended the use of the jab following reports of blood clots in some recipients. But a review by the EU's medicines regulator todayconcluded the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is ""safe and effective"". ""I will be vaccinated tomorrow afternoon with this vaccine to show that we can fully trust it,"" Castex says.  Jean Castex says he will have the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine tomorrow It comes as he announced new restrictions for 16 departments - or administrative regions - in France. The Paris region, the Hauts-de-France region, and the departments of Alpes-Maritimes, Seine-Maritime and Eure will be in lockdown, starting from Friday midnight and for four weeks. Like in March and in November, only essential shops will be able to open but this time bookshops and record stores will be allowed to stay open. The schools will remain open as well as middle schools. ""The progression of the epidemic is accelerating"" says the PM this evening, with 35,000 new cases in the past 24 hours and a 23.6% increase in new cases in one week. He says this is caused by the British variant, which represents three quarters of the new cases. You can read more about the situation in France here. Wales expects to have 250,000 fewer doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the coming weeks due to supply disruption, Mark Drakeford says. The first minister says he hopes the top nine priority groups will still be offered the vaccine by mid-April. But Mr Drakeford tells Newyddion S4C he cannot rule out those who already have appointments being affected. ""Losing a quarter of a million doses - you can't do that without it having some impact,"" he says.

In a letter to parents, Bricknell Primary School acting head teacher Nicola Waites says they are also awaiting the results of further tests. The 630-pupil school is being deep-cleaned today and tomorrow ahead of re-opening on Monday, she adds. Hull City Council says a third of schools in the city have closed some educational ""bubbles"". Ms Waites says a number of members of the ""school community"" returned positive Covid-19 tests at the end of last week, with more this week. Read more Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, warned the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet Avoid crowds, only hang out with your closest circle and keep following Swedenâs coronavirus rules and recommendations. That was the message sternly delivered by Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, at a news conference in Stockholm this evening. The Swedish leader warned citizens the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet and the virus doesnât take a break during public holiday weekends. People should be mindful about avoiding activities that could cause an increase in infection, he said. Sweden is continuing to report high numbers of new coronavirus cases and more than 13,000 people have died in the country of just 10 million. At the news conference, Johan Carlson, head of the Swedish Public Health Agency, repeated warnings made by the countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, earlier this month that Sweden risks plunging into a third wave if the public does not continue to follow its guidelines. However, Carlson stopped short of asking people to stop domestic travel altogether over Easter, merely asking people to âsocialise safelyâ if they chose to travel to meet others. Sweden has never had a lockdown but has toughened its approach in recent months. Shops and gyms must limit numbers to make at least 10 metres of space available per customer and thereâs a rule-of-four in restaurants and bars, reduced to one person per table in cafes inside shopping malls and large retail stores. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris Two children in the group appealed to the Algerian president to help them go home Twenty-six Algerians returning home from the UK have been stuck in transit at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris for the past three weeks. The group, including two young girls and a 75-year-old woman, flew from Heathrow Airport on 26 February. In Paris they were told by Air Algeria they could not continue their journey, reportedly because of Covid measures. They have since been living rough in the transit area of Terminal 2 at Charles de Gaulle. The 26 men, women and children have been sleeping on chairs or on the floor, eating food provided by sympathisers. Air Algeria initially gave them food vouchers, but stopped when they refused the company's offer to fly them back to London. They have access to showers in a zone of the airport where there is a hotel, but they are charged â¬20 (Â£17; $24) to use them. They also receive a doctor's visit every day. Read more here. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been giving a coronavirus news conference at Downing Street. Here are some of the key points: Alex Brown of The Scotsman asks when the 800,000 Scots living in England will be able to go home to see their families. He also asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if it is found she broke the ministerial code. (You can read some background on this here.) Boris Johnson says there is no change in the roadmap adding that everyone should ""use commons sense in the application of rules"". On the Nicola Sturgeon question, he says that is a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish electorate. And there the briefing ends. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if there is any evidence that the suspension of the Oxford vaccine in some European countries has had an impact on people not turning up for vaccination appointments or asking for another vaccine. He also asks if the PM will observe a silence to mark the anniversary of the start of the first lockdown. Prof Whitty says there are ""anecdotal reports"" that a small number of people have not turned up following the news. He says in contrast ""almost record numbers"" of people have been taking up the vaccine. He says anyone who is doubtful should think about the danger of Covid and the safety of vaccines. The PM says he will ""of course"" mark the anniversary of the first lockdown. He adds that the government is looking into the idea of a memorial for those who have died as a result of Covid-19. Steven Swinford from the Times asks Prof Whitty how confident he is that England will be able to proceed with its next stage of lockdown easing, on 12 April, now that children have been able to return to classrooms. Prof Whitty thanks teachers and other school staff who have done a ""really terrific job"" to make schools as safe as possible and keep transmission of the virus low. He is expecting that schools going back will put some upward pressure on the R rate, he says, but ""the roadmap was planned with that possibility absolutely in mind"". Whitty says it's too soon to say what the ""full impact"" is of schools reopening again, as it takes a while for data to come in and be analysed fully. ""It is important that we stick to this 'data not dates' approach, but there is nothing at the moment that is flashing red lights beyond what you'd expect,"" he says, adding: ""We'll just have to see what the data show."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asks if GPs are banned from vaccinating under-50s even if they have stock and have done all their priority groups. He also asks if the Indian government was involved in blocking the delivery of vaccines from India to the UK. To the first question, Prof Chris Whitty says it is important to ensure people aren't left behind ""because we're racing down the age groups"". He adds the key priority is to contact all those in the high-risk groups. ""We absolutely then want to move down the ages,"" he adds. On the second question, Boris Johnson says the Indian government hasn't stopped any exports. He praises the Serum Institute (the Indian firm making some of the vaccines) and says the delay is due to various technical reasons. Helen CattPolitical correspondent It's been a week when the vaccine programme has hit its first really major bump
since the start of the rollout. Concerns
voiced in Europe risk threatening another, if they put people off getting their
vaccine. So
there's a real effort by the Prime Minister to reassure on three fronts this
evening: Emily Morgan from ITV asks if the vaccine supply issue might mean the government fails one of the tests it has set itself to ease restrictions. The PM says ""no"". ""We'll be able to meet the targets in exactly the way I've described,"" he adds. He says easing restrictions on 12 April will enable the government to ""get on"" with its timetable for unlocking restrictions. But he says this still remains dependent on the four tests the government has set out continuing to be met. Prof Chris Whitty says the British people understand the vaccine is effective The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the safety concerns over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might have put some people off having their jab. The PM says the best testimony he can give is of the views of the medical professionals around him - as well as of the European medicine regulator, which earlier today published new findings to confirm there was no additional risk of blood clots in people who have had the jab. Prof Whitty adds the ""overwhelming professional view"" in the global scientific comunity is that the vaccines are very safe and effective. ""It is clear that the British public also have taken that message,"" he says, pointing to figures which suggest the uptake of the jab has been over 90% in the age groups that have already been offered the vaccine. ""The general public is, as always, sensible and steady on this - they understand this is a dangerous disease and [an] effective vaccine,"" he adds. The panel are now asked if supply will be at risk, if the EU blocks vaccine exports. ""People should be under no anxiety about that,"" the PM replies. He says the vaccines are part of ""a multi-national effort, produced as a result of international co-operation"". ""We will continue to co-operate with our European friends,"" he adds. Jane from Buckinghamshire asks if the UK can provide stats to prove the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe. Dr Raine says ""yes we can - we're committed to transparency"". She says the MHRA publishes all of the adverse drug reactions. Prof Chris Whitty, England's deputy chief medical officer, says all drugs come with some risk, explaining that even aspirin can cause problems. He says the risk benefit of the AstraZeneca jab is ""really in favour"" of getting vaccinated.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Evha Jannath, 11, died while on a school trip to the theme park in May 2017 The former operator of a theme park has been fined Â£1m after a girl died on a ride, but the penalty will never be paid as it is in administration. Evha Jannath, 11, was on the Splash Canyon rapids ride at Drayton Manor during a school trip in May 2017 when she was ""propelled"" into the water. Evha, who could not swim, fell from the boat at the park in Tamworth, Staffordshire, when it hit a barrier. In 2019 an inquest juryconcluded she died accidentally. During a sentencing hearing at Stafford Crown Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Spencer said: ""This was an utterly tragic waste of a young life."" He added there was ""no prospect of the fine being paid"" given the company operating the park at the time had sincegone into administration. The park has been sold to Looping Group, which runs attractions in Europe and the UK including West Midland Safari Park and Pleasurewood Hills. ""It is important that lessons are learned and the seriousness of the defendant company's failing in this case is marked by an appropriate punishment,"" Mr Justice Spencer said. Drayton Manor Park Ltd previously admitted a breach under Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act, after the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) brought the prosecution. The Splash Canyon ride has remained closed since Evha's death The park had a history offailings on the same ridebefore the death of Evha, from Leicester, the court was told during the two-day hearing. At the start of the hearing on Wednesday, James Puzey, barrister for the HSE, told the judge the accident had happened ""in context of the systemic failures of safety on this ride"". ""The control measures they had were failing every day,"" he added. Between 2011-2013, park records show there were four instances of people falling into the water at the ride before it was closed following Evha's death. One of the incidents was in 2013, when10-year-old Patrick Treacy fell into the Splash Canyonattraction and had to be rescued by a member of the public. Evha, who was on an end-of-year school trip with Jameah Girls Academy, was unsupervised on the ride and at times, along with other pupils, was standing up. Mr Justice Spencer said: ""The public and Evha's family must not be led to think that this serious offence, which resulted in the death of a child, can properly be met by only a nominal [financial] penalty. ""In my judgment it would be wholly inappropriate to do other than impose the fine which the offence merited,"" he added. ""No sentence of the court can begin to reflect the tragedy of this case for Evha's family."" Evha drowned while she was on an end-of-year school trip with friends from Jameah Girls Academy Victim impact statements from Evha's father and brother were not read out to the court but Mr Puzey spoke of the ""devastating impact"" on Evha's family. ""She was a bright and promising student who had spoken of wanting to become a teacher herself,"" he said. The former Leicester East MP Keith Vaz, who has supported Evha's family, said they had gone through ""torture"" and that ""lessons need to be learned"". ""No-one has lost their jobs as a result of this, the company will not pay this fine, no individual has said they are responsible, but there remains a hole in the heart of the family,"" he added. Latest news from the West Midlands Speaking after the hearing, HSE principal inspector Lyn Spooner said Evha died ""at the end of what should have been a fun day out"". Ms Spooner added: ""The risks from ejection from the raft had been evident to Drayton Manor for some time, yet they still failed to take the action that could have prevented Evha's death."" Richard Matthews QC, representing Drayton Manor Park Ltd, told the hearing the park had co-operated with the HSE investigation fully and had no previous convictions.

The subreddit WallStreetBets gained prominence earlier this year afterits users invested in the computer game retailer GameStopand boosted the share price. The idea was that if enough Reddit users bought GameStop shares, they could drive up the price, hurting hedge funds which had bet against the company. Now the community has decided to help apes. Dr Stoinski's video in which she thanked WSB for their ""incredible support"", was posted on the subreddit and upvoted more than 159,000 times. She told BBC News: ""They've truly made a difference for our world and shown what can be accomplished when people come together. When we save gorillas and we save forests, we save our world."" In a tweet, the charity said: ""In a typical weekend, we might get 20 new adoptions. This weekend, the numbers astonished us.

"Merthyr Tydfil has a seven-day case rate of 159.1 per 100,000 population compared to the Wales average of 43.3 Extended households and workplaces are behind a rise in Covid cases in Merthyr Tydfil, a health chief has said. The flare-up was down to ""a bit of a loss of discipline"" said Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, director of public health for Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board. Localised hotpot Gellideg and Merthyr Town has had 44 cases in the past week, nearly half of those in the local area. The county has a seven-day case rate of 159.1 per 100,000 population compared to the Wales average of 43.3. This was the fourth highest case rate in the UK on Thursday. Covid rules currently allow most people toonly meet indoors with people they live with. Merthyr council has responded by setting up a mobile testing unit at the Swansea Road estate. Merthyr Tydfil's 'closeness and community' spreading virus The hotspot in Gellideg and Town is at a rate of 625.6 per 100,000 for the past seven days, by far the highest of these localised case rates in Wales. Dr Nnoaham toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: ""We have identified about four different clusters that are largely responsible for the increase in cases that we have had. ""We know that a number of workplaces have been involved in this cluster, we know there has been an extended household cluster in one of the areas. ""I think we understand exactly why this has happened and I just want to use the opportunity to appeal to people out there that whilst we're making progress in the vaccination programme we're by no means home and dry and we still need to maintain those precautions and be extra vigilant."" Covid-19 cases are rising in Merthyr Tydfil He said the spread was largely down to young people in the area. ""When we looked at the age profile of the majority of the cases and these clusters, what we're talking about is largely young people who have not had their vaccination,"" he said. ""And secondly, it does appear that the loss of discipline around the social distancing [and] face masks has been more likely in the younger populations. ""There's a bit of a loss of discipline that has happened more recently"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Town's schools could shut to curb Covid flare-up Vaccine supplies to be delayed 'up to four weeks' He urged people to watch Saturday's Grand Slam between Wales and Franceat home and not with friends and family. Only those who live alone, are single and live in a house share, single parents, families with babies and 16 and 17-year-olds who do not live with an adult had been able to form a so-called ""support bubble"". Four people from two households can meet outdoors to socialise, including in gardens. A graffiti artist hopes his work around valleys communities will remind people to wear their masks The case rate in Merthyr Tydfil was again the highest case rate in Wales. This is the highest point reached locally in the past six weeks, but still a long way from the levels seen in previous months. Cases in the area hit a peak of 1,349 per 100,000 on 18 December,two days before Wales was placed under a national lockdown, with the county having the worst case rate in the UK. At the time officials blamed the spike in cases on the""closeness"" and ""tight-knit"" nature of valleys communities, with people living close to extended family and friends and popping round to check on their neighbours. In an area with high rates of deprivation, there were also concerns about people having to make tough choices between going to work to get paid and isolating if contacted by tracers. At the start of February there was a feeling of hope as case rates fell to some of the lowest in Wales, but there were warnings they could rise again as people became weary of lockdown measures.

"This video can not be played Nationalise Liberty Steel if necessary, says Miliband The government should step in to save Liberty Steel, says shadow business secretary Ed Miliband He said the situation was ""urgent and worrying"" and nothing should be off the table, including nationalisation, to save thousands of jobs in a key strategic industry. ""These are crucial jobs for communities up and down this country,"" he said. Liberty owns 12 steel plants in the UK, including at Rotherham, Motherwell and Newport, and employs 5,000 people. Mr Miliband told the BBC the plants are ""a crucial part of our strategic infrastructure, are crucial for the aerospace sector to automotive. Let's hope that Liberty steel can find that the refinancing that it's looking for but the government needs a plan B to make sure whatever happens, these jobs are saved."" The collapse of the company's main financial backer, Greensill Capital, last week has sparked grave concerns about the future of those jobs. Mr Miliband said the government needed a to consider every option available to save the company. ""If there's one lesson we learned from this pandemic it's that our strategic infrastructure, our resilience really matters. And steel is a key part of our strategic infrastructure and resilience. ""We cannot afford to let these jobs go. Government has got to make sure it doesn't happen."" Liberty Steel is owned by Sanjeev Gupta Mr Miliband added it was a demonstration of the need for a comprehensive industrial strategy; a strategy he accused the government of abandoning with the recent abolition of the industrial strategy council of senior business leaders. ""We absolutely need an industrial strategy. Because we face such massive challenges as a country like the green transition, we have to undertake.

"Kwasi Kwarteng said it was important to restore confidence Proposals to reduce the dominance of the ""Big Four"" accountancy firms and scrap the industry regulator have been unveiled by the government. The aim is to improve regulatory standards after high profile corporate failures such as Carillion and BHS. Also, company directors will face more responsibility to ensure accounts are accurate, or face tougher penalties. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the changes would help restore confidence in business. There will now be a 16-week consultation on the proposals. The business of auditing companies' accounts, and ensuring they are a fair reflection of their financial health, is dominated by four accountancy firms: KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. However, there is concern that providing both accountancy and auditing services creates a conflict of interest. Under the new rules, large companies would be required to use smaller auditing firms to conduct part of their annual audit, in an attempt to dilute the Big Four's dominance. The new proposals would require KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY to make their audits more rigorous. They could face a cap on the number of companies on the FTSE 350 index they may audit, if those improvements don't go far enough. The government said last year almost a third of audits inspected on the FTSE 350 were in need of improvement. The largest private companies in the UK would also face greater scrutiny from regulators under the new rules. The collapse of construction giant Carillion shed a light on failings in the audit profession. Sir Donald Brydon, a former chairman of the London Stock Exchange who authored a government review on improving corporate governance, said the new proposals would help to ""restore trust"" and that similar measures had worked in the US. ""So many of us depend on business for our living and our life, whether it is suppliers, customers, employees or shareholders,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""What really matters is that the information on which those people make their decisions is accurate and honest, and an auditor's role is to ensure as far as humanly possible, at a reasonable cost, that information is truthful."" He added: ""People want to know three things about a business - how is it performing, is it honestly run, and will it survive. And auditors are key to answering all three."" Mr Kwarteng said: ""Restoring business confidence, but also people's confidence in business, is crucial to repairing our economy and building back better from the pandemic. ""When big companies go bust, the effects are felt far and wide with job losses and the British taxpayer picking up the tab. ""It's clear from large-scale collapses like Thomas Cook, Carillion and BHS that Britain's audit regime needs to be modernised with a package of sensible, proportionate reforms."" A new accountancy watchdog, the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA), would be launched to implement the changes, replacing the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). It would have legal powers to force auditors and companies to resubmit their accounts without the need for court action. UK companies and directors also face curbs on dividend and bonus payments if there is misconduct, they publish inaccurate accounts, or have insufficient cash reserves. Directors of failed firms could also see their bonuses clawed back up to two years after a pay award is made, to clamp down on ""rewards for failure"", the government added. By providing more transparency over company accounts the new rules should also help deter firms that could be facing insolvency  from making largescale dividend and bonus payments. They will also be required to produce ""resilience statements"". Accountancy firms welcomed the proposals, with Jon Holt, head of audit at KPMG UK, saying: ""It is an ambitious package of strategic reform. Prioritising and clarifying the audit reform agenda is an important step to rebuild trust in the profession."" Kevin Ellis, chairman and senior partner at PwC UK, also stressed that importance of ""driving trust and confidence"" in the profession. Legal bid launched to ban ex-Carillion directors ""We welcome comprehensive consultation. For lasting change, we need a coherent set of measures and for all parties to play their part. Listening to the views of a wide range of businesses, investors and other interested parties will be key to achieving this,"" Mr Ellis said. The proposals also won the support of employers' groups. The CBI saying the reforms would ""inject focus and momentum behind efforts to maintain the highest possible standards"". The British Chambers of Commerce said the changes would be a ""positive step"". But Suren Thiru, BCC head of economics, cautioned: ""Government and regulators must tread carefully to avoid unintended consequences, including adding to the already onerous cost burden on firms and undermining the UK's global reputation as great place to do business.""

"This video can not be played Nationalise Liberty Steel if necessary, says Miliband The government should step in to save Liberty Steel, says shadow business secretary Ed Miliband He said the situation was ""urgent and worrying"" and nothing should be off the table, including nationalisation, to save thousands of jobs in a key strategic industry. ""These are crucial jobs for communities up and down this country,"" he said. Liberty owns 12 steel plants in the UK, including at Rotherham, Motherwell and Newport, and employs 5,000 people. Mr Miliband told the BBC the plants are ""a crucial part of our strategic infrastructure, are crucial for the aerospace sector to automotive. Let's hope that Liberty steel can find that the refinancing that it's looking for but the government needs a plan B to make sure whatever happens, these jobs are saved."" The collapse of the company's main financial backer, Greensill Capital, last week has sparked grave concerns about the future of those jobs. Mr Miliband said the government needed a to consider every option available to save the company. ""If there's one lesson we learned from this pandemic it's that our strategic infrastructure, our resilience really matters. And steel is a key part of our strategic infrastructure and resilience. ""We cannot afford to let these jobs go. Government has got to make sure it doesn't happen."" Liberty Steel is owned by Sanjeev Gupta Mr Miliband added it was a demonstration of the need for a comprehensive industrial strategy; a strategy he accused the government of abandoning with the recent abolition of the industrial strategy council of senior business leaders. ""We absolutely need an industrial strategy. Because we face such massive challenges as a country like the green transition, we have to undertake. And we can only do that without proper partnership between public and private sectors.

"BT has said it will ""build like fury"" to roll out full-fibre internet connections after new rules announced by the UK's telecoms regulator. Ofcom has decided,externalnot to impose price caps on full-fibre connections provided by the firm's Openreach subsidiary. This gives the company the certainty it had been looking for ahead of a planned Â£12bn investment. However, the decision lays Ofcom open to criticism that is has given a near-monopoly operator a generous deal. That could mean more expensive internet connections for the public than might have been the case. Ofcom also froze the price curbs it levels on what Openreach charges internet service providers for its slower copper-based connections. Openreach lays down and maintains the fibre-optic cables involved as well as operating the associated telephone exchanges, and then sells use of these services to individual internet service providers. They in turn sell access to the public. The business has said it can now confirm a plan to build fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) connections to 20 million homes and offices by the mid- to late-2020s. ""Today's regulation will allow us to ramp up to three million premises per year providing vital next generation connectivity for homes and business right across the UK,"" saidOpenreach's chief executive Clive Selley,external. Ofcom's chief executive denied its move would harm consumers. ""It's true we certainly want to make sure that BT can have a fair bet on this investment, but at the core of our approach is that we are trying to get competition into the wholesale network layer, of broadband for the future, really for the first time in quite a new way,"" Dame Melanie Dawes told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""And the reason we believe in competition is we actually think that's best for the consumer. It gives us all more options to choose from, not just on pricing but also on service quality and reliability."" As part of the measures, Ofcom will effectively freeze the wholesale fees Openreach charges for providing ""superfast"" data speeds of up to 40 megabits per second, which rely on copper links via fibre to the cabinet (FTTC) or older technologies. The watchdog had previously forced these to fall by about 20% over recent years. The price Openreach charges for faster and more reliable FTTP connections will remain unregulated. There is, however, one new restriction. Openreach will not be allowed to offer geographic discounts on its full-fibre wholesale services. A similar limitation already existed on its provision of ""superfast"" links. And Ofcom has said it will review all long-term discount arrangements offered by Openreach to its clients, and will intervene if necessary to prevent the firm from stifling investment by rivals. It said it believed its approach should mean about 70% of the UK would still end up with a choice of networks. Virgin Media, CityFibre and Hyperoptic are among alternative providers. Their ability to profit from building rival networks would have come under pressure if they had been required to match new full-fibre price caps imposed on  Openreach. ""Rolling out infrastructure is a costly and time-consuming venture, that comes with a long pay-back on investment,"" commented Kester Mann, an analyst at the tech consultancy CCS Insight. ""This is particularly true in less-densely populated areas where the economics may be considerably less appealing. ""As such, Openreach needed certainty that it would be able to make a sufficient return on investment before embarking on the next stages of roll-out."" Openreach will also be allowed to turn off copper-based networks in areas where faster full-fibre internet connections to properties have already been deployed. This should help reduce its costs by removing the need to maintain two different systems in parallel. Ofcom said this would also help promote take-up of faster fibre services. However, it indicated that any such switch off must be done ""progressively... over a number of years"". And it added that customers would be ""protected"" during the transition to ensure they would continue to have access to the net. Ofcom had to walk a difficult line with this review. If it set regulation too tight by capping wholesale prices at a low level, the risk was that BT and its fibre network rivals would be reluctant to invest the billions needed to roll out ultrafast broadband. If it loosened the reins it would be accused of going soft on BT, sparking anger from the likes of Sky, which use the Openreach network and would have to pass on the higher prices to their retail customers. By opting to impose no price controls on BT's fibre product for a decade, Ofcom has chosen the second option, insisting that it is the only way to spark the frenzy of competitive network building needed to move the UK up into the broadband fast lane. What this review does not do is ensure ultrafast connections reach the 20% of the country where BT and its rivals still don't believe they can make a commercial return. The broadband industry is waiting impatiently to hear how the government plans to spend the Â£1.5bn of public money it has promised by 2025 to spur investment in rural fibre coverage. An announcement on that is expected imminently.

We'll be back with another coronavirus live page tomorrow morning. The writers today were: Becky Morton, Alice Evans, George Wright, Richard Morris, Kate Whannel and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Vanessa Barford and James Clarke. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here is a recap of the main stories from today.  Patience AtuhaireBBC News, Kampala Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has sued a leading independent newspaper for defamation after accusing it of publishing a ""malicious"" allegation against him about Covid-19 vaccines. The Daily Monitor quoted a report in the US-based Wall Street Journal alleging Museveni and his inner circle had secretly been inoculated before the rest of the population. The president denied the report, published on 23 February, and in two separate national addresses over the past couple of weeks, he has demanded a front-page apology from the Daily Monitor. It issued a ""clarification"" earlier this week. The president's petition, filed in the High Court, described the story as intentionally reckless and malicious, and said it had painted him as a dishonest person. In a televised address on Sunday, Museveni said he was still considering which of the globally-approved vaccines to take. He added he wanted people who are most at risk, such as health workers, to be vaccinated first. Uganda has so far received more than 860,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. More than 4,000 people, most of them frontline workers, have already been vaccinated. This video can not be played PM: Roadmap will not be disrupted by vaccine supply issues Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a Downing Street coronavirus briefing that delays to vaccine supply next month willnot affect England's roadmap out of lockdown. Watch more in the above clip. The NHS Louisa Jordan temporary hospital in Glasgow is to close at the end of March. The Â£38m hospital at the Scottish Event Campus was built in just two weeks early in the pandemic amid fears the NHS could be overwhelmed. Its main role, however, has been in the delivery of vaccinations to about 175,000 people and as a base for outpatient appointments - it was not needed to treat patients with the virus. The nearby SSE Hydro will take over its role as a mass vaccination centre. Staff based at NHS Louisa Jordan will return to their health boards or the vaccination programme. The building itself will revert to being an events and conference centre, and is due to play a key role in the COP26 climate change conference later this year. Read more France is to resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab France will resume vaccinating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from tomorrow, Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced. A number of European countries suspended the use of the jab following reports of blood clots in some recipients. But a review by the EU's medicines regulator todayconcluded the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is ""safe and effective"". ""I will be vaccinated tomorrow afternoon with this vaccine to show that we can fully trust it,"" Castex says.  Jean Castex says he will have the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine tomorrow It comes as he announced new restrictions for 16 departments - or administrative regions - in France. The Paris region, the Hauts-de-France region, and the departments of Alpes-Maritimes, Seine-Maritime and Eure will be in lockdown, starting from Friday midnight and for four weeks. Like in March and in November, only essential shops will be able to open but this time bookshops and record stores will be allowed to stay open. The schools will remain open as well as middle schools. ""The progression of the epidemic is accelerating"" says the PM this evening, with 35,000 new cases in the past 24 hours and a 23.6% increase in new cases in one week. He says this is caused by the British variant, which represents three quarters of the new cases. You can read more about the situation in France here. Wales expects to have 250,000 fewer doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the coming weeks due to supply disruption, Mark Drakeford says. The first minister says he hopes the top nine priority groups will still be offered the vaccine by mid-April. But Mr Drakeford tells Newyddion S4C he cannot rule out those who already have appointments being affected. ""Losing a quarter of a million doses - you can't do that without it having some impact,"" he says.

Read more Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, warned the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet Avoid crowds, only hang out with your closest circle and keep following Swedenâs coronavirus rules and recommendations. That was the message sternly delivered by Swedenâs Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, at a news conference in Stockholm this evening. The Swedish leader warned citizens the Covid-19 âmarathonâ wasnât over yet and the virus doesnât take a break during public holiday weekends. People should be mindful about avoiding activities that could cause an increase in infection, he said. Sweden is continuing to report high numbers of new coronavirus cases and more than 13,000 people have died in the country of just 10 million. At the news conference, Johan Carlson, head of the Swedish Public Health Agency, repeated warnings made by the countryâs top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, earlier this month that Sweden risks plunging into a third wave if the public does not continue to follow its guidelines. However, Carlson stopped short of asking people to stop domestic travel altogether over Easter, merely asking people to âsocialise safelyâ if they chose to travel to meet others. Sweden has never had a lockdown but has toughened its approach in recent months. Shops and gyms must limit numbers to make at least 10 metres of space available per customer and thereâs a rule-of-four in restaurants and bars, reduced to one person per table in cafes inside shopping malls and large retail stores. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris Two children in the group appealed to the Algerian president to help them go home Twenty-six Algerians returning home from the UK have been stuck in transit at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris for the past three weeks. The group, including two young girls and a 75-year-old woman, flew from Heathrow Airport on 26 February. In Paris they were told by Air Algeria they could not continue their journey, reportedly because of Covid measures. They have since been living rough in the transit area of Terminal 2 at Charles de Gaulle. The 26 men, women and children have been sleeping on chairs or on the floor, eating food provided by sympathisers. Air Algeria initially gave them food vouchers, but stopped when they refused the company's offer to fly them back to London. They have access to showers in a zone of the airport where there is a hotel, but they are charged â¬20 (Â£17; $24) to use them. They also receive a doctor's visit every day. Read more here. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been giving a coronavirus news conference at Downing Street. Here are some of the key points: Alex Brown of The Scotsman asks when the 800,000 Scots living in England will be able to go home to see their families. He also asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if it is found she broke the ministerial code. (You can read some background on this here.) Boris Johnson says there is no change in the roadmap adding that everyone should ""use commons sense in the application of rules"". On the Nicola Sturgeon question, he says that is a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish electorate. And there the briefing ends. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if there is any evidence that the suspension of the Oxford vaccine in some European countries has had an impact on people not turning up for vaccination appointments or asking for another vaccine. He also asks if the PM will observe a silence to mark the anniversary of the start of the first lockdown. Prof Whitty says there are ""anecdotal reports"" that a small number of people have not turned up following the news. He says in contrast ""almost record numbers"" of people have been taking up the vaccine. He says anyone who is doubtful should think about the danger of Covid and the safety of vaccines. The PM says he will ""of course"" mark the anniversary of the first lockdown. He adds that the government is looking into the idea of a memorial for those who have died as a result of Covid-19. Steven Swinford from the Times asks Prof Whitty how confident he is that England will be able to proceed with its next stage of lockdown easing, on 12 April, now that children have been able to return to classrooms. Prof Whitty thanks teachers and other school staff who have done a ""really terrific job"" to make schools as safe as possible and keep transmission of the virus low. He is expecting that schools going back will put some upward pressure on the R rate, he says, but ""the roadmap was planned with that possibility absolutely in mind"". Whitty says it's too soon to say what the ""full impact"" is of schools reopening again, as it takes a while for data to come in and be analysed fully. ""It is important that we stick to this 'data not dates' approach, but there is nothing at the moment that is flashing red lights beyond what you'd expect,"" he says, adding: ""We'll just have to see what the data show."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asks if GPs are banned from vaccinating under-50s even if they have stock and have done all their priority groups. He also asks if the Indian government was involved in blocking the delivery of vaccines from India to the UK. To the first question, Prof Chris Whitty says it is important to ensure people aren't left behind ""because we're racing down the age groups"". He adds the key priority is to contact all those in the high-risk groups. ""We absolutely then want to move down the ages,"" he adds. On the second question, Boris Johnson says the Indian government hasn't stopped any exports. He praises the Serum Institute (the Indian firm making some of the vaccines) and says the delay is due to various technical reasons. Helen CattPolitical correspondent It's been a week when the vaccine programme has hit its first really major bump
since the start of the rollout. Concerns
voiced in Europe risk threatening another, if they put people off getting their
vaccine. So
there's a real effort by the Prime Minister to reassure on three fronts this
evening: Emily Morgan from ITV asks if the vaccine supply issue might mean the government fails one of the tests it has set itself to ease restrictions. The PM says ""no"". ""We'll be able to meet the targets in exactly the way I've described,"" he adds. He says easing restrictions on 12 April will enable the government to ""get on"" with its timetable for unlocking restrictions. But he says this still remains dependent on the four tests the government has set out continuing to be met. Prof Chris Whitty says the British people understand the vaccine is effective The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks if the safety concerns over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might have put some people off having their jab. The PM says the best testimony he can give is of the views of the medical professionals around him - as well as of the European medicine regulator, which earlier today published new findings to confirm there was no additional risk of blood clots in people who have had the jab. Prof Whitty adds the ""overwhelming professional view"" in the global scientific comunity is that the vaccines are very safe and effective. ""It is clear that the British public also have taken that message,"" he says, pointing to figures which suggest the uptake of the jab has been over 90% in the age groups that have already been offered the vaccine. ""The general public is, as always, sensible and steady on this - they understand this is a dangerous disease and [an] effective vaccine,"" he adds. The panel are now asked if supply will be at risk, if the EU blocks vaccine exports. ""People should be under no anxiety about that,"" the PM replies. He says the vaccines are part of ""a multi-national effort, produced as a result of international co-operation"". ""We will continue to co-operate with our European friends,"" he adds. Jane from Buckinghamshire asks if the UK can provide stats to prove the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe. Dr Raine says ""yes we can - we're committed to transparency"". She says the MHRA publishes all of the adverse drug reactions. Prof Chris Whitty, England's deputy chief medical officer, says all drugs come with some risk, explaining that even aspirin can cause problems. He says the risk benefit of the AstraZeneca jab is ""really in favour"" of getting vaccinated.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Stuart Lubbock was found dead in Michael Barrymore's swimming pool in March 2001 A 50-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the indecent assault and murder of Stuart Lubbock at the home of Michael Barrymore. Mr Lubbock, 31, died in hospital after being found unconscious in the TV presenter's pool in Roydon, Essex. He had been attending a party at the home of Mr Barrymore, 68, with eight other people in March 2001. The man, who was arrested in Cheshire, has since been released on bail, Essex Police said. A post-mortem examination found Mr Lubbock had suffered ""horrific"" injuries prior to his death, police said. Alcohol, ecstasy and cocaine were found in his bloodstream. Det Supt Lucy Morris, Essex Police's head of major crime, said the arrest was made after ""significant new information"" came to light following a renewed appeal in February 2020. This video can not be played Stuart Lubbock: Murder arrest followed 'significant new information' ""This information has led to us making an arrest and over the coming days we will be contacting all those who were present at the party at the time as well as others who may have information,"" she said. ""As we stated last February and have continually stated over the last 20 years, we believe someone or some people at that party know what happened."" Det Supt Morris said the investigation had been ""extremely lengthy and complex"", adding: ""We have never given up on finding out what exactly happened to Stuart and we will not stop in our pursuit of justice for him and for his family and friends."" Mr Lubbock, a butcher from Harlow, was described by neighbours at the time of his death as a ""pleasant, sociable"" man. No-one has ever been charged with any offence in relation to his death. Stuart Lubbock's father Terry said he had been living ""to get justice"" for his son Reacting to news of the arrest, Mr Lubbock's father Terry said: ""There is just so much going on in my head. I can't get my head around it. ""Of course I'm happy. Of course this is good news. But it's been 20 years. This has nearly killed me."" In February, the 76-year-old from Harlow said he had only months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. ""All I've been living for is to get justice for Stuart,"" he said. Michael Barrymore has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing Mr Barrymore and two other men were arrested in 2007 on suspicion of sexual assault and murder, but were later released without charge. The TV personality, who was known for shows including Strike It Lucky, has always denied involvement in the death. Speaking last year, he said: ""I have had nothing to do with this whatsoever and yet I keep getting bashed and bullied by the media."" On Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr Barrymore said it would be inappropriate to comment following the arrest. Mr Barrymore's Essex home became the centre of inquiries into how Mr Lubbock died An inquest into Mr Lubbock's death, in 2002, recorded an open verdict. Three years ago, the then-attorney general, Jeremy Wright, refused to let Terry Lubbock make a High Court application for a second inquest. In 2009, the police watchdog published the findings of a review of the investigation into Mr Lubbock's death, concluding that officers missed crucial evidence and did not ensure vital forensic tests were completed until six years later. Last year's police appeal coincided with the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary about Mr Lubbock's death.

"Donald Trump's net worth dropped by about $700m to $2.3bn (Â£1.65bn) during his time as president, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Covid-19 pandemic hit his fortunes hard, with Mr Trump's office buildings, branded hotels and resorts losing revenue and falling in value. His fleet of planes and golf courses have also seen drops in their value. Mr Trump is currently under a criminal investigation into his financial affairs and his family business. Trumpâs taxes: Why they matter to a criminal probe Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded Donald Trump 'paid $750 in federal income taxes' Bloomberg analysed financial documents and other filings from May 2016 and January 2021 to calculate Mr Trump's wealth before and after he became US president. Mr Trump's commercial real estate accounts for about three-quarters of his net worth. The office towers he owns or co-owns have seen big drops in valuations as more people work from home, a trend that could last in the long term. Bloomberg, which provides financial news and data, estimates a 26% drop in the value of his main commercial property holdings. He also owns, manages or licenses his name to about a dozen hotels and resorts, plus 19 golf courses. Although golf has become popular during the pandemic as a socially distanced outdoor sport, Mr Trump's two courses in Scotland have consistently lost money, filings show. After the Capitol Hill siege in January, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) of America ended an agreement to host its 2022 championship tournament at Mr Trump's New Jersey golf course, saying it would hurt the group's brand. This video can not be played Trump describes allegations he avoided taxes as ""fake news"" Deutsche Bank, the only bank willing to lend to him after his bankruptcies in the 1990s, also said after the riots that it would not do business with him again. Mr Trump also owns a fleet of planes that includes a Boeing 757. These planes are decades old and have been marked down in value over the years, according to financial disclosures seen by Bloomberg. Seven planes were valued at around $59m in 2015 and five were valued at about $6.5m in 2020. The value of Mr Trump's aircraft has dropped over the years, in part because he has sold some of his fleet. During his presidency, Mr Trump's finances were regularly in the spotlight and he has been very secretive about how much tax he pays. Last month the Supreme Court ordered Mr Trump to hand over his tax returns and other financial records to prosecutors in New York. For months they have been trying to obtain eight years' worth of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns. The investigation was originally started in 2018 to examine the Trump Organization's role in hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had had affairs with Mr Trump. As a former president, Donald Trump can expect to sign some lucrative media deals to recover some of his lost wealth, such as a post-presidential memoir. Barack and Michelle Obama reportedly got paid about $65m for their memoirs, while Bill Clinton earned a $15m advance for his 2004 book. Bloomberg says the most obvious way Mr Trump can profit post-presidency is with a news channel or social media platform that would appeal to his 74m voters in the 2020 election.

"Kwasi Kwarteng said it was important to restore confidence Proposals to reduce the dominance of the ""Big Four"" accountancy firms and scrap the industry regulator have been unveiled by the government. The aim is to improve regulatory standards after high profile corporate failures such as Carillion and BHS. Also, company directors will face more responsibility to ensure accounts are accurate, or face tougher penalties. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the changes would help restore confidence in business. There will now be a 16-week consultation on the proposals. The business of auditing companies' accounts, and ensuring they are a fair reflection of their financial health, is dominated by four accountancy firms: KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. However, there is concern that providing both accountancy and auditing services creates a conflict of interest. Under the new rules, large companies would be required to use smaller auditing firms to conduct part of their annual audit, in an attempt to dilute the Big Four's dominance. The new proposals would require KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY to make their audits more rigorous. They could face a cap on the number of companies on the FTSE 350 index they may audit, if those improvements don't go far enough. The government said last year almost a third of audits inspected on the FTSE 350 were in need of improvement. The largest private companies in the UK would also face greater scrutiny from regulators under the new rules. The collapse of construction giant Carillion shed a light on failings in the audit profession. Sir Donald Brydon, a former chairman of the London Stock Exchange who authored a government review on improving corporate governance, said the new proposals would help to ""restore trust"" and that similar measures had worked in the US. ""So many of us depend on business for our living and our life, whether it is suppliers, customers, employees or shareholders,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""What really matters is that the information on which those people make their decisions is accurate and honest, and an auditor's role is to ensure as far as humanly possible, at a reasonable cost, that information is truthful."" He added: ""People want to know three things about a business - how is it performing, is it honestly run, and will it survive. And auditors are key to answering all three."" Mr Kwarteng said: ""Restoring business confidence, but also people's confidence in business, is crucial to repairing our economy and building back better from the pandemic. ""When big companies go bust, the effects are felt far and wide with job losses and the British taxpayer picking up the tab. ""It's clear from large-scale collapses like Thomas Cook, Carillion and BHS that Britain's audit regime needs to be modernised with a package of sensible, proportionate reforms."" A new accountancy watchdog, the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA), would be launched to implement the changes, replacing the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). It would have legal powers to force auditors and companies to resubmit their accounts without the need for court action. UK companies and directors also face curbs on dividend and bonus payments if there is misconduct, they publish inaccurate accounts, or have insufficient cash reserves. Directors of failed firms could also see their bonuses clawed back up to two years after a pay award is made, to clamp down on ""rewards for failure"", the government added. By providing more transparency over company accounts the new rules should also help deter firms that could be facing insolvency  from making largescale dividend and bonus payments. They will also be required to produce ""resilience statements"". Accountancy firms welcomed the proposals, with Jon Holt, head of audit at KPMG UK, saying: ""It is an ambitious package of strategic reform. Prioritising and clarifying the audit reform agenda is an important step to rebuild trust in the profession."" Kevin Ellis, chairman and senior partner at PwC UK, also stressed that importance of ""driving trust and confidence"" in the profession. Legal bid launched to ban ex-Carillion directors ""We welcome comprehensive consultation. For lasting change, we need a coherent set of measures and for all parties to play their part. Listening to the views of a wide range of businesses, investors and other interested parties will be key to achieving this,"" Mr Ellis said. The proposals also won the support of employers' groups. The CBI saying the reforms would ""inject focus and momentum behind efforts to maintain the highest possible standards"". The British Chambers of Commerce said the changes would be a ""positive step"". But Suren Thiru, BCC head of economics, cautioned: ""Government and regulators must tread carefully to avoid unintended consequences, including adding to the already onerous cost burden on firms and undermining the UK's global reputation as great place to do business.""

"An expected reduction in the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses. The shipment, produced by the Serum Institute of India, has been held up by four weeks, the BBC has been told. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said neither a single factory nor a country was responsible for supply issues. The Department of Health insists it is still on track to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July. NHS Englandwarned of a reduction in supply in Aprilin a letter to local health organisations on Wednesday. The Scottish government said it was""seeking clarity"" from the UK Vaccine Taskforce on future supplies,while the governments in Wales andNorthern Irelandsaid they were examining how their own vaccine programmes could be affected. A spokesperson for the Serum Institute said: ""Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India."" A source told the BBC that although the original aim had been to deliver the next five million in March, there was not a stipulated time for the delivery of the doses. Why are India's vaccine makers struggling to meet demand? What is the Serum Institute of India? When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? Mr Jenrick told the BBC that the government had learned of vaccine supply issues ""in the last few days"". He said the UK had less supply of the vaccine ""than we might have hoped for in the coming weeks but we expect it to increase again through the course of April"". The vaccine rollout would be ""slightly slower than we might have hoped but not slower than the target we had set ourselves"" of offering a first dose to all people aged over 50 by 15 April, and all adults by the end of July, he said. Anyone with an appointment for a second jab ""should have complete confidence"" that they will go ahead, he said, adding: ""The month of April will be different - and it was always going to be - because I think this will be the month that second jabs exceed first jabs."" On Monday NHS sources said there would bea big increase in the number of people being offered vaccinations in the coming daysafter the UK received the first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said over the next two weeks the NHS would be pushing on with vaccinating over-50s and vulnerable people while it had a ""bumper supply"". He said the announcement of a shortage was ""disappointing"" news and it would impact ""the group we were hoping to start on in April which is the people under the age of 50 without any pre-existing conditions"" who would now have to wait until May. More than25 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, while around 1.7 million have had a second jab. Afteropening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the government's Joint Committee for Vaccinations and Immunisation (JCVI), said the disruption to supply meant the UK's rollout would be going from ""extremely fast to somewhat less fast"", rather than ""juddering to a halt"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the supply issues could affect infection rates but should not have an impact on hospital admissions, as those who are most vulnerable to Covid-19 were being prioritised for the jab. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock said vaccine supply is ""always lumpy, but we're on course"" The Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries. Its chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been""directed to prioritise the huge needs of India"".,external He has also raised concerns about raw material shortages,attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines,,externalsuch as specialised bags and filters. Earlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest delayed for several weeks. The rest of the UK's AstraZeneca doses are being produced domestically and the company says there are no supply issues. Pfizer, which produces its vaccine in Belgium, says its deliveries to the NHS are also on track. The UK has also approved a third vaccine - Moderna, which is due to start being rolled out in late spring. More than 400 million doses of Covid vaccines have been ordered by the UK,including jabs made by Valneva, GlaxoSmithKline, Novavax and Janssen, which are yet to be approved. Predicting what supply is available in the future is difficult. Vaccine production is a biological process so manufacturers can never absolutely guarantee how much will be available. When you are relying on supplies from abroad there's an added element of complexity. The UK only has two plants that are currently producing an approved vaccine - both make the AstraZeneca jab. Stocks of Pfizer come from Belgium. Both these supply routes are currently delivering what has been forecast. A deal was done with India to supply 10 million doses. But it was always made clear the exact date of shipment could not be absolutely guaranteed. The government had understood the full shipment would arrive in time for mid-March and felt it needed to get vaccination clinics ready to do extra doses. They have now had to be stood down. It comes after expectations were ramped up at the weekend after briefing to the media that the target to offer all adults a jab by the end of July could be hit a month early. Those hopes now seem to have been dashed. Another reminder of just how fragile supply is. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give a statement to MPs in the Commons later on Thursday. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthtweeted that,externalpeople ""across the country"" would be ""anxious and worried"" about news of delays. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is due on Thursday to release the findings of an investigation into cases of blood clots in a handful of Oxford-AstraZeneca jab recipients. Several European countries have paused the use of the vaccine but the regulator has saidthere was ""no indication"" it caused the clots. The World Health Organization has urged countries not to halt vaccinations. A further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to figures updated on Wednesday from theUK government.,externalA further 5,758 people have tested positive.

"This video can not be played Atlanta shootings: ""It's scary just to be an Asian American woman"" A man has been charged with murder over the killing of eight people at massage parlours in Atlanta, Georgia. Officials cannot yet confirm if the attack, in which six Asian women were killed, was racially motivated. Four victims were named on Wednesday. The suspect, named as Robert Aaron Long, faces multiple counts of murder as well as aggravated assault. Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said the suspect may have been a patron and claimed to have a ""sex addiction"". The attack comes amid a sharp uptick in crimes against Asian-Americans. Four of the victims have been identified by Cherokee County officials as Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R Hernandez-Ortiz was identified as having been injured. In a news conference on Wednesday, investigators said Mr Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia, admitted to the shooting spree, and said that he denied that the attack was motivated by race. He has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department. Two of the spas were across the road from each other in Atlanta ""He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,"" said Capt Jay Baker, adding that Mr Long was caught with a 9mm handgun and did not resist arrest. But Capt Baker's remarks - that ""yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did"" - came in for widespread criticism for appearing to sympathise with the alleged perpetrator. Massage parlours are known to sometimes provide prostitution services, but authorities say there is no indication yet that this is the case at the targeted locations. ""These are legally operating businesses that have not been on our radar,"" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who added that the city would not engage in ""victim shaming, victim blaming"". Police also noted it is still too early in the investigation to definitively state a motive and that the suspect appeared to have been acting alone. Ms Bottoms said that he was on his way to Florida, possibly to commit more shootings, when he was arrested. The suspect's parents helped to identify him, officials told reporters. According to CBS News, the suspect told investigators that ""he loved God and guns"". The first happened at about 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Cherokee County. Two people died at the scene and three were taken to hospital, where two more died, sheriff's office spokesman Capt Baker said. He later confirmed the victims were two Asian women, a white woman and a white man, and said a Hispanic man had been wounded. Less than an hour later, police were called to a ""robbery in progress"" at Gold Spa in north-east Atlanta. In the recording of the 911 call released on Wednesday, a woman tells the dispatcher that she's hiding from the assailant. ""Do you have a description of the male?"" the operator asks. ""We're hiding right now,"" the woman replies. ""They have a gun."" ""Please come, ok?"" she says. When authorities arrived at the spa, ""officers located three females deceased inside the location from apparent gunshot wounds"", police said. While there, officers were called to a spa across the street, called Aromatherapy Spa, where they found another woman shot dead. On a second 911 call, a woman tells the operator that she got a call from a friend who said a man had entered the spa and fired a gun. ""They said some guy came in... We heard a gunshot and the lady's passed out in front of the door,"" she says. ""And everybody is scared and everybody is hiding."" Investigators who had studied CCTV footage then released images of a suspect near one of the spas. Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta. Robert Aaron Long was taken into custody Authorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. Police have only identified the people who were attacked in Cherokee County at this time. Details have been slow to emerge. Here is what we know about the named victims so far. Ashley Yaun and her husband had gone to Young's Asian Massage for a couples massage, according to an online fundraiser. Her husband survived the attack and was unharmed. The couple have two children. ""We just don't know how to do any of this alone,"" the GoFundMe page says. A GoFundMe for Mr Hernandez-Ortiz, the only victim to survive the attacks, says that he is intensive care after being shot in the forehead, lungs and stomach. His daughter Yoseline, 9, told WGCL-TV that ""he is a really good dad,"" and ""I don't want him to go."" By Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Washington Heartbroken, fearful, angry, fed up. These are some shared feelings of people who showed up at a vigil in Washington DC the night after the shooting. Around 100 people marched in Chinatown and lit candles, mourning the eight lives lost in Atlanta - six of them of Asian descent. The authorities have not linked the killing with anti-Asian hate crime. But many here believe the shooting is yet another senseless attack against Asians and Asian-Americans during the pandemic. ""It's scary to be an Asian-American woman anywhere in the US,"" an Asian woman told me. She said it was finally time for her to speak up, after being told by her parents to stay silent about racism she experienced while growing up. There's a myth about Asian-Americans being the quiet ""model minority"". But those who attended the vigil, both Asians and non-Asians, spoke loud and clear with a unified voice. ""We will not fight racism with racism,"" a Korean-American man spoke to the crowd emotionally, ""We will fight racism with unity!"" Though authorities say it is too early to know if the victims were targeted because of their race, many online have criticised a recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, which activists have linked to rhetoric blaming Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic. The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders acknowledged a motive was unclear, but said ""right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian American community that must be addressed"". It called the shootings ""an unspeakable tragedy"" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has ""been reeling from high levels of racist attacks"". From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise ""A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,"" Mayor Bottoms said in a statement, adding that she had been in communication with the White House. Mr Biden tweeted that he and the first lady were ""keeping everyone impacted by the shootings in Atlanta in our prayers"". ""We don't yet know the motive, but what we do know is that the Asian-American community is feeling enormous pain tonight. The recent attacks against the community are un-American.  They must stop,"" he said. Vice-President Kamala Harris, the first Asian-American to hold the office, said during a Wednesday meeting with Irish officials: ""I do want to say to our Asian-American community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people."" Ben Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: ""Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism."" Two of the spas were across the road from each other in Atlanta Atlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: ""Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence.""
