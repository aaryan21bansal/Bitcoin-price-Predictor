"Divock Origi headed in a dramatic winner in the 86th minute Divock Origi's late winner sent Liverpool top of the Premier League with victory at Newcastle United to put the pressure back on Manchester City and ensure the title race will go to the final game. Origi - on as substitute for Mohamed Salah after he was taken off on a stretcher with a head injury sustained in a collision with Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka - headed in Xherdan Shaqiri's free-kick in the 86th minute. It gave Liverpool three points after a topsy-turvy night on Tyneside. Now Manchester City must beat Leicester City at Etihad Stadium on Monday to ensure they retain the initiative going into the final round of games next Sunday. Liverpool went ahead after 13 minutes when Virgil van Dijk arrived unmarked on the end of Trent Alexander-Arnold's free-kick. Newcastle were quickly level when Christian Atsu scored from close range after Alexander-Arnold handled Salomon Rondon's shot on the line but Salah took advantage of more poor marking to volley home another fine delivery from the young defender. Rondon, a handful all night, drew Newcastle level once more nine minutes after the break when Liverpool failed to clear a corner and Jurgen Klopp's side suffered another blow whenSalah was taken off after a lengthy delay. Origi was introduced and made the decisive contribution that keeps the title race alive - although Salah's injury is a worry with Liverpool attempting to claw back a 3-0 deficit against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final second leg at Anfield on Tuesday. 'Liverpool survive night laced with danger â and now look to Rodgers for helping hand' We have qualified for our final - Klopp Salah could face Barca but Firmino out How the title race could still go to a 39th game play-off Jordan Henderson's side host Wolves on the final day of the season Liverpool simply refuse to buckle in their pursuit of Manchester City - no matter how long they have to wait to get the victories they require. Klopp's side are showing remarkable drive and resilience, illustrated by the manner in which they have won so many games in the closing stages, especially when the pressure has been on. There have been prime examples at home to Everton and Tottenham but in recent weeks they have stayed the course to outlast opponents such as Fulham, Southampton and now Newcastle away from home. And here, in this unforgiving Tyneside atmosphere, they overcame adversity and a Newcastle side who were in no mood to stand meekly aside despite Premier League safety being assured. Liverpool were vulnerable in defence but this is a side that carries a persistent threat and it was the introduction of the likes of Shaqiri and Origi that made the difference. Liverpool could have been forgiven for thinking the fates were against them when Salah took that sickening blow in an accidental aerial collision with Dubravka, the Egyptian lying on the floor for several minutes before being taken away on a stretcher to sympathetic applause from the entire stadium. And yet they responded once more, digging deep to secure three points with Origi's glancing header and this means Manchester City know the stakes are huge when they face Brendan Rodgers' in-form side on Monday.

The messages are still mixed but not here among Newcastle's fanbase. There is only one outcome these fans, who idolise Benitez, want. Whether Benitez gives them what they desire remains to be seen but once again he has kept a workmanlike squad in the Premier League with room to spare and now wants the investment to send them into the top 10. Ironically, on this night, some of the Benitez trademarks were missing as wretched defensive organisation allowed Liverpool to cash in on each of their goals. But, as he led the players around St James' Park to take the supporters' applause it was clear that those fans now want the final line of this season's story to be written with Benitez's name on a new deal. When asked about his future, Benitez said: ""We have been talking the last week and hopefully in one or two weeks will have more news."" Andrew Robertson was full of his usual attacking threat, making more passes in the opposition half than any other player Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport:""I know what kind of boys I have - who doesn't know after the game today? If anyone thought Newcastle weren't playing for anything, wow, that was competitive - but we deserved to win. ""I only have to help the boys. I don't feel pressure. If we are champions then we are champions, you can't feel pressure when you do your best. On Divock Origi's winning goal:""That's nearly a fairytale.

The fans appreciate that and were behind the team, we couldn't ask for more. ""We made a few mistakes at set pieces but in terms of effort and desire we did quite well. We are trying to make sure we don't make so many mistakes. I don't know about the third goal but the first two we can do much better. ""We have been quite consistent, working really hard as a team and as a unit, staying very compact. It was a great performance from us."" Liverpool have scored 18 headed goals in the Premier League this season and 12 goals via substitutes, more than any other team in both categories. The Reds have scored more goals against Newcastle in the Premier League than against any other team (98). Liverpool's Mohamed Salah scored his 100th league goal in European top-flight football, with 56 of those coming in the Premier League (also 35 in Italian Serie A and 9 in Swiss Super League). Liverpool are the first team in Premier League history to have at least two defenders provide 10+ assists each in a single campaign (Trent Alexander-Arnold 11, Andy Robertson 11). Newcastle's Salomon Rondon has hit double figures for goals in a Premier League season for the first time. Only Chelsea's Eden Hazard (48%) has had a hand in a higher proportion of his team's goals in the Premier League this season than Rondon (45% - scoring 10 goals and assisting 7 of 38). Liverpool host Wolves at Anfield on the final day of the season - Sunday, 12 May - while Newcastle are away at Fulham, with both matches kicking off at 15:00 BST.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Aberdeen 0-3 Celtic Celtic secured an eighth consecutive title in style with a convincing win away to wasteful Aberdeen. Neil Lennon's side are now two-thirds of the way towards a third consecutive clean sweep of domestic trophies after already lifting the League Cup. The Dons' James Wilson fired wastefully against a post before Mikael Lustig's diving header opened the scoring. Jozo Simunovic rose to meet a Callum McGregor corner after half-time before Odsonne Edouard fired the third. For Celtic not to have finished the weekend as champions for a 50th time, Aberdeen would have had to have ended the visitors' 11-game unbeaten run, combined with a win for second-placed Rangers at home to Hibernian on Sunday. But the Glasgow side's sixth consecutive win at Pittodrie means they have now won eight domestic trophies in a row before their Scottish Cup final against Heart of Midlothian on 25 May. Celtic will now eye matching the nine titles in a row they last achieved in 1974 and which was matched by city rivals Rangers in 1997. Aberdeen remain in a battle for fourth with Kilmarnock, the Ayrshire side later going above the Dons on goal difference with victory at Tynecastle. Relive the drama as Celtic clinch title Who did you vote man of the match? Games, goals & eight in a row - How does Celtic's latest title stack up? This video can not be played Watch: Celtic players and staff celebrate eighth successive title with supporters As a club, Celtic have experienced great sadness in recent weeks with the loss of two of their precious Lisbon Lions. The tributes have flooded in from all corners for Billy McNeill and Stevie Chalmers. The lives of two great footballers who helped lift the European Cup have been celebrated in word and song and that carried on at Pittodrie. Another minute's applause but most importantly, given what these men represented, another victory and another league title secured. Eight in a row was never in doubt, but it was banked here. Celtic survived a few scares but cantered away to win handily. Indeed, that could be the story of their season. Some wobbles but easy enough in the end, a league won largely in third gear. The Dons could have delayed the inevitability of the title party, but teams don't tend to beat Celtic in domestic competition while spurning big moments. How the Dons will rue the early chances they had. How Derek McInnes, sitting in the purgatory of the stand while serving his touchline ban, will have suffered angst at what might have been. These weren't half chances or 50-50 affairs. These were borderline sitters, both of them falling to James Wilson, a striker who finished like strikers tend to do when they're not used to scoring goals. Wilson, big on reputation but low on end product, can only boast 13 goals in a career that spans almost 90 games. This video can not be played Five games that helped Celtic win eight in a row Celtic had the lion's share of possession, but it was the Dons who carved out the most interesting opportunities before Lustig got the Celtic party started. The first of them came when Scott Brown was hustled and harried and gave the ball away in the process. Aberdeen swept left and, when Greg Stewart's cross came in it fell to Wilson, standing all alone and so close to Scott Bain that he could have heard him gulp. His volley was thumped into the ground and bounced up and over the Celtic goalkeeper's crossbar. Edouard wasted a decent chance soon after, but another huge moment followed. This was the second act of wastefulness from Wilson. Scott McKenna did wonderfully to win the ball before bombing down the left and curling a gorgeous ball across goal and into the path of Sam Cosgrove. The striker's shot was beaten away by Bain, but when the loose ball broke to Wilson, it looked certain that the Dons were about to take the lead. Instead, Wilson struck his shot off the outside of Bain's right-hand post and wide. It was a calamitous miss and, sure enough, Aberdeen were made to pay for it, just as Kilmarnock were made to pay for not executing at Celtic Park last week when the game was still goalless. Looking gift horses in the mouth is not the best plan against the champions. Seven minutes after Wilson's miss, Lustig got away from Stevie May and dived to head in McGregor's excellent delivery from the left. It was yet another assist for McGregor, a titan of this team - and there'd be a second one later on. Lustig's terrific finish was the cue for the celebrations. Celtic only needed a point to lock down the title. They cruised on to take all three. Celtic doubled their lead eight minutes into the new half. An out-swinging McGregor corner was headed home by Simunovic, the centre-half who, over the last few weeks, has showed the centre-forwards how to do it. The hosts had a chance or two to halve the deficit but couldn't produce Celtic's efficiency in front of goal. They worked hard and got frustrated at times. Cosgrove was fortunate not to be sent off when he brought down Jonny Hayes, who had appeared for Kieran Tierney. The full-back, still slightly diminished by injury, will now surely be wrapped in cotton wool before the cup final and that tilt for the treble treble. Celtic's title day had a last flourish when they broke free and Edouard added a third, and a 21st for the season. That well and truly sent the visitors into raptures.

""I'm really delighted with my defence. Simunovic has come back in beside Ajer and has been outstanding, Lustig outstanding, Kieran already a Celtic great, and my goalkeeper has been unbelievable. ""He was unbelievable today when we got sloppy and put a bit of pressure on ourselves, but the second half was comprehensive."" Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes:""I thought we were well in the game. Celtic started the game in charge, which is understandable as we had one or two playing out of position. ""But I thought that, once we got a foothold in the game, we had good opportunities and looked a threat on the counter-attack. ""The only thing we were guilty of is not putting the ball into the net.

"Nadia Sparkes had a ""brilliant"" first day at Reepham High after being bullied at her previous school A 13-year-old nicknamed ""Trash Girl"" by bullies for picking litter has changed schools after pupils assaulted her. Nadia Sparkes won international praise and awards for gathering litter on her journey to and from school, and refused to let the taunts deter her. Police got involved last term when she was shown a knife and punched at school, her mother said. Her old school, Hellesdon High School near Norwich, said pupils' safety and welfare was of paramount importance. Since 2017, Nadia has set off for school an hour early each day to pick up litter and put it in her bicycle basket. She turned the ""Trash Girl"" slur on its head and embraced the nickname because it made her feel ""like a superhero"" - attracting more than 4,000 followers on social media. Nadia Sparkes said the ""Trash Girl"" nickname made her feel ""like a superhero"" But Paula Sparkes said her daughter was not championed at her school. ""The staff were not on her side to help and support her and we felt it was not appropriate for her to be there any more,"" she said.

Norfolk Police confirmed it was called to an incident at the school and had referred a teenager to the Youth Offending Team, which was providing support. ""Officers also provided extra knife crime prevention presentations to all years groups,"" a spokeswoman added. Nadia was depicted as a superhero in a cartoon by Creative Nation in January last year In a separate incident, Nadia had to sit through a class covered in orange juice that had been thrown in her face, her mother said. ""Nadia picked up a [volunteering]award from the prime minister,externalearlier this month - it's a shame when you think what the school could have achieved with this, and they haven't.""

"Snowdon is the busiest mountain in the UK Crowds queuing at the peaks of Snowdon and Pen y Fan highlight the need to invest in infrastructure around Wales' mountains, authorities say. More people are visiting the peaks in north and south Wales, with pictures showing crowds at the summits over the Easter holiday. But the British Mountaineering Council (BMC) said money must be spent on better facilities. The Welsh Government said Â£2m was being spent on improvements. Train tickets to the summit of Snowdon sold out in advance of last month's 10th anniversary of the Hafod Eryri visitor centre. Photos on social media also showed crowds and queues of people waiting patiently to take photos at the best vantage spots - with similar scenes at Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons.

""We're also increasingly concerned that the current standard of infrastructure is beginning to affect people's experience of Snowdonia and of Wales as a destination. ""We and other partners are doing our best with the limited resources we have. Snowdonia National Park Authority has half the resources it had 20 years ago [but] visitor numbers have at least doubled.""

"Alliance's Ross McMullan (centre) got almost 1,000 votes over the quota when he was elected to Belfast City Council PR elections in Northern Ireland are always more of a marathon than a sprint, so it's wise not to overanalyse the results at the halfway mark. The protracted drama of single transferable voting means that both candidates and parties who looked like hares early on turn into tortoises as the white tape approaches. Conversely some early stragglers eventually crawl on their hands and knees towards the finishing line. So with that caveat, where are we after day one of the count? Alliance's surge is undeniably the most striking development. So with inter-party talks due to get under way on Tuesday, what lessons might the party leaders be mulling over from the local council elections? As day one of the count drew to a close the most striking development was the strong showing for Alliance. At the halfway point their vote share was up by five percentage points, and they had broken out of their Greater Belfast heartlands by taking seats in places like the ABC council (Armagh, Banbridge & Craigavon) and Derry & Strabane where they previously had no representation. What has fuelled the Alliance success? Well since its inception in 1970 the party has stood for compromise between Orange and Green, so it seems plausible that the public's disenchantment with the paralysis at Stormont must have been an important factor. Also on Brexit, Alliance reflects a widespread anxiety about the potential impact on the border and business. With the parties due to resume talks next Tuesday, maybe the British and Irish governments could do worse than to re-readthe Alliance blueprint ""Next Steps Forward"",externalwhich suggested a variety of ways to break the deadlock including the appointment of an independent talks facilitator. Alliance haven't been the only winners - the strong performances of Green and left wing People Before Profit candidates appear to indicate generational change. And the election of the DUP's first openly gay candidate shows that times are changing, even within the party which used to be regarded as the political wing of Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian Church. The DUP leader Arlene Foster insists the party's policy opposing same-sex marriage remains unchanged. But the maverick South Down MLA Jim Wells isn't the only DUP traditionalist unnerved by the election of Alison Bennington. In private, other DUP figures think the leadership is testing the water as part of a process of incremental change. Alison Bennington (centre, with thumbs up) celebrates her election to Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council The draft deal which the DUP failed to sign off on in February of last year sidelined the issue of same sex marriage (something Sinn FÃ©in took some criticism over). But as the former Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams made clearin a blog published on polling day,externalit will be back near the top of the talks agenda in the coming weeks. The DUP seem fairly relaxed about their performance, with their vote share up and the Traditional Unionist Voice well down. But both big parties will no doubt be annoyed that they have failed to take overall control of a single council. On a good day, Sinn FÃ©in might have hoped to seize either Fermanagh & Omagh or Derry & Strabane, whilst the DUP could have had a similar aspiration in Lisburn & Castlereagh. In the event, none of these targets were hit. Sinn FÃ©in did make a breakthrough in Lisburn & Castlereagh, where they got two councillors in a chamber in which they were previously unrepresented. But some of the party's other gambits failed to pay off - notably moving Patrice Hardy into Ballymena in the hope of inheriting some SDLP votes. So far the Ulster Unionists look like the losers with a fall of two percentage points. That's partly because the former leader Mike Nesbitt had a successful council election five years ago, and under Robin Swann's leadership the party seems to lack firm direction, uncomfortably straddling a divide between its liberal and hardline unionists. The SDLP has experienced problems, with breakaway councillors in some districts and arguments over its new link with Fianna FÃ¡il. However, it has proved resilient, especially in its Derry & Strabane home turf, with impressive debuts from Cara Hunter and Mary Durkan, who is keeping the family political dynasty going. And last but not least we have a new kid on the block - the pro-life republican AontÃº with its first councillor, recently retired GP Anne McCloskey, also in Derry & Strabane. Day two and the political marathon continues. The day after the counting stops, the real runners will take to the streets of Belfast for a real marathon. It's the first time the race has taken place in the city on a Sunday, another reminder of how much the times have changed for those who still remember the days when some Northern Ireland councils used to tie up the swings in their play parks in the name of observing the Lord's Day.

"A 66-year-old man has been robbed of a five-figure sum after a group of men burst into his home and stole a safe. Police have described the attack, which took place on Friday at about 14:15 in Shields Road in Galston, near Kilmarnock, as ""incredible callous"". They said they believed the raid was pre-planned by about four or five men. It follows the theft of a safe from a family home in Paisley, in which two men forced their way into a house while a couple and a young child were inside. Following the theft in Kilmarnock, the men made off in a silver coloured Lexus GS300 car, which had a broken rear windscreen, heading towards the centre of Galston. Det Sgt Ewan Bell said: ""Although the man was not physically injured, this robbery was a terrifying experience for him to have to go through and he has been left shaken. ""Nobody should be afraid in their own home and it is vital that we find the men responsible for this incredibly callous and forceful crime."" Mr Bell said officers were going through CCTV and making door-to-door inquiries in an effort to find the men responsible. He added: ""We believe that the man we have described may have been in the area in the days leading up to the robbery and that it was a pre-planned, targeted attack."" One of the men was wearing a grey balaclava while another is described as being 5ft 10in tall, of stocky build with pale skin. He is described as having short cropped hair that was either blond or red and stubble on his face. Meanwhile, police are investigating an armed robbery at a family home in Paisley in which a safe was also stolen. A 27-year-old woman answered her door to two men in the town's Dee Crescent, at about 11:50 on Friday, when they forced their way in. The woman was in the house with her young child and 31-year-old partner. Police said the men managed to get into one of the rooms where they stole the safe. One of the suspects dropped a ""bladed weapon"" after being chased away from the scene by the 31-year-old man. Det Con John Sharkey said the two suspects were dressed entirely in black and would have ""looked completely out of place"". He added: ""Although thankfully not injured, this was very distressing for both the man and woman involved especially as their young child was also in the house at the time. ""The man gave chase after the suspects along Dee Crescent and managed to recover one of the weapons used, but the men got away. ""At this time we do not know why their house was targeted."" The suspects, who made off on foot towards Fulbar Road, are described as both white, between 30 and 40 years of age and wearing almost identical clothing. This includes black 'work wear' type jackets, dark trousers, dark sunglasses, gloves and black baseball caps.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Aberdeen 0-3 Celtic Celtic secured an eighth consecutive title in style with a convincing win away to wasteful Aberdeen. Neil Lennon's side are now two-thirds of the way towards a third consecutive clean sweep of domestic trophies after already lifting the League Cup. The Dons' James Wilson fired wastefully against a post before Mikael Lustig's diving header opened the scoring. Jozo Simunovic rose to meet a Callum McGregor corner after half-time before Odsonne Edouard fired the third. For Celtic not to have finished the weekend as champions for a 50th time, Aberdeen would have had to have ended the visitors' 11-game unbeaten run, combined with a win for second-placed Rangers at home to Hibernian on Sunday. But the Glasgow side's sixth consecutive win at Pittodrie means they have now won eight domestic trophies in a row before their Scottish Cup final against Heart of Midlothian on 25 May. Celtic will now eye matching the nine titles in a row they last achieved in 1974 and which was matched by city rivals Rangers in 1997. Aberdeen remain in a battle for fourth with Kilmarnock, the Ayrshire side later going above the Dons on goal difference with victory at Tynecastle. Relive the drama as Celtic clinch title Who did you vote man of the match? Games, goals & eight in a row - How does Celtic's latest title stack up? This video can not be played Watch: Celtic players and staff celebrate eighth successive title with supporters As a club, Celtic have experienced great sadness in recent weeks with the loss of two of their precious Lisbon Lions. The tributes have flooded in from all corners for Billy McNeill and Stevie Chalmers. The lives of two great footballers who helped lift the European Cup have been celebrated in word and song and that carried on at Pittodrie. Another minute's applause but most importantly, given what these men represented, another victory and another league title secured. Eight in a row was never in doubt, but it was banked here. Celtic survived a few scares but cantered away to win handily. Indeed, that could be the story of their season. Some wobbles but easy enough in the end, a league won largely in third gear. The Dons could have delayed the inevitability of the title party, but teams don't tend to beat Celtic in domestic competition while spurning big moments. How the Dons will rue the early chances they had. How Derek McInnes, sitting in the purgatory of the stand while serving his touchline ban, will have suffered angst at what might have been. These weren't half chances or 50-50 affairs. These were borderline sitters, both of them falling to James Wilson, a striker who finished like strikers tend to do when they're not used to scoring goals. Wilson, big on reputation but low on end product, can only boast 13 goals in a career that spans almost 90 games. This video can not be played Five games that helped Celtic win eight in a row Celtic had the lion's share of possession, but it was the Dons who carved out the most interesting opportunities before Lustig got the Celtic party started. The first of them came when Scott Brown was hustled and harried and gave the ball away in the process. Aberdeen swept left and, when Greg Stewart's cross came in it fell to Wilson, standing all alone and so close to Scott Bain that he could have heard him gulp. His volley was thumped into the ground and bounced up and over the Celtic goalkeeper's crossbar. Edouard wasted a decent chance soon after, but another huge moment followed. This was the second act of wastefulness from Wilson. Scott McKenna did wonderfully to win the ball before bombing down the left and curling a gorgeous ball across goal and into the path of Sam Cosgrove. The striker's shot was beaten away by Bain, but when the loose ball broke to Wilson, it looked certain that the Dons were about to take the lead. Instead, Wilson struck his shot off the outside of Bain's right-hand post and wide. It was a calamitous miss and, sure enough, Aberdeen were made to pay for it, just as Kilmarnock were made to pay for not executing at Celtic Park last week when the game was still goalless. Looking gift horses in the mouth is not the best plan against the champions. Seven minutes after Wilson's miss, Lustig got away from Stevie May and dived to head in McGregor's excellent delivery from the left. It was yet another assist for McGregor, a titan of this team - and there'd be a second one later on. Lustig's terrific finish was the cue for the celebrations. Celtic only needed a point to lock down the title. They cruised on to take all three. Celtic doubled their lead eight minutes into the new half. An out-swinging McGregor corner was headed home by Simunovic, the centre-half who, over the last few weeks, has showed the centre-forwards how to do it. The hosts had a chance or two to halve the deficit but couldn't produce Celtic's efficiency in front of goal. They worked hard and got frustrated at times. Cosgrove was fortunate not to be sent off when he brought down Jonny Hayes, who had appeared for Kieran Tierney. The full-back, still slightly diminished by injury, will now surely be wrapped in cotton wool before the cup final and that tilt for the treble treble. Celtic's title day had a last flourish when they broke free and Edouard added a third, and a 21st for the season. That well and truly sent the visitors into raptures. This video can not be played ""Look I'm here to do a job and I've done it"" Celtic interim manager Neil Lennon:""It's a great way to get over the line and now we can enjoy it. ""I'm really delighted with my defence. Simunovic has come back in beside Ajer and has been outstanding, Lustig outstanding, Kieran already a Celtic great, and my goalkeeper has been unbelievable. ""He was unbelievable today when we got sloppy and put a bit of pressure on ourselves, but the second half was comprehensive."" Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes:""I thought we were well in the game. Celtic started the game in charge, which is understandable as we had one or two playing out of position. ""But I thought that, once we got a foothold in the game, we had good opportunities and looked a threat on the counter-attack. ""The only thing we were guilty of is not putting the ball into the net. If you don't take your chances against a team like Celtic, it comes back to bite you and it certainly did.""

"Theresa May must resign or the Conservatives should force her out, after the party's heavy local election losses, Iain Duncan Smith has said. The former Tory leader called Mrs May a ""caretaker PM"" and described her attempts to reach a Brexit deal with Labour as ""absurd"". The party suffered its worst local election result in England since 1995. Other senior Conservatives have urged Tory MPs to compromise with Labour to ensure Brexit is delivered. Elections were held on Thursday for 248 English councils, six mayors, and all 11councils in Northern Ireland. No elections took place in Scotland or Wales. The Conservatives lost 1,334 councillors, while Labour failed to make expected gains, instead losing 82 seats. The Liberal Democrats benefited from Tory losses, gaining 703 seats, with the Greens and independents also making gains. Following the results, Mrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both insisted they would push ahead with talks seeking cross-party agreement on leaving the EU. Mrs May said it was clear the public wanted ""to see the issue of Brexit resolved"". Smaller parties make gains in NI elections Tories lose more than 1,300 councillors Local elections: The main parties punished Election results in maps But Mr Duncan Smith, a leading Brexiteer, said many Conservatives would refuse to back any deal reached between the two parties. Mrs May must announce her departure ""very soon"", he said, and if she did not go, the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs would have to force her to do so. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""As a result of the devastating election result, the PM has in effect become a caretaker. ""As such, she is not empowered to make any deal with the Labour Party which itself suffered a very similar result. Two discredited administrations making a discredited deal is not the answer to the electorate."" In December, Mrs May survived a vote of no-confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party, but in March she pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU.

The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after Parliament was unable to agree a way forward. Ruth Davidson warned the parties would suffer the wrath of voters in the EU elections over Brexit In the wake of the Conservatives' local election losses, senior Tories have called for the party to compromise in order to reach an agreement with Labour to end the Brexit deadlock. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson called for the negotiating teams of both parties - who are currently locked in talks - to ""get Brexit sorted, get a deal over the line and let Britain move on"". This video can not be played Theresa May on local election results: ""Simple message... just get on and deliver Brexit"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Conservative Party needed to listen to the election results and be ""in the mood for compromise"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the Conservatives might have to move towardsLabour's proposal of a permanent customs union- a move many Brexiteers in the party oppose - in order to solve the impasse in Westminster. Mrs May's government has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union after the UK leaves the EU, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. Labour has said the EU may show flexibility over the issue and allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Mr Hancock suggested ""coming up with something in-between"", and called for ""an open dialogue in which we can make an agreement"". But Mr Duncan Smith said a customs union was ""the worst of all worlds because you lose your decision-making capacity"". Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ""glimmer of hope"" that a compromise between the Conservative and Labour ""core-voters"" could be reached. He added that while he supported the withdrawal deal reached between the EU and Mrs May, there might be things that could be done to make it ""more acceptable"" to Labour without compromising on the ""things that we think are essential"". But he also warned that a customs union would not be a ""long-term solution"". Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Hunt's remarks on a customs union provided ""yet more evidence"" that many in the cabinet believed the ""most important thing right now"" was the race to be Mrs May's successor. Labour's MP for Redcar, Anna Turley, also reacted to Mr Hunt's comments that a customs union was not a long-term solution,tweeting:,external""This is why we can't trust the Tories by doing a deal stitched up in Number 10 which they will seek to unravel under their next leader.""

He is the son of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane who was shot dead in front of his wife and three children in 1989. This video can not be played John Finucane says he wants to ""change Belfast for the positive"" The DUP made some gains in Belfast with Nicola Verner taking a seat in Court, from former TUV candidate Jolene Bunting. Ms Bunting, who had been involved in a number of controversies during her five-year tenure, ran as an independent this time but only polled 351 first preferences. In Derry and Strabane District Council, independent Gary Donnelly topped the poll in the Moor electoral area - where journalistLyra McKee was killed last month by dissident republicans. He had refused to condemn violent dissident republicanism but in the wake of her murder he called on the New IRA to desist from further attacks. Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport: It has been a similar theme to day one, which is that of Alliance victories, they have the most to be pleased about as the result of this election. Clearly different voters vote for them for different reasons, but it may well reflect a disenchantment with the political paralysis up at Stormont. The DUP will be pleased that they have held their own and actually increased their vote slightly at the expense of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which had a good election five years ago but has not been able to replicate that performance. I think Sinn FÃ©in will be disappointed, they missed a number of their targets and their vote has slid slightly. One interesting development tonight is that it looks like Fermanagh and Omagh District Council might slip into no overall control, rather than being a nationalist majority council. That is because there has been a wave of independents who won through there. Those independents may actually be nationalist in their outlooks but it is a sign of changing times both there and in Belfast where some of the smaller parties have also come through. Meanwhile, an independent candidate - who only stood for election after a Facebook post suggestion posted on 1 April garnered online support - has been elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey District council. Michael Stewart, who runs the Love Ballyclare Facebook page, said: ""I wasn't aware there would be this massive surge to independents, the Greens and Alliance. I didn't know I was part of anything."" He added: ""I am one of those people who voted for me, who've no interest in politics - they care about holes in their roads, no paper in their schools and that they can't get an appointment with their health centre."" It has been a long election for candidates, counters and commentators. In Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council, Brian Pope of Alliance was elected following a marathon count that went on until 06:00 on Saturday morning.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details.

"Theresa May must resign or the Conservatives should force her out, after the party's heavy local election losses, Iain Duncan Smith has said. The former Tory leader called Mrs May a ""caretaker PM"" and described her attempts to reach a Brexit deal with Labour as ""absurd"". The party suffered its worst local election result in England since 1995. Other senior Conservatives have urged Tory MPs to compromise with Labour to ensure Brexit is delivered. Elections were held on Thursday for 248 English councils, six mayors, and all 11councils in Northern Ireland. No elections took place in Scotland or Wales. The Conservatives lost 1,334 councillors, while Labour failed to make expected gains, instead losing 82 seats. The Liberal Democrats benefited from Tory losses, gaining 703 seats, with the Greens and independents also making gains. Following the results, Mrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both insisted they would push ahead with talks seeking cross-party agreement on leaving the EU. Mrs May said it was clear the public wanted ""to see the issue of Brexit resolved"". Smaller parties make gains in NI elections Tories lose more than 1,300 councillors Local elections: The main parties punished Election results in maps But Mr Duncan Smith, a leading Brexiteer, said many Conservatives would refuse to back any deal reached between the two parties. Mrs May must announce her departure ""very soon"", he said, and if she did not go, the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs would have to force her to do so. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""As a result of the devastating election result, the PM has in effect become a caretaker. ""As such, she is not empowered to make any deal with the Labour Party which itself suffered a very similar result. Two discredited administrations making a discredited deal is not the answer to the electorate."" In December, Mrs May survived a vote of no-confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party, but in March she pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU.

The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after Parliament was unable to agree a way forward. Ruth Davidson warned the parties would suffer the wrath of voters in the EU elections over Brexit In the wake of the Conservatives' local election losses, senior Tories have called for the party to compromise in order to reach an agreement with Labour to end the Brexit deadlock. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson called for the negotiating teams of both parties - who are currently locked in talks - to ""get Brexit sorted, get a deal over the line and let Britain move on"". This video can not be played Theresa May on local election results: ""Simple message... just get on and deliver Brexit"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Conservative Party needed to listen to the election results and be ""in the mood for compromise"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the Conservatives might have to move towardsLabour's proposal of a permanent customs union- a move many Brexiteers in the party oppose - in order to solve the impasse in Westminster. Mrs May's government has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union after the UK leaves the EU, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. Labour has said the EU may show flexibility over the issue and allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Mr Hancock suggested ""coming up with something in-between"", and called for ""an open dialogue in which we can make an agreement"". But Mr Duncan Smith said a customs union was ""the worst of all worlds because you lose your decision-making capacity"". Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ""glimmer of hope"" that a compromise between the Conservative and Labour ""core-voters"" could be reached. He added that while he supported the withdrawal deal reached between the EU and Mrs May, there might be things that could be done to make it ""more acceptable"" to Labour without compromising on the ""things that we think are essential"". But he also warned that a customs union would not be a ""long-term solution"". Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Hunt's remarks on a customs union provided ""yet more evidence"" that many in the cabinet believed the ""most important thing right now"" was the race to be Mrs May's successor. Labour's MP for Redcar, Anna Turley, also reacted to Mr Hunt's comments that a customs union was not a long-term solution,tweeting:,external""This is why we can't trust the Tories by doing a deal stitched up in Number 10 which they will seek to unravel under their next leader.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May on local election results: ""Simple message... just get on and deliver Brexit"" The Conservatives have lost 1,334 councillors, with Theresa May saying voters wanted the main parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. Labour also lost 82 seats in the English local elections, in which it had been expected to make gains. But the strongly pro-EU Lib Dems gained 703 seats, with leader Sir Vince Cable calling every vote received ""a vote for stopping Brexit"". The Greens and independents also made gains, as UKIP lost seats. LIVE: Local election results and reaction Watson: Why is Labour losing seats? Election results in maps May predicts 'bright future' after Brexit Local elections: The main parties punished All 248 English councils holding elections have now announced their full results. While the scale of the Conservative election losses is larger than expected, Labour had predicted it would gain seats, having suffered losses the last time these council seats were contested, in 2015. The Green Party has added 194 councillors, while the number of independent councillors has risen by 612. UKIP, which enjoyed large gains in 2015, lost 145 seats. Results fromNorthern Ireland's 11 councils are also being announced. No local elections are taking place in Scotland and Wales. After nine years in government it's not surprising that the Conservatives have lost a significant chunk of seats. But the sheer number that have disappeared and the loss of control of authorities will hurt - especially with so many activists identifying Theresa May's handling of Brexit as a root of the problem, not just a general malaise. The perceived personal nature of the failure is more of an indignity than an encounter with a heckler in tweeds. And for Jeremy Corbyn, it is surprising and disappointing that Labour has simply failed to make any significant capital from such a divided and chaotic government. However ardently his devotees swear loyalty, the party has fallen back - on this set of results at least - seeming further, rather than closer, from winning power in a general election he so often claims to crave. Read more from Laura here. MPs have yet to agree on a deal for leaving the European Union, and, as a result,the deadline of Brexit has been pushed back from 29 March to 31 October. While local elections give voters the chance to choose the decision-makers who affect their communities, the national issue has loomed large on the doorstep. Mrs May, appearing at the Welsh Conservative conference, said voters had sent the ""simple message"" that her party and Labour had to ""get on"" with delivering Brexit. ""These were always going to be difficult elections for us,"" the prime minister added, ""and there were some challenging results for us last night, but it was a bad night for Labour, too."" A heckler shouted at the prime minister: ""Why don't you resign?"" He was then ushered out of the conference hall in Llangollen, North Wales, as the audience chanted: ""Out, out, out."" This video can not be played Vince Cable: Lib Dems are ""success story of the night"" BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that while the Conservatives had lost ""more than 10 times as many councillors"", it was ""remarkable"" that Labour, ""around the mid-term of a not-very-popular government - has not made net gains"". Speaking in Greater Manchester, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he ""wanted to do better"" and conceded voters who disagreed with its backing for Brexit had deserted the party. But Lib Dem leader Sir Vince, attending a rally in Chelmsford, Essex, where his party took control of the council, said it had been a ""brilliant"" result and that ""every vote for the Liberal Democrats was a vote for stopping Brexit"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reacts to local election results after Labour suffers losses The BBC projects that, if the local election results it analysed were replicated across Britain, both the Conservatives and Labour would get 28% of the total vote. The data, based on 650 wards in which detailed voting figures were collected, suggests the Lib Dems would get 19% and other parties and independents 25%. Conservatives: 93 (-44) Labour: 60 (-6) Lib Dem: 18 (+10) Independent: 2 (+2) Residents' associations: 2 (+1) No overall control: 73 (+37) Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the days of the Conservatives and Labour dominating the electoral landscape, as happened in the 2017 election when they won 80% of the vote between them, ""may be over"". He said it was only the second time in history that the two main parties' projected national share of the vote had fallen below 30%. The only other occasion was in 2013, when UKIP performed strongly in local elections. Prof Curtice also said the Conservatives and Labour had both lost ground since last year's local elections when both were estimated to be on 35%. While the Lib Dem figure was the highest since 2010, when they agreed to join the coalition government with the Conservatives, he said it was still well below the 24% the party regularly achieved in the 1990s and 2000s. Green Party co-leader Sian Berry told the BBC the Greens were not simply benefiting from a protest vote over Brexit - their gains reflected ""huge new concerns"" about climate change as well as the strength of their local campaigning on a range of issues. For UKIP, Lawrence Webb, a former London mayoral candidate who is standing in this month's European elections, said the party's ""fortunes were on the up"", despite the fall in its number of councillors.

A further 462 seats are up for grabs in Northern Ireland. Six mayoral elections have also taken place, with Labour's Jamie Driscoll winning the contest to become the first ever North of Tyne mayor.

"Alliance leader Naomi Long has hailed her party's ""incredible result"" in the council elections as a watershed moment for Northern Ireland politics. With all 462 seats declared, Alliance saw a 65% rise in its representation. It had 32 councillors five years ago but now it has 53. Other smaller parties and independents also made significant gains. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in were returned as the two biggest parties, but the DUP lost eight seats. Live from the Northern Ireland count centres Northern Ireland results so far Revolving council doors usher in new faces Alliance surge a striking development What do councils in NI do? In terms of first preference votes the DUP saw a marginal increase to 24.1% but Sinn FÃ©in's was 23.2%, a slight drop on its 2014 results. Alliance saw its share of the vote increase from 6.7% to 11.5%. A sister party of the Liberal Democrats in Great Britain, Alliance is Northern Ireland's main centrist cross-community party, seeking to attract support from both Protestants and Catholics. It won 10 seats in Belfast and will continue to hold the balance of power between unionists and nationalists. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Bunting, who had been involved in a number of controversies during her five-year tenure, ran as an independent this time but only polled 351 first preferences. In Derry and Strabane District Council, independent Gary Donnelly topped the poll in the Moor electoral area - where journalistLyra McKee was killed last month by dissident republicans. He had refused to condemn violent dissident republicanism but in the wake of her murder he called on the New IRA to desist from further attacks. Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport: It has been a similar theme to day one, which is that of Alliance victories, they have the most to be pleased about as the result of this election. Clearly different voters vote for them for different reasons, but it may well reflect a disenchantment with the political paralysis up at Stormont. The DUP will be pleased that they have held their own and actually increased their vote slightly at the expense of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which had a good election five years ago but has not been able to replicate that performance. I think Sinn FÃ©in will be disappointed, they missed a number of their targets and their vote has slid slightly. One interesting development tonight is that it looks like Fermanagh and Omagh District Council might slip into no overall control, rather than being a nationalist majority council. That is because there has been a wave of independents who won through there. Those independents may actually be nationalist in their outlooks but it is a sign of changing times both there and in Belfast where some of the smaller parties have also come through. Meanwhile, an independent candidate - who only stood for election after a Facebook post suggestion posted on 1 April garnered online support - has been elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey District council. Michael Stewart, who runs the Love Ballyclare Facebook page, said: ""I wasn't aware there would be this massive surge to independents, the Greens and Alliance. I didn't know I was part of anything."" He added: ""I am one of those people who voted for me, who've no interest in politics - they care about holes in their roads, no paper in their schools and that they can't get an appointment with their health centre."" It has been a long election for candidates, counters and commentators. In Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council, Brian Pope of Alliance was elected following a marathon count that went on until 06:00 on Saturday morning.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details.

DUP leader Arlene Foster said she was delighted by Ms Bennington's electoral performance.

"Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Prime Minister Theresa May, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock Senior Conservatives have called for the party to pull together after it suffered its worst results in English local elections since 1995. The Conservatives lost 1,334 councillors in Thursday's votes. Home Secretary Sajid Javid admitted voters had ""issues of trust"" over Brexit, and said the European elections would ""be even more challenging"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the party needed to listen to the results and be ""in the mood for compromise"". Both PM Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have insisted they will push ahead with seeking a cross-party agreement on Brexit, following the results. Live: Second day of counting in NI council elections Tories lose more than 1,300 councillors Local elections: The main parties punished Election results in maps Labour had been expected to make gains but lost 82 seats in the elections, while the Liberal Democrats - who have campaigned for a further vote on leaving the EU - were the main beneficiary of Tory losses, gaining 703 seats. The Greens and independents also made gains, as UKIP lost seats. Elections were held for 248 English councils, six mayors, and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland -where a second day of counting is continuing.No elections took place in Scotland or Wales. Vince Cable claimed Liberal success ""reflected the unpopularity of the government"" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hancock said ""the mood of the nation is, 'get on, deliver Brexit, and then move on'"". But he said the Tories might have to move towardsLabour's proposal of a permanent customs union- in order to solve the current impasse in Westminster over Brexit. The EU customs union means that once goods have cleared customs in one country and the commonly agreed tariffs (charges on imports) have been paid, they can be shipped to others in the union without further charges. A country does not have to be a member of the EU to be part of the customs union, but members cannot negotiate their own independent trade deals with countries from the rest of the world. Mrs May's government has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union after the UK leaves the EU, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. Labour has suggested the EU may show flexibility over the issue and allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Mr Hancock suggested ""coming up with something in-between"", and called for ""an open dialogue in which we can make an agreement"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said there was a ""glimmer of hope"" that a compromise between the Conservative and Labour ""core-voters"" could be reached. ""If we can find a solution that delivers the benefits of the customs union without signing up to the current arrangements, then I think there will be potential,"" he said. Justice Secretary David Gauke told BBC News that the local election results should be seen as a ""punishment"" to both the Conservatives and the Labour Party ""for failing to find a way through"" the Brexit conundrum. He added: ""We have to persevere with the talks with the Labour Party. I think that is the best opportunity to find a way through here."" The MP for Hertfordshire South West also rejected calls to oust Mrs May, saying: ""We should back the prime minister... so that we can bring the country together again - we can unite the Conservative Party and find a practical way through."" The UK was due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline has been pushed back to 31 October. Mr Javid said this was a big factor in the Conservative Party losing control of 45 councils on Thursday - in its worst performance since John Major's party lost 2,000 councillors in 1995. In a rallying cry to Conservatives in Aberdeen, he said that ""a divided party cannot unite a divided nation"". The home secretary said the party risked losing voters' trust after ""not delivering on a promise at the heart of our last manifesto"". And, speaking about the European elections, due to take place on 23 May, he said: ""We shouldn't be surprised if people tick the protest box on the ballot paper."" Either search using your postcode or council name or click around the map to show local results.  Lisa Nandy, Labour MP for Wigan, also said the results reflected the public's frustration with the two main parties' ""perceived inability... to get our act together"". She told the Today programme there was ""no single magic bullet"" to solving Brexit, but ""the fact that people are not clear on what our policy is, is harming us in both Remain and Leave areas alike"". Ms Nandy said failing to leave the European Union would be a ""final breach of trust"" and her party must respect the referendum result. However, she said she believed the Brexit effect on the election results had been ""enormously overstated"" and many in towns like Wigan ""just didn't feel like Labour spoke for them"".

By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. Click or tap here if you cannot see the map.,external With all the results declared in England the Conservatives have lost over 1,300 councillors while Labour has also seen dozens of losses. The Lib Dems and Greens have both made significant gains, with the Lib Dems gaining more than 700 councillors and the Greens nearly 200. Independent candidates have also made unusually large gains, as shown by the rise of ""Others"" in the above chart. Professor Sir John Curtice has calculated how Thursday's vote would translate across Britain. This projection of the national vote share puts Labour and the Conservatives both on 28%. The Lib Dems were the big winners in terms of councils, taking over 10, seven of which were at the expense of the Conservatives. Their most impressive victory was inChelmsfordwhere they flipped a majority of 23. The Conservatives saw big losses in the south west, particularly the new councils ofBournemouth, Christchurch & PooleandSomerset West & Taunton. Labour suffered its biggest loss inAshfield, where it lost 20 councillors and the control of the council passed to Independents. Labour won seats in many parts of the country, and the party's largest gain was 16 councillors in the former UKIP stronghold ofThanet. The Conservatives' largest gain was inNorth East Derbyshire. Support for the major parties fell more heavily in their heartlands, according toProf Curtice, with Tories losing most seats in the south of England and Labour in the north. The Green Party were one of the beneficiaries of the main parties' misfortune, gaining nearly 200 new councillors across the country and only failing to defend seats in two areas. Meanwhile, UKIP lost councillors in many areas. The biggest loss came in their old heartland ofThanet, where former-leader Nigel Farage campaigned unsuccessfully to become an MP in 2015.

King Vajiralongkorn inherited the throne in 2016 when his long-reigning father Bhumibol Adulyadej died. Days ago in a surprise announcement the palace said the king had married his long-term partner and royal consort who would now be Queen Suthida. Thailand has a constitutional monarchy, but the royal family is highly revered by Thais and wields considerable power. Thailand also has strict laws, called lese majeste, which ban criticism of the monarchy. The laws have shielded the royal family from public view and scrutiny. In pictures: Thai coronation ceremony During Saturday's ceremony the 66-year-old king was handed the 7.3kg (16lbs) Great Crown of Victory, which he placed on his head. The monarchy commands widespread reverence in Thailand He then issued his first royal command, promising to reign with righteousness, as his father had done at his coronation 69 years ago. The coronation comes at a time of political uncertainty. A general election was held on 24 March, the first since the army took control in a coup in 2014, but a new government has yet to be declared. Coronation explained:The sacred water that makes a king Thailand's lese-majeste law explained King Vajiralongkorn is the second child, and first son, of Queen Sirikit and Bhumibol Adulyadej. King Vajiralongkorn's father was the longest-reigning monarch in the world He was educated in the UK and Australia and has been trained at the Royal Military College in Canberra. He went on to become an officer in the Thai armed forces and is a qualified civilian and fighter pilot. He became crown prince and official heir to the throne in 1972. He is now known as Rama X, or the 10th King of the Chakri dynasty. Thai TV showed the wedding ceremony of King Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida Queen Suthida, who is his fourth wife, is the deputy commander of his personal security unit. She was made a full general in the army in December 2016. The coronation rituals began at 10:09 (03:09 GMT), an auspicious time, when King Vajiralongkorn changed into a white robe to go through purification and anointment ceremonies using sacred water that has been collected from more than 100 locations around the country. He is receiving the five Royal Regalia - the symbols of kingship - which includes the Great Crown of Victory. Most of the main Brahmin and Buddhist rituals take place on Saturday, and the coronation continues until Monday. While King Vajiralongkorn has been on the throne since 2016, in Thai tradition he cannot be considered a divine representative on Earth nor the main patron of Buddhism until he is consecrated. On Sunday, King Vajiralongkorn will take part in a procession around the capital, Bangkok, giving people a chance to celebrate. Large crowds are expected for this event as well as when he makes a public appearance on a balcony at the Grand Palace on Monday. King Vajiralongkorn spends most of his time abroad and is not as well known to the public as his father. But huge portraits of him can now be seen at many buildings after it was made mandatory for state offices to erect them in the weeks leading up to the celebration. Civil servants were also asked to wear yellow - the colour associated with the king. Many ordinary Thais will also be wearing yellow to show their loyalty to the monarch. Key events Saturday 4 May The Royal Purification and Anointment - sacred water is poured over the king Royal Regalia - the king is presented with the crown, sword and other items Temple of the Emerald Buddha - the king proclaims himself the Royal Patron of Buddhism Assumption of the Royal Residence - he symbolically moves into the official residence with a housewarming ceremony Sunday 5 May Royal Procession on Land - the king rides the Royal Palanquin encircling the city allowing people to pay homage Monday 6 May The king grants a public audience on a balcony in the Grand Palace.

"Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, east London, in 2015 to join the Islamic State group in Syria IS bride Shamima Begum would ""face the death penalty"" for terrorism if she came to Bangladesh, the country's foreign minister has said. Abdul Momen told the BBC that Ms Begum has ""nothing to do"" with his country. The 19-year-old, who left east London to join the Islamic State group in 2015, was stripped of her British citizenship in February. Her claim to Bangladeshi nationality through her mother is believed to have informed the Home Office's decision. Under international law, it is illegal to deprive nationals of citizenship if to do so would leave them stateless. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Begum's lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, told the BBC ""in no way is she Bangladesh's problem"". Ms Begum is appealing against the Home Office's decision. What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Legal aid: Who is entitled to it? 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' The women and children no-one wants Mr Momen said there was ""no question"" of giving Ms Begum Bangladeshi citizenship or allowing her into the country, piling pressure on Home Secretary Sajid Javid to settle her status. ""She has never sought Bangladeshi citizenship and her parents are also British citizens,"" he told the BBC. ""The British government is responsible for her. They'll have to deal with her."" He added that, if she did end up coming to Bangladesh, she would fall foul of the country's ""zero tolerance policy"" towards terrorism. ""Bangladeshi law is very clear. Terrorists will have to face the death penalty,"" he said. Although Ms Begum travelled to Syria to join the IS group, she has not admitted any terror offences. This video can not be played Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer for the family of Shamima Begum, expects her to be ""damaged"" by her ordeal The Home Office could reverse its decision ""at any time"" and doing so would ""save British taxpayers a lot of money"" in court costs and legal aid, Mr Akunjee said. ""What Sajid Javid did in stripping Shamima of her citizenship is human fly tipping - taking our problems and dumping them on other countries,"" he said. The Home Office told the BBC it would not respond to Mr Momen's comments and had nothing further to add to its previous statement. How do countries deal with IS returnees? After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Ms Begum left the UK with two school friends at the age of 15 before being found by a journalist from the Times in a Syrian refugee camp in mid-February this year. Heavily pregnant with her third child, she pleaded to return to the UK, claiming she had been ""brainwashed"" by Islamic State and now ""regrets everything"". She said she did not regret travelling to Syria but did not agree with everything the IS group had done. Mr Javid did not acquiesce to her pleas, telling MPs he ""won't hesitate"" to revoke her citizenship in the interests of national security. ""If you back terror, there must be consequences,"" he said. Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Soon afterwards, she gave birth to a boy called Jarrah. He died of pneumonia in March at less than three weeks of age. She had two other children who also died. In the wake of the boy's death, Mr Javid was criticised over the decision to strip Ms Begum of her British citizenship. Three weeks prior to the death, Ms Begum's sister, Renu Begum, had written to Mr Javid asking him to help her bring the baby to the UK. Under the 1981 British Nationality Act, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be ""conducive to the public good"" and they would not become stateless as a result.

"Alliance leader Naomi Long has hailed her party's ""incredible result"" in the council elections as a watershed moment for Northern Ireland politics. With all 462 seats declared, Alliance saw a 65% rise in its representation. It had 32 councillors five years ago but now it has 53. Other smaller parties and independents also made significant gains. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in were returned as the two biggest parties, but the DUP lost eight seats. Live from the Northern Ireland count centres Northern Ireland results so far Revolving council doors usher in new faces Alliance surge a striking development What do councils in NI do? In terms of first preference votes the DUP saw a marginal increase to 24.1% but Sinn FÃ©in's was 23.2%, a slight drop on its 2014 results. Alliance saw its share of the vote increase from 6.7% to 11.5%. A sister party of the Liberal Democrats in Great Britain, Alliance is Northern Ireland's main centrist cross-community party, seeking to attract support from both Protestants and Catholics. It won 10 seats in Belfast and will continue to hold the balance of power between unionists and nationalists. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It also doubled its representation in Mid and East Antrim from three councillors to six, and for the first time in decades, it has representation in the north west with two seats on Derry and Strabane Council. ""Crucially, we've broken outside the Greater Belfast area for the first time in I would say 30 years,"" Alliance leader Naomi Long told the BBC.

This video can not be played Alliance leader Naomi Long explains why she thinks voters rewarded the party at the polls Sinn FÃ©in's results have been mixed - it won six out of seven seats in Blackmountain District Electoral Area (DEA) and for the first time, it has representation on Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council with two seats. However, the party lost five sitting councillors from Derry City and Strabane Council.

The DUP has also carved out some new territory, gaining two new seats in Belfast, andelecting its first ever openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtonin Antrim and Newtownabbey. But the party lost its leader on Belfast City Council, Lee Reynolds, after a low turnout in its east Belfast heartland.

Independents have also taken support from larger parties. In Newry, Mourne and Down, independent candidate Gavin Malone, a former council worker himself, topped the poll in the Newry District Electoral Area (DEA).

He is the son of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane who was shot dead in front of his wife and three children in 1989. This video can not be played John Finucane says he wants to ""change Belfast for the positive"" The DUP made some gains in Belfast with Nicola Verner taking a seat in Court, from former TUV candidate Jolene Bunting. Ms Bunting, who had been involved in a number of controversies during her five-year tenure, ran as an independent this time but only polled 351 first preferences. In Derry and Strabane District Council, independent Gary Donnelly topped the poll in the Moor electoral area - where journalistLyra McKee was killed last month by dissident republicans. He had refused to condemn violent dissident republicanism but in the wake of her murder he called on the New IRA to desist from further attacks. Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport: It has been a similar theme to day one, which is that of Alliance victories, they have the most to be pleased about as the result of this election. Clearly different voters vote for them for different reasons, but it may well reflect a disenchantment with the political paralysis up at Stormont. The DUP will be pleased that they have held their own and actually increased their vote slightly at the expense of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which had a good election five years ago but has not been able to replicate that performance. I think Sinn FÃ©in will be disappointed, they missed a number of their targets and their vote has slid slightly. One interesting development tonight is that it looks like Fermanagh and Omagh District Council might slip into no overall control, rather than being a nationalist majority council. That is because there has been a wave of independents who won through there. Those independents may actually be nationalist in their outlooks but it is a sign of changing times both there and in Belfast where some of the smaller parties have also come through. Meanwhile, an independent candidate - who only stood for election after a Facebook post suggestion posted on 1 April garnered online support - has been elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey District council. Michael Stewart, who runs the Love Ballyclare Facebook page, said: ""I wasn't aware there would be this massive surge to independents, the Greens and Alliance. I didn't know I was part of anything."" He added: ""I am one of those people who voted for me, who've no interest in politics - they care about holes in their roads, no paper in their schools and that they can't get an appointment with their health centre."" It has been a long election for candidates, counters and commentators. In Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council, Brian Pope of Alliance was elected following a marathon count that went on until 06:00 on Saturday morning.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details.

"This video can not be played Alison Bennington was congratulated by DUP colleagues after her election The election of the DUP's first openly gay politician was welcomed by one of the party's senior politicians. Alison Bennington was elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey. Belfast East MP Gavin Robinson said it was a ""good news story"", despite assembly member Jim Wells claiming members were ""shocked by the decision"" to let her run. Elsewhere there were some surprising gains for Alliance and some smaller parties. Sinn FÃ©in had a mixed set of results on the first day of counting, while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost a number of seats.

School friends battle it out Alison Bennington has been elected as a councillor for the party which has consistently opposed the legalisation of same-sex marriage. It remains against the law in Northern Ireland. The DUP's founder and leader for almost 40 years, Ian Paisley, was also the founder of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, a fundamentalist and evangelical denomination which many DUP politicians are still associated with. DUP leader Arlene Foster said Ms Bennington's election did not necessarily mean a shift in the party's policy. Jim Wells, who has been one of the party's most vocal opponents of same-sex marriage, said: ""This marks a watershed change in DUP party policy and none of the members were consulted about it. ""Many thousands of people in Northern Ireland are depending on the DUP to hold the line on these moral issues. ""They feel very let down and very concerned about what has happened.""

""We're not a theocracy, we're a political party."" Former DUP special advisor Timothy Cairns said he felt he spoke for many in the party who were ""quite angry"" at Mr Well's comments. He said: ""Most right-thinking people are disgusted at Jim Well's comments. ""It is time for the leadership to take action. It is beyond time. ""What Jim has said this evening about a fellow colleague is wrong"". There were a number of gains for the Alliance Party and smaller parties including the Greens and People Before Profit. Alliance won three seats in the Ormiston district electoral area (DEA) in Belfast and took a seat from Sinn FÃ©in in Titanic, securing a second councillor in that DEA. The party also topped the poll in every DEA in Lisburn and Castlereagh - with all nine candidates being elected - and won seats outside its traditional greater Belfast heartlands with victories in Coleraine, Lurgan and Faughan. Alliance's Ross McMullan (centre) got almost 1,000 votes over the quota The Green Party's Ãine Groogan topped the poll in the Botanic DEA and has become her party's first councillor in that area. Ms Groogan, who was a first-time candidate in the local government elections, told BBC News NI her party had made gains because voters were ""fed up with old-style politics"". Elsewhere in Belfast another smaller party, People Before Profit took a seat from Sinn FÃ©in in Collin and also gained a councillor in Oldpark. This video can not be played Ãine Groogan: 'People are fed up with old-style politics' However the Progressive Unionist Party lost a seat as Julie-Anne Corr-Johnston was defeated in Oldpark. As well as losing out to People Before Profit in Collin and Alliance in Titanic, Sinn FÃ©in's former Derry and Strabane mayor MaolÃ­osa McHugh lost his seat. Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Raymond McCartney said his party was set to lose ""a couple of seats"" on that council. Mr McCartney said the party fought a strong campaign but that the absence of devolved government at Stormont was an issue on the doorsteps. He said it would inform Sinn FÃ©in's position going intotalks aimed at restoring devolution which are due to starton Tuesday. This video can not be played Voters have shown that they want equality, says Mary Lou McDonald Party president Mary Lou McDonald added that the election had demonstrated to her that the political deadlock was ""unacceptable"". The SDLP's Mary Durkan has been elected in the Foyleside District of Derry and Strabane Council after her first foray into politics. The barrister is the sister of assembly member Mark H Durkan. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party had done ""very, very well"" in Derry and Strabane and was pleased with the performance overall. This video can not be played The SDLP's ""renewal project"" is working ""very well"", says Colum Eastwood He said: ""We are very happy, we have had some difficult years but I think this is a positive day for the party. ""What we are seeing is that new candidates with good campaigns and hard work on the ground are actually winning and winning well."" A difficult day for the UUP The UUP lost a number of seats on Friday, including in Ormiston, where Peter Johnston lost out and in Botanic. So far the party's first preference vote share is down by 2% compared to the last council election in 2014, but this could improve after more results are declared on Saturday. The UUP enjoyed a better day in Lisburn and Castlereagh, where their first preference vote share rose by 1.9%. They also had a narrow victory in Cusher DEA in Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon where Gordon Kennedy beat DUP candidate Quincey Dougan to the last seat by 1.84 votes. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Where else would you find such electoral excitement on a Friday night? There have been gains for the smaller parties including Alliance, the Greens and People Before Profit at the expense of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The two biggest parties say their vote has held up - and even improved - in some of their traditional stronghold areas. But there's no denying both have taken gambles that haven't paid off, running more candidates in some areas in a bid to increase their presence only for it not to work out. The SDLP are pleased with their performance in some areas, but across the board the UUP vote looks much poorer than the strong result they polled in 2014. As ever, transfers are key for those final nail-biter seats in each area. As one candidate put it to me: ""Every transfer matters, it's like Game of Thrones!"" In Mid-Ulster, Kyle Black, the son of prison officer David Black who was murdered by dissident republicans, was elected in Carntogher. He said: ""Out of absolutely devastating circumstance that will impact out lives forever, I wanted to try and do something positive - to give back to the community."" This video can not be played Kyle Black says he entered politics after his father's murder showed him the ""worst"" of Northern Ireland It will be late on Saturday before the full results are confirmed. As of Friday night, turnout was recorded as 52%, but this is not the final figure. Thursday's good weather appears to have boosted voter numbers, but there is a wide variation across the different District Electoral Areas (DEAs). In County Fermanagh, the turnout was almost 72% in the Erne East DEA. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The local election results are disappointing for both the Conservatives and for Labour, while the Liberal Democrats, Greens and independents prospered, writes Prof Sir John Curtice and colleagues on the BBC's local elections team. ""A plague on both your houses."" That seems to have been the key message to emerge from the ballot boxes. On the basis of the detailed voting figures in 40 local authorities, we estimate that if the pattern of voting in the local council elections were to be replicated across the whole of Great Britain, both the Conservatives and Labour would have won 28% of the vote. This is only the second time that this calculation has put both those parties below 30%. The elections always looked set to be difficult for the Conservatives. The party was defending seats that were mostly last up for grabs four years ago, on the same day David Cameron won the 2015 general election. That, coupled with the party's recent freefall in the polls, clearly pointed to significant Conservative losses. May 2019 local election results in maps and charts Laura Kuenssberg: Two main parties, one key message What happens when councils change hands? And that proved to be the case. The party has suffered net losses of more than 1300 seats. On average the party's share of the vote was down by six points, both compared with 2015 and with last year's local election results. However, despite the government's difficulties, Labour also slipped back - on average, by no less than seven points compared with last year's local election results. As a result, the party has found itself suffering net losses of around 80 seats, when opposition parties are normally expected to post gains. The party's performance would seem to confirm the message of a number of polls that Labour's support has been slipping in the wake of the Brexit impasse, a fall in Jeremy Corbyn's popularity, and a continuing row about anti-Semitism. Compared with last year, the party lost ground more heavily in Leave-voting areas than in Remain-voting ones, a pattern that it shared with the Conservatives (who in previous years have tended to perform better in such areas). This has been seized on by pro-Leave Labour MPs as evidence that the party should reach an agreement with the government which would pave the way for the UK to leave the EU. What the two parties also had in common was a tendency for their support to fall more heavily in their heartlands. Labour's vote fell back most heavily in the north, the Conservatives in the south. Equally, Labour's vote fell more heavily in wards where it was previously strong, while the Conservative vote fell most heavily where they were strongest. It was as though voters vented their frustration with the Brexit process by punishing whichever party represented the political establishment locally. This mood perhaps also helps account for the remarkable success of independent candidates. Those not standing on a party label were on average winning as much as a quarter of the vote where they stood. More than 900 independent councillors have been elected - a net gain of more than 500. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats, who before they entered into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 were often a vehicle for protest votes, also appear to have profited from voters' disenchantment with the two largest parties. The party, which has made net gains of more than 600 seats, advanced particularly strongly in Conservative-held wards where it was previously in second place. Double digit swings from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats were common in such seats. The party seemed to be successful in reinvigorating some of the bastions of local strength where its support had been badly eroded in the wake of the coalition government. This pattern added significantly to the tally of Conservative losses. Theresa May insisted the local election results showed voters wanted the main parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. In contrast, and despite the party's pro-Remain stance, there was only limited evidence that the Lib Dems' advance was stronger in areas that voted heavily for Remain in the 2016 referendum. For example, while support for the party rose on average by three points on last year in areas where more than half voted for Remain, it also increased by two points in areas where the Remain vote was less than 45%. Thanks in part to the fact that in 2015 the Liberal Democrats had recorded its worst ever local election performance, the party was able to make so many gains, due to an increase in its vote since then, of eight points. More significant, perhaps, was the fact that its vote was also up by three points on last year's local elections. When the party's performance is projected into a national vote, it is estimated to be worth 19% of the vote. This represents its best local election performance since the party entered into coalition in 2010, but was still well below the party's performance in any round of local votes between 1993 and 2010. Overall, the party's performance is best seen as evidence of a partial recovery from the depths to which the party sank during the coalition years. At the same time, the Greens had one of their best local election results ever. The party made net gains of more than 180 seats. The Greens posted an average of 12% of the vote in the wards they contested, up five points on their performance where they stood four years ago. That equals the party's previous highest average, 12% in 2009, when local elections were held on the same day as European Parliament elections. The party may have been helped by the recent protests about climate change. Fighting just one in six wards, there was little opportunity for UKIP to make much impact on these elections. Where it did stand, the party's vote was down by four  points on its relative high point of 2015, but up eight points on its poor position last year. However, the challenge from the Eurosceptic parties may be more formidable in the European elections in three weeks time, when Nigel Farage's Brexit Party is on the ballot paper.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details.

"This video can not be played Theresa May on local election results: ""Simple message... just get on and deliver Brexit"" The Conservatives have lost 1,334 councillors, with Theresa May saying voters wanted the main parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. Labour also lost 82 seats in the English local elections, in which it had been expected to make gains. But the strongly pro-EU Lib Dems gained 703 seats, with leader Sir Vince Cable calling every vote received ""a vote for stopping Brexit"". The Greens and independents also made gains, as UKIP lost seats. LIVE: Local election results and reaction Watson: Why is Labour losing seats? Election results in maps May predicts 'bright future' after Brexit Local elections: The main parties punished All 248 English councils holding elections have now announced their full results. While the scale of the Conservative election losses is larger than expected, Labour had predicted it would gain seats, having suffered losses the last time these council seats were contested, in 2015. The Green Party has added 194 councillors, while the number of independent councillors has risen by 612. UKIP, which enjoyed large gains in 2015, lost 145 seats. Results fromNorthern Ireland's 11 councils are also being announced. No local elections are taking place in Scotland and Wales. After nine years in government it's not surprising that the Conservatives have lost a significant chunk of seats. But the sheer number that have disappeared and the loss of control of authorities will hurt - especially with so many activists identifying Theresa May's handling of Brexit as a root of the problem, not just a general malaise. The perceived personal nature of the failure is more of an indignity than an encounter with a heckler in tweeds. And for Jeremy Corbyn, it is surprising and disappointing that Labour has simply failed to make any significant capital from such a divided and chaotic government. However ardently his devotees swear loyalty, the party has fallen back - on this set of results at least - seeming further, rather than closer, from winning power in a general election he so often claims to crave. Read more from Laura here. MPs have yet to agree on a deal for leaving the European Union, and, as a result,the deadline of Brexit has been pushed back from 29 March to 31 October. While local elections give voters the chance to choose the decision-makers who affect their communities, the national issue has loomed large on the doorstep. Mrs May, appearing at the Welsh Conservative conference, said voters had sent the ""simple message"" that her party and Labour had to ""get on"" with delivering Brexit. ""These were always going to be difficult elections for us,"" the prime minister added, ""and there were some challenging results for us last night, but it was a bad night for Labour, too."" A heckler shouted at the prime minister: ""Why don't you resign?"" He was then ushered out of the conference hall in Llangollen, North Wales, as the audience chanted: ""Out, out, out."" This video can not be played Vince Cable: Lib Dems are ""success story of the night"" BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that while the Conservatives had lost ""more than 10 times as many councillors"", it was ""remarkable"" that Labour, ""around the mid-term of a not-very-popular government - has not made net gains"". Speaking in Greater Manchester, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he ""wanted to do better"" and conceded voters who disagreed with its backing for Brexit had deserted the party. But Lib Dem leader Sir Vince, attending a rally in Chelmsford, Essex, where his party took control of the council, said it had been a ""brilliant"" result and that ""every vote for the Liberal Democrats was a vote for stopping Brexit"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reacts to local election results after Labour suffers losses The BBC projects that, if the local election results it analysed were replicated across Britain, both the Conservatives and Labour would get 28% of the total vote. The data, based on 650 wards in which detailed voting figures were collected, suggests the Lib Dems would get 19% and other parties and independents 25%. Conservatives: 93 (-44) Labour: 60 (-6) Lib Dem: 18 (+10) Independent: 2 (+2) Residents' associations: 2 (+1) No overall control: 73 (+37) Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the days of the Conservatives and Labour dominating the electoral landscape, as happened in the 2017 election when they won 80% of the vote between them, ""may be over"". He said it was only the second time in history that the two main parties' projected national share of the vote had fallen below 30%. The only other occasion was in 2013, when UKIP performed strongly in local elections. Prof Curtice also said the Conservatives and Labour had both lost ground since last year's local elections when both were estimated to be on 35%. While the Lib Dem figure was the highest since 2010, when they agreed to join the coalition government with the Conservatives, he said it was still well below the 24% the party regularly achieved in the 1990s and 2000s. Green Party co-leader Sian Berry told the BBC the Greens were not simply benefiting from a protest vote over Brexit - their gains reflected ""huge new concerns"" about climate change as well as the strength of their local campaigning on a range of issues. For UKIP, Lawrence Webb, a former London mayoral candidate who is standing in this month's European elections, said the party's ""fortunes were on the up"", despite the fall in its number of councillors.

A further 462 seats are up for grabs in Northern Ireland. Six mayoral elections have also taken place, with Labour's Jamie Driscoll winning the contest to become the first ever North of Tyne mayor.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reacts to local election results after Labour suffers losses Labour has suffered a net loss of council seats - starting from the low base of 2015 in many cases. The Conservatives have lost more than 10 times as many councillors, but what is remarkable is that the main party of opposition - around the mid-term of a not-very-popular government - has not made net gains. It seems reasonable to assume that some votes have been lost by Labour in Leave areas because - as the leader of Sunderland City Council Graeme Miller has said - the party hasn't decisively ruled out another referendum. (It has retained it as an option, if the Conservatives are unwilling to change their deal). Labour agrees a Brexit referendum position Main parties hit by Brexit backlash in polls LIVE: Local election results and reaction as it happens But if you take a close look at the figures in Sunderland, the complexity of Labour's political problems are revealed. Its vote fell by nearly 17 points there - while UKIP's went up by 4.5. The pro-Remain Lib Dems saw their vote rise by nearly 10 points and the Greens by 8.5. Indeed, the combined vote of the Lib Dems and Greens was 21.4%, not far off UKIP's 23.9%. The swing from Labour to the Lib Dems was about 13%  and to the Greens 10%. Those in Labour's ranks who wanted a stronger commitment to another referendum on any Brexit deal are arguing now that the party is losing support in some Leave areas by failing to appeal enough to those who voted Remain. Defections to the Lib Dems and the Greens suppressed the Labour vote, and further flatters UKIP's performance. In leave-supporting Derby, where Jeremy Corbyn's party lost six seats and UKIP gained two, the swing from Labour to Lib Dems was 6%. But those who support Labour's current policy - a heavily caveatedcommitment to a referendum on Brexit under certain circumstancesrather than a public vote in all circumstances - say this is too simplistic an analysis. In truth, we can't discern the underlying motives of Labour/Lib Dem switchers in every part of the country unless we ask them. There are genuinely local factors at play in some areas - unsurprising, perhaps, as these are indeed local elections. And some on Labour's left have another theory. They say the party is vulnerable to a protest vote because some Labour councils have had to cut services due to constrained budgets. In some cases the Lib Dems are the beneficiaries Others on the left say the party can't get a hearing for its anti-austerity message as the Brexit debate muffles all else. They are actually quite keen for their party leadership to reach a deal with the government soon to get Brexit over the line and - they believe - this will then neutralise the political toxicity of the issue. But there is little doubt politicians will proclaim to know the will of the people, without necessarily exploring deeper motivations - and the results will be interpreted in a way which advances their own arguments.

"The voice records of five million taxpayers are being deleted by the UK's tax authority, as the way they were collected broke privacy rules. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) failed to gain explicit consent from individuals before signing them up to the voice ID system for telephone enquiries. Campaigners accused HMRC of creating ""biometric ID cards by the back door"". The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said there had been a ""significant"" breach of data laws. ""Innovative digital services help make our lives easier but it must not be at the expense of people's fundamental right to privacy,"" said Steve Wood, deputy commissioner at the ICO. Now the BBC has learned that the tax authority's system will continue despite the deletions. Sir Jon Thompson, HMRC chief executive, said: ""I am satisfied that HMRC should continue to use voice ID."" ""It is popular with our customers, is a more secure way of protecting customer data, and enables us to get callers through to an adviser faster,"" he saidin a letter,externalto HMRC's data protection officer. In a bid to speed up the much-criticised HMRC helpline, people were invited to use the voice recognition system, rather than the normal security checks. The scheme, launched in 2017, asks callers to repeat the phrase ""my voice is my password"" to register. Once this task is complete, they can use the phrase to confirm their identity when managing their taxes. HMRC passes the voice through an algorithm to instantly confirm their ID. Similar projects have been launched by banks and other providers, although they have not always been entirely successful,as this BBC investigation found. Privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch complained about the audio signatures system, claiming users were ""railroaded"" into using it as they were not given the choice to opt out. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force across the European Union in May last year, requires organisations to obtain explicit consent before they use biometric data to identify someone, including voice recordings. HMRC has been told by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) that it was not adhering to the data protection rules. In effect, it had automatically pushed people into the system without explicit consent. The commissioner is issuing the first enforcement notice of its kind to HMRC, under GDPR rules, to ensure the data is deleted. As a result, no fine will be levied. The tax authority changed the way it sought permission for voice ID in October. Some 1.5 million people have called HMRC since then, and said they wanted to continue using the service. Their records have been retained. But HMRC has started to delete the voice records of the remaining five million who enrolled into the system before October and who have not called or used the service since. It said the records would be deleted ""well before"" the Information Commissioner's deadline of 5 June. Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ""This is a massive success for Big Brother Watch, restoring data rights for millions of ordinary people around the country. ""To our knowledge, this is the biggest ever deletion of biometric IDs from a state-held database. This sets a vital precedent for biometrics collection and the database state, showing that campaigners and the ICO have real teeth and no government department is above the law."" Mr Wood, deputy commissioner at the ICO, said: ""We welcome HMRC's prompt action to begin deleting personal data that it obtained unlawfully. Our investigation exposed a significant breach of data protection law. HMRC appears to have given little or no consideration to it with regard to its voice ID service.""

"Angela Collingbourne (top left) and seven other members of the drugs gang were jailed on Friday A grandmother has been jailed for six years after becoming ""second in command"" to a drugs gang headed by her two sons. Angela Collingbourne, 51, helped the group to sell more than Â£2.7m of cocaine in Newport, with her son directing operations from prison. Seven other members were also jailed for conspiracy to supply class A drugs on Friday at Newport Crown Court. Another eight hadalready been jailed in March, bringing the total to 16. The gang, from Newport, dealt the drug from a garage called NP19 Tyres, with video showing thousands of pounds passing through but only a handful of cars being repaired. The court was told Collingbourne, who is a grandmother, racked up a ""number of convictions"" for shoplifting, driving and a public order offence before becoming responsible for managing the gang's funds and facilitating - and maintaining control of the mobile telephone trading line with 4,000 customers. Prosecutor Andrew Jones said: ""She was a middle tier manager of the organisation."" Another eight members, including Angela Collingbourne's sons, were jailed in March She denied being ""a trusted lieutenant of this organised crime group, the second-in-command"" - but was convicted by a jury. Richard Barton, defending, said Collingbourne was acting out of ""mother's love"" and trying to provide for her three sons - the youngest of which has now lost ""three fifths of his remaining family"" following the convictions. The court was told Collingbourne became estranged from her ""racist"" parents after they did not approve of her relationship. Judge Daniel Williams told Collingbourne: ""During your trial you portrayed yourself as a victim, fighting bigotry and injustice - but the jury saw through you. ""You dismissed your crimes as evidence of your own victim-hood. ""You were counting and banking the vast profits from this operation. Angela Collingbourne was captured on CCTV counting cash from drugs sales ""You began to believe that you were unstoppable."" The gang was arrested following a year-long investigation, Operation Finch, which involved surveillance and secret recordings. Collingbourne's son Jerome Nunes, 28, and Blaine Nunes, 26, were jailed for 12 and 14 years. Judge Williams said it was ""depressing"" that Jerome Nunes was able to direct the operation from his prison cell using hidden mobile phones, while serving a sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to supply. The gang sourced drugs from Merseyside, with Matthew Croft regularly visiting Liverpool to meet ""up-stream suppliers"", the court heard. Police devices recorded Tia Donovan-Jones, 19, counting cash and inputting postcodes for drug deals. She would accompany her partner Thomas Allison to drug deals in her pyjamas and had ambitions of buying a Â£500,000 house with him. A raid recovered Versace, Prada, Bulgari and Louis Vuitton clothing.
