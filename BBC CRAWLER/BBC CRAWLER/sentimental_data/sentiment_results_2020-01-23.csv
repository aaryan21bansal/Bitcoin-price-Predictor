"A small government agency is supporting fossil fuel projects abroad with estimated carbon emissions of a country the size of Portugal, it has emerged. UK Export Finance (UKEF), a government agency in the Department for International Trade, is spending billions of pounds on the projects, Newsnight researchers have found. This is despite a government commitment to cut down on carbon emissions. The Conservative Environment Network (CEN) called the figures ""staggering"". The organisation, which describes itself as a forum for conservatives who support conservation and decarbonisation, said funding the projects was ""a blemish on the UK government's record on climate change"". An investigation byNewsnight, in conjunction with Unearthed - Greenpeace's investigations unit - found that UKEF has helped to finance oil and gas projects that, when complete, will emit 69 million tonnes of carbon a year, according to government estimates. That's nearly a sixth of the total annual carbon emissions of the UK. The government calculated the UK's total emissions to be 449 million tonnes of C02e (carbon dioxide equivalent) in 2018. It said the 69 million tonne estimate was a ""worst case"" scenario - and the emissions of the projects may be lower when the projects are operational. The UK is just one of a number of backers for these projects. UKEF was set up a century ago - and aims to support British businesses abroad. Earlier this week, Boris Johnson announced that the UK would no longer finance coal mining or coal-fired power plants abroad. Newsnight's investigation found all of UKEF's current fossil fuel financing was for oil and gas projects, and not coal. Newsnight research also found that - since 2010 - UKEF has financed Â£6bn of fossil fuel projects. Financing has been provided to some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world. BBC Briefing: Your energy and climate facts guide Trump takes on Thunberg and 'pessimism' at Davos â¢A visual guide to Australia's bushfire crisis The projects that UKEF helps to fund abroad include oil refineries, power plants and liquefied gas extraction. Last year, the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) published a report criticising UKEF as an ""elephant in the room undermining the UK's international climate and development targets"". Kerry McCarthy MP, a Labour member of the EAC said: ""It's ludicrous that we would be funding something overseas, that we are purporting to be moving away from in our own country. ""There's just a complete disconnect, there's complete hypocrisy, that we boast of cleaning up our own act, but actually we are enabling other countries to carry on polluting."" UKEF told Newsnight: ""We are committed to working with countries across the world to unlock their renewable energy potential and support their transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives."" As well as investments in fossil fuels UKEF has also financed some renewable projects. The CEN's Sam Hall said the government needed to solve the issue of what UKEF funds before COP26 - an international climate change conference due to be held in Glasgow in November this year.

"People are taking precautions around the world An incident team has been set up to deal with the threat of coronavirus in Scotland after it was confirmed five people are being tested for the virus. The Scottish government said the tests were a precaution and experts would be monitoring the situation daily. Globally there aremore than 800 confirmed cases of the virus which has killed 26 people in China. BBC Scotland understands that one of the patients is a Chinese student who is being treated in Edinburgh. He is believed to have first been in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary before being transferred to the Western, where the Regional Infectious Diseases Unit is located. The man is thought to have become unwell after visiting family in Wuhan, the suspected source of the outbreak. Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? It is not known where the other patients are being treated. Downing Street said four of them were believed to be Chinese nationals. People coming out of Wuhan were being checked for fever The Scottish government said two of those being tested had already been diagnosed with flu. Three others were being tested on a precautionary basis. There are currently no confirmed case of coronavirus in the UK and the risk to the Scottish public remains low, a government spokesman added. All those being tested in Scotland have respiratory symptoms and have been in the Chinese city of Wuhan, thought to be the source of the outbreak, in the last 14 days. They are among14 people in the UK who have been tested, according to Public Health England. Five have tested negative and nine are waiting for results. Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began How do you quarantine a city - and does it work? Samples are being sent in category A transport to a laboratory in London for urgent testing. The Scottish government said it would provide updates of any confirmed cases of coronavirus, but it would not provide a ""running update"" on cases being considered on a precautionary basis. A spokesman added: ""We are co-orientating with Health Protection Scotland a daily incident management team to continue to monitor the situation as it develops, including on the number of any potential cases going forward."" Prof Juergen Haas said it was ""very likely"" that there would be confirmed cases in the UK Prof Juergen Haas, Edinburgh University's head of infection medicine said it was ""very likely"" that cases would be confirmed in the UK. ""In any European countries there is a danger that these cases occur,"" he said. ""Here at the University of Edinburgh we have more than 2,000 students from China and they are always coming and going back to China so we are relatively sure we will have cases in the UK from travellers coming back from China."" He warned that the spread of the virus might increase as more people travelled around for Chinese New Year, within China and to other countries. Any suspected cases have to be isolated and staff dealing with them must wear protective clothes including gloves, masks and goggles. Elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are particularly at risk. Dundee University has 34 students from Wuhan studying in Dundee as a result of its partnership with Wuhan University. Five members of staff returned from a visit to Wuhan last week. No health concerns have been raised. Aberdeen University said five of its staff members visited Wuhan recently. Four returned to the university three or more weeks ago while the fourth is working from home as a precautionary measure. Any students who have been in China, or other areas where incidents of infection have been reported, within the last 14 days, and are experiencing respiratory symptoms, should contact their GP or NHS 24. Students should be careful if receiving packages from areas where the virus is present, especially if they contain food items. Nicola Sturgeon was questioned about the risk to people in Scotland at First Minister's Questions at the Scottish Parliament on Thursday. She said the situation was being closely monitored, adding: ""I should say, that the risk to the public here in Scotland - and indeed the UK - is currently classified as low but that is kept under review."" Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust research charity and an expert on disease in Asia, told BBC Scotland the outbreak in China was ""very, very concerning"". ""China is facing a real crisis,"" he said. ""This is now spreading across China and we are likely to see a lot more of this epidemic before it stops."" The city of Wuhan, where 11 million people live, is effectively on lockdown: all bus, subway and ferry services have been suspended and all outbound planes and trains cancelled. Residents have been advised not to leave, and roadblocks have been reported. Travel restrictions are also in place across 10 cities, affecting 20 million people. The virus has spread to the US, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea. The new strain of coronavirus is believed to have originated at a market in Wuhan.

"Eighteen people have died and 630 infected by new virus that emerged in Wuhan, China Wuhan, with 11m residents, is in lockdown to control the virus's spread Huanggang, a city of six million, will follow suit later - other cities have partial lockdowns Countries around the world have announced they will be screening travellers New confirmed cases in Singapore and Vietnam Four people tested in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland David Molloy, Tom Spender and Roland Hughes It is approaching 18:00 here in London and 02:00 in Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. We're going to pause our live coverage of this story from the time being - but you can alwayscheck our main news story for any late updates. To recap the day's events:  Do you want to know more about this outbreak? We've got some excellent background material: The Wuhan government is to build a new specialist hospital to receive coronavirus patients in just six days, state media report. The local government said it was following the example of a hospital built in Beijing in 2003 to help contain the Sars outbreak. Former BBC Beijing correspondent writes... Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor For many people in China, this is the only time they will get to see their families this year. It's the only public holiday long enough for people to go all the way home if you live a long way away. It's like Christmas in the West. People will be concerned about their health and will know that enjoying yourself at a time of a health crisis is secondary. I can't remember a time of such disruption during China's biggest holiday. The government will be aware of this. But what they are more aware of is that with the Sars outbreak in 2003, it was criticised for not doing enough quickly enough. They don't want to be seen saying ""carry on with the New Year celebrations"" when there is a crisis going on. They would rather cancel events and make sure this crisis is in control rather than face the criticism. Adoctor at a Wuhan hospital has told BBC Newsof her alarm at the spread of the outbreak. We have chosen to protect the doctor's identity. Today from 10:00, all boundaries in the city were closed - no in or out. People are not allowed to leave. We don't know how long this will last.  Normally, Wuhan is a great place to live. We are proud of our work as doctors. But I fear this is going to get worse and worse.  There is no anti-virus medication, so we can only treat symptomatically - decreasing fever and with good hydration. Right now, it's all about precautions.  Earlier we quoted India's foreign ministry as saying that an Indian nurse working in Saudi Arabia had tested positive for the new coronavirus from Wuhan. However India's consulate in the Saudi city of Jeddah now says that the nurse is suffering from Mers - or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - which emerged in 2015 and is a different form of coronavirus.

The BBC understands that the man flew into Belfast from China at the weekend and had travelled from Wuhan. While the man is believed to have been admitted with a high temperature it's thought clinicians took the immediate steps of placing him in isolation following advice from health authorities. Four people who have recently travelled to Wuhanare also being tested for the virus in Scotland. An international student in Wuhan - the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak - has been speaking to the BBC about what life is like in the now locked-down city. This video can not be played An international student talks about the impact of the virus scare on his life Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Despite widespread fear and concern as new coronavirus cases
are announced every day, China's government media have leapt on the opportunity
to emphasise positivity. Official media People's Daily and CCTV are extensively
calling on people to share posters promoting the good work of the medical
service and the public in trying to prevent the virus spreading. ""Come on, Wuhan,external"" and ""Help each other,external"" are slogans being pumped out, and shared hundreds of thousands of times â to
the extent that posts containing the hashtag #ComeOnWuhan have been read more
than 1.4bn timesand posted more than 4 million times,external. Today, a black and white picture of a boat sailing across a
river is being circulated hundreds of thousands of times. Addressing the Wuhan lockdown, a slogan accompanying it
says: ""Our city is sick, but we will cure it, and then again warmly
welcome you to Wuhan"". The health authority in China's northern Hebei Province says a patient with the coronavirus there has died. The local health commission said the 80-year-old died on Wednesday but was
not confirmed to have been infected with the virus until
Thursday. It brings the total death toll to 18. All the other 17 confirmed deaths have been in Hubei Province, where the city of Wuhan is located. Hebei is some distance from where the other deaths occurred. Here's a map showingmostof the places where the virus has spread. It started in Wuhan, but since that's a major population centre and transport hub, it spread to other Chinese cities and, through air travel, to other countries near and far. We've recently had reports from Saudi Arabia and Vietnam, too - our map designer is on the case. Journalists - the BBC included, we admit it - have tossed around the word ""epidemic"" a fair bit around this story. So what does that mean? The World Health Organisation says it's an illness ""in a community or region... clearly in excess of normal expectancy"". We often use the word ""outbreak""  to mean the same thing. There's no number behind the definition - it depends on the disease. So thousands of people having a cold isn't an epidemic, it's just normal in the winter season for many places. What about a pandemic? Well, in an epidemic, even though a lot more people get sick then you might expect, it only affects a specific area at a specific time. The word pandemic is used to describe a much wider outbreak - affecting multiple regions, countries - or even the entire world. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online This is a new virus, never seen in humans before - and it can kill. So what do we know, and should we be worried? This video can not be played China coronavirus: What we know so far Lady MacLehose Holiday Village in Sai Kung district is being used as one of two quarantine centres Hong Kong has turned two holiday camps, one of which is a former British military barracks, into quarantine areas for people who may have come into contact with the virus, officials said. The same sites were used as quarantine facilities during the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak 17 years ago, which killed nearly 300 people in Hong Kong. Two people in the city have so far tested positive for the coronavirus. Both had been in Wuhan. They are being treated in isolation wards. Wong Ka-hing, the director of the Centre for Health Protection, said three people who had come into close contact with the two confirmed cases would be taken to one of the camps, in rural Sai Kung district. It's midnight in the city of Huanggang, which lies about 70km east of Wuhan and is home to seven million people, and travel restrictions are just coming into force there. The bus and train networks are now closed and citizens have been asked not to leave by other means. Inside the city, entertainment venues such as cinemas and internet cafes have also been closed. So far 12 cases of coronavirus have been found in the city. What animal does the coronavirus come from? Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online It is not yet known how the virus was transmitted. Other
coronaviruses, such as Sars and Mers, came from civet cats and camels
respectively. Experts are working to find the source. Standard recommendations to prevent infection apply.
These include: Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of
respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. A lot of news about the coronavirus has flooded in, so here's a quick recap of the day's events: Four people who have recently travelled from Wuhan to Scotland are being treated as suspected cases of coronavirus. The head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, Professor Jurgen Haas, said all four had respiratory symptoms and had been in Wuhan within the last 14 days. It is believed that three patients are in Edinburgh and the fourth is in Glasgow.
It is likely to be several days before tests will confirm whether the four have contracted coronavirus or not. Prof Juergen told the BBC it was ""very likely"" that cases would be confirmed in the UK.

"This video can not be played Fears over coronavirus in China trigger face mask shortage Lockdown measures are increasing across China's Hubei province to try to control the spread of a new virus that has left 18 people dead in the country. Wuhan, Hubei's capital of 11 million people where the virus first emerged, has no trains or planes in or out. At least five other provincial cities are seeing clampdowns on transport. There are more than 500 confirmed cases of the virus, which has spread abroad, with Singapore and Vietnam the latest affected. Thursday's events as they happened The new strain of coronavirus is believed to have originated at a market in Wuhan. One resident of the city said the atmosphere there felt like ""the end of the world"". The lockdowns come as millions of Chinese people travel across the country for the Lunar New Year holiday. How do you quarantine a city - and does it work? Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began 'Increased likelihood' of new virus reaching UK All the fatalities bar one so far have been in Hubei province. Most of the 17 victims there were elderly and suffered from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's disease and diabetes. An 18th victim, an elderly patient, was announced on Thursday in Hebei province, near the capital, Beijing. Wuhan's public transport lockdown came into force as of 10:00 local time (02:00 GMT), leaving normally busy train stations and airports empty. One Wuhan resident said on social media site Weibo that people were on the ""verge of tears"" when they heard about the closures. Supermarket shelves emptied in Wuhan as residents stocked up on supplies Health authorities are reported to have made wearing a mask mandatory in the city. They are advising people to avoid crowds and public gatherings. Demand for rubber gloves and surgical masks has soared.Taobao, the Chinese online retail giant, has warned sellers not to profit from the outbreakby raising prices. Also in Hubei province: Huanggang, a city east of Wuhan, suspended bus and rail services and encouraged people not to leave the city.

Coronavirus: How worried should we be? New China virus: Your questions answered Killer plague game tops charts amid coronavirus A doctor at a hospital in Wuhan spoke to the BBC The virus is now spreading at an alarming rate. The hospitals have been flooding with thousands of patients, who wait hours to see a doctor. You can imagine their panic. Normally Wuhan is a great place to live and we are proud of our work. Specialists here have developed a guide for coronavirus diagnosis and treatment. But I am scared because this is a new virus and the figures are worrying. Two days ago we were told not to go to work because of the risk of contamination. If we leave our home on the hospital campus, we are required to wear masks.

He's sleeping now, and we are trying to protect him as much as possible: handwashing, airing the apartment, avoiding contact with people. Outside I can barely see anyone on the streets. We have been told to avoid gatherings. I went to the supermarket to buy food, but there was nothing left, no vegetables or biscuits. Some Lunar New Year celebrations are cancelled. People had bought tickets to go home for Lunar New Year but they can't go now. Everyone is stuck here and can't leave. Read more from the doctor in Wuhan Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold. Authorities have said this new virus originated in a seafood market in Wuhan that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". The market has been shut down since the beginning of the year. There is evidence of human-to-human transmission, with the virus spreading from patients to family members and healthcare workers. But understanding more about how the virus transmits between people is one of the major outstanding questions. The virus infects the lungs, and symptoms start with a fever and cough. It can progress to shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. The World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee said on Thursday that it was not the time to declare an ""international emergency"" over the new virus, although it was ""an emergency in China"". Its 16-member experts' panel was divided 50-50 on the issue, the WHO said, but had decided overall that it was too early because of the limited number of cases abroad, the efforts made by China to control the virus and the fact there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China. A global emergency is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound, and has previously been used in response to swine flu, Zika virus and Ebola.

"The UK is monitoring flights arriving from China as a precautionary measure There is an ""increased likelihood"" of cases of the new coronavirus occurring in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Globally, there are more than 500 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 18 people in China. But there are no known cases in the UK, Mr Hancock said, which was ""well prepared"" to deal with an outbreak. Fourteen people in the UK have now been tested for the virus, Public Health England said. Five of them have tested negative for the virus, while nine are still awaiting results. Earlier, it emerged six people were being tested in hospitals in Scotland and Northern Ireland after showing symptoms. All the patients had been in Wuhan - the Chinese city where the new strain of the virus, which can cause lung disease such as pneumonia, first emerged - in the last 14 days. One man is being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast- he is thought to have been admitted with a high temperature. Add the Scottish government confirmed there werefive suspected cases in Scotland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the tests were ""purely precautionary"". It is likely to be several days before tests will confirm whether they have contracted coronavirus or not. China battles to prevent New Year virus spike How worried should we be? Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Wuhan - which has a population of 11 million people - has gone into lockdown, with authorities suspending planes and trains in and out of the city. The UK is monitoring flights arriving from China as a precaution. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hancock said that it was a ""rapidly developing situation and the number of deaths and the number of cases is likely to be higher than those that have been confirmed so far and I expect them to rise further"". He told MPs: ""The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from 'very low' to 'low' and has concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well prepared and well equipped to deal with them."" He added: ""The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus. ""The NHS is ready to respond appropriately to any cases that emerge."" This video can not be played British passenger Thomas Crosby describes journey from virus-hit Wuhan In response to the outbreak, the Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan. On Wednesday, Public Health England began carrying out enhanced monitoring of direct flights from China. Passengers are receiving advice on what to do if they fall ill, which Mr Hancock said was the most important part of the monitoring as it can take days after infection before a patient develops symptoms, so physical checks were considered less useful. He added: ""We are working closely with our counterparts in the devolved administrations and the public can be assured that the whole of the UK is always well prepared for these types of outbreaks. ""And we'll remain vigilant and keep our response under constant review in the light of emerging scientific evidence.""

" The country with an ambitious plan  By Gabriel Gatehouse When a small village in Finland took the country’s biggest peat producer to court over a polluted river, it didn’t expect to win. But it had a secret weapon - a local fisherman-turned-scientist whose work on climate change would help push his country’s government to adopt one of the toughest targets for reducing carbon emissions anywhere in the world. Finland has pledged to be carbon-neutral by 2035 - that’s twice as fast as the UK government target. But to achieve this, it will have to make big changes, particularly in the peat industry, which currently provides energy, heating and jobs. Can the Finns turn an ambitious plan into reality?       Tero Mustonen is mending nets when we arrive at his house one morning, in the village of Selkie near the Russian border. “When I was very young, we could witness far more clean waters,” he says. “The lake was a certain depth and doing well. There were good fish stocks.” Tero has played a key role in Finland’s environmental story since 2010. One day, he and other local fishermen spotted dead fish floating on the surface of the water. “There was a massive discharge of acidic waters here in Selkie that killed all the fish in our river,” he tells me nearly a decade later, sitting in his 18th Century log house on the edge of the forest. The “acidic discharge” had come from a nearby peat field. When Tero saw the dead fish he immediately alerted Vapo, the peat extraction company that ran the site. The firm told him it had been caused by leaves falling into the river. But Tero knew that wasn’t right. And the dead fish were only a small part of a much bigger problem. So Tero and his village did something no-one had ever done before. They took Vapo, the state-controlled peat company, to court. They argued that the acidic waters were a result of the company’s activities. And they won.       Peat is formed of decayed vegetation. When dried it can be burned like a fossil fuel. In Finland, peat provides around 4% of the nation’s electricity, and 15% of heating. As a power source, peat is dirtier than coal. And it gets worse. Even after the peat has been extracted and burned, drained peatlands continue to emit previously locked-in, centuries-old greenhouse gases. Environmentalists say a failure by Finland to cut its reliance on peat could make its target of having a carbon footprint of net zero by 2035 - set by the country’s new coalition government last year - hard to achieve. “This became the first area where [Vapo] had to retreat and start the restoration,” he explains, as we pick our way over what was once a peat bog. Now it looks more like a brown and black moonscape. “When these were degraded by human land use, they turned into releasing places for carbon.” Tero and his colleagues have now taken over the restoration work. A digger is building a bank around the site. Soon they will flood it with water.        “Some of those emissions will stop immediately,” he says. “But then of course we will have to wait on those natural cycles for the plants to come back.” It’s a process called rewilding - returning a patch of land to its natural state, allowing biodiversity to flourish once again. Here’s the extraordinary thing about peatlands - when burned or dried out, theyrelease greenhouse gases. In their natural state however, they do the opposite. They are what’s known as carbon sinks - natural sites that trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and lock it back into the soil. “The existing marshmires, bogs and peatlands are defined by the UN as highly critical for [the] survival of humankind because they are helping with climate change through natural processes.”       Tero Mustonen is mending nets when we arrive at his house one morning, in the village of Selkie near the Russian border. “When I was very young, we could witness far more clean waters,” he says. “The lake was a certain depth and doing well.

He’s one of the lead authors on reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the IPCC) - that’s the UN body that evaluates the latest science in this area. After he won his local battle against Vapo, he had an idea. What if this small project on the outskirts of his village was a model that could be replicated more widely and help reduce carbon emissions on a vast scale? Boreal wetlands and marshmires extend around the planet’s higher latitudes - from Scandinavia through northern Russia and across the Pacific into Canada.    Tero Mustonen     “In Finland we have a massive potential for restoration of peatlands and bogs and marshmires into carbon sinks that are currently degraded. “We can bring them back into health and create more sites that trap carbon.” But despite Tero’s efforts, and the Finnish government’s pledge to go carbon-neutral by 2035, Finland is still issuing licences for the extraction of peat at other sites across the country. Even with the greenest of intentions, the Finns are discovering how stubborn the politics of fossil fuels can be.       It’s hunting season. In the village of Selkie, men gather before the dawn. Soon, the first big snowfalls will come. Today is perhaps the hunters’ last chance to catch enough moose to feed the whole community at the annual feast to mark the start of winter. Tero, who is also head of the village, introduces us to a group of men dressed in bright orange high-vis vests. They make some last-minute preparations: rifles are checked and the dogs are given collars fitted with GPS trackers. Then the hunters are divided into teams. The dog handlers drive off into the woods, but  the rest retreat to a circular wooden hut, where they will sit around a blazing log fire and wait. The hunt has begun. In these northern villages this is a tradition as old as human habitation itself. But technology is changing things. In the past, they’d all be in the woods, tracking the moose on foot. Now the majority sit by the warmth of the fire, checking an app on their smartphones. They’ll go out only when the time is right.   Tracking moose on a mobile phone    “Even though technology is giving assistance to the hunt, we still need traditional knowledge,” says Tero. “There are days when no animals are caught.” That traditional knowledge includes recognising animal tracks and droppings, and an understanding of the likely movements of the moose according to the weather and the season. And here, too, things are changing. Everyone around the fire has noticed the snows are coming later. “We now have Helsinki-style winters all the way up here on the 62nd parallel, which is 400km (250 miles) north,” says Markku Eskelinen, the leader of the hunt. “In one way, it has made the dynamics of the hunt easier,” he adds. A lack of snow certainly makes it easier to track through the forest. But the changes in the weather are having a mixed effect on agriculture. For Kyosti Siltala, a lawyer who also runs a small farm and forestry business, the warmer climate means his trees are growing faster, which can mean bigger profits from logging. But he’s also noticed new species and new diseases. “The whole of nature is changing,” he says. “It’s very difficult to see where we are heading and I’m personally very worried about it.” I look around the hut at the faces, young and old, lit by the flickering fire. “Is anyone not worried about climate change?” I ask. Silence. Here in the rural villages, plans to make Finland carbon-neutral in just 15 years’ time have generated a mixture of hope and trepidation. Yes, they worry about the consequences of a warming planet. But they also fear that some of the measures the city people in government might take to combat climate change could pose a real problem to rural life. “If they start to ration the fuel for climate reasons, it’s impossible for us,” Tero says, translating for two of the hunters sitting around the fire. “We rely on these vehicles for our daily life here, and fuel prices are very high, so a lot of our resources are going into that.” It’s mid-morning before the dogs pick up the scent of a moose. Thanks to the GPS trackers, the hunters are ready and waiting.  Markku Eskelinen  Markku takes up position on a path leading through the woods. In the distance, there is the sound of a dog barking. He raises his rifle. Off to the right, the undergrowth stirs. Suddenly a moose breaks cover and crosses the track. But she’s got a young calf with her. Markku holds his fire. The hunt has its rules, Tero explains. “It’s never a mass slaughter, or something we do just for the sake of it. Here in the northern villages there is still an understanding of the long traditions of how we have been living sustainably.” But the hunters aren’t finished yet. Markku gets a message over his radio. We walk deeper into the forest. A young male moose lies dead on the ground.     It’s hunting season. In the village of Selkie, men gather before the dawn.

Markku gets a message over his radio. We walk deeper into the forest. A young male moose lies dead on the ground.      The hunter who got the kill is Markku Kervinen - a border guard by day, but in his spare time one of the most prolific hunters in the village. He has cut the animal’s belly open. It’s not for the faint-hearted. He runs his hand through the animal’s fur and pulls out two small bugs - insects that never used to be found at such northern latitudes and that usually die when the temperature is well below freezing.   Bugs pulled from the moose     “Those are the moose flies that have now come because of climate change,” Tero explains. “They’re parasites. They weren’t here when we were young.” The hunters heave the moose on to an improvised sledge. The animal will be skinned and butchered - the meat shared in the community. “In the northern regions and northern cultures the way we interact with the Earth is the hunt,” says Tero, reflecting on the wider significance of what we’ve just witnessed. “We are, first and foremost, hunting and fishing societies. We call it traditional knowledge. And this, combined with science, can provide wisdom and ethics of how to treat the Earth and how to live so that humans are not against nature, but with nature.”    Markku Kervinen   The hunter who got the kill is Markku Kervinen - a border guard by day, but in his spare time one of the most prolific hunters in the village.

One reportin particular that he worked on, about the rate of warming in the Arctic, had a profound effect. Thousands came out on to the streets of Helsinki and other cities to demand their government do more to tackle the issue. All the major parties - except one - made tackling the climate crisis a major part of their campaigns, promising ambitious policies to restrict global warming to 1.5C. Proposals included an eco-tax on meat, higher levies on aviation and restrictions on the country’s logging industry. The right-wing nationalist Finns Party was the only political group not to join in. Having traditionally focused on the issue of immigration, in the 2019 poll its members switched their attention to what they called “climate hysteria”. They argued not that climate change wasn’t happening, but that Finland, a small country of 5.5 million people, was not mostly to blame for the rise in global CO2 emissions. Overly-ambitious targets would hurt ordinary people, especially in rural communities, the party said, without significantly contributing to the fight against global warming.   Finnish TV election debate   Looking back at some of the debates in the election campaign, I thought about the hunters in Selkie, who worried about their fuel prices going up, even as they fretted about warmer winters. In Finland, as elsewhere, climate has become a battleground in a broader culture war that has engulfed many Western democracies.       The result of the April election was tight. The Finns Party got the second-largest number of votes, trailing the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) by only 0.2 of a percentage point. But the Finns Party has been frozen out of government by a coalition of five other parties, led by the SDP. One of the new government’s first acts was to pledge to make Finland carbon-neutral by 2035 - one of the most ambitious targets for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the world. (Norway has promised to go net-zero by 2030 but will rely in part on buying international carbon credits, which Finland says it won’t do.) The coalition has proved to be an uneasy one. The leader of the SDP, Antti Rinne, was forced to step down as prime minister in December, replaced by his party colleague Sanna Marin, who at 34 has become the world’s youngest serving PM.   Sanna Marin      But the coalition has held together and remains committed to going net-zero by 2035. The government’s plans include investment in renewables, such as wind and solar power, energy tax reforms, investment in railways and conservation projects. The city of Helsinki has announced an international competition, offering a prize of one million euros for anyone who can come up with a green alternative to coal as an energy source in the capital. When I went to see Krista Mikkonen, Minister for the Environment and Climate Change, she was upbeat about the challenge that lies ahead. The 2035 target, she told me, had really focused minds.   Krista Mikkonen     “We understand that we need action now. We can’t wait because 2035 is quite close. It has also been a very good signal for businesses. They are really thinking how they can help cut down the emissions and have new kinds of technologies. “And they understand that if they are the first ones on the market... they can have a lot of business all over the world, because the whole world is really calling for answers and solutions, how to cut the emissions.” But where some see a business opportunity, others see a threat. The governing coalition includes Krista Mikkonen’s Green League but also the Centre Party - which has traditionally represented rural agrarian communities and has longstanding ties to the peat industry. Finland has legislated to end the use of coal for power and heating by 2029. When I asked Mikkonen why the new government doesn’t have a plan to end peat production there was a long silence. “That’s a good question,” she said finally. “I think we should do it. But it is not in our government programme at the moment. We don’t have a political agreement on that.”       Finland’s general election of April 2019 was dominated by the issue of climate change - thanks, in part, to Tero’s work as a climate scientist.

So what we need to do is create jobs in the same areas for those people who are now dependent on the peat industry.”       Finland’s use of peat for energy and heat production has declined since the mid-2000s. The industry employs around 2,600 people each year. Much of the work is seasonal. Environmental campaigners say those jobs could easily be replaced with investment in renewable energy. But the politics of this native Finnish fossil fuel is proving complicated. Before stepping down, former Prime Minister Antti Rinne promised that government subsidies for the peat industry - currently worth around 200 million euros a year - would be removed “at some point”. But for now, they remain in place.

A week after the moose hunt, the inhabitants of Selkie gather in the village hall for the annual feast, a communal meal to celebrate the traditional beginning of winter. Outside, snow is falling. Inside, raffle tickets are selling fast and a long table is laden with the spoils of the hunt. I sit down with Matti, his partner Senja and their two young children as they tuck into plates of steaming moose stew, boiled potatoes and red berry sauce.  Matti, Senja and their children    “The signs are there, and the anxiety that comes with climate-change news can be overwhelming,” Matti tells me. “It makes me so sad. I try not to think about it too much.” Matti is a teacher and commutes to his job in the nearby town of Joensuu. “I’m trying to reduce my use of the car but it’s hard to work from here. I already work one day in the week from home. How else could I reduce it? I don’t know.” “We try to recycle everything and grow our own food, like carrots and potatoes,” Senja adds. Matti believes the solution to climate change is really quite simple - less work and less consumption. “It’s mostly a societal problem. It’s about giving up the way you live. It can be hard if you’re the first ones to change but it is achievable.” Senja is not so optimistic about Finland’s chances of creating a less consumer-driven society. “I think it’s quite hard to achieve, because we have everything, and I don’t think people would like to give up those things.”     After the moose stew, Tero Mustonen takes to the stage at the far end of the hall to announce the start of the much-anticipated raffle. Excited children are dispatched up to the podium to receive their prizes, including hunting jackets, fishing nets, and bags of frozen moose meat. “We are at a profound crossroads,” he tells me. “The forces that have been unleashed by our greed, our misunderstanding of what nature is and our endless economic idea that it can grow without any checks and balances has come to its end.”      A week after the moose hunt, the inhabitants of Selkie gather in the village hall for the annual feast, a communal meal to celebrate the traditional beginning of winter.

He’s careful to emphasise that he doesn’t speak on behalf of the UN body, but he says the climate crisis is more urgent than even most reports in the press suggest. “I think it’s far worse than what we have been discussing in the media. Once we get into the 2030s, 2040s, there will be impacts to the global security and global governance which will be extremely hard to control. “I would give it eight-to-10 years when we really, really, truly have to do at least two things: one, the emission cuts and secondly, the land use. We will not be able to stop human-induced climate change any more. There will be impacts.” Tero says it is now a question of mitigation rather than prevention. Then he says something that I’ve rarely heard from a scientist. Now is not the time for more study, experiments or peer-reviewed papers, he explains. Now is the time for action. “What more evidence do we need? The planet is truly shifting. I don’t think we need more science or data as such. We have all the data. We have the technologies.We can disagree on other things, but let us be united on this.”     In his log house on the edge of the forest, Tero is working on the next report to the IPCC, which will shape the way governments around the world respond to the challenges of climate change in the coming years.

"This video can not be played Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital has had its busiest month on record, with 7,409 patients attending its A&E unit Waiting times for A&E departments in Wales hit their worst levels in December, with only 72.1% of patients waiting less than four hours. The target is for 95% of patients to be seen in that time - but that target has never been met. Figures published on Thursday also show a record number of patients waited more than 12 hours. Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething has announced an additional Â£10m to help tackle the pressures. That is on top of Â£30m already provided this winter to improve the flow of patients out of hospital and into the community. The Welsh Ambulance Service also missed its target for responding to red - immediately life-threatening - calls for a second month. Emergency departments saw the highest number of attendances over the period, with spikes in demand on some days. The December figures showed only 72.1% waited less than four hours in A&E to be treated, transferred or discharged, compared to the target of 95% This is down from 74.4% in November and significantly worse than December 2018 (77.8%) There were 6,656 patients waiting more than 12 hours - a record high. The target is that no-one should wait that long The ambulance service failed to meet its target for responding to immediately life threatening calls for the second time since the target was introduced in 2015 In December the ambulance service responded to 62% of red calls within eight minutes - the target is 65% The ambulance service had a 23% rise in red calls and an 8.4% increase in amber calls compared to last winter. It received more than 100 red calls on eight out of these 17 days, peaking at 119 calls on 20 December. Its performance was a slight improvement on November's figure of 61.4% - but significantly worse than the same time last winter. A&E record low performance as ambulance service struggles Fines considered to tackle ambulance transfer delays Winter pressures at hospitals 'exceptional' Ambulances on amber calls 'getting to sickest first' Long ambulance wait for dementia patient near hospital Winter tends to bring more complex conditions and circulating illnesses which affect older people more seriously. That is reflected in figures which show - despite milder weather - an 8.4% rise in A&E attendances over the Christmas and New Year period for the over 75s compared to last year. There was also a 5.2% increase in emergency admissions to hospital of patients aged over 75 when compared with 2018-19. The Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport has had a record month The Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport has had its busiest month on record, with 7,409 patients attending its A&E unit. That's an 8.3% rise on last December. Its waiting times performance has also suffered - with only 53% of patients seen within the four hour target. There were also 852 patients who waited more than 12 hours. Paul Mizen, director of urgent care, said it was a ""daily challenge"" which could be very stressful for staff. The hospital has opened up extra beds, put a pharmacist inside the emergency department and a member of staff co-ordinates the discharging of patients to improve the flow. But Dr Mizen admitted sometimes patients had to be treated in chairs rather than beds ""and that's a regret"". ""The system is coping but there are times when it's very, very tight,"" he said. Senior nurse Natalie Skyrme said: ""Staff have risen to the challenge. It's not always done in places but we're doing our best. ""It's better to treat them in a chair than not at all. ""Boxing Day was an exceptionally bad day but I suppose it feels like you're in a place where you have no control - but you're trying to deal with what's in front of you,"" she said. Jan Newman brought a friend in after a fall Jan Newman brought her friend Gwyneira into Newport by taxi after she suffered a fall in her bedroom and needed a series of tests. They had been referred from hospital in Ystrad Mynach and said they had a ""feeling of dread,"" knowing the wait they faced. She said the Royal Gwent was ""bursting at the seams"". ""They're constantly stressed and rushed - and the fact we couldn't find a chair in the waiting room to sit down on [when we arrived], it's stress all round."" The money announced on Thursday by Mr Gething is on top of Â£30m worth of funds announced in the autumn. ""There has been a welcome reduction in delayed transfers of care but too many patients are spending long periods in emergency departments waiting for a hospital bed,"" he said. ""We want health boards to work with partners to improve the flow of patients through the hospital system and out into the community, and I have made an extra Â£10m available to support improvement in this area."" One consultant at Morriston Hospital in Swansea told BBC Wales earlier this month there had been 125 medically fit patients in beds who were unable to leave until social care was available. Jo Mower, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Wales said the figures came despite A&E staff ""working tirelessly"" to provide care in the face of reduced capacity. ""We need to assess ongoing health and social care needs both in hospitals and in the community,"" she said. ""Without adequate health and social care resources and the consequential effect upon the unscheduled care system this will inevitably result in emergency department crowding which has in turn resulted in an increase in patients waiting outside the emergency department."" There are also record numbers waiting more than 12 hours Dr David Bailey of the BMA in Wales added: ""The whole system is under strain like never before and a whole system approach is needed to tackle it. ""We've received countless examples from our GP members across the country of unacceptable delays in handing over seriously unwell patients to onward care, particularly when emergencies occur on GP premises. ""Beds in hospitals are blocked by patients who can't be moved on to social care, due to a lack of resources."" The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health boards, said work had started to transform services, including working closely with local government. ""This is the right path to take, but we need to deliver this change at pace and scale for the benefit of everyone in Wales,"" said a spokesman. Mr Gething said it was a ""difficult challenge but not unfixable"" but he was against a ""big bang reorganisation"" to move social care out of local government and into the health service. He also said he would soon consider a possible change in the waiting time measures - also being considered in England - on advice from senior consultants. ""It's not simply about junking measures we don't like, it's about what would be the right set of measures to have that clinicians themselves agree would make a difference,"" he said. ""[They would] tell you and the wider public something useful about the quality of care as well as the volume of care and how timely that care is being provided."" Plaid Cymru said the explanation from the minister about the latest figures was ""not good enough"" and the performance was consistently worse than in England. Health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Every year, we get a different excuse as to why this time the poor performance is 'unprecedented' or 'extraordinary'. The excuses change, the deterioration in performance doesn't"". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds added: ""It is vital that the Welsh Government urgently gets to grips with A&E waiting times so we can improve patient safety, increase staff retention and give patients the quality treatment they deserve."" Conservative health spokeswoman Angela Burns said staff were being let down and called the figures disturbing. ""The health minister must announce - today - what remedial action he is going to take, and a definite timeframe in which to deliver it,"" she added. In the bigger scheme of things, Â£10m is a drop in the ocean compared to the Â£8bn entire budget of NHS Wales. But the Welsh Government will hope that by injecting this cash now, on top of the cash pledged earlier, they might be able to stop the slump in performance seen over the past four months. The NHS will also get a significant cash injection to its budget in the next financial year. But it's struggling now. The health minister insists demand this winter has been exceptional - despite it being relatively mild - with a big rise in the most serious red ambulance calls, for example. But opposition parties argue Mr Gething can't use this as an excuse. They say the blame for long A&E waits and worsening ambulance response times lie squarely at his door, even though targets have been missed across the UK this winter.Â Fines considered to speed up A&E handovers 'Exceptional' winter pressures at hospitals A&E record low as ambulance service struggles Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Morrisons is axing 3,000 management roles as part of a huge restructuring to create more shop floor jobs. The firm says it is also creating 7,000 new hourly-paid roles at its 500 stores, meaning a net 4,000 new posts. The new jobs will be in customer-facing roles, such as more butchers, bakers, fishmongers, the supermarket said. Morrisons said the new roles will be a mixture of part and full time posts, but declined to reveal how the numbers will be split. Managers will be able to move to the new jobs, with the firm saying there will be roles ""for everybody who wants to continue to work at Morrisons"". David Lepley, Morrisons group retail director, said: ""Whilst there will be a short period of uncertainty for some managers affected by these proposals we will be supporting them through this process. ""There will also be more roles with greater flexibility that are very attractive to colleagues with families."" The company says those in managerial jobs who want to remain working at Morrisons can stay. However, their new offer will be at the shop floor level. Front-line store staff at Morrisons earn Â£9 an hour. News of the restructuring was first reported byRetail Week,external. The big four supermarkets are all making changes to try to stem the flow of shoppers switching allegiance to discount stores. They are all hoping to save money on staffing costs in order to be able to offer bigger discounts to shoppers in store. Within the past year Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have all announced significant job cuts at management level. However, unlike Tesco's job cuts at this point last year, Morrisons are putting more new shop floor workers behind specialist counters. Rather than cutting deli counters, Morrisons are keen for their Market Street sections to help them stand out against the other big players in the supermarket wars. All affected stores will have a 45-day consultation period, with the cuts beginning in March. The manager jobs at risk include in-store posts, and not office roles, the company said. Jobs such as in-store beer, wine and spirits managers will be combined with other jobs. Morrisons is not the only supermarket to be cutting management posts. All the big four UK supermarket chains are battling to retain market share amid fierce competition, particularly from discount chains Aldi and Lidl. Earlier this week,Sainsbury's said it was shedding hundreds of managers at its head office,but did not confirm the number. Sainsbury's said the cuts were being made due to the integration of Argos, which it bought in 2016. Asda has reportedly begun consultations with more than 2,800 staff over cutbacks. Reports say those working in administrative, cash office and personnel roles have been told their jobs are at risk.

"Eighteen people have died and 630 infected by new virus that emerged in Wuhan, China Wuhan, with 11m residents, is in lockdown to control the virus's spread Huanggang, a city of six million, will follow suit later - other cities have partial lockdowns Countries around the world have announced they will be screening travellers New confirmed cases in Singapore and Vietnam Four people tested in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland David Molloy, Tom Spender and Roland Hughes It is approaching 18:00 here in London and 02:00 in Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. We're going to pause our live coverage of this story from the time being - but you can alwayscheck our main news story for any late updates. To recap the day's events:  Do you want to know more about this outbreak? We've got some excellent background material: The Wuhan government is to build a new specialist hospital to receive coronavirus patients in just six days, state media report. The local government said it was following the example of a hospital built in Beijing in 2003 to help contain the Sars outbreak. Former BBC Beijing correspondent writes... Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor For many people in China, this is the only time they will get to see their families this year. It's the only public holiday long enough for people to go all the way home if you live a long way away. It's like Christmas in the West. People will be concerned about their health and will know that enjoying yourself at a time of a health crisis is secondary. I can't remember a time of such disruption during China's biggest holiday. The government will be aware of this. But what they are more aware of is that with the Sars outbreak in 2003, it was criticised for not doing enough quickly enough. They don't want to be seen saying ""carry on with the New Year celebrations"" when there is a crisis going on. They would rather cancel events and make sure this crisis is in control rather than face the criticism. Adoctor at a Wuhan hospital has told BBC Newsof her alarm at the spread of the outbreak. We have chosen to protect the doctor's identity. Today from 10:00, all boundaries in the city were closed - no in or out. People are not allowed to leave. We don't know how long this will last.  Normally, Wuhan is a great place to live. We are proud of our work as doctors. But I fear this is going to get worse and worse.  There is no anti-virus medication, so we can only treat symptomatically - decreasing fever and with good hydration. Right now, it's all about precautions.  Earlier we quoted India's foreign ministry as saying that an Indian nurse working in Saudi Arabia had tested positive for the new coronavirus from Wuhan. However India's consulate in the Saudi city of Jeddah now says that the nurse is suffering from Mers - or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - which emerged in 2015 and is a different form of coronavirus.

The BBC understands that the man flew into Belfast from China at the weekend and had travelled from Wuhan. While the man is believed to have been admitted with a high temperature it's thought clinicians took the immediate steps of placing him in isolation following advice from health authorities. Four people who have recently travelled to Wuhanare also being tested for the virus in Scotland.

This video can not be played An international student talks about the impact of the virus scare on his life Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Despite widespread fear and concern as new coronavirus cases
are announced every day, China's government media have leapt on the opportunity
to emphasise positivity. Official media People's Daily and CCTV are extensively
calling on people to share posters promoting the good work of the medical
service and the public in trying to prevent the virus spreading. ""Come on, Wuhan,external"" and ""Help each other,external"" are slogans being pumped out, and shared hundreds of thousands of times â to
the extent that posts containing the hashtag #ComeOnWuhan have been read more
than 1.4bn timesand posted more than 4 million times,external. Today, a black and white picture of a boat sailing across a
river is being circulated hundreds of thousands of times. Addressing the Wuhan lockdown, a slogan accompanying it
says: ""Our city is sick, but we will cure it, and then again warmly
welcome you to Wuhan"". The health authority in China's northern Hebei Province says a patient with the coronavirus there has died. The local health commission said the 80-year-old died on Wednesday but was
not confirmed to have been infected with the virus until
Thursday. It brings the total death toll to 18. All the other 17 confirmed deaths have been in Hubei Province, where the city of Wuhan is located. Hebei is some distance from where the other deaths occurred. Here's a map showingmostof the places where the virus has spread. It started in Wuhan, but since that's a major population centre and transport hub, it spread to other Chinese cities and, through air travel, to other countries near and far. We've recently had reports from Saudi Arabia and Vietnam, too - our map designer is on the case. Journalists - the BBC included, we admit it - have tossed around the word ""epidemic"" a fair bit around this story. So what does that mean? The World Health Organisation says it's an illness ""in a community or region... clearly in excess of normal expectancy"". We often use the word ""outbreak""  to mean the same thing. There's no number behind the definition - it depends on the disease. So thousands of people having a cold isn't an epidemic, it's just normal in the winter season for many places. What about a pandemic? Well, in an epidemic, even though a lot more people get sick then you might expect, it only affects a specific area at a specific time. The word pandemic is used to describe a much wider outbreak - affecting multiple regions, countries - or even the entire world. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online This is a new virus, never seen in humans before - and it can kill. So what do we know, and should we be worried? This video can not be played China coronavirus: What we know so far Lady MacLehose Holiday Village in Sai Kung district is being used as one of two quarantine centres Hong Kong has turned two holiday camps, one of which is a former British military barracks, into quarantine areas for people who may have come into contact with the virus, officials said. The same sites were used as quarantine facilities during the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak 17 years ago, which killed nearly 300 people in Hong Kong. Two people in the city have so far tested positive for the coronavirus. Both had been in Wuhan. They are being treated in isolation wards. Wong Ka-hing, the director of the Centre for Health Protection, said three people who had come into close contact with the two confirmed cases would be taken to one of the camps, in rural Sai Kung district. It's midnight in the city of Huanggang, which lies about 70km east of Wuhan and is home to seven million people, and travel restrictions are just coming into force there. The bus and train networks are now closed and citizens have been asked not to leave by other means. Inside the city, entertainment venues such as cinemas and internet cafes have also been closed. So far 12 cases of coronavirus have been found in the city. What animal does the coronavirus come from? Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online It is not yet known how the virus was transmitted. Other
coronaviruses, such as Sars and Mers, came from civet cats and camels
respectively. Experts are working to find the source. Standard recommendations to prevent infection apply.
These include: Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of
respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. A lot of news about the coronavirus has flooded in, so here's a quick recap of the day's events: Four people who have recently travelled from Wuhan to Scotland are being treated as suspected cases of coronavirus. The head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, Professor Jurgen Haas, said all four had respiratory symptoms and had been in Wuhan within the last 14 days. It is believed that three patients are in Edinburgh and the fourth is in Glasgow.
It is likely to be several days before tests will confirm whether the four have contracted coronavirus or not. Prof Juergen told the BBC it was ""very likely"" that cases would be confirmed in the UK.

"This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe said he pushed the PM to be ""brave"" in regards to Iran The husband of a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran said there has been ""no breakthrough"" in efforts to secure her release after talks with Boris Johnson. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife was being used as a ""chess piece"" in foreign policy and urged the government to be ""tougher"" with Tehran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained for almost four years over spying allegations she denies. Her five-year-old daughter was also at the meeting at No 10 on Thursday. Mr Johnson has previously said he would leave ""no stone unturned"" to help free her. Mr Ratcliffe last met the prime minister when he was foreign secretary in 2017. That meeting came shortly after Mr Johnson had to apologise after wrongly suggesting that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists at the time of her arrest. She has always maintained she was in Iran visiting relatives. What is the Zaghari-Radcliffe case about? Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter returns to UK Concern for Briton jailed in Iran as tensions rise Thursday's meeting followedthe US killing of Iran's top military leader Qasem Soleimani. Holding the hand of his daughter, Gabriella, outside No 10, Mr Ratcliffe said he urged the prime minister to be ""brave"" in his dealings with Iran - and that relations between two countries must improve. Gabriella was given a toy version of Larry the Downing Street cat during her visit to No 10 Mr Johnson is ""personally committed"" to her case, he said, and was ""touched"" when he gave him a wallet that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had made in prison. But Mr Ratcliffe added that ""sympathy isn't enough"" and that the prime minister did not apologise for the mistake he made as foreign secretary. ""I don't stand here hopeful, if I'm honest. I stand here with my wife still in prison and things aren't moving,"" he said. ""I will think carefully about what I tell her on the phone on Saturday."" He has previously raised concerns that the recent escalation in tensions could make matters worse for his wife. Before her arrest Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe lived in London with accountant Mr Ratcliffe Ahead of the meeting, which the foreign secretary also attended, the prime minister's spokesman said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's continued detention was ""inhumane and unacceptable"" and the UK continued to ""take every opportunity"" to raise her case with the Iranian government. It comes as the Court of Appeal in London prepares to hear a case that could resolve a decade-long financial dispute between the UK and Iran. The dispute is over the interest due on a debt owed by Britain to Tehran for an arms deal in the 1970s that was never fulfilled. Mr Ratcliffe said he was told at the meeting that the government is trying to resolve ""other issues"" but that they are ""complicated"". Speaking in the Commons, the couple's MP, Labour's Tulip Siddiq, urged the government to settle the debt with Iran, accusing it of ""unforgiveable"" behaviour. However, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the issue was ""extraordinarily difficult"" because the government could not be seen to be paying money to allow the release of people who had been illegally detained. ""The risk that would cause to other Britons travelling abroad would be very considerable,"" he said.

Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, remains on medication for depression and on beta blockers - medicines which slow down the heart - for the panic attacks she's been suffering in jail,her husband said. The dual national has been detained since 2016, when she took her British-born daughter Gabriella to Iran to visit her parents. She was sentenced to five years in prison for spying. Her family and the UK government has always maintained her innocence and she has beengiven diplomatic protectionby the Foreign Office - meaning the case is treated as a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran. While he was foreign secretary, Mr Johnson mistakenly said that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran training journalists when she was arrested. Four days later Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to an unscheduled court hearing during which Mr Johnson's comments were cited as proof she was engaged in ""propaganda against the regime"".

"Party leaders issued a joint statement Stormont's five main party leaders have asked that a Â£1,000 pay rise in MLAs' salaries is ""immediately deferred"". MLAs' pay is due to rise from Â£49,500 to Â£50,500 but the five leaders jointly asked the Assembly Commission to halt this until the decision is reviewed. Stormont's Speaker Alex Maskey has now called commission members to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue. The current rules on MLAs' salaries and expenses were set by the Independent Financial Review Panel (IFRP) in 2016. Stormont's devolved government collapsed the following year and the panel's members terms later expired, but the IFRP's determination from 2016 still applies. That determination provides MLAs with a Â£500 annual increase to their salaries, but pay rises were blocked while devolution was suspended after a request from the Assembly Commission to the then Secretary of State Karen Bradley. With devolution restored, MLAs are due to automatically receive a Â£1,000 uplift - for the two years they did not get the additional money while Stormont was not running. However, many of the 90 MLAs have said they did not have any input into this decision and have offered to donate the money to charity. The assembly sat for the first time in three years on 11 January In a joint statement on Wednesday, the five main party leaders said: ""We share the broad public dismay at this development, only a matter of days after the Assembly and institutions have been fully restored. ""We have had a range of concerns over time around recommendations emerging from the Independent Financial Review Panel. ""We are jointly asking the Assembly Commission that any pay proposal is immediately deferred until the work of the Financial Review Panel has been comprehensively reviewed, and a new panel has the opportunity to consider this matter again and produce a fresh determination. ""We recognise that a number of MLAs and parties have indicated if the proposed pay increase cannot be halted, they will donate any additional sum to local causes and charities."" Assembly members to get Â£1,000 pay rise Â£15m paid in MLA salaries 'unacceptable' NI assembly members' pay drops by 15% On Wednesday evening, a spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Assembly said: ""The Speaker is mindful of the concerns expressed by the five main political parties in relation to the Independent Financial Review Panel's inflationary increases to MLA salaries arising from its 2016 determination. ""He has therefore invited Assembly Commission members and those members who are due to be appointed to the commission, to attend a meeting tomorrow afternoon, to discuss how those concerns might be addressed."" TheIFRP was established by the Assembly Commission in 2011,externalto make independent determinations in relation to MLAs' salaries, allowances and pensions. Under its 2016 determination, MLAs are due to receive another Â£500 rise in April 2020, unless the assembly establishes another mechanism to deal with MLA pay. Earlier, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in both said they would look at ways to stop the Â£1,000 pay increase. Sinn FÃ©in vice president Michelle O'Neill said it was ""unjustifiable"". The DUP said it was ""totally opposed"" to it, ""in light of the very recent restoration of the assembly"". The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in said they would explore ways to stop or return the pay rise The DUP said it supported ""the concept that pay levels should be entirely independent of any MLA input"". However, the statement added: ""We are currently examining options to see whether this rise can be returned and if not then it is the view of our members that they will not keep any additional salary but instead support local causes."" Speaking on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said: ""Whoever thought that this was a good thing to do, at this particular juncture, was way off the mark. ""It is incredibly unfortunate that this has jarred with the start of what has been quite a positive opening to the assembly."" Ms O'Neill tweeted on Tuesday that assembly members had ""no input into this decision, nor did they seek it"". In a statement on Wednesday, the party said it was ""actively exploring options to stop it"". ""If that's not possible then we'll see if the money can be returned to public funds or donated to charity,"" it added. This is quite the move by the party leaders. While it's clear they are doing this to try to curtail some of the public ire, how they are going about it might make some uncomfortable. MLAs stopped having an input into how their pay is set in 2011, when the independent body was established. Under the law, it states that the panel should not be ""subject to the direction or control of"" the Northern Ireland Assembly, or the Assembly Commission. But this statement is an indication that the politicians want to undo - or at least review - what the panel decided almost four years ago. The situation is complicated by fact that the panel members' terms of office were allowed to expire and no action was taken to replace them. It is now over to the Assembly Commission - made up of the Speaker and five members from the main parties - to respond. West Belfast MLA Gerry Carroll has criticised the pay increase All 12 SDLP MLAs said they would be donating their pay rises to charity. People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said it was ""a slap in the face to nurses who stood on freezing pickets for months for pay parity, and the civil service staff who are still taking industrial action to get what they deserve"". Mr Butler, the UUP's Chief Whip, said in a Facebook post he would be donating the salary increase to a number of charities. ""Just for clarity, there is no way to refuse this pay increase. It is automatic. It was not voted on by MLAs,"" he added. The Alliance Party said it was ""working with other party leaders to find a means to defer this"". The former chair of the IFRP, Pat McCartan, said the determination in the 2016 report still applies. ""It did provide for a basic salary of an MLA of Â£49,000 with a less than 1% increase per annum of Â£500 provided inflation was running at more than 1%,"" he said. ""Now, when you roll that up, that is why you get the current level of salaries and it is entirely justified through the whole method that we use with job evaluation, pay comparison, and looking at all other legislatures in these islands. ""These are the lowest paid legislatures, whether they actually legislate or not is a matter for the electorate.""

"The UK is monitoring flights arriving from China as a precautionary measure There is an ""increased likelihood"" of cases of the new coronavirus occurring in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Globally, there are more than 500 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 18 people in China. But there are no known cases in the UK, Mr Hancock said, which was ""well prepared"" to deal with an outbreak. Fourteen people in the UK have now been tested for the virus, Public Health England said. Five of them have tested negative for the virus, while nine are still awaiting results. Earlier, it emerged six people were being tested in hospitals in Scotland and Northern Ireland after showing symptoms. All the patients had been in Wuhan - the Chinese city where the new strain of the virus, which can cause lung disease such as pneumonia, first emerged - in the last 14 days. One man is being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast- he is thought to have been admitted with a high temperature. Add the Scottish government confirmed there werefive suspected cases in Scotland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the tests were ""purely precautionary"". It is likely to be several days before tests will confirm whether they have contracted coronavirus or not. China battles to prevent New Year virus spike How worried should we be? Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Wuhan - which has a population of 11 million people - has gone into lockdown, with authorities suspending planes and trains in and out of the city. The UK is monitoring flights arriving from China as a precaution. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hancock said that it was a ""rapidly developing situation and the number of deaths and the number of cases is likely to be higher than those that have been confirmed so far and I expect them to rise further"". He told MPs: ""The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from 'very low' to 'low' and has concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well prepared and well equipped to deal with them."" He added: ""The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus. ""The NHS is ready to respond appropriately to any cases that emerge."" This video can not be played British passenger Thomas Crosby describes journey from virus-hit Wuhan In response to the outbreak, the Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan. On Wednesday, Public Health England began carrying out enhanced monitoring of direct flights from China. Passengers are receiving advice on what to do if they fall ill, which Mr Hancock said was the most important part of the monitoring as it can take days after infection before a patient develops symptoms, so physical checks were considered less useful. He added: ""We are working closely with our counterparts in the devolved administrations and the public can be assured that the whole of the UK is always well prepared for these types of outbreaks. ""And we'll remain vigilant and keep our response under constant review in the light of emerging scientific evidence."" This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Authorities around the world have announced screening measures for passengers from China. Singapore, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam are the latest countries to have registered a confirmed case. Thailand has confirmed four cases of the virus - the most outside of China. The US, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have all reported one case each. The World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee is meeting on Thursday in Geneva to decide whether or not to declare a ""global emergency"". A global emergency is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound and has previously been used in response to swine flu, Zika virus and Ebola. All but one of the fatalities so far have been in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. Most of the 17 victims were elderly and suffered from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's disease and diabetes. The lockdown comes as millions of Chinese people travel across the country for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold. Authorities have said it originated in a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". The market has been shut down since the beginning of the year.

There is evidence of human-to-human transmission, with the virus spreading from patients to family members and healthcare workers. But understanding more about how the virus transmits between people is one of the major outstanding questions. The virus infects the lungs, and symptoms start with a fever and cough. It can progress to shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

Its 16-member experts' panel was divided 50-50 on the issue, the WHO said, but had decided overall that it was too early because of the limited number of cases abroad, the efforts made by China to control the virus and the fact there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China.

"Only about one in 14 crimes reported to police lead to a suspect being charged, official statistics have shown. Covering the year up to September 2019, the Home Office figures for England and Wales mark a new low, having fallen from about one in seven in 2015. It comes as knife crime recorded by police rose by 7% to an all-time high and robberies increased by 12%. But homicides - including murder and manslaughter - fell by 6% to 617 deaths, and fatal stabbings fell 20%. The crimes least likely to be solved Knife possession offences reach record high âWe stitch their stab wounds and then we save themâ The key facts about rising knife crime The proportion of crimes leading to a prosecution in England and Wales has been in continuous decline since 2015, when the figures were first compiled this way. Between September 2015 and September 2018, it had fallen from 14% to 8.4%, and it has now dropped again to 7.3% - about one in 14 cases. In addition, 1.4% of crimes led to a caution, 2.3% led to an informal warning and 0.1% were ""taken into consideration"" - meaning an offender admitted them as part of another investigation. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said the fall in prosecutions was ""extremely concerning"". ""The public need to have confidence that the criminal justice system is finding, prosecuting and convicting criminals - so it is a serious problem that fewer crimes are being solved or dealt with,"" she said. She said MPs had previously warned that police forces were ""badly overstretched"" and that without additional funding, there would be ""serious consequences for public safety"". Rape had the lowest rate of charges at just 1.4%, while for thefts it was 5.4% and for robberies it was 7.2%. The slump in the charging rate is arguably the most worrying feature of these latest statistics. It means 13 out of every 14 crimes are not being solved - offenders are still at large and able to commit further offences, fuelling the steady rise in crimes such as robbery. There are some tentative signs that the rate of decline may be slowing - it was down only one-tenth of a percentage point in the last three months - and extra government investment in policing and the Crown Prosecution Service will undoubtedly help. But low detection levels dent public confidence in police and the criminal justice system, creating a damaging vicious circle in which people are less likely to co-operate with investigations - because they don't believe anything will happen. Cases where the victim does not support criminal proceedings have risen sharply over five years, from 8.7% to 22.9%. In 43.4% of cases, no suspect could be identified. It comes as separate crime figures show that police recorded 44,771 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument in the year to September 2019 - an increase of 7% to a new record high. Helen Ross, from the Office for National Statistics' Centre for Crime and Justice, said there is a ""mixed picture"" across the country for knife crime and ""overall levels of violence remain steady"". ""We have also seen the number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was used decrease by a fifth, driven by falls in London,"" she said. The ONS said that although improvements in the way crime was recorded may have contributed to the 12% rise in robberies, to a total of 82,542 offences, some of the increase is ""likely to reflect a real change"". The crime figures exclude Greater Manchester, due to technical issues with recording the data. The Crime Survey for England and Wales - which is considered better for judging long-term trends - suggests that overall crime rates are broadly stable. But the survey shows that fraud rose by 9%, driven by a rise in bank and credit account fraud.

"Morrisons is axing 3,000 management roles as part of a huge restructuring to create more shop floor jobs. The firm says it is also creating 7,000 new hourly-paid roles at its 500 stores, meaning a net 4,000 new posts. The new jobs will be in customer-facing roles, such as more butchers, bakers, fishmongers, the supermarket said. Morrisons said the new roles will be a mixture of part and full time posts, but declined to reveal how the numbers will be split. Managers will be able to move to the new jobs, with the firm saying there will be roles ""for everybody who wants to continue to work at Morrisons"". David Lepley, Morrisons group retail director, said: ""Whilst there will be a short period of uncertainty for some managers affected by these proposals we will be supporting them through this process. ""There will also be more roles with greater flexibility that are very attractive to colleagues with families."" The company says those in managerial jobs who want to remain working at Morrisons can stay. However, their new offer will be at the shop floor level. Front-line store staff at Morrisons earn Â£9 an hour. News of the restructuring was first reported byRetail Week,external. The big four supermarkets are all making changes to try to stem the flow of shoppers switching allegiance to discount stores. They are all hoping to save money on staffing costs in order to be able to offer bigger discounts to shoppers in store. Within the past year Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have all announced significant job cuts at management level. However, unlike Tesco's job cuts at this point last year, Morrisons are putting more new shop floor workers behind specialist counters. Rather than cutting deli counters, Morrisons are keen for their Market Street sections to help them stand out against the other big players in the supermarket wars. All affected stores will have a 45-day consultation period, with the cuts beginning in March. The manager jobs at risk include in-store posts, and not office roles, the company said. Jobs such as in-store beer, wine and spirits managers will be combined with other jobs. Morrisons is not the only supermarket to be cutting management posts. All the big four UK supermarket chains are battling to retain market share amid fierce competition, particularly from discount chains Aldi and Lidl. Earlier this week,Sainsbury's said it was shedding hundreds of managers at its head office,but did not confirm the number. Sainsbury's said the cuts were being made due to the integration of Argos, which it bought in 2016. Asda has reportedly begun consultations with more than 2,800 staff over cutbacks. Reports say those working in administrative, cash office and personnel roles have been told their jobs are at risk.

"More than half a million Muslims are still believed to live in Myanmar's Rakhine state The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ordered measures to prevent the genocide of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar (formerly Burma). The decision comes despite de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi defending her country against the accusations in person last month. Thousands of Rohingya died and more than 700,000 fled to Bangladesh during an army crackdown in 2017. UN investigators have warned that genocidal actions could recur. The ICJ case, lodged by the African Muslim-majority nation of The Gambia, called for emergency measures to be taken against the Myanmar military until a fuller investigation could be launched. The man who took Aung San Suu Kyi to the world court Myanmar Rohingya: What you need to know The Lady who fell from grace Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist state, has always insisted that its military campaign was waged to tackle an extremist threat in Rakhine state. In her defence statement at the court in The Hague, Ms Suu Kyi described the violence as an ""internal armed conflict"" triggered by Rohingya militant attacks on government security posts. This video can not be played How did this peace icon end up at a genocide trial? The panel of 17 judges at the ICJ on Thursday voted unanimouslyto order Myanmar to take ""all measures within its power"" to prevent genocide,external, which they said the Rohingya remained at serious risk of. These include the prevention of killing, and ""causing serious bodily or mental harm"" to members of the group, as well as preserving evidence of possible genocide that has already occurred. Will Omar get justice for his murdered family? Villages destroyed for government facilities What awaits refugees who return? Presiding judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf said Myanmar should report back within four months on how it was implementing the ruling. The measures are binding and not subject to appeal, but the court has no means of enforcing them. This video can not be played Rohingya refugee: ""They killed my family in front of me"" By Nick Beake, Myanmar correspondent, BBC News This judgment has surely obliterated any remnants of Aung San Suu Kyi's international reputation. Remember, she didn't have to go to The Hague and become the embodiment of Myanmar's defence. She chose to argue, in person, there was no mass murder, rape or arson. Even her biggest critics used to acknowledge she doesn't control the still powerful Burmese army, but now she has destroyed the firewall between her and the generals by trying - and failing - to justify their actions. So far, Myanmar has played by the rules of the International Court of Justice. But will it abide by these emergency measures? Writing today in a British newspaper, Aung San Suu Kyi questioned whether the international justice system was capable of ignoring ""unsubstantiated narratives"" told by human rights groups and UN investigators against her country. So, after initially engaging with the UN's top court, will a defeated Aung San Suu Kyi retreat now into isolation? During hearings at the court in December, Ms Suu Kyi asked the ICJ to drop the case, describing it as ""incomplete and incorrect"". And in an article for the Financial Times published shortly before the court's judgement she said human rights groups had condemned Myanmar based on ""unproven statements without the due process of criminal investigation"". This video can not be played The BBC saw the remains of burned villages on a tightly controlled government trip to Rakhine state ""The international condemnation has had a negative effect on Myanmar's endeavours to bring stability and progress to Rakhine,"" she said. ""It has undermined painstaking domestic efforts to establish co-operation between the military and the civilian government."" Her remarks also appeared to echo a statement by a government-appointed panel earlier this week which accepted that war crimes may have been committed by individuals but said there was no indication of an intent to commit genocide. However, the BBC's Anna Holligan, who is in The Hague, says that by coming to the court in December, Ms Suu Kyi had in effect recognised its legitimacy and it will now be difficult for Myanmar to ignore its judgement. Rohingya groups have welcomed the decision. ""Today's ruling by the ICJ is a crucial moment for Rohingya justice, and vindication for those of us who have lived through this genocide for decades,"" tweeted Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK. ""The court's decision clearly shows that it takes the allegations of genocide seriously, and that Myanmar's hollow attempts to deny these have fallen on deaf ears."" Human rights organisation Amnesty International said the decision sent a message that the world would not tolerate Myanmar's ""atrocities"". Gambian Justice Minister Abubacarr Tambadou, who led the prosecution, said he was ""very, very pleased"". ""I think this represents a triumph of international law and international justice. And it is the international community - as represented by the ICJ - saying in the strongest of terms that genocide will not be accepted under any circumstances by any perpetrators,"" he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. But some Burmese people responding to a BBC Facebook live broadcast were scathing of the court and its judges. ""This is not a fair and just ruling. I would like to speak on behalf of the Myanmar people that those judges are blind. They are deaf. They do not know the real situation in the country,"" said Nu Yimwin. Kyaw Myint Oo described the ruling as a tragic day for the country: ""Our situation is like being a prey gradually strangled by a python and eventually we will be forced to give in to all their demands."" Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said: ""We hope good sense will prevail in Myanmar and they will take back all the Rohingya refugees and provide them security."" The Rohingya, who numbered around one million in Myanmar at the start of 2017, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the country. Rohingya Muslims are the largest community of Muslims in Myanmar, with the majority living in Rakhine state. But Myanmar's government denies them citizenship, refusing to recognise them as a people and seeing them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Waves of Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh over the decades but their latest exodus began on 25 August 2017 after militants from a Rohingya insurgent group called Arsa launched deadly attacks on more than 30 police posts. Rohingyas arriving in Bangladesh said they fled after troops, backed by local Buddhist mobs, responded by burning their villages and attacking and killing civilians. The government claims that ""clearance operations"" against the militants ended on 5 September 2017, but analysis of satellite imagery by Human Rights Watch suggests hundreds of villages were destroyed after August that year.

"Only about one in 14 crimes reported to police lead to a suspect being charged, official statistics have shown. Covering the year up to September 2019, the Home Office figures for England and Wales mark a new low, having fallen from about one in seven in 2015. It comes as knife crime recorded by police rose by 7% to an all-time high and robberies increased by 12%. But homicides - including murder and manslaughter - fell by 6% to 617 deaths, and fatal stabbings fell 20%. The crimes least likely to be solved Knife possession offences reach record high âWe stitch their stab wounds and then we save themâ The key facts about rising knife crime The proportion of crimes leading to a prosecution in England and Wales has been in continuous decline since 2015, when the figures were first compiled this way. Between September 2015 and September 2018, it had fallen from 14% to 8.4%, and it has now dropped again to 7.3% - about one in 14 cases. In addition, 1.4% of crimes led to a caution, 2.3% led to an informal warning and 0.1% were ""taken into consideration"" - meaning an offender admitted them as part of another investigation. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said the fall in prosecutions was ""extremely concerning"". ""The public need to have confidence that the criminal justice system is finding, prosecuting and convicting criminals - so it is a serious problem that fewer crimes are being solved or dealt with,"" she said. She said MPs had previously warned that police forces were ""badly overstretched"" and that without additional funding, there would be ""serious consequences for public safety"". Rape had the lowest rate of charges at just 1.4%, while for thefts it was 5.4% and for robberies it was 7.2%. The slump in the charging rate is arguably the most worrying feature of these latest statistics. It means 13 out of every 14 crimes are not being solved - offenders are still at large and able to commit further offences, fuelling the steady rise in crimes such as robbery. There are some tentative signs that the rate of decline may be slowing - it was down only one-tenth of a percentage point in the last three months - and extra government investment in policing and the Crown Prosecution Service will undoubtedly help. But low detection levels dent public confidence in police and the criminal justice system, creating a damaging vicious circle in which people are less likely to co-operate with investigations - because they don't believe anything will happen. Cases where the victim does not support criminal proceedings have risen sharply over five years, from 8.7% to 22.9%. In 43.4% of cases, no suspect could be identified. It comes as separate crime figures show that police recorded 44,771 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument in the year to September 2019 - an increase of 7% to a new record high. Helen Ross, from the Office for National Statistics' Centre for Crime and Justice, said there is a ""mixed picture"" across the country for knife crime and ""overall levels of violence remain steady"". ""We have also seen the number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was used decrease by a fifth, driven by falls in London,"" she said. The ONS said that although improvements in the way crime was recorded may have contributed to the 12% rise in robberies, to a total of 82,542 offences, some of the increase is ""likely to reflect a real change"". The crime figures exclude Greater Manchester, due to technical issues with recording the data. The Crime Survey for England and Wales - which is considered better for judging long-term trends - suggests that overall crime rates are broadly stable. But the survey shows that fraud rose by 9%, driven by a rise in bank and credit account fraud.

"The UK is monitoring flights arriving from China as a precautionary measure There is an ""increased likelihood"" of cases of the new coronavirus occurring in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Globally, there are more than 500 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 18 people in China. But there are no known cases in the UK, Mr Hancock said, which was ""well prepared"" to deal with an outbreak. Fourteen people in the UK have now been tested for the virus, Public Health England said. Five of them have tested negative for the virus, while nine are still awaiting results. Earlier, it emerged six people were being tested in hospitals in Scotland and Northern Ireland after showing symptoms. All the patients had been in Wuhan - the Chinese city where the new strain of the virus, which can cause lung disease such as pneumonia, first emerged - in the last 14 days. One man is being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast- he is thought to have been admitted with a high temperature. Add the Scottish government confirmed there werefive suspected cases in Scotland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the tests were ""purely precautionary"". It is likely to be several days before tests will confirm whether they have contracted coronavirus or not. China battles to prevent New Year virus spike How worried should we be? Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Wuhan - which has a population of 11 million people - has gone into lockdown, with authorities suspending planes and trains in and out of the city. The UK is monitoring flights arriving from China as a precaution. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hancock said that it was a ""rapidly developing situation and the number of deaths and the number of cases is likely to be higher than those that have been confirmed so far and I expect them to rise further"". He told MPs: ""The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from 'very low' to 'low' and has concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well prepared and well equipped to deal with them."" He added: ""The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus. ""The NHS is ready to respond appropriately to any cases that emerge."" This video can not be played British passenger Thomas Crosby describes journey from virus-hit Wuhan In response to the outbreak, the Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan. On Wednesday, Public Health England began carrying out enhanced monitoring of direct flights from China. Passengers are receiving advice on what to do if they fall ill, which Mr Hancock said was the most important part of the monitoring as it can take days after infection before a patient develops symptoms, so physical checks were considered less useful. He added: ""We are working closely with our counterparts in the devolved administrations and the public can be assured that the whole of the UK is always well prepared for these types of outbreaks.

"This video can not be played Ms Dos Santos has denied allegations that she built her fortune by exploiting her country Africa's richest woman, Isabel dos Santos, has been accused of embezzlement and money laundering by prosecutors in Angola. Attorney General Helder Pitta Gros said the allegations related to her time as chairwoman of state oil firm Sonangol. He called on Ms Dos Santos to return to Angola and face potential criminal charges. Ms Dos Santos recently denied alleged corruption revealed by leaked documents. Africa's richest woman 'ripped off her country' Isabel dos Santos eyes Angolan presidency The billionaire, who currently lives in the UK, also told the BBC she was considering running for Angola's presidency. Her father, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, was Angola's president for 38 years before he stepped down in 2017. Separately, another suspect in the case who managed Sonangol's account at the small Portuguese bank EuroBic, was found dead at his house in Lisbon on Wednesday, Portuguese media said quoting a police source. The source said ""everything"" suggested that the death of Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha was suicide. Prosecutors are seeking to recover $1bn (Â£760m) that Ms Dos Santos and her associates are alleged to owe the state. ""Isabel dos Santos is accused of mismanagement and embezzlement of funds during her tenure at Sonangol,"" Mr Pitta Gros told a news conference on Wednesday evening. He said that as a result she was being provisionally charged with ""money laundering, influence peddling, harmful management...[and] forgery of documents, among other economic crimes"". The Angolan authorities will now conduct a criminal investigation to determine whether she should be formally charged. They have also named five other people as suspects in the case, one of whom was Mr Ribeiro da Cunha, and urged them to return to Angola. Mr Pitta Gros said that if Ms Dos Santos did not return to Angola voluntarily, an international arrest warrant would be issued for her. Ms Dos Santos was controversially appointed head of Sonangol in June 2016 by her father. She was sacked from the post in 2017 by her father's successor, President Joao LourenÃ§o. An investigation into Ms Dos Santos was opened after her successor at Sonangol, Carlos Saturnino, alerted authorities to alleged irregular money transfers. Her assets in Angola have been frozen. On Sunday, the BBC and other news organisations reported on more than 700,000 leaked documents about the billionaire's business empire. The documents showed how Ms Dos Santos got access to lucrative land, oil, diamond and telecoms deals when her father was president. Her fortune is estimated at $2.1 bn (Â£1.6bn). They also showed how Western firms helped Ms Dos Santos take her money out of Angola. She called the allegations entirely false and claimed that the Angolan government was engaged in a politically motivated witch-hunt. Earlier this weeka top executive at financial services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers left the firm over its links with Ms Dos Santos. The company declined to comment on the departure and said it had launched its own investigation. On WednesdayEuroBic said it would end its business relationship with Ms Dos Santos, who is reportedly the bank's main shareholder through two companies she owns. It was later reported as saying that Ms Dos Santos was selling her capital stake in the bank. The bank added that it would investigate transfers worth tens of millions of dollars she had made.Some of the transfers drained Sonangol's account at EuroBic,external, the New York Times reports.

"This video can not be played Schiff: 'The facts are damning' US Democrats have ruled out a ""witness swap"" with Republicans in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Lawmakers who are seeking to remove the president from office hope to hear testimony from his former National Security Adviser John Bolton. But Democrats refused any deal to allow the son of former US Vice-President Joe Biden to be called as a witness. Mr Trump is accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He strongly denies any wrongdoing. House Democrats have up to three days to make their case as they present their arguments in the impeachment trial in the Senate. Mr Trump's defence team will have three days after that for a rebuttal. Democrats accuse the president of using US military aid as a bargaining chip in an attempt to prod Ukraine into announcing an investigation to discredit his would-be Democratic White House challenger, Mr Biden. 'No crime, no impeachment' - is that true? Trump impeachment trial: All you need to know Mr Trump has been touting corruption claims against Mr Biden, whose son Hunter held a lucrative board position with a Ukrainian gas firm while his father was US vice-president and in charge of American-Ukrainian relations. Attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Mr Trump jokingly warned he might confront Democrats by coming to ""sit right in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces"". The impeachment trial could end next week, but Mr Trump's fellow Republicans control the chamber and are unlikely to oust him. This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What happened on day one? There was one thing in particular that President Trump said which was kind of like a red rag to a bull. It's when he said basically: ""Well things are going very well, we have all the information, and they [Democrats] have none of it."" Well, if you want a fair trial, then maybe that information should be made available. We keep using the word ""trial"", and the words ""jurors"" and ""witnesses"" and ""evidence"", but we must not lose sight that this is a political process. We saw that clearly last night when the first votes started coming in. In a vote that split completely along party lines, 53 Republicans said ""no we should not be able to subpoena the White House for documents"", while 47 Democrats said ""yes we should"". So we have Donald Trump kind of goading and saying: ""Look I've got the information. We know what happened, but we're not going to tell you."" I think this might inflame public opinion. Polls are already indicating that a clear majority believe that evidence should be handed over and witnesses should be called. Democrats want to call Mr Bolton, who referred to the White House's alleged political pressure on Ukraine as a ""drug deal"", according to previous witness testimony in the House of Representatives. But the former national security adviser has said he will not consider testifying unless served with a legal summons known as a subpoena. Mr Trump's Republican allies have argued Hunter Biden should also be ordered to appear before the impeachment trial. But Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, told reporters during a break in the trial on Wednesday: ""That trade is not on the table."" This video can not be played Trump impeachment trial: Five possible twists ahead Joe Biden said on Wednesday in Osage, Iowa, where he is campaigning for the White House that he would not offer himself up in any witness trade. ""We're not going to turn it into a farce or political theatre,"" Mr Biden said. ""I want no part of that."" Defending his son, Mr Biden added: ""There's nobody that's indicated there's a single solitary thing he did that was inappropriate or wrong - other than the appearance. It looked bad that he was there."" Mr Biden said last year that if elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation. The Trump impeachment story explained Trump impeachment - your questions answered This video can not be played A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump On Wednesday, the lead Democratic prosecutor, California congressman Adam Schiff, criticised President Trump's dealings with Ukraine as ""worse than crazy"". ""It's repulsive, it's repugnant. It breaks our word. And to do it in the name of these corrupt investigations is also contrary to everything we espouse around the world,"" he said. Mr Schiff, who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urged Republicans to vote to remove Mr Trump from office to ""protect our democracy"". He warned that senators would ""also undermine our global standing"" if they do not oust the president. This video can not be played What's Ukraine got to do with the Trump impeachment? The first day of the trial dragged on till the early hours of Wednesday morning as the senators debated a flurry of incremental motions. Much of the evidence being laid out is a rehash of testimony already presented exhaustively in the House of Representatives, which voted to impeach Mr Trump last month. Under arcane rules, senators are forbidden to drink coffee on the chamber floor and are only allowed water and milk. A number of senators, mostly Republicans, were seen to be absent from the chamber during Mr Schiff's presentation. Also, several members were spotted dozing during the proceedings.

"People should cut the amount of beef, lamb and dairy produce they eat by a fifth to combat climate change, a report says. It says public bodies should lead the way by offering plant-based options with all meals. But it says if people donât cut consumption willingly, taxes on meat and dairy might be needed. The report comes from the governmentâs official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). Its chief executive Chris Stark told BBC News: âWe can't meet the government's 2050 Net Zero target without major changes in the way we use the land, the way we farm, and what we eat.â The farming union NFU welcomed much of the report, although they oppose cuts in livestock - but some environmentalists believe it's too timid. What's your diet's carbon footprint?,external Food 'made from air' could compete with soya Plant-based diet can fight climate change - UN Is meat too hot for politicians? 'Greening' the countryside The document recommends a host of measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the countryside. Others include increasing UK forestry cover from 13% to at least 17% by 2050, and restoring at least half of upland peat bogs. But itâs the proposals for reducing consumption of dairy produce and red meat that are likely to draw attention. The authors say reducing the amount of beef, lamb and dairy we eat by at least 20%, and reducing food waste by 20% would save the equivalent of seven million tonnes of CO2 from farms. They say land thatâs no longer needed for cattle and sheep could support trees crops to burn for energy. Fewer sheep and cows expected The authors anticipate around a 10% drop in cattle and sheep numbers by 2050 against 2017 levels. They say there's already been a reduction of around 20% in the past two decades. Some upland farmers argue that on thin soils, the only productive use of the land is for livestock. Minette Batters, NFU President said: ""Plant-based products do not always necessarily have a lower impact on the environment. ""Of British land, 65% is only suitable for grazing livestock and we have the right climate to produce high quality red meat and dairy. Therefore it makes sense that, when talking about environmental impact, the public continues to support British livestock production."" The report says: âGrasslands can have a positive impact on soil quality (by storing carbon in the soil) but grassland cannot continuously increase its carbon store. âThis means grassland cannot be used continually to offset methane emissions from livestock.â The broad-ranging document also says farmers must use fertilisers more intelligently. They should deal with animal manure better, and reduce food waste. Peatland burning 'should be banned' The report urges a ban on regular burning on peatland, and a ban on peat extraction. Controversially, the committee recommends expanding crops grown to be burned for energy to around 23,000 hectares each year. This is resisted by food charities such as the Sustain Alliance. Its spokesperson Vicki Hird said: âThe emphasis on energy crops to feed power plants is dangerous â it could damage biodiversity and ecosystems as well as our food security.â New forests could be funded by aviation levies The Committee says land use â thatâs farms, forests and peatland â accounted for 12% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. But by 2050, it says, farmers and land-managers must reduce these emissions by almost two thirds for the UK to meet its targets. New forests, it urges, should be funded by a levy on greenhouse gas-emitting industries such as aviation. Increasing forestry, the report says, will provide woods for recreation, clean the air, filter water and capture flood waters on the land. The re-wilding campaigner George Monbiot said the report contained âfeeble half-measuresâ. He said: ""The level of ambition is in no way matched to the scale of our climate and ecological emergencies. ""People in the UK are already reducing their red meat consumption. ""A 10% reduction in cattle and sheep numbers by 2050 is likely to be much smaller than the shift that's going to happen anyway, without the help of the measures the committee proposes.""

"This video can not be played Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital has had its busiest month on record, with 7,409 patients attending its A&E unit Waiting times for A&E departments in Wales hit their worst levels in December, with only 72.1% of patients waiting less than four hours. The target is for 95% of patients to be seen in that time - but that target has never been met. Figures published on Thursday also show a record number of patients waited more than 12 hours. Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething has announced an additional Â£10m to help tackle the pressures. That is on top of Â£30m already provided this winter to improve the flow of patients out of hospital and into the community. The Welsh Ambulance Service also missed its target for responding to red - immediately life-threatening - calls for a second month. Emergency departments saw the highest number of attendances over the period, with spikes in demand on some days. The December figures showed only 72.1% waited less than four hours in A&E to be treated, transferred or discharged, compared to the target of 95% This is down from 74.4% in November and significantly worse than December 2018 (77.8%) There were 6,656 patients waiting more than 12 hours - a record high. The target is that no-one should wait that long The ambulance service failed to meet its target for responding to immediately life threatening calls for the second time since the target was introduced in 2015 In December the ambulance service responded to 62% of red calls within eight minutes - the target is 65% The ambulance service had a 23% rise in red calls and an 8.4% increase in amber calls compared to last winter. It received more than 100 red calls on eight out of these 17 days, peaking at 119 calls on 20 December. Its performance was a slight improvement on November's figure of 61.4% - but significantly worse than the same time last winter. A&E record low performance as ambulance service struggles Fines considered to tackle ambulance transfer delays Winter pressures at hospitals 'exceptional' Ambulances on amber calls 'getting to sickest first' Long ambulance wait for dementia patient near hospital Winter tends to bring more complex conditions and circulating illnesses which affect older people more seriously. That is reflected in figures which show - despite milder weather - an 8.4% rise in A&E attendances over the Christmas and New Year period for the over 75s compared to last year. There was also a 5.2% increase in emergency admissions to hospital of patients aged over 75 when compared with 2018-19. The Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport has had a record month The Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport has had its busiest month on record, with 7,409 patients attending its A&E unit. That's an 8.3% rise on last December. Its waiting times performance has also suffered - with only 53% of patients seen within the four hour target. There were also 852 patients who waited more than 12 hours. Paul Mizen, director of urgent care, said it was a ""daily challenge"" which could be very stressful for staff. The hospital has opened up extra beds, put a pharmacist inside the emergency department and a member of staff co-ordinates the discharging of patients to improve the flow. But Dr Mizen admitted sometimes patients had to be treated in chairs rather than beds ""and that's a regret"". ""The system is coping but there are times when it's very, very tight,"" he said. Senior nurse Natalie Skyrme said: ""Staff have risen to the challenge. It's not always done in places but we're doing our best. ""It's better to treat them in a chair than not at all. ""Boxing Day was an exceptionally bad day but I suppose it feels like you're in a place where you have no control - but you're trying to deal with what's in front of you,"" she said. Jan Newman brought a friend in after a fall Jan Newman brought her friend Gwyneira into Newport by taxi after she suffered a fall in her bedroom and needed a series of tests. They had been referred from hospital in Ystrad Mynach and said they had a ""feeling of dread,"" knowing the wait they faced. She said the Royal Gwent was ""bursting at the seams"". ""They're constantly stressed and rushed - and the fact we couldn't find a chair in the waiting room to sit down on [when we arrived], it's stress all round."" The money announced on Thursday by Mr Gething is on top of Â£30m worth of funds announced in the autumn. ""There has been a welcome reduction in delayed transfers of care but too many patients are spending long periods in emergency departments waiting for a hospital bed,"" he said. ""We want health boards to work with partners to improve the flow of patients through the hospital system and out into the community, and I have made an extra Â£10m available to support improvement in this area."" One consultant at Morriston Hospital in Swansea told BBC Wales earlier this month there had been 125 medically fit patients in beds who were unable to leave until social care was available. Jo Mower, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Wales said the figures came despite A&E staff ""working tirelessly"" to provide care in the face of reduced capacity. ""We need to assess ongoing health and social care needs both in hospitals and in the community,"" she said. ""Without adequate health and social care resources and the consequential effect upon the unscheduled care system this will inevitably result in emergency department crowding which has in turn resulted in an increase in patients waiting outside the emergency department."" There are also record numbers waiting more than 12 hours Dr David Bailey of the BMA in Wales added: ""The whole system is under strain like never before and a whole system approach is needed to tackle it. ""We've received countless examples from our GP members across the country of unacceptable delays in handing over seriously unwell patients to onward care, particularly when emergencies occur on GP premises. ""Beds in hospitals are blocked by patients who can't be moved on to social care, due to a lack of resources."" The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health boards, said work had started to transform services, including working closely with local government. ""This is the right path to take, but we need to deliver this change at pace and scale for the benefit of everyone in Wales,"" said a spokesman. Mr Gething said it was a ""difficult challenge but not unfixable"" but he was against a ""big bang reorganisation"" to move social care out of local government and into the health service. He also said he would soon consider a possible change in the waiting time measures - also being considered in England - on advice from senior consultants. ""It's not simply about junking measures we don't like, it's about what would be the right set of measures to have that clinicians themselves agree would make a difference,"" he said. ""[They would] tell you and the wider public something useful about the quality of care as well as the volume of care and how timely that care is being provided."" Plaid Cymru said the explanation from the minister about the latest figures was ""not good enough"" and the performance was consistently worse than in England. Health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Every year, we get a different excuse as to why this time the poor performance is 'unprecedented' or 'extraordinary'. The excuses change, the deterioration in performance doesn't"". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds added: ""It is vital that the Welsh Government urgently gets to grips with A&E waiting times so we can improve patient safety, increase staff retention and give patients the quality treatment they deserve."" Conservative health spokeswoman Angela Burns said staff were being let down and called the figures disturbing. ""The health minister must announce - today - what remedial action he is going to take, and a definite timeframe in which to deliver it,"" she added. In the bigger scheme of things, Â£10m is a drop in the ocean compared to the Â£8bn entire budget of NHS Wales. But the Welsh Government will hope that by injecting this cash now, on top of the cash pledged earlier, they might be able to stop the slump in performance seen over the past four months. The NHS will also get a significant cash injection to its budget in the next financial year. But it's struggling now. The health minister insists demand this winter has been exceptional - despite it being relatively mild - with a big rise in the most serious red ambulance calls, for example. But opposition parties argue Mr Gething can't use this as an excuse. They say the blame for long A&E waits and worsening ambulance response times lie squarely at his door, even though targets have been missed across the UK this winter.Â Fines considered to speed up A&E handovers 'Exceptional' winter pressures at hospitals A&E record low as ambulance service struggles Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Teesside has been struck by an earthquake of 3.0 magnitude which woke people up and caused homes to shake. The tremor was felt across Stockton, Billingham, Hartlepool, Wolviston and Middlesbrough just before 06:00 GMT. People posted on social media to say they heard a rumbling or felt their houses shake. Emergency services said they received calls but there were no reports of damage. The website Earthquake Track said it was six miles (10km) beneath Stockton. The tremor was felt just before 06:00 GMT Cleveland Police said it had received about 15 reports of the earthquake, with officers called out to several different areas. The force said no-one was injured. Read more: How many quakes happen in the UK? The magnitude of the earthquake was first estimated as 2.8 by the United States Geological Survey but raised to 3.0 by the British Geological Survey following local analysis. Seismologist Glen Ford described it as a ""typical British earthquake"" - strong enough to knock over ornaments, but of the kind you would expect to see three times a year. ""The UK is criss-crossed with many old tectonic plates, you get the stresses built up on them and these small earthquakes get released,"" he said. ""There are about 200 a year actually but only about 10% of them are felt by the general public so that's why when they happen they really startle people. ""This one occurred just under a heavily-populated area so many thousands of people felt it. ""In world terms it's absolutely tiny, but with its timing... people were just starting to come awake so it's rather alarming - gets them out of bed quite early."" Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe said he pushed the PM to be ""brave"" in regards to Iran The husband of a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran said there has been ""no breakthrough"" in efforts to secure her release after talks with Boris Johnson. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife was being used as a ""chess piece"" in foreign policy and urged the government to be ""tougher"" with Tehran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained for almost four years over spying allegations she denies. Her five-year-old daughter was also at the meeting at No 10 on Thursday. Mr Johnson has previously said he would leave ""no stone unturned"" to help free her. Mr Ratcliffe last met the prime minister when he was foreign secretary in 2017. That meeting came shortly after Mr Johnson had to apologise after wrongly suggesting that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists at the time of her arrest. She has always maintained she was in Iran visiting relatives. What is the Zaghari-Radcliffe case about? Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter returns to UK Concern for Briton jailed in Iran as tensions rise Thursday's meeting followedthe US killing of Iran's top military leader Qasem Soleimani. Holding the hand of his daughter, Gabriella, outside No 10, Mr Ratcliffe said he urged the prime minister to be ""brave"" in his dealings with Iran - and that relations between two countries must improve. Gabriella was given a toy version of Larry the Downing Street cat during her visit to No 10 Mr Johnson is ""personally committed"" to her case, he said, and was ""touched"" when he gave him a wallet that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had made in prison. But Mr Ratcliffe added that ""sympathy isn't enough"" and that the prime minister did not apologise for the mistake he made as foreign secretary. ""I don't stand here hopeful, if I'm honest. I stand here with my wife still in prison and things aren't moving,"" he said. ""I will think carefully about what I tell her on the phone on Saturday."" He has previously raised concerns that the recent escalation in tensions could make matters worse for his wife. Before her arrest Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe lived in London with accountant Mr Ratcliffe Ahead of the meeting, which the foreign secretary also attended, the prime minister's spokesman said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's continued detention was ""inhumane and unacceptable"" and the UK continued to ""take every opportunity"" to raise her case with the Iranian government. It comes as the Court of Appeal in London prepares to hear a case that could resolve a decade-long financial dispute between the UK and Iran. The dispute is over the interest due on a debt owed by Britain to Tehran for an arms deal in the 1970s that was never fulfilled. Mr Ratcliffe said he was told at the meeting that the government is trying to resolve ""other issues"" but that they are ""complicated"". Speaking in the Commons, the couple's MP, Labour's Tulip Siddiq, urged the government to settle the debt with Iran, accusing it of ""unforgiveable"" behaviour. However, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the issue was ""extraordinarily difficult"" because the government could not be seen to be paying money to allow the release of people who had been illegally detained. ""The risk that would cause to other Britons travelling abroad would be very considerable,"" he said. This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) ""The law must take its course in relation to the money that was deposited here but it would be absolutely wrong to connect the two issues."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, remains on medication for depression and on beta blockers - medicines which slow down the heart - for the panic attacks she's been suffering in jail,her husband said. The dual national has been detained since 2016, when she took her British-born daughter Gabriella to Iran to visit her parents. She was sentenced to five years in prison for spying. Her family and the UK government has always maintained her innocence and she has beengiven diplomatic protectionby the Foreign Office - meaning the case is treated as a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran. While he was foreign secretary, Mr Johnson mistakenly said that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran training journalists when she was arrested. Four days later Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to an unscheduled court hearing during which Mr Johnson's comments were cited as proof she was engaged in ""propaganda against the regime"".

"Teesside has been struck by an earthquake of 3.0 magnitude which woke people up and caused homes to shake. The tremor was felt across Stockton, Billingham, Hartlepool, Wolviston and Middlesbrough just before 06:00 GMT. People posted on social media to say they heard a rumbling or felt their houses shake. Emergency services said they received calls but there were no reports of damage. The website Earthquake Track said it was six miles (10km) beneath Stockton. The tremor was felt just before 06:00 GMT Cleveland Police said it had received about 15 reports of the earthquake, with officers called out to several different areas. The force said no-one was injured. Read more: How many quakes happen in the UK? The magnitude of the earthquake was first estimated as 2.8 by the United States Geological Survey but raised to 3.0 by the British Geological Survey following local analysis. Seismologist Glen Ford described it as a ""typical British earthquake"" - strong enough to knock over ornaments, but of the kind you would expect to see three times a year. ""The UK is criss-crossed with many old tectonic plates, you get the stresses built up on them and these small earthquakes get released,"" he said. ""There are about 200 a year actually but only about 10% of them are felt by the general public so that's why when they happen they really startle people. ""This one occurred just under a heavily-populated area so many thousands of people felt it. ""In world terms it's absolutely tiny, but with its timing... people were just starting to come awake so it's rather alarming - gets them out of bed quite early."" Allow Twitter content?

" The country with an ambitious plan  By Gabriel Gatehouse When a small village in Finland took the country’s biggest peat producer to court over a polluted river, it didn’t expect to win. But it had a secret weapon - a local fisherman-turned-scientist whose work on climate change would help push his country’s government to adopt one of the toughest targets for reducing carbon emissions anywhere in the world. Finland has pledged to be carbon-neutral by 2035 - that’s twice as fast as the UK government target. But to achieve this, it will have to make big changes, particularly in the peat industry, which currently provides energy, heating and jobs. Can the Finns turn an ambitious plan into reality?       Tero Mustonen is mending nets when we arrive at his house one morning, in the village of Selkie near the Russian border. “When I was very young, we could witness far more clean waters,” he says. “The lake was a certain depth and doing well. There were good fish stocks.” Tero has played a key role in Finland’s environmental story since 2010. One day, he and other local fishermen spotted dead fish floating on the surface of the water. “There was a massive discharge of acidic waters here in Selkie that killed all the fish in our river,” he tells me nearly a decade later, sitting in his 18th Century log house on the edge of the forest. The “acidic discharge” had come from a nearby peat field. When Tero saw the dead fish he immediately alerted Vapo, the peat extraction company that ran the site. The firm told him it had been caused by leaves falling into the river. But Tero knew that wasn’t right. And the dead fish were only a small part of a much bigger problem. So Tero and his village did something no-one had ever done before. They took Vapo, the state-controlled peat company, to court. They argued that the acidic waters were a result of the company’s activities. And they won.       Peat is formed of decayed vegetation. When dried it can be burned like a fossil fuel. In Finland, peat provides around 4% of the nation’s electricity, and 15% of heating. As a power source, peat is dirtier than coal. And it gets worse. Even after the peat has been extracted and burned, drained peatlands continue to emit previously locked-in, centuries-old greenhouse gases. Environmentalists say a failure by Finland to cut its reliance on peat could make its target of having a carbon footprint of net zero by 2035 - set by the country’s new coalition government last year - hard to achieve. “This became the first area where [Vapo] had to retreat and start the restoration,” he explains, as we pick our way over what was once a peat bog. Now it looks more like a brown and black moonscape. “When these were degraded by human land use, they turned into releasing places for carbon.” Tero and his colleagues have now taken over the restoration work. A digger is building a bank around the site. Soon they will flood it with water.        “Some of those emissions will stop immediately,” he says. “But then of course we will have to wait on those natural cycles for the plants to come back.” It’s a process called rewilding - returning a patch of land to its natural state, allowing biodiversity to flourish once again. Here’s the extraordinary thing about peatlands - when burned or dried out, theyrelease greenhouse gases. In their natural state however, they do the opposite. They are what’s known as carbon sinks - natural sites that trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and lock it back into the soil. “The existing marshmires, bogs and peatlands are defined by the UN as highly critical for [the] survival of humankind because they are helping with climate change through natural processes.”       Tero Mustonen is mending nets when we arrive at his house one morning, in the village of Selkie near the Russian border. “When I was very young, we could witness far more clean waters,” he says. “The lake was a certain depth and doing well.

He’s one of the lead authors on reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the IPCC) - that’s the UN body that evaluates the latest science in this area. After he won his local battle against Vapo, he had an idea. What if this small project on the outskirts of his village was a model that could be replicated more widely and help reduce carbon emissions on a vast scale? Boreal wetlands and marshmires extend around the planet’s higher latitudes - from Scandinavia through northern Russia and across the Pacific into Canada.    Tero Mustonen     “In Finland we have a massive potential for restoration of peatlands and bogs and marshmires into carbon sinks that are currently degraded. “We can bring them back into health and create more sites that trap carbon.” But despite Tero’s efforts, and the Finnish government’s pledge to go carbon-neutral by 2035, Finland is still issuing licences for the extraction of peat at other sites across the country. Even with the greenest of intentions, the Finns are discovering how stubborn the politics of fossil fuels can be.       It’s hunting season. In the village of Selkie, men gather before the dawn. Soon, the first big snowfalls will come. Today is perhaps the hunters’ last chance to catch enough moose to feed the whole community at the annual feast to mark the start of winter. Tero, who is also head of the village, introduces us to a group of men dressed in bright orange high-vis vests. They make some last-minute preparations: rifles are checked and the dogs are given collars fitted with GPS trackers. Then the hunters are divided into teams. The dog handlers drive off into the woods, but  the rest retreat to a circular wooden hut, where they will sit around a blazing log fire and wait. The hunt has begun. In these northern villages this is a tradition as old as human habitation itself. But technology is changing things. In the past, they’d all be in the woods, tracking the moose on foot. Now the majority sit by the warmth of the fire, checking an app on their smartphones. They’ll go out only when the time is right.   Tracking moose on a mobile phone    “Even though technology is giving assistance to the hunt, we still need traditional knowledge,” says Tero. “There are days when no animals are caught.” That traditional knowledge includes recognising animal tracks and droppings, and an understanding of the likely movements of the moose according to the weather and the season. And here, too, things are changing. Everyone around the fire has noticed the snows are coming later. “We now have Helsinki-style winters all the way up here on the 62nd parallel, which is 400km (250 miles) north,” says Markku Eskelinen, the leader of the hunt. “In one way, it has made the dynamics of the hunt easier,” he adds. A lack of snow certainly makes it easier to track through the forest. But the changes in the weather are having a mixed effect on agriculture. For Kyosti Siltala, a lawyer who also runs a small farm and forestry business, the warmer climate means his trees are growing faster, which can mean bigger profits from logging. But he’s also noticed new species and new diseases. “The whole of nature is changing,” he says. “It’s very difficult to see where we are heading and I’m personally very worried about it.” I look around the hut at the faces, young and old, lit by the flickering fire. “Is anyone not worried about climate change?” I ask. Silence. Here in the rural villages, plans to make Finland carbon-neutral in just 15 years’ time have generated a mixture of hope and trepidation. Yes, they worry about the consequences of a warming planet. But they also fear that some of the measures the city people in government might take to combat climate change could pose a real problem to rural life. “If they start to ration the fuel for climate reasons, it’s impossible for us,” Tero says, translating for two of the hunters sitting around the fire. “We rely on these vehicles for our daily life here, and fuel prices are very high, so a lot of our resources are going into that.” It’s mid-morning before the dogs pick up the scent of a moose. Thanks to the GPS trackers, the hunters are ready and waiting.  Markku Eskelinen  Markku takes up position on a path leading through the woods. In the distance, there is the sound of a dog barking. He raises his rifle. Off to the right, the undergrowth stirs. Suddenly a moose breaks cover and crosses the track. But she’s got a young calf with her. Markku holds his fire. The hunt has its rules, Tero explains. “It’s never a mass slaughter, or something we do just for the sake of it. Here in the northern villages there is still an understanding of the long traditions of how we have been living sustainably.” But the hunters aren’t finished yet. Markku gets a message over his radio. We walk deeper into the forest. A young male moose lies dead on the ground.     It’s hunting season. In the village of Selkie, men gather before the dawn.

Markku gets a message over his radio. We walk deeper into the forest. A young male moose lies dead on the ground.      The hunter who got the kill is Markku Kervinen - a border guard by day, but in his spare time one of the most prolific hunters in the village. He has cut the animal’s belly open. It’s not for the faint-hearted. He runs his hand through the animal’s fur and pulls out two small bugs - insects that never used to be found at such northern latitudes and that usually die when the temperature is well below freezing.   Bugs pulled from the moose     “Those are the moose flies that have now come because of climate change,” Tero explains. “They’re parasites. They weren’t here when we were young.” The hunters heave the moose on to an improvised sledge. The animal will be skinned and butchered - the meat shared in the community. “In the northern regions and northern cultures the way we interact with the Earth is the hunt,” says Tero, reflecting on the wider significance of what we’ve just witnessed. “We are, first and foremost, hunting and fishing societies. We call it traditional knowledge. And this, combined with science, can provide wisdom and ethics of how to treat the Earth and how to live so that humans are not against nature, but with nature.”    Markku Kervinen   The hunter who got the kill is Markku Kervinen - a border guard by day, but in his spare time one of the most prolific hunters in the village.

One reportin particular that he worked on, about the rate of warming in the Arctic, had a profound effect. Thousands came out on to the streets of Helsinki and other cities to demand their government do more to tackle the issue. All the major parties - except one - made tackling the climate crisis a major part of their campaigns, promising ambitious policies to restrict global warming to 1.5C. Proposals included an eco-tax on meat, higher levies on aviation and restrictions on the country’s logging industry. The right-wing nationalist Finns Party was the only political group not to join in. Having traditionally focused on the issue of immigration, in the 2019 poll its members switched their attention to what they called “climate hysteria”. They argued not that climate change wasn’t happening, but that Finland, a small country of 5.5 million people, was not mostly to blame for the rise in global CO2 emissions. Overly-ambitious targets would hurt ordinary people, especially in rural communities, the party said, without significantly contributing to the fight against global warming.   Finnish TV election debate   Looking back at some of the debates in the election campaign, I thought about the hunters in Selkie, who worried about their fuel prices going up, even as they fretted about warmer winters. In Finland, as elsewhere, climate has become a battleground in a broader culture war that has engulfed many Western democracies.       The result of the April election was tight. The Finns Party got the second-largest number of votes, trailing the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) by only 0.2 of a percentage point. But the Finns Party has been frozen out of government by a coalition of five other parties, led by the SDP. One of the new government’s first acts was to pledge to make Finland carbon-neutral by 2035 - one of the most ambitious targets for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the world. (Norway has promised to go net-zero by 2030 but will rely in part on buying international carbon credits, which Finland says it won’t do.) The coalition has proved to be an uneasy one. The leader of the SDP, Antti Rinne, was forced to step down as prime minister in December, replaced by his party colleague Sanna Marin, who at 34 has become the world’s youngest serving PM.   Sanna Marin      But the coalition has held together and remains committed to going net-zero by 2035. The government’s plans include investment in renewables, such as wind and solar power, energy tax reforms, investment in railways and conservation projects. The city of Helsinki has announced an international competition, offering a prize of one million euros for anyone who can come up with a green alternative to coal as an energy source in the capital. When I went to see Krista Mikkonen, Minister for the Environment and Climate Change, she was upbeat about the challenge that lies ahead. The 2035 target, she told me, had really focused minds.   Krista Mikkonen     “We understand that we need action now. We can’t wait because 2035 is quite close. It has also been a very good signal for businesses. They are really thinking how they can help cut down the emissions and have new kinds of technologies. “And they understand that if they are the first ones on the market... they can have a lot of business all over the world, because the whole world is really calling for answers and solutions, how to cut the emissions.” But where some see a business opportunity, others see a threat. The governing coalition includes Krista Mikkonen’s Green League but also the Centre Party - which has traditionally represented rural agrarian communities and has longstanding ties to the peat industry. Finland has legislated to end the use of coal for power and heating by 2029. When I asked Mikkonen why the new government doesn’t have a plan to end peat production there was a long silence. “That’s a good question,” she said finally. “I think we should do it. But it is not in our government programme at the moment. We don’t have a political agreement on that.”       Finland’s general election of April 2019 was dominated by the issue of climate change - thanks, in part, to Tero’s work as a climate scientist.

The right-wing nationalist Finns Party was the only political group not to join in. Having traditionally focused on the issue of immigration, in the 2019 poll its members switched their attention to what they called “climate hysteria”. They argued not that climate change wasn’t happening, but that Finland, a small country of 5.5 million people, was not mostly to blame for the rise in global CO2 emissions. Overly-ambitious targets would hurt ordinary people, especially in rural communities, the party said, without significantly contributing to the fight against global warming.     Looking back at some of the debates in the election campaign, I thought about the hunters in Selkie, who worried about their fuel prices going up, even as they fretted about warmer winters. In Finland, as elsewhere, climate has become a battleground in a broader culture war that has engulfed many Western democracies.  Finnish TV election debate    The result of the April election was tight. The Finns Party got the second-largest number of votes, trailing the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) by only 0.2 of a percentage point. But the Finns Party has been frozen out of government by a coalition of five other parties, led by the SDP. One of the new government’s first acts was to pledge to make Finland carbon-neutral by 2035 - one of the most ambitious targets for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the world. (Norway has promised to go net-zero by 2030 but will rely in part on buying international carbon credits, which Finland says it won’t do.) The coalition has proved to be an uneasy one. The leader of the SDP, Antti Rinne, was forced to step down as prime minister in December, replaced by his party colleague Sanna Marin, who at 34 has become the world’s youngest serving PM.   Sanna Marin    But the coalition has held together and remains committed to going net-zero by 2035. The government’s plans include investment in renewables, such as wind and solar power, energy tax reforms, investment in railways and conservation projects. The city of Helsinki has announced an international competition, offering a prize of one million euros for anyone who can come up with a green alternative to coal as an energy source in the capital. When I went to see Krista Mikkonen, Minister for the Environment and Climate Change, she was upbeat about the challenge that lies ahead. The 2035 target, she told me, had really focused minds.   Krista Mikkonen    “We understand that we need action now. We can’t wait because 2035 is quite close. It has also been a very good signal for businesses. They are really thinking how they can help cut down the emissions and have new kinds of technologies. “And they understand that if they are the first ones on the market... they can have a lot of business all over the world, because the whole world is really calling for answers and solutions, how to cut the emissions.” But where some see a business opportunity, others see a threat. The governing coalition includes Krista Mikkonen’s Green League but also the Centre Party - which has traditionally represented rural agrarian communities and has longstanding ties to the peat industry. Finland has legislated to end the use of coal for power and heating by 2029. When I asked Mikkonen why the new government doesn’t have a plan to end peat production there was a long silence. “That’s a good question,” she said finally. “I think we should do it. But it is not in our government programme at the moment. We don’t have a political agreement on that.”     Environmental activists like Tero Mustonen say that ending peat production should, in theory, be one of the easiest and most effective measures to help Finland reach its net-zero carbon-emissions target. “There’s a lot of peat land in Finland,” Mikkonen explained. “And there are a lot of areas where the peat industry is locally quite important. So what we need to do is create jobs in the same areas for those people who are now dependent on the peat industry.”       Finland’s use of peat for energy and heat production has declined since the mid-2000s. The industry employs around 2,600 people each year. Much of the work is seasonal. Environmental campaigners say those jobs could easily be replaced with investment in renewable energy. But the politics of this native Finnish fossil fuel is proving complicated. Before stepping down, former Prime Minister Antti Rinne promised that government subsidies for the peat industry - currently worth around 200 million euros a year - would be removed “at some point”. But for now, they remain in place.

A week after the moose hunt, the inhabitants of Selkie gather in the village hall for the annual feast, a communal meal to celebrate the traditional beginning of winter. Outside, snow is falling. Inside, raffle tickets are selling fast and a long table is laden with the spoils of the hunt. I sit down with Matti, his partner Senja and their two young children as they tuck into plates of steaming moose stew, boiled potatoes and red berry sauce.  Matti, Senja and their children    “The signs are there, and the anxiety that comes with climate-change news can be overwhelming,” Matti tells me. “It makes me so sad. I try not to think about it too much.” Matti is a teacher and commutes to his job in the nearby town of Joensuu. “I’m trying to reduce my use of the car but it’s hard to work from here. I already work one day in the week from home. How else could I reduce it? I don’t know.” “We try to recycle everything and grow our own food, like carrots and potatoes,” Senja adds. Matti believes the solution to climate change is really quite simple - less work and less consumption. “It’s mostly a societal problem. It’s about giving up the way you live. It can be hard if you’re the first ones to change but it is achievable.” Senja is not so optimistic about Finland’s chances of creating a less consumer-driven society. “I think it’s quite hard to achieve, because we have everything, and I don’t think people would like to give up those things.”     After the moose stew, Tero Mustonen takes to the stage at the far end of the hall to announce the start of the much-anticipated raffle. Excited children are dispatched up to the podium to receive their prizes, including hunting jackets, fishing nets, and bags of frozen moose meat. “We are at a profound crossroads,” he tells me. “The forces that have been unleashed by our greed, our misunderstanding of what nature is and our endless economic idea that it can grow without any checks and balances has come to its end.”      A week after the moose hunt, the inhabitants of Selkie gather in the village hall for the annual feast, a communal meal to celebrate the traditional beginning of winter.

He’s careful to emphasise that he doesn’t speak on behalf of the UN body, but he says the climate crisis is more urgent than even most reports in the press suggest. “I think it’s far worse than what we have been discussing in the media. Once we get into the 2030s, 2040s, there will be impacts to the global security and global governance which will be extremely hard to control. “I would give it eight-to-10 years when we really, really, truly have to do at least two things: one, the emission cuts and secondly, the land use. We will not be able to stop human-induced climate change any more. There will be impacts.” Tero says it is now a question of mitigation rather than prevention. Then he says something that I’ve rarely heard from a scientist. Now is not the time for more study, experiments or peer-reviewed papers, he explains. Now is the time for action. “What more evidence do we need? The planet is truly shifting. I don’t think we need more science or data as such. We have all the data. We have the technologies.We can disagree on other things, but let us be united on this.”     In his log house on the edge of the forest, Tero is working on the next report to the IPCC, which will shape the way governments around the world respond to the challenges of climate change in the coming years.

"This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe said he pushed the PM to be ""brave"" in regards to Iran The husband of a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran said there has been ""no breakthrough"" in efforts to secure her release after talks with Boris Johnson. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife was being used as a ""chess piece"" in foreign policy and urged the government to be ""tougher"" with Tehran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained for almost four years over spying allegations she denies. Her five-year-old daughter was also at the meeting at No 10 on Thursday. Mr Johnson has previously said he would leave ""no stone unturned"" to help free her. Mr Ratcliffe last met the prime minister when he was foreign secretary in 2017. That meeting came shortly after Mr Johnson had to apologise after wrongly suggesting that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists at the time of her arrest. She has always maintained she was in Iran visiting relatives. What is the Zaghari-Radcliffe case about? Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter returns to UK Concern for Briton jailed in Iran as tensions rise Thursday's meeting followedthe US killing of Iran's top military leader Qasem Soleimani. Holding the hand of his daughter, Gabriella, outside No 10, Mr Ratcliffe said he urged the prime minister to be ""brave"" in his dealings with Iran - and that relations between two countries must improve. Gabriella was given a toy version of Larry the Downing Street cat during her visit to No 10 Mr Johnson is ""personally committed"" to her case, he said, and was ""touched"" when he gave him a wallet that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had made in prison. But Mr Ratcliffe added that ""sympathy isn't enough"" and that the prime minister did not apologise for the mistake he made as foreign secretary. ""I don't stand here hopeful, if I'm honest. I stand here with my wife still in prison and things aren't moving,"" he said. ""I will think carefully about what I tell her on the phone on Saturday."" He has previously raised concerns that the recent escalation in tensions could make matters worse for his wife. Before her arrest Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe lived in London with accountant Mr Ratcliffe Ahead of the meeting, which the foreign secretary also attended, the prime minister's spokesman said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's continued detention was ""inhumane and unacceptable"" and the UK continued to ""take every opportunity"" to raise her case with the Iranian government. It comes as the Court of Appeal in London prepares to hear a case that could resolve a decade-long financial dispute between the UK and Iran. The dispute is over the interest due on a debt owed by Britain to Tehran for an arms deal in the 1970s that was never fulfilled. Mr Ratcliffe said he was told at the meeting that the government is trying to resolve ""other issues"" but that they are ""complicated"". Speaking in the Commons, the couple's MP, Labour's Tulip Siddiq, urged the government to settle the debt with Iran, accusing it of ""unforgiveable"" behaviour. However, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the issue was ""extraordinarily difficult"" because the government could not be seen to be paying money to allow the release of people who had been illegally detained. ""The risk that would cause to other Britons travelling abroad would be very considerable,"" he said.

Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, remains on medication for depression and on beta blockers - medicines which slow down the heart - for the panic attacks she's been suffering in jail,her husband said. The dual national has been detained since 2016, when she took her British-born daughter Gabriella to Iran to visit her parents. She was sentenced to five years in prison for spying. Her family and the UK government has always maintained her innocence and she has beengiven diplomatic protectionby the Foreign Office - meaning the case is treated as a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran. While he was foreign secretary, Mr Johnson mistakenly said that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran training journalists when she was arrested.

" The country with an ambitious plan  By Gabriel Gatehouse When a small village in Finland took the country’s biggest peat producer to court over a polluted river, it didn’t expect to win. But it had a secret weapon - a local fisherman-turned-scientist whose work on climate change would help push his country’s government to adopt one of the toughest targets for reducing carbon emissions anywhere in the world. Finland has pledged to be carbon-neutral by 2035 - that’s twice as fast as the UK government target. But to achieve this, it will have to make big changes, particularly in the peat industry, which currently provides energy, heating and jobs. Can the Finns turn an ambitious plan into reality?       Tero Mustonen is mending nets when we arrive at his house one morning, in the village of Selkie near the Russian border. “When I was very young, we could witness far more clean waters,” he says. “The lake was a certain depth and doing well. There were good fish stocks.” Tero has played a key role in Finland’s environmental story since 2010. One day, he and other local fishermen spotted dead fish floating on the surface of the water. “There was a massive discharge of acidic waters here in Selkie that killed all the fish in our river,” he tells me nearly a decade later, sitting in his 18th Century log house on the edge of the forest. The “acidic discharge” had come from a nearby peat field. When Tero saw the dead fish he immediately alerted Vapo, the peat extraction company that ran the site. The firm told him it had been caused by leaves falling into the river. But Tero knew that wasn’t right. And the dead fish were only a small part of a much bigger problem. So Tero and his village did something no-one had ever done before. They took Vapo, the state-controlled peat company, to court. They argued that the acidic waters were a result of the company’s activities. And they won.       Peat is formed of decayed vegetation. When dried it can be burned like a fossil fuel. In Finland, peat provides around 4% of the nation’s electricity, and 15% of heating. As a power source, peat is dirtier than coal. And it gets worse. Even after the peat has been extracted and burned, drained peatlands continue to emit previously locked-in, centuries-old greenhouse gases. Environmentalists say a failure by Finland to cut its reliance on peat could make its target of having a carbon footprint of net zero by 2035 - set by the country’s new coalition government last year - hard to achieve. “This became the first area where [Vapo] had to retreat and start the restoration,” he explains, as we pick our way over what was once a peat bog. Now it looks more like a brown and black moonscape. “When these were degraded by human land use, they turned into releasing places for carbon.” Tero and his colleagues have now taken over the restoration work. A digger is building a bank around the site. Soon they will flood it with water.        “Some of those emissions will stop immediately,” he says. “But then of course we will have to wait on those natural cycles for the plants to come back.” It’s a process called rewilding - returning a patch of land to its natural state, allowing biodiversity to flourish once again. Here’s the extraordinary thing about peatlands - when burned or dried out, theyrelease greenhouse gases. In their natural state however, they do the opposite. They are what’s known as carbon sinks - natural sites that trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and lock it back into the soil. “The existing marshmires, bogs and peatlands are defined by the UN as highly critical for [the] survival of humankind because they are helping with climate change through natural processes.”       Tero Mustonen is mending nets when we arrive at his house one morning, in the village of Selkie near the Russian border. “When I was very young, we could witness far more clean waters,” he says. “The lake was a certain depth and doing well.

He’s one of the lead authors on reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the IPCC) - that’s the UN body that evaluates the latest science in this area. After he won his local battle against Vapo, he had an idea. What if this small project on the outskirts of his village was a model that could be replicated more widely and help reduce carbon emissions on a vast scale? Boreal wetlands and marshmires extend around the planet’s higher latitudes - from Scandinavia through northern Russia and across the Pacific into Canada.    Tero Mustonen     “In Finland we have a massive potential for restoration of peatlands and bogs and marshmires into carbon sinks that are currently degraded. “We can bring them back into health and create more sites that trap carbon.” But despite Tero’s efforts, and the Finnish government’s pledge to go carbon-neutral by 2035, Finland is still issuing licences for the extraction of peat at other sites across the country. Even with the greenest of intentions, the Finns are discovering how stubborn the politics of fossil fuels can be.       It’s hunting season. In the village of Selkie, men gather before the dawn. Soon, the first big snowfalls will come. Today is perhaps the hunters’ last chance to catch enough moose to feed the whole community at the annual feast to mark the start of winter. Tero, who is also head of the village, introduces us to a group of men dressed in bright orange high-vis vests. They make some last-minute preparations: rifles are checked and the dogs are given collars fitted with GPS trackers. Then the hunters are divided into teams. The dog handlers drive off into the woods, but  the rest retreat to a circular wooden hut, where they will sit around a blazing log fire and wait. The hunt has begun. In these northern villages this is a tradition as old as human habitation itself. But technology is changing things. In the past, they’d all be in the woods, tracking the moose on foot. Now the majority sit by the warmth of the fire, checking an app on their smartphones. They’ll go out only when the time is right.   Tracking moose on a mobile phone    “Even though technology is giving assistance to the hunt, we still need traditional knowledge,” says Tero. “There are days when no animals are caught.” That traditional knowledge includes recognising animal tracks and droppings, and an understanding of the likely movements of the moose according to the weather and the season. And here, too, things are changing. Everyone around the fire has noticed the snows are coming later. “We now have Helsinki-style winters all the way up here on the 62nd parallel, which is 400km (250 miles) north,” says Markku Eskelinen, the leader of the hunt. “In one way, it has made the dynamics of the hunt easier,” he adds. A lack of snow certainly makes it easier to track through the forest. But the changes in the weather are having a mixed effect on agriculture. For Kyosti Siltala, a lawyer who also runs a small farm and forestry business, the warmer climate means his trees are growing faster, which can mean bigger profits from logging. But he’s also noticed new species and new diseases. “The whole of nature is changing,” he says. “It’s very difficult to see where we are heading and I’m personally very worried about it.” I look around the hut at the faces, young and old, lit by the flickering fire. “Is anyone not worried about climate change?” I ask. Silence. Here in the rural villages, plans to make Finland carbon-neutral in just 15 years’ time have generated a mixture of hope and trepidation. Yes, they worry about the consequences of a warming planet. But they also fear that some of the measures the city people in government might take to combat climate change could pose a real problem to rural life. “If they start to ration the fuel for climate reasons, it’s impossible for us,” Tero says, translating for two of the hunters sitting around the fire. “We rely on these vehicles for our daily life here, and fuel prices are very high, so a lot of our resources are going into that.” It’s mid-morning before the dogs pick up the scent of a moose. Thanks to the GPS trackers, the hunters are ready and waiting.  Markku Eskelinen  Markku takes up position on a path leading through the woods. In the distance, there is the sound of a dog barking. He raises his rifle. Off to the right, the undergrowth stirs. Suddenly a moose breaks cover and crosses the track. But she’s got a young calf with her. Markku holds his fire. The hunt has its rules, Tero explains. “It’s never a mass slaughter, or something we do just for the sake of it. Here in the northern villages there is still an understanding of the long traditions of how we have been living sustainably.” But the hunters aren’t finished yet. Markku gets a message over his radio. We walk deeper into the forest. A young male moose lies dead on the ground.     It’s hunting season. In the village of Selkie, men gather before the dawn.

Markku gets a message over his radio. We walk deeper into the forest. A young male moose lies dead on the ground.      The hunter who got the kill is Markku Kervinen - a border guard by day, but in his spare time one of the most prolific hunters in the village. He has cut the animal’s belly open. It’s not for the faint-hearted. He runs his hand through the animal’s fur and pulls out two small bugs - insects that never used to be found at such northern latitudes and that usually die when the temperature is well below freezing.   Bugs pulled from the moose     “Those are the moose flies that have now come because of climate change,” Tero explains. “They’re parasites. They weren’t here when we were young.” The hunters heave the moose on to an improvised sledge. The animal will be skinned and butchered - the meat shared in the community. “In the northern regions and northern cultures the way we interact with the Earth is the hunt,” says Tero, reflecting on the wider significance of what we’ve just witnessed. “We are, first and foremost, hunting and fishing societies. We call it traditional knowledge. And this, combined with science, can provide wisdom and ethics of how to treat the Earth and how to live so that humans are not against nature, but with nature.”    Markku Kervinen   The hunter who got the kill is Markku Kervinen - a border guard by day, but in his spare time one of the most prolific hunters in the village.

One reportin particular that he worked on, about the rate of warming in the Arctic, had a profound effect. Thousands came out on to the streets of Helsinki and other cities to demand their government do more to tackle the issue. All the major parties - except one - made tackling the climate crisis a major part of their campaigns, promising ambitious policies to restrict global warming to 1.5C. Proposals included an eco-tax on meat, higher levies on aviation and restrictions on the country’s logging industry. The right-wing nationalist Finns Party was the only political group not to join in. Having traditionally focused on the issue of immigration, in the 2019 poll its members switched their attention to what they called “climate hysteria”. They argued not that climate change wasn’t happening, but that Finland, a small country of 5.5 million people, was not mostly to blame for the rise in global CO2 emissions. Overly-ambitious targets would hurt ordinary people, especially in rural communities, the party said, without significantly contributing to the fight against global warming.   Finnish TV election debate   Looking back at some of the debates in the election campaign, I thought about the hunters in Selkie, who worried about their fuel prices going up, even as they fretted about warmer winters. In Finland, as elsewhere, climate has become a battleground in a broader culture war that has engulfed many Western democracies.       The result of the April election was tight. The Finns Party got the second-largest number of votes, trailing the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) by only 0.2 of a percentage point. But the Finns Party has been frozen out of government by a coalition of five other parties, led by the SDP. One of the new government’s first acts was to pledge to make Finland carbon-neutral by 2035 - one of the most ambitious targets for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the world. (Norway has promised to go net-zero by 2030 but will rely in part on buying international carbon credits, which Finland says it won’t do.) The coalition has proved to be an uneasy one. The leader of the SDP, Antti Rinne, was forced to step down as prime minister in December, replaced by his party colleague Sanna Marin, who at 34 has become the world’s youngest serving PM.   Sanna Marin      But the coalition has held together and remains committed to going net-zero by 2035. The government’s plans include investment in renewables, such as wind and solar power, energy tax reforms, investment in railways and conservation projects. The city of Helsinki has announced an international competition, offering a prize of one million euros for anyone who can come up with a green alternative to coal as an energy source in the capital. When I went to see Krista Mikkonen, Minister for the Environment and Climate Change, she was upbeat about the challenge that lies ahead. The 2035 target, she told me, had really focused minds.   Krista Mikkonen     “We understand that we need action now. We can’t wait because 2035 is quite close. It has also been a very good signal for businesses. They are really thinking how they can help cut down the emissions and have new kinds of technologies. “And they understand that if they are the first ones on the market... they can have a lot of business all over the world, because the whole world is really calling for answers and solutions, how to cut the emissions.” But where some see a business opportunity, others see a threat. The governing coalition includes Krista Mikkonen’s Green League but also the Centre Party - which has traditionally represented rural agrarian communities and has longstanding ties to the peat industry. Finland has legislated to end the use of coal for power and heating by 2029. When I asked Mikkonen why the new government doesn’t have a plan to end peat production there was a long silence. “That’s a good question,” she said finally. “I think we should do it.

So what we need to do is create jobs in the same areas for those people who are now dependent on the peat industry.”       Finland’s use of peat for energy and heat production has declined since the mid-2000s. The industry employs around 2,600 people each year. Much of the work is seasonal. Environmental campaigners say those jobs could easily be replaced with investment in renewable energy. But the politics of this native Finnish fossil fuel is proving complicated. Before stepping down, former Prime Minister Antti Rinne promised that government subsidies for the peat industry - currently worth around 200 million euros a year - would be removed “at some point”.

A week after the moose hunt, the inhabitants of Selkie gather in the village hall for the annual feast, a communal meal to celebrate the traditional beginning of winter. Outside, snow is falling. Inside, raffle tickets are selling fast and a long table is laden with the spoils of the hunt. I sit down with Matti, his partner Senja and their two young children as they tuck into plates of steaming moose stew, boiled potatoes and red berry sauce.  Matti, Senja and their children    “The signs are there, and the anxiety that comes with climate-change news can be overwhelming,” Matti tells me. “It makes me so sad. I try not to think about it too much.” Matti is a teacher and commutes to his job in the nearby town of Joensuu. “I’m trying to reduce my use of the car but it’s hard to work from here. I already work one day in the week from home. How else could I reduce it? I don’t know.” “We try to recycle everything and grow our own food, like carrots and potatoes,” Senja adds. Matti believes the solution to climate change is really quite simple - less work and less consumption. “It’s mostly a societal problem. It’s about giving up the way you live. It can be hard if you’re the first ones to change but it is achievable.” Senja is not so optimistic about Finland’s chances of creating a less consumer-driven society. “I think it’s quite hard to achieve, because we have everything, and I don’t think people would like to give up those things.”     After the moose stew, Tero Mustonen takes to the stage at the far end of the hall to announce the start of the much-anticipated raffle. Excited children are dispatched up to the podium to receive their prizes, including hunting jackets, fishing nets, and bags of frozen moose meat. “We are at a profound crossroads,” he tells me. “The forces that have been unleashed by our greed, our misunderstanding of what nature is and our endless economic idea that it can grow without any checks and balances has come to its end.”      A week after the moose hunt, the inhabitants of Selkie gather in the village hall for the annual feast, a communal meal to celebrate the traditional beginning of winter.

He’s careful to emphasise that he doesn’t speak on behalf of the UN body, but he says the climate crisis is more urgent than even most reports in the press suggest. “I think it’s far worse than what we have been discussing in the media. Once we get into the 2030s, 2040s, there will be impacts to the global security and global governance which will be extremely hard to control. “I would give it eight-to-10 years when we really, really, truly have to do at least two things: one, the emission cuts and secondly, the land use. We will not be able to stop human-induced climate change any more. There will be impacts.” Tero says it is now a question of mitigation rather than prevention. Then he says something that I’ve rarely heard from a scientist. Now is not the time for more study, experiments or peer-reviewed papers, he explains. Now is the time for action. “What more evidence do we need? The planet is truly shifting. I don’t think we need more science or data as such. We have all the data. We have the technologies.We can disagree on other things, but let us be united on this.”     In his log house on the edge of the forest, Tero is working on the next report to the IPCC, which will shape the way governments around the world respond to the challenges of climate change in the coming years.

"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Wuhan, a Chinese city of eleven million people, has temporarily shut down its public transport as it tries to halt the outbreak of a new strain of virus. Those living in the city have been advised not to leave, in a week when millions of Chinese are travelling for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. The respiratory illness has spread to other parts of China, with some cases in other countries including the US. There are more than 500 confirmed cases and 17 people have died. Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Chinese virus: How worried should we be? Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began Known for now as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold. All the fatalities so far have been in Hubei, the province around Wuhan. Meanwhile, after a day of discussions in Geneva, the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee has announced it will not yet declare a ""global emergency"" over the new virus. Director general Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said more information was needed about the spread of the infection. The committee of health experts will meet again on Thursday. A global emergency is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound and has previously been used in response to swine flu, Zika virus and Ebola. From Thursday, all flights and passenger train services out of Wuhan have been stopped. Bus, subway and ferry services all shut down from 10:00 local time (02:00 GMT). A special command centre in Wuhan set up to contain the virus said the move was meant to ""resolutely contain the momentum of the epidemic spreading"". Those living in Wuhan had already been told to avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings. State news agency Xinhua said tourist attractions and hotels in the city had been told to suspend large-scale activities while libraries, museums and theatres were cancelling exhibitions and performances. A Lunar New Year prayer-giving ceremony at the city's Guiyuan Temple, which attracted 700,000 people last year, has also been cancelled. The hashtag ""Wuhan is sealed off"" was trending on Chinese social media website Weibo. One user said worries about food and disinfectant made it feel like ""the end of the world"", while another said they were on the ""verge of tears"" when Chinese officials announced the shut-down. The WHO's Dr Ghebreyesus described the latest measures as ""very strong"" and said they would ""not only control the outbreak, they will minimise spread internationally"". Chinese officials said the country was now at the ""most critical stage"" of prevention and control. ""Basically, do not go to Wuhan. And those in Wuhan please do not leave the city,"" said National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin in one of the first public briefings since the beginning of the outbreak. By James Gallagher, BBC health and science correspondent Wuhan is starting to look like a city in quarantine. Officials had already warned residents not to leave the city and visitors not to come. Now the reported public transport ban - which includes flights - slams many of the routes in and out of the city shut. Subways in Wuhan will be temporarily shut It is a significant attempt to stop the spread of this new virus, which we now know can spread from person to person. Limiting transport will cut the chance of the virus reaching other cities in China and other countries around the world. This all comes just as millions of people are travelling across China for the week-long holiday that is Lunar New Year. If you're struggling for context - imagine shutting down London in the week before Christmas. The big question left is the roads - and whether any of Wuhan's 11 million inhabitants will be able to simply drive away. Officials inHong Kong reported the territory's first two cases,externalon Wednesday and one case was reported in the nearby city of Macau. The patient in Macau is said to be a businesswoman who arrived from Wuhan over the weekend. The first US case was confirmed on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said the situation was ""totally under control"" and that he trusted the information being provided by Chinese authorities. There have been three cases in Thailand, one in Korea, one in Japan and one in Taiwan. Although only about 500 cases have been confirmed, calculations by scientists at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggest there are 4,000 people sick with the virus in Wuhan.

"This video can not be played Fears over coronavirus in China trigger face mask shortage Lockdown measures are increasing across China's Hubei province to try to control the spread of a new virus that has left 18 people dead in the country. Wuhan, Hubei's capital of 11 million people where the virus first emerged, has no trains or planes in or out. At least five other provincial cities are seeing clampdowns on transport. There are more than 500 confirmed cases of the virus, which has spread abroad, with Singapore and Vietnam the latest affected. Thursday's events as they happened The new strain of coronavirus is believed to have originated at a market in Wuhan. One resident of the city said the atmosphere there felt like ""the end of the world"". The lockdowns come as millions of Chinese people travel across the country for the Lunar New Year holiday. How do you quarantine a city - and does it work? Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began 'Increased likelihood' of new virus reaching UK All the fatalities bar one so far have been in Hubei province. Most of the 17 victims there were elderly and suffered from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's disease and diabetes. An 18th victim, an elderly patient, was announced on Thursday in Hebei province, near the capital, Beijing. Wuhan's public transport lockdown came into force as of 10:00 local time (02:00 GMT), leaving normally busy train stations and airports empty. One Wuhan resident said on social media site Weibo that people were on the ""verge of tears"" when they heard about the closures. Supermarket shelves emptied in Wuhan as residents stocked up on supplies Health authorities are reported to have made wearing a mask mandatory in the city. They are advising people to avoid crowds and public gatherings. Demand for rubber gloves and surgical masks has soared.Taobao, the Chinese online retail giant, has warned sellers not to profit from the outbreakby raising prices. Also in Hubei province: Huanggang, a city east of Wuhan, suspended bus and rail services and encouraged people not to leave the city. Cafes, cinemas, theatres and exhibitions are also being shut Ezhou, just south of Huanggang, has shut its train stations Xiantaohas cancelled gatherings, suspended transport and set up temperature detection stations ChibiandLichuanare suspending transport, AFP news agency reports Beijing announced it had cancelled all major Chinese New Year celebrations. Coronavirus: How worried should we be? New China virus: Your questions answered Killer plague game tops charts amid coronavirus A doctor at a hospital in Wuhan spoke to the BBC The virus is now spreading at an alarming rate. The hospitals have been flooding with thousands of patients, who wait hours to see a doctor. You can imagine their panic. Normally Wuhan is a great place to live and we are proud of our work. Specialists here have developed a guide for coronavirus diagnosis and treatment. But I am scared because this is a new virus and the figures are worrying. Two days ago we were told not to go to work because of the risk of contamination. If we leave our home on the hospital campus, we are required to wear masks.

He's sleeping now, and we are trying to protect him as much as possible: handwashing, airing the apartment, avoiding contact with people. Outside I can barely see anyone on the streets. We have been told to avoid gatherings. I went to the supermarket to buy food, but there was nothing left, no vegetables or biscuits. Some Lunar New Year celebrations are cancelled. People had bought tickets to go home for Lunar New Year but they can't go now. Everyone is stuck here and can't leave. Read more from the doctor in Wuhan Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans.

But understanding more about how the virus transmits between people is one of the major outstanding questions. The virus infects the lungs, and symptoms start with a fever and cough. It can progress to shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. The World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee said on Thursday that it was not the time to declare an ""international emergency"" over the new virus, although it was ""an emergency in China"". Its 16-member experts' panel was divided 50-50 on the issue, the WHO said, but had decided overall that it was too early because of the limited number of cases abroad, the efforts made by China to control the virus and the fact there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China. A global emergency is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound, and has previously been used in response to swine flu, Zika virus and Ebola. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Authorities around the world have announced screening measures for passengers from China. Thailand has confirmed four cases of the virus, the most outside China. The US, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea have all reported one case each. The first US case was confirmed on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said the situation was ""totally under control"" and that he trusted the information being provided by Chinese authorities On Thursday, two more nations confirmed cases: Singapore, where a 66-year-old man who had travelled from Wuhan is being held in an isolation room, and there is also another suspected case Vietnam, where the health ministry has confirmed two Chinese citizens in the country have the virus An earlier report that an Indian nurse working in the city of Khamis Mushait in Saudi Arabia had tested positive was altered by the Indian consulate in Jeddah.

"This video can not be played Labour needs to sell a message of aspiration to voters, says Long-Bailey Labour had ""a great set of policies"" at the general election but got its ""messaging"" wrong, Rebecca Long-Bailey has told the BBC. ""We should have been talking about aspiration,"" the Labour leadership contender said, but too often talked about ""handouts"" instead. She said she had the ability to sell ""a positive vision"" and ""hope for the future"" that wins elections. The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn is down to four after Jess Phillips quit. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy have made it on the final leadership ballot, after securing the necessary trade union and affiliated group support. Emily Thornberry and Mrs Long-Bailey have yet to reach the threshold. Ms Phillips said she would be happy with either Ms Nandy or Sir Keir as leader, but argued that Mrs Long-Bailey would be the wrong choice for Labour at this moment. Nandy joins Starmer on Labour leadership ballot Jess Phillips quits Labour leadership race Who will be Labour's next leader? Mr Corbyn announced he would be standing down after Labour suffered its worst defeat, in terms of seats, since 1935 in December's election. But Mrs Long-Bailey - whose campaign is backed by grassroots organisation Momentum - refused to blame the party's manifesto, saying she was ""proud"" of the policies in it. Labour's ""compromise position"" on Brexit ""didn't satisfy our communities and meant that we weren't trusted,"" she told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. And, she added: ""We didn't tackle anti-Semitism and we weren't trusted to deal with that issue within our own party."" The manifesto policies - which included nationalising utilities and a big increase in tax-funded public spending - were not drawn together into an ""overarching narrative"" that chimed with the electorate, she said. ""Our messaging really didn't resonate with voters. We should have been talking about aspiration and how all of the things within our manifesto would improve your life, would improve the outcome for businesses in our areas, but we didn't say that. ""Quite often we talked about handouts and how we will help people, rather than providing that broad positive vision of the future."" She said Labour had a history of talking ""about how bad the Conservatives are"" without ""showing that real vision and hope for the future"". ""That's what wins general elections, showing that real vision and hope for the future. And I know that I can do that and that's why I'm standing to be the leader of the party."" The shadow business secretary said Labour did not do enough to ""sell"" her flagship policy, the Green Industrial Revolution, which she said ""would have transformed our economy and delivered investment in regions and nations"". This video can not be played Rebecca Long-Bailey says she supports gender self-identification ""Whoever becomes leader, we have to reunite the party to make sure that we're unified in the message that we're putting forward. But we had many of the right answers to the right questions."" She also hit back at claims she was not forceful enough to be prime minister. ""I'm not shy. I mean, I have spent last four years, you know, locked in a room developing many of the policies that we've been trying to push forward as a party, but I don't think you could ever describe me as shy."" She said she believed her ""forensic approach"" to politics would be a challenge to Boris Johnson, whom she described as having ""a bit of a struggling relationship with the truth and with detail"". On the prospect of being PM herself one day, she said she could picture herself living in 10 Downing Street, ""chilling out"" in her pyjamas on a Friday night, with ""Netflix and a Chinese takeaway"". In a wide-ranging interview, Mrs Long-Bailey was asked whether she had any Conservative friends in Parliament. ""Not really, no,"" she replied, but added: ""I'm friendly to everyone."" She said her non-political friends would not tell her if they supported the Tories ""because I'd be angry"". She also reiterated her belief that women had a ""right to choose"" when it came to abortion and she was not in favour of changing the law, after arow over comments she madeto Catholic priests during the general election. And she backed a change in the law to allow transgender people to self-identify without the need for medical evidence. This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership Labour's manifesto committed to reform of the Gender Recognition Act to allow self-identification, but critics warn it will make it easier for someone born as a man but now identifying as a woman to gain access to women-only spaces such as toilets, changing rooms, prisons and domestic violence refuges. Asked whether she had any concerns about the policy, Mrs Long-Bailey said she understood the arguments, but Labour must ""fully support our trans community"".

"This video can not be played Schiff: 'The facts are damning' US Democrats have ruled out a ""witness swap"" with Republicans in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Lawmakers who are seeking to remove the president from office hope to hear testimony from his former National Security Adviser John Bolton. But Democrats refused any deal to allow the son of former US Vice-President Joe Biden to be called as a witness. Mr Trump is accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He strongly denies any wrongdoing. House Democrats have up to three days to make their case as they present their arguments in the impeachment trial in the Senate. Mr Trump's defence team will have three days after that for a rebuttal. Democrats accuse the president of using US military aid as a bargaining chip in an attempt to prod Ukraine into announcing an investigation to discredit his would-be Democratic White House challenger, Mr Biden. 'No crime, no impeachment' - is that true? Trump impeachment trial: All you need to know Mr Trump has been touting corruption claims against Mr Biden, whose son Hunter held a lucrative board position with a Ukrainian gas firm while his father was US vice-president and in charge of American-Ukrainian relations. Attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Mr Trump jokingly warned he might confront Democrats by coming to ""sit right in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces"". The impeachment trial could end next week, but Mr Trump's fellow Republicans control the chamber and are unlikely to oust him. This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What happened on day one? There was one thing in particular that President Trump said which was kind of like a red rag to a bull. It's when he said basically: ""Well things are going very well, we have all the information, and they [Democrats] have none of it."" Well, if you want a fair trial, then maybe that information should be made available. We keep using the word ""trial"", and the words ""jurors"" and ""witnesses"" and ""evidence"", but we must not lose sight that this is a political process. We saw that clearly last night when the first votes started coming in. In a vote that split completely along party lines, 53 Republicans said ""no we should not be able to subpoena the White House for documents"", while 47 Democrats said ""yes we should"". So we have Donald Trump kind of goading and saying: ""Look I've got the information. We know what happened, but we're not going to tell you."" I think this might inflame public opinion. Polls are already indicating that a clear majority believe that evidence should be handed over and witnesses should be called. Democrats want to call Mr Bolton, who referred to the White House's alleged political pressure on Ukraine as a ""drug deal"", according to previous witness testimony in the House of Representatives. But the former national security adviser has said he will not consider testifying unless served with a legal summons known as a subpoena. Mr Trump's Republican allies have argued Hunter Biden should also be ordered to appear before the impeachment trial. But Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, told reporters during a break in the trial on Wednesday: ""That trade is not on the table."" This video can not be played Trump impeachment trial: Five possible twists ahead Joe Biden said on Wednesday in Osage, Iowa, where he is campaigning for the White House that he would not offer himself up in any witness trade. ""We're not going to turn it into a farce or political theatre,"" Mr Biden said. ""I want no part of that."" Defending his son, Mr Biden added: ""There's nobody that's indicated there's a single solitary thing he did that was inappropriate or wrong - other than the appearance. It looked bad that he was there."" Mr Biden said last year that if elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation. The Trump impeachment story explained Trump impeachment - your questions answered This video can not be played A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump On Wednesday, the lead Democratic prosecutor, California congressman Adam Schiff, criticised President Trump's dealings with Ukraine as ""worse than crazy"". ""It's repulsive, it's repugnant. It breaks our word. And to do it in the name of these corrupt investigations is also contrary to everything we espouse around the world,"" he said. Mr Schiff, who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urged Republicans to vote to remove Mr Trump from office to ""protect our democracy"". He warned that senators would ""also undermine our global standing"" if they do not oust the president. This video can not be played What's Ukraine got to do with the Trump impeachment? The first day of the trial dragged on till the early hours of Wednesday morning as the senators debated a flurry of incremental motions. Much of the evidence being laid out is a rehash of testimony already presented exhaustively in the House of Representatives, which voted to impeach Mr Trump last month. Under arcane rules, senators are forbidden to drink coffee on the chamber floor and are only allowed water and milk. A number of senators, mostly Republicans, were seen to be absent from the chamber during Mr Schiff's presentation. Also, several members were spotted dozing during the proceedings.
