"Alesha MacPhail died just days into her school holidays in July A 16-year-old boy is to stand trial charged with abducting, raping and murdering six-year-old Alesha MacPhail on the Isle of Bute. The teenager - who cannot be named for legal reasons - made his first public appearance in court on Monday. His QC Brian McConnachie pled not guilty on his behalf and he will stand trial in February. Alesha's mother was given special permission to be present in court to see the proceedings. Prosecutors allege the accused boy was armed with a knife when he took Alesha from her bed at a house in Ardbeg Road in Rothesay in July. It is claimed he then carried the schoolgirl to the site of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel on the island. Alesha MacPhail's mother was allowed to watch proceedings in court The indictment at the High Court in Glasgow stated he took off Alesha's clothes, shook her violently before placing his hands over her nose, mouth and around her neck. The boy is said to have ""applied pressure"" to her face, inflicted injuries by ""means unknown"", with prosecutors alleging he went on to rape and murder Alesha. The teenager then faces a separate charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. It is alleged he went to another house in Ardbeg Road before disposing of the clothes he had worn and then taking a shower to remove blood from his body. This was said to have been done in a bid to ""destroy or conceal evidence"". Police investigated after the body of the six-year-old was discovered on the Isle of Bute QC Brian McConnachie entered a not guilty plea on the 16-year-old's behalf. The advocate said: ""He pleads not guilty to both charges on the indictment."" Both Mr McConnachie and prosecutor Iain McSporran QC told the court they were ready for a trial to be set. Mr McSporran said: ""Trial is expected to last 10 days"" Judge Lady Rae then fixed a trial to begin next February. Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane, from Airdrie,  who is a witness in the case, was given special permission by Lady Rae to be present in court to see the proceedings against the teenager accused of murdering her daughter.

A boathouse in North Carolina destroyed by the storm Snow, sleet and freezing rain continues to impact the South. At a news conference on Monday, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said ""a year's worth of snowfall fell in some places in a day"". More than 300,000 people were affected by electricity outages,externalin the Carolinas, Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia on Sunday, while storm warnings remained in place in the south-east ""especially North Carolina and Virginia"", the National Weather Service (NWS) said in a tweet. The storm was expected to move off the coast on Monday, although the NWS's lead forecaster Michael Schichtel warned it would continue to be ""a dangerous system"". ""It's slow to move off the Carolinas but a saving grace is that it won't hit New England,"" he told Reuters news agency.

"The Foreign Office has accused Russian state media of trying to discredit a government-funded body that works to counter Kremlin disinformation. A spokesperson said the Institute for Statecraft was hacked several weeks ago and documents were ""published and amplified by Kremlin news channels"". The National Cyber Security Centre is said to be investigating. The FCO comments on the IfS were issued after a news report said the group had retweeted stories critical of Labour. Western officials believe the group involved in the hack is linked to the Russian state. Since then internal documents have been leaked to the Russian media about the organisation's activities, including lists of journalists it had contacted. The Institute for Statecraft is acharity registered in Scotland,externaland based in Gateside, Fife. Scotland'sSunday Mail newspaper ran a story,externalthis weekend that the Integrity Initiative run by the institute had retweeted an article in the New Statesman in April which criticised Labour's support for Russia's position on Syria; an article in the Times in February in which the writer Edward Lucas described Mr Corbyn as the Kremlin's ""useful idiot"", and a Sunday Times magazine piece that criticised Mr Corbyn's aide Seumas Milne for his opinions on Russia. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said he had ordered an immediate investigation after seeing the report, saying ""if there is any kind of organisation for which we are paying which is involved in domestic politics in that way, I would totally condemn it"". Sir Alan confirmed the Foreign Office was funding the institute's Integrity Initiative on 27 Novemberin a written answer to a Parliamentary question,externalfrom Labour MP Chris Williamson. The Foreign Office statement issued later emphasised that the Â£2.2m it had given to the institute over the last two years supported its work to counter disinformation overseas and not in the UK. The spokesperson said the government did not endorse or fund the institute's social media activity. And while insisting that the retweeting showed no systemic bias, she said the institute had agreed to review its editorial policy. The spokesperson said: ""The Institute for Statecraft, an independent charity, was hacked several weeks ago and numerous documents were published and amplified by Kremlin news channels. ""The Russian state media campaign's objective is clear. This is yet another example of Russian disinformation intended to confuse audiences and discredit an organisation which is working independently to tackle the threat of disinformation."" They added: ""The Institute for Statecraft is independent of government and is non-partisan. We fund them on that basis. ""Their retweeting of articles critical of both the government and opposition shows no systemic bias, though they have undertaken to review their editorial policy."" Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said it was ""outrageous"" a Foreign Office-funded initiative ""has routinely been using its Twitter feed to disseminate personal attacks and smears"" against Labour. In a statement, the Institute for Statecraft said: ""In sharing information about such malign activities, the Integrity Initiative uses Twitter as a key method of sharing knowledge. The campaign retweeted links to stories critical of Jeremy Corbyn and his aides ""This includes the usual Twitter practice of re-tweeting and liking tweets. ""However, at no time has the Integrity Initiative engaged in party political activity and would never take up a party-political stance. Disinformation and malign influence from rogue states and certain non-state actors are a threat to democratic values and transcend any party political cause."" A spokesman for the Integrity Initiative did not deny the retweets but pointed out the group had also promoted an article in October about links between the Russian state and Conservative peer Lord Barker of Battle, who is chairman of the Russian energy giant EN+. Correction 27 February 2019: This article has been amended to make clear that western officials believe the hacking of the Institute for Statecraft's computer system was linked to the Russian state.

"Quality tyres are valuable on the black market in crisis-hit Venezuela Goodyear employees in Venezuela are each to be given 10 tyres as part of their severance payment, as the US firm halts operations in the country. Quality tyres are valuable on the black market, in a country where there is a chronic shortage of all sorts of goods. A number of foreign firms have pulled out of Venezuela, citing a growing economic crisis and US sanctions. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has accused his opponents and the US of waging an ""economic war"" on his government. Venezuela crisis hits food markets and a morgue Venezuela crisis: A country in freefall Venezuela's leader NicolÃ¡s Maduro divides opinion In a statement on Monday, Goodyear said that it ""has made the difficult decision to stop producing tyres"" in Venezuela, Reuters news agency reports. ""Our goal had been to maintain its operations, but economic conditions and US sanctions have made this impossible."" The company said it was in the process of making severance payments, which included giving each employee 10 tyres. Goodyear is the latest multinational to leave Venezuela, following Kellogg, Kimberley Clark and several airlines. Venezuela has been in a dire economic crisis since 2014. An estimated 2.3 million citizens have fled hyperinflation, power cuts, and food and medicine shortages.

"Dany Cotton, second from right, in Grenfell Tower on the night of the fire Grenfell Tower residents and firefighters were let down by London Fire Brigade's leaders, a lawyer for the victims has said. Sam Stein QC told the public inquiry into the fire that commissioner Dany Cotton and her leadership team were ""not fit to run"" the emergency service. The brigade said it would be unfair for it to be judged before all the evidence was heard. A total of 72 people were killed as a result of the fire in June 2017. Mr Stein told the inquiry in London that Ms Cotton should have been well aware of the ""dreadful failings"" within the fire brigade that had been identified in the hearings, by the time she came to give her evidence. But he added: ""This condemnation of the leadership of the fire brigade of London should not be taken to be an insult to those on the front line."" ""No-one can or should forget the sheer bravery and determination of the individual firefighters who risked their lives in the Grenfell Tower."" Five things firefighters told us about the fire How the tragedy unfolded Grenfell fire spread in just 10 minutes Another victims' lawyer, Danny Friedman QC, said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" the brigade had failed to plan for such a scenario. Mr Friedman said the fire service knew there was a risk of a high-rise fire which could require evacuation. But he said that knowledge did not filter down to firefighters in a ""terrible gulf between paper and practice"". Dany Cotton speaking to Theresa May the day after the fire He also said that the brigade had been brought into disrepute byMs Cotton's evidence to the inquiry from September, in which she said she would not change any part of the brigade's response to the fire. ""Not only were these comments insulting to the bereaved, survivors and residents, but they were irresponsible,"" Mr Friedman said. ""They sent a wholly negative message about the LFB's capacity as an organisation to acknowledge its shortcomings and to make any real change in the future."" LISTEN: BBC's Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast - how the fire likely can be traced to a fridge The first phase of the inquiry has been examining what happened when the fire broke out on 14 June 2017. Phase two of the inquiry, due to begin early next year,will look at the refurbishment of the tower block,external, including the cladding and insulation. It will also look at the concerns and warnings residents expressed about the fire safety of the building. Stephen Walsh QC, representing the London Fire Brigade, said the fire was the ""biggest challenge to any fire service in the UK in living memory"". ""Its policies, procedures and training were strained to their limits and in some respects well beyond, that is accepted,"" he said. This video can not be played Dany Cotton says she wanted firefighters to know she was there for them as they went into the tower Ms Cotton previously told the inquiry that she provided ""direct leadership"" on the night of the fire. She said she hoped by going into the tower herself she was showing the firefighters they were all in it together.

"The Voyager probes are both outside the heliosphere, a protective bubble created by the Sun that extends beyond the orbit of Pluto The Voyager 2 probe, which left Earth in 1977, has become the second human-made object to leave our Solar System. It was launched 16 days before its twin craft, Voyager 1, but that probe's faster trajectory meant that it was in ""the space between the stars"" six years before Voyager 2. The news was revealed at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in Washington. And chief scientist on the mission, Prof Edward Stone, confirmed it. Voyager 2 launched 16 days before its twin, Voyager 1 He said both probes had now ""made it into interstellar space"" and that Voyager 2's date of departure from the Solar System was 5 November 2018. On that date, the steady stream of particles emitted from the Sun that were being detected by the probe suddenly dipped. This indicated that it had crossed the ""heliopause"" - the term for the outer edge of the Sun's protective bubble of particles and magnetic field. And while its twin craft beat it to this boundary, the US space agency says that Voyager 2 has a working instrument aboard that will provide ""first-of-its-kind observations of the nature of this gateway into interstellar space"". The probe's present location is some 18 billion km (11 billion miles) from Earth. It is moving at roughly 54,000km/h (34,000mph). Voyager 1 is further and faster still, at 22 billion km and 61,000km/h. The probes were launched to explore the outer planets, but have just kept going TheVoyagers,externalwere sent initially to study the outer planets, but then just kept on going. Prof Stone said that at the start of the mission the team had no idea how long it would take them to reach the edge of the Sun's protective bubble, or heliosphere. ""We didn't know how large the bubble was, how long it would take to get there and if the space craft would last long enough,"" he added. ""Now we're studying the very local interstellar medium. ""It's a very exciting time in Voyager's 41 year journey."" Scientists define the Solar System in different ways, so Prof Stone has always been very careful not to use the exact phrase ""leave the Solar System"" in relation to his spacecraft. He is mindful that the Nasa probes still have to pass through the Oort cloud where there are comets gravitationally bound to the Sun, albeit very loosely. But both Voyagers certainly are in a new, unexplored domain of space. Decades and billions of kilometres. Voyager 1 departed Earth on 5 September 1977, a few days after its sister spacecraft, Voyager 2. The pair's primary objective was to survey the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - a task they completed in 1989. They were then steered towards deep space. It is expected that their plutonium power sources will eventually stop supplying electricity, at which point their instruments and their 20W transmitters will die. The Voyager project manager, Suzanne Dodd told BBC News that she would like to see them both keep going until 2027. ""It would be super-exciting to have a 50-year mission still operating,"" she added, describing the probes as ""pioneers"" of interstellar space. ""Every so often they phone home and say - 'I'm still going. Don't forget about me!'"" The Sun sits in an extensive bubble of hot gas called the heliosphere Voyager 1 will not approach another star for nearly 40,000 years, even though it is moving at such great speed. But it will be in orbit around the centre of our galaxy with all its stars for billions of years.

"The pound's fall has accelerated after the prime minister confirmed she would defer the vote on her Brexit deal. It had already fallen 1% earlier on reports of the delay, but fell further as Theresa May addressed Parliament. Sterling remained weak on global exchanges after markets closed in London, down almost two cents against the dollar at $1.2562, close to its lowest level since April 2017. It was 1% lower against the euro at â¬1.1059, its lowest level since August. Meanwhile, the domestically focused FTSE 250 share index fell 2%, hitting its lowest since December 2016. The steep falls reflect mounting uncertainty about the terms of the UK's exit from the European Union, analysts said. ""Until the market knows what will happen with respect to Brexit one way or the other then they [traders] will remain extremely anxious,"" said Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank. Ms Foley said the threat of a hard Brexit, under which the UK leaves the EU without a deal, as well as the continuing political uncertainty was ""an extraordinary and toxic mix"" for the pound. ""Once we know what is happening, things will be more settled,"" she added. This week had always been expected to be a volatile one for the pound because of the vote on Tuesday, which has also heightened political uncertainty. Dozens of Conservative MPs had been planning to join forces with Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems and the DUP to vote down Mrs May's deal. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said the pound's movements were directly linked to the current political uncertainty. But he said there was also a question of valuation and how investors ""price in Brexit"". The pound's movements over the past decade suggested that the pound could be spared a ""drastic fall"" over a prolonged period, he said. Mrs May made a statement to MPs at 15:30 GMT, confirming that the vote would be delayed because it ""would be rejected by a significant margin"". She said MPs backed much of the deal she had struck with the EU, but there was concern over the Northern Irish backstop. She said she believed she could still get the deal through if she addressed MPs' concerns. And that, she added, was what she intended to do in the next few days. However, Speaker John Bercow - who chairs debates in the House of Commons - called on the government to give MPs a vote on whether Tuesday's vote should be cancelled, saying it was the ""right and obvious"" thing to do given how angry some MPs were about the cancellation. Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes Investment Management, said: ""The vote could be delayed for as little as a week, or even put off until January. At this stage, it is unlikely to directly impact the timing of the Article 50 process, as Prime Minister May has repeatedly refused to countenance shifting that from the 29 March date."" However, there is a theory in the market that the turbulence could work in the government's favour, encouraging MPs to back Theresa May's deal to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Silvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management, said: ""In our - admittedly low confidence - base case, stress in financial markets and pressure from businesses should lead to a last-minute approval of the deal in Parliament."" Dr Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Avoiding a messy exit from the EU is a matter of national urgency. Efforts must be redoubled to find a route forward, while at the same time ensuring that preparations are stepped up to help businesses and communities deal with any potential scenario.""

"The case was heard by all 27 European judges last month The European Court of Justice has ruled the UK can cancel Brexit without the permission of the other 27 EU members. The ECJ judges ruled this could be done without altering the terms of Britain's membership. A group of anti-Brexit politicians argued the UK should be able to unilaterally halt Brexit, but they were opposed by the government and EU. The decision came as Theresa May announced a Commons vote on whether to approve her deal would be postponed. MPs had been widely expected on Tuesday to reject the EU withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. But she pre-empted their decision, saying the vote would be deferred to a later date so she could seek ""further assurances"" from EU leaders about the application of the Irish border backstop. May calls off MPs' vote on her Brexit deal In a subsequent statement to MPs, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said the government noted the ECJ ruling but insisted ""our policy has not changed"". He said the UK would be leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the EU's Article 50 process, and had ""absolutely no intention"" of overturning the 2016 Brexit vote. ""The government's firm and long held policy is that we will not revoke the Article 50 notice,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The case was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians and the Good Law Project who wanted to know whether the UK could revoke the decision to leave the EU without getting approval from the other member states. They believed that if the ruling went in their favour, it could pave the way for an alternative option to Brexit, such as another referendum. A group of politicians brought the case including (from top left) Catherine Stihler MEP; Joanna Cherry MP; David Martin MEP; (from bottom left) Alyn Smith MEP; Ross Greer MSP and Andy Wightman MSP Both the UK government and the EU had been against it going to the ECJ. The EU warned that it would set a dangerous precedent by encouraging other countries to announce they were leaving in an attempt to secure better membership terms, before cancelling their withdrawal. The UK government's lawyers also argued that the case was purely hypothetical as ""the UK does not intend to revoke its notification"" and those politicians behind it wanted to use the case as ""political ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK Parliament"". The ECJ ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke its withdrawal from the EU, broadly following the non-binding opinion given last week bya senior ECJ official - the advocate general. Thestatement from the court,externalsaid the ability for a member state to change its mind after telling the EU it wanted to leave would last as long as a withdrawal agreement had not been entered into, or for the two-year period after it had notified the bloc it was leaving. If that two-year period gets extended, then a member state could change its mind during that extra time too. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Brexit: A really simple guide Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? The court said the UK would be able to stay on the same terms it has now, so it would not be forced to join the euro or the Schengen area - where there are no passport controls between countries. But the decision to stay must ""follow a democratic process"". The member state would then have to write to the EU to notify them of the ""unequivocal and unconditional"" decision. The ECJ said it made the ruling to ""clarify the options open to MPs"" ahead of voting on Mrs May's deal. The politicians involved hope the victory will increase the chances of Brexit being called off completely, potentially through another referendum. Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer - one of the politicians who launched the case - said: ""This is a massive moment at the start of a vital week, pointing to a clear way out of the Brexit mess."" And the SNP's Alyn Smith, who was also involved in the case, said: ""A bright light has switched on above an exit sign."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project which took the case to the court, said that the ruling was ""arguably the most important case in modern domestic legal history"". ""It is up to MPs to remember what they came into politics for and find the moral courage to put the country's interests before private ambition,"" he added. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - who backed Remain - said the ruling meant it was ""now open to the House of Commons"" to extend Article 50 to allow time for another vote. And Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake tweeted that it was the ""best news possible"" and said it was now ""full steam ahead for a People's Vote"". Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a prominent Brexiteer, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme those calling for a second vote were ""people who never accepted that first vote, who didn't accept that democratic mandate and who want to overturn it"". ""We don't want to stay in the EU. We voted very clearly, 17.4 million people sent a clear message that we want to leave the European Union, and that means also leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,"" he added. ""So, this case is all very well, but it doesn't alter the referendum vote or the clear intention of the government to make sure that we leave on 29 March."" Allow Twitter content?

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC people would be ""shocked and very angry"" if any government delayed leaving the EU and it was ""certainly not the intention of the government"". Brexiteer Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg hailed the decision as the right one, but told LBC radio: ""I think this government would find it very difficult to remain the government if it went away from what it said in its manifesto and the referendum result."" A spokeswoman for the European Commission said it would ""take note"" of the judgement, but there was an ""agreement on the table"". ""As President [Jean-Claude] Juncker said, this deal is the best and only deal possible. We will not renegotiate,"" he said.

BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the ruling made staying in the EU ""a real, viable option"" and that may ""sway a few MPs"" in the way they vote.

"This video can not be played 'Breathtaking ignorance' around Brexit There has been ""breathtaking ignorance"" from ""those who believe themselves to be unionists"" who oppose the Northern Ireland backstop in the Brexit deal, Sir John Major has said. The former prime minister made the remarkas Tuesday's vote in the Commons was called off. Theresa May said she would seek assurances from Brussels for the DUP and Brexiteers on the backstop. It is the insurance policy to avoid a return to a hard border after Brexit. The importance of being unionist? Irish have 'poked unionists in the eye' Is the backstop an opportunity or a threat? LIVE: Brexit turbulence hits FTSE Mrs May made a statement to MPs in Parliament on Monday afternoon, and said she had listened to ""widespread and deep concerns"" from MPs about the backstop. The DUP and Brexiteer MPshave vowed to reject the deal unless the backstop is ditched, because they say any differences for Northern Ireland could threaten the union and damage the economy. That is because if the backstop took effect, Northern Ireland alone would align with the EU single market in some areas, meaning new regulatory barriers between GB and NI - Labour has described this as a ""de facto Irish Sea border"". It hasalso said it will vote down the deal in Parliament, along with other opposition parties. Speaking at the inaugural Albert Reynolds Memorial lecture in County Longford, Sir John was critical of those he described as ""believing themselves to be unionists"". He warned of the dangers of violence returning in Northern Ireland, if physical checks or infrastructure were put in place at the border again after Brexit. ""Some opinion has shown a breathtaking ignorance of the likely impact unsettling the Good Friday Agreement will have on Ireland, north and south,"" said the former prime minister. ""To them, the Irish demand for a backstop is a bogus ploy, a bogus ploy to keep the UK in a customs union. ""In truth, a backstop is of vital national interest for Ireland and for the United Kingdom."" He added, however, that despite the turmoil at Westminster, he did not believe that a majority of MPs would permit a hard border to become a reality. ""The reckless few, who are careless of its likely effect are a clear minority, and with good reason."" This video can not be played 'It took over a year and a half to negotiate' Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said it is not possible to renegotiate the Irish border backstop proposal without ""opening up all aspects"" of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. He stressed the current plan was ""the only deal on the table"", which took a year-and-a-half to negotiate. The Irish government has ""already offered a lot of concessions along the way"", which have the support of the other 26 EU member states, added Mr Varadkar. The taoiseach confirmed that he had spoken to European Council President Donald Tusk by phone on Monday afternoon and discussed this week's European Council meeting and the current Brexit situation. Both the EU and UK have committed to ensuring the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland remains as frictionless after Brexit as it is now.

The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop without EU agreement. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Greens, as well as a number of business and agri-food groups,have urged Parliament to back the deal. In a statement, the leaders of those parties urged the backstop to be ""banked"", in order to protect the Good Friday Agreement, they said. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds described the delay on the Brexit vote as a ""shambles"".

The DUP - which props up the government in a confidence-and-supply pact to give Mrs May a working majority - has been putting pressure on the government to ""bin the backstop"".

A summit of EU leaders is still due to take place on Thursday, but the EU Council President Donald Tusk has said Brussels will not renegotiate the deal,  including the backstop. Mrs May has refused to say when the Commons vote on her deal would now be held - saying it would depend how long fresh talks with the EU last. Some MPs called for it to come back to the Commons before Christmas, but Mrs May would only say the final deadline for the vote was 21 January.

"The so-called Stansted 15 broke through a perimeter fence to get to the plane Fifteen protesters who locked themselves around a deportation plane at Stansted Airport have been convicted of an aviation offence. The jet had been chartered by the Home Office to take people from UK detention centres to Africa on 28 March 2017. A jury heard the so-called Stansted 15, who cut through a perimeter fence, had ""placed the safety of the airport in a likelihood of danger"". Amnesty International branded the verdicts a ""blow for human rights"". The group will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court at a later date. One of the activists, Benjamin Smoke, 27, of Rowley Gardens, London, told the court: ""I was fighting to stop the plane deporting people to a place where they would be at risk of being killed or seriously harmed."" Amnesty International's UK director Kate Allen described the verdicts as a ""crushing blow for human rights in the UK"". Protesters outside Chelmsford Crown Court during the trial The court was told the protesters secured themselves around the nose wheel and wing of the Boeing 767, which was due to transport people for repatriation to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. They locked themselves together with pipes and foam, having cut a 3ft by 3ft (1m by 1m) hole in the perimeter fence. Airport security and police spent hours removing the defendants before their arrests and flights in and out of the Essex airport were delayed as a result. The defendants had denied a single charge of intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome. Ms Allen said: ""The terrorism-related charge against these individuals was always a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. ""It's deeply disturbing that peaceful protesters who caused disruption but at no time caused harm to anyone, should now be facing a possible lengthy prison sentence. ""This whole case will send a shiver down the spine of anyone who cares about the right to protest in our country.""

"Crossrail - to be known as the Elizabeth Line - had an original budget set at Â£15.9bn in 2007, which was then cut to Â£14.8bn in 2010 A Â£1.4bn bailout has been announced for Crossrail, as Europe's biggest infrastructure project is pushed back beyond its launch date of autumn 2019. Londonâs Â£15bn route, to be known as the Elizabeth Line, had originally been due to open this month. The rescue plan - the third this year - will be used to plug a predicted Â£2bn hole in the project's finances. The scheme will connect major landmarks such as Heathrow Airport and the Canary Wharf business district. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the deal means ""Crossrail's new leadership can get the job done"". Crossrail received a Â£590m cash injection in July, followed by an ""interim"" Â£350m loan announced in October Transport for London (TfL) estimates it will miss out on at least Â£20m in revenue due to the delay. Between Â£1.6bn and Â£2bn is needed to complete the project, a review by accountancy firm KPMG found. The scheme is currently runningalmost Â£600m over budget,and the previous bailouts have not come without criticism. The project received a Â£590m cash injection in July, followed byan ""interim"" Â£350m loanannounced in October. It wasannounced in Augustthat the route was to open nine months after the original scheduled launch of December 2018 to allow more time for testing. Crossrail said on Monday that the launch had once again been pushed back, and a new ""robust and deliverable schedule"" would be announced later. Elizabeth Line trains are already operating between Shenfield and Liverpool Street, and between Paddington and Hayes & Harlington. When open, the project will help ease London's chronic congestion. Trains will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west through 13 miles of new tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, when fully operational. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes and described the 10-year project as ""hugely complex"". An estimated 200m passengers will use the new underground line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Analysis Tom Edwards, BBC London Transport Correspondent Crossrail was the industry's mega star. The largest infrastructure project in Europe once had its own documentary and was even the backdrop for adverts for nice 4x4s. But the project's catchphrase ""on time and on budget"" has been totally obliterated. And it is Londoners who will have to pay through increased borrowing. All kinds of questions need answering: if the project was in such bad shape why didn't anyone spot it? Who knew what when? This is also a terrible scenario for Transport for London. Its finances were already in a bad way with a Â£1bn deficit. This will have consequences for Tfl. It'll probably mean cuts. Crossrail could one day be a great service and large complicated projects often suffer delays, but this latest announcement goes beyond embarrassment into the realms of calamity. Under the new deal the Greater London Authority (GLA) will borrow up to Â£1.3bn from the Department for Transport, and provide an extra Â£100m itself. The GLA will repay this loan through business rates. Mike Brown, TfL's commissioner, said the extra costs would mean bosses will ""have to look at"" other transport projects in the capital ""but that will all come out in the next few days."" The announcement comes amid a row over when Mr Khan knew about the delays. Sir Terry Morgan,the former chairman of Crossrail Ltd, said the firm had ""raised concerns"" about progress with the mayor in July but had still been working towards a December launch. Mr Khan claimed he only found out about the delay two days before it was made public in late August, despite having regular briefings with the Crossrail board. The mayor said: ""This agreement means that, working with TfL and the Government, Crossrail's new leadership can get the job done."" A DfT spokesman said: ""The government remains committed to the rapid completion of the project, in a way that is fair to UK taxpayers.""

Airport security and police spent hours removing the defendants before their arrests and flights in and out of the Essex airport were delayed as a result. The defendants had denied a single charge of intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome. Ms Allen said: ""The terrorism-related charge against these individuals was always a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. ""It's deeply disturbing that peaceful protesters who caused disruption but at no time caused harm to anyone, should now be facing a possible lengthy prison sentence. ""This whole case will send a shiver down the spine of anyone who cares about the right to protest in our country."" Amnesty International placards were held up outside Chelmsford Crown Court during the trial Brighton Pavilion MP and former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said she found the convictions ""absolutely shocking"".

""These people placed themselves, the flight crew, airport personnel and police at serious risk of injury or even death due to their actions on the airfield.

"Crossrail - to be known as the Elizabeth Line - had an original budget set at Â£15.9bn in 2007, which was then cut to Â£14.8bn in 2010 A Â£1.4bn bailout has been announced for Crossrail, as Europe's biggest infrastructure project is pushed back beyond its launch date of autumn 2019. Londonâs Â£15bn route, to be known as the Elizabeth Line, had originally been due to open this month. The rescue plan - the third this year - will be used to plug a predicted Â£2bn hole in the project's finances. The scheme will connect major landmarks such as Heathrow Airport and the Canary Wharf business district. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the deal means ""Crossrail's new leadership can get the job done"". Crossrail received a Â£590m cash injection in July, followed by an ""interim"" Â£350m loan announced in October Transport for London (TfL) estimates it will miss out on at least Â£20m in revenue due to the delay. Between Â£1.6bn and Â£2bn is needed to complete the project, a review by accountancy firm KPMG found. The scheme is currently runningalmost Â£600m over budget,and the previous bailouts have not come without criticism. The project received a Â£590m cash injection in July, followed byan ""interim"" Â£350m loanannounced in October. It wasannounced in Augustthat the route was to open nine months after the original scheduled launch of December 2018 to allow more time for testing. Crossrail said on Monday that the launch had once again been pushed back, and a new ""robust and deliverable schedule"" would be announced later. Elizabeth Line trains are already operating between Shenfield and Liverpool Street, and between Paddington and Hayes & Harlington. When open, the project will help ease London's chronic congestion. Trains will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west through 13 miles of new tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, when fully operational. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes and described the 10-year project as ""hugely complex"". An estimated 200m passengers will use the new underground line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Analysis Tom Edwards, BBC London Transport Correspondent Crossrail was the industry's mega star. The largest infrastructure project in Europe once had its own documentary and was even the backdrop for adverts for nice 4x4s. But the project's catchphrase ""on time and on budget"" has been totally obliterated. And it is Londoners who will have to pay through increased borrowing. All kinds of questions need answering: if the project was in such bad shape why didn't anyone spot it? Who knew what when? This is also a terrible scenario for Transport for London. Its finances were already in a bad way with a Â£1bn deficit. This will have consequences for Tfl. It'll probably mean cuts. Crossrail could one day be a great service and large complicated projects often suffer delays, but this latest announcement goes beyond embarrassment into the realms of calamity. Under the new deal the Greater London Authority (GLA) will borrow up to Â£1.3bn from the Department for Transport, and provide an extra Â£100m itself. The GLA will repay this loan through business rates. Mike Brown, TfL's commissioner, said the extra costs would mean bosses will ""have to look at"" other transport projects in the capital ""but that will all come out in the next few days."" The announcement comes amid a row over when Mr Khan knew about the delays. Sir Terry Morgan,the former chairman of Crossrail Ltd, said the firm had ""raised concerns"" about progress with the mayor in July but had still been working towards a December launch. Mr Khan claimed he only found out about the delay two days before it was made public in late August, despite having regular briefings with the Crossrail board.

"Interserve holds the contract for cleaning Network Rail stations Shares in Interserve - one of the UK's largest providers of public services - have collapsed after it revealed it is seeking a rescue deal. The firm, which works in prisons, schools, hospitals and on the roads, has Â£500m of debts and says its rescue plan will involve issuing new shares. Its shares initially fell as low as 6.5p, down 70% from Friday, but closed at 11.5p, representing a 53% fall. A year ago, Interserve's shares had been worth 100p each. On Sunday,the firm said it was ""making good progress"" on a recovery plan.,external However, it added that current investors could see the value of their stake in the company slashed, in what it called a ""material dilution for current Interserve shareholders"". Details of the plan, which it said it expected to announce early next year, are yet to be finalised. The government has said it supports the company's long-term recovery plan. On Monday, Interserve was awarded a new Â£25m Welsh public sector contract to help in the redevelopment of Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr. Work is set to start this month. Workers at the Foreign Office and the NHS are among Interserve's tens of thousands of UK employees. Simon Jack, business editor Sources close to Interserve's creditors have told the BBC they accept they may have to write off some of their loans to ensure the company's survival. Lenders described talks around the company's future as ""extremely fluid"". They recognised inevitable comparisons to the situation that engulfed Carillion, but insist the company's management still has lenders' support. The BBC also understands Interserve is expected to announce imminently it has secured new public service contracts. The Labour party leadership - ideologically opposed to the role of private companies in the provision of public services - has insisted that no new government contracts should be awarded to the company while it is in a parlous financial position. That position is widely considered within industry to be detrimental to the future of a company that employs 75,000 worldwide, 45.000 in the UK. Read more from Simon here Interserve said it was in talks about a ""deleveraging plan"", which it said would deliver ""a strong balance sheet"". ""Although the form of the deleveraging plan remains to be finalised, it is likely to involve the conversion of a substantial proportion of the group's external borrowings into new equity, an element of which may be sold to existing shareholders and potentially other investors,"" the firm said. It would be second rescue deal for Interserve, with the company refinancing its debt in March. Its troubles have been blamed on cancellations and delays in its construction contracts as well as struggling waste-to-energy projects in Derby and Glasgow. Interserve claims its prospects are improving, and says it will increase profits this year. From its origins in dredging and construction, the company has diversified into wide range of services, such as health care and catering, for clients in government and industry. At King George Hospital in east London, for instance, Interserve has a Â£35m contract for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5 Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water. But Interserve is also the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice. In a statement, Interserve said: ""The fundamentals of the business are strong and the board is focused on ensuring Interserve has the right financial structure to support its future success."" The company said its options included bringing ""new capital into the business and progressing the disposal of non-core businesses "". Interserve's difficulties follow the collapse of Carillion in January 2018, whichput thousands of jobs at risk and cost taxpayers Â£148m. Interserve shares dive on fears for future Government reassures over Interserve Following that, the government launched a pilot of ""living wills"" for contractors, so that critical services can be taken over in the event of a crisis. Interserve is one of five suppliers taking part. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""We monitor the financial health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Interserve, and have regular discussions with the company's management. The company successfully raised new debt facilities earlier this year, and we fully support them in their long term recovery plan.""

"The Foreign Office has accused Russian state media of trying to discredit a government-funded body that works to counter Kremlin disinformation. A spokesperson said the Institute for Statecraft was hacked several weeks ago and documents were ""published and amplified by Kremlin news channels"". The National Cyber Security Centre is said to be investigating. The FCO comments on the IfS were issued after a news report said the group had retweeted stories critical of Labour. Western officials believe the group involved in the hack is linked to the Russian state. Since then internal documents have been leaked to the Russian media about the organisation's activities, including lists of journalists it had contacted. The Institute for Statecraft is acharity registered in Scotland,externaland based in Gateside, Fife. Scotland'sSunday Mail newspaper ran a story,externalthis weekend that the Integrity Initiative run by the institute had retweeted an article in the New Statesman in April which criticised Labour's support for Russia's position on Syria; an article in the Times in February in which the writer Edward Lucas described Mr Corbyn as the Kremlin's ""useful idiot"", and a Sunday Times magazine piece that criticised Mr Corbyn's aide Seumas Milne for his opinions on Russia. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said he had ordered an immediate investigation after seeing the report, saying ""if there is any kind of organisation for which we are paying which is involved in domestic politics in that way, I would totally condemn it"". Sir Alan confirmed the Foreign Office was funding the institute's Integrity Initiative on 27 Novemberin a written answer to a Parliamentary question,externalfrom Labour MP Chris Williamson. The Foreign Office statement issued later emphasised that the Â£2.2m it had given to the institute over the last two years supported its work to counter disinformation overseas and not in the UK. The spokesperson said the government did not endorse or fund the institute's social media activity. And while insisting that the retweeting showed no systemic bias, she said the institute had agreed to review its editorial policy. The spokesperson said: ""The Institute for Statecraft, an independent charity, was hacked several weeks ago and numerous documents were published and amplified by Kremlin news channels. ""The Russian state media campaign's objective is clear. This is yet another example of Russian disinformation intended to confuse audiences and discredit an organisation which is working independently to tackle the threat of disinformation."" They added: ""The Institute for Statecraft is independent of government and is non-partisan. We fund them on that basis. ""Their retweeting of articles critical of both the government and opposition shows no systemic bias, though they have undertaken to review their editorial policy."" Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said it was ""outrageous"" a Foreign Office-funded initiative ""has routinely been using its Twitter feed to disseminate personal attacks and smears"" against Labour. In a statement, the Institute for Statecraft said: ""In sharing information about such malign activities, the Integrity Initiative uses Twitter as a key method of sharing knowledge. The campaign retweeted links to stories critical of Jeremy Corbyn and his aides ""This includes the usual Twitter practice of re-tweeting and liking tweets. ""However, at no time has the Integrity Initiative engaged in party political activity and would never take up a party-political stance. Disinformation and malign influence from rogue states and certain non-state actors are a threat to democratic values and transcend any party political cause."" A spokesman for the Integrity Initiative did not deny the retweets but pointed out the group had also promoted an article in October about links between the Russian state and Conservative peer Lord Barker of Battle, who is chairman of the Russian energy giant EN+. Correction 27 February 2019: This article has been amended to make clear that western officials believe the hacking of the Institute for Statecraft's computer system was linked to the Russian state.

"The so-called Stansted 15 broke through a perimeter fence to get to the plane Fifteen protesters who locked themselves around a deportation plane at Stansted Airport have been convicted of an aviation offence. The jet had been chartered by the Home Office to take people from UK detention centres to Africa on 28 March 2017. A jury heard the so-called Stansted 15, who cut through a perimeter fence, had ""placed the safety of the airport in a likelihood of danger"". Amnesty International branded the verdicts a ""blow for human rights"". The group will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court at a later date. One of the activists, Benjamin Smoke, 27, of Rowley Gardens, London, told the court: ""I was fighting to stop the plane deporting people to a place where they would be at risk of being killed or seriously harmed."" Amnesty International's UK director Kate Allen described the verdicts as a ""crushing blow for human rights in the UK"". Protesters outside Chelmsford Crown Court during the trial The court was told the protesters secured themselves around the nose wheel and wing of the Boeing 767, which was due to transport people for repatriation to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. They locked themselves together with pipes and foam, having cut a 3ft by 3ft (1m by 1m) hole in the perimeter fence. Airport security and police spent hours removing the defendants before their arrests and flights in and out of the Essex airport were delayed as a result. The defendants had denied a single charge of intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome. Ms Allen said: ""The terrorism-related charge against these individuals was always a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. ""It's deeply disturbing that peaceful protesters who caused disruption but at no time caused harm to anyone, should now be facing a possible lengthy prison sentence. ""This whole case will send a shiver down the spine of anyone who cares about the right to protest in our country."" Amnesty International placards were held up outside Chelmsford Crown Court during the trial Brighton Pavilion MP and former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said she found the convictions ""absolutely shocking"".

"Popkov has been described as Russia's worst serial killer in recent decades (file photo) A Siberian policeman described as Russia's most prolific mass murderer in modern times has been given a second life sentence. Mikhail Popkov, 53, murdered 55 women and a policeman near Irkutsk between 1992 and 2007. He was already in jail for 22 other murders. He killed the victims after offering them late-night rides in his car. At least 10 were also raped. Popkov was caught in 2012 after a DNA match identified his car. The victims were all women between the ages of 16 and 40 apart from one male, a policeman. In three cases he was on duty in his police car. Popkov killed them around the city of Angarsk, near Irkutsk, with an axe and hammer. He dumped their mutilated bodies in forests, by the roadside and in a local cemetery. He claimed to be ""purging"" Angarsk of what he saw as immoral women. The death toll exceeds the 48 murdered by ""chessboard killer"" Alexander Pichushkin, and the 52 murdered by Andrei Chikatilo during the Soviet era. Why were there so many serial killers in the 1980s? Living in the shadow of an unsolved murder Tyre marks from Popkov's Niva car were found next to some of the bodies, which led police to check all owners of that Niva type in Angarsk. The owners' DNA was checked against DNA found on the victims, and that enabled police to identify Popkov. He was arrested en route to Vladivostok, in the far east, where he had gone to buy a new car. He later confessed to 20 murders. His youngest victim was a 15-year-old girl. Popkov in court in Irkutsk: he left the police force in 1998 An Irkutsk court found him guilty of 22 murders in 2015 and sentenced him to life, but he was kept on remand as the investigation had already started into the other murders. Interfax news agency says he told a cellmate that he had killed more people than Chikatilo. Popkov was found to be sane but with a ""pathological attraction to killing people"", according to prosecutors. Some of his victims were found alive but died later in hospital. State Prosecutor Alexander Shkinev said Popkov would now appeal in the hope of retaining his police pension, worth 24,000 roubles a month (Â£284; $361), on the grounds that he had co-operated with the investigators.

"""Nothing is off the table."" To be diplomatic that is rather a shift in tone from No 10 who, this time last week, were telling all who would listen that the divorce deal reached with the rest of the EU was the best available and there was no chance of significant changes. MPs had three choices - Theresa May's deal, no deal, or no Brexit. That's why some Tory MPs were, with gritted teeth, actually on board with the deal. One minister told me ""the prime minister and the attorney general have convinced me"" there is no chance of significant change on the backstop, so they were going to support the agreement. With the prime minister, however, heading for a likely thumping defeat if there is no change, guess what - No 10's tone has rather changed too. The PM is back in touch with some EU leaders, and sources say that they are looking at different options, including potentially reopening the withdrawal agreement, even though they are well aware of the risks that runs. One cabinet minister told me, ""she simply has to get something else"". Brexit: A really simple guide 'Nothing off table' for PM ahead of vote UK can cancel Brexit, says EU court But is this last-minute hope of a shift from the EU real? As my colleagueKatya Adler's explainedthere is nothing straightforward about this. On the face of it, it's pretty extraordinary to imagine that the UK government could be genuinely asking to reopen an agreement that took 18 months to put together, has already been through the grinder on multiple occasions and was only concluded a fortnight ago. But since the ink dried, it has become clear that the chance of getting the deal through Parliament is very small. One minister said, ""it's only a deal if it's ratified"". Perhaps for wavering MPs, even the sign of the PM continuing to push for more will make a difference. It is certainly the case that opposition to the backstop is the main impediment to getting the agreement through Parliament. And both sides acknowledge privately there is a possibility of some kind of clarification, some kind of side letter, to give reassurance. A cynical historian might suggest that if you stand back for a moment, this kind of very, very last-minute haggling was entirely predictable. But trust is low. If there were to be any last-minute concessions, or perhaps more likely the promise that they might emerge, MPs currently in the mood for rebelling would want genuine promises, not a last-minute flimsy buy-off. And whether a solution can be constructed before Tuesday's planned vote is just one question. The bigger one is whether a real way forward can be found at all. MPs may try to steal Brexit, says Liam Fox Three defeats for May in Commons Brexit fight Can the government avoid Brexit defeat?

"The Voyager probes are both outside the heliosphere, a protective bubble created by the Sun that extends beyond the orbit of Pluto The Voyager 2 probe, which left Earth in 1977, has become the second human-made object to leave our Solar System. It was launched 16 days before its twin craft, Voyager 1, but that probe's faster trajectory meant that it was in ""the space between the stars"" six years before Voyager 2. The news was revealed at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in Washington. And chief scientist on the mission, Prof Edward Stone, confirmed it. Voyager 2 launched 16 days before its twin, Voyager 1 He said both probes had now ""made it into interstellar space"" and that Voyager 2's date of departure from the Solar System was 5 November 2018. On that date, the steady stream of particles emitted from the Sun that were being detected by the probe suddenly dipped. This indicated that it had crossed the ""heliopause"" - the term for the outer edge of the Sun's protective bubble of particles and magnetic field. And while its twin craft beat it to this boundary, the US space agency says that Voyager 2 has a working instrument aboard that will provide ""first-of-its-kind observations of the nature of this gateway into interstellar space"". The probe's present location is some 18 billion km (11 billion miles) from Earth. It is moving at roughly 54,000km/h (34,000mph). Voyager 1 is further and faster still, at 22 billion km and 61,000km/h. The probes were launched to explore the outer planets, but have just kept going TheVoyagers,externalwere sent initially to study the outer planets, but then just kept on going. Prof Stone said that at the start of the mission the team had no idea how long it would take them to reach the edge of the Sun's protective bubble, or heliosphere. ""We didn't know how large the bubble was, how long it would take to get there and if the space craft would last long enough,"" he added. ""Now we're studying the very local interstellar medium. ""It's a very exciting time in Voyager's 41 year journey."" Scientists define the Solar System in different ways, so Prof Stone has always been very careful not to use the exact phrase ""leave the Solar System"" in relation to his spacecraft. He is mindful that the Nasa probes still have to pass through the Oort cloud where there are comets gravitationally bound to the Sun, albeit very loosely. But both Voyagers certainly are in a new, unexplored domain of space. Decades and billions of kilometres. Voyager 1 departed Earth on 5 September 1977, a few days after its sister spacecraft, Voyager 2. The pair's primary objective was to survey the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - a task they completed in 1989. They were then steered towards deep space. It is expected that their plutonium power sources will eventually stop supplying electricity, at which point their instruments and their 20W transmitters will die. The Voyager project manager, Suzanne Dodd told BBC News that she would like to see them both keep going until 2027. ""It would be super-exciting to have a 50-year mission still operating,"" she added, describing the probes as ""pioneers"" of interstellar space. ""Every so often they phone home and say - 'I'm still going. Don't forget about me!'"" The Sun sits in an extensive bubble of hot gas called the heliosphere Voyager 1 will not approach another star for nearly 40,000 years, even though it is moving at such great speed. But it will be in orbit around the centre of our galaxy with all its stars for billions of years.

"Alwyn Stockdale worked for the Royal Family for 20 years A retired chauffeur for the Royal Family was to be charged with sexual offences against young boys before he died, the Crown Prosecution Service has said. Alwyn Stockdale, who was 81, was suspected of abusing a boy aged 10 or under and a boy aged nine or under. The alleged offences took place between 1972 and 1975. Mr Stockdale, who worked for the Royal Family between 1972 and 1992, died of natural causes in hospital last week. The CPS, which received a file on the case in August, had decided on 30 November that Mr Stockdale should be prosecuted over four allegations - two charges relating to each boy - but he had not been formally charged. It is alleged he attacked the nine-year-old at his quarters in the Royal Mews, on Buckingham Palace Road. The other boy was allegedly abused in West Yorkshire at the home of a relative of the boy. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said he understood Mr Stockdale was questioned by police and made some admissions, suggesting that at least one of the boys had been a ""willing"" participant. A CPS spokesperson said: ""Following a Metropolitan Police investigation into allegations of non-recent sexual abuse, the CPS authorised four charges against a suspect aged in his 80s.

"Indian business tycoon Vijay Mallya can be extradited from the UK to India where he faces fraud charges, a London court has ruled. The extradition ruling will be passed to the Home Secretary for approval. Mr Mallya, whose business empire once included Kingfisher beer, left India in March 2016 after defaulting on debts of more than $1bn (Â£785m). He denies ""fleeing"" from India, and says he made an ""unconditional"" offer to pay back the sum in full in July. Mr Mallya attended Westminster Magistrates Court for the hearing. Following the hearing, Mr Mallya declined to say if he would appeal against the ruling. ""My legal team will be reviewing the judgment in detail and determining the next steps forward,"" he said. Vijay Mallya: India's most controversial businessman? India's 'King of Good Times' to learn fate The businessman's fall from grace is being avidly tracked in India, where he was once listed as one of India's wealthiest people. Mr Mallya built his fortune from Kingfisher beer, before branching out into Indian cricket and Formula 1 racing. He set up the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines in 2005. He faces a raft of charges relating to financial irregularities at Kingfisher Airlines. His monetary affairs are being investigated by India's Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate, which handles financial crimes. Nick Vamos, partner at Peters & Peters and former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, said the court decision was ""a hugely significant judgment for the Indian government"". ""Although Mr Mallya failed to convince the court that his prosecution was politically motivated, the Indian authorities pulled out all of the stops to achieve this result and undoubtedly will try to make political capital from it back home. ""However, they would be wise not to be too triumphalist as Mr Mallya has 14 days to appeal to the High Court, who might look askance at excessive gloating in the meantime,"" he added. Vijay Mallya entered the court surrounded by a scrum of reporters shouting questions in English and Hindi. As we stood in line for our turn at the x-ray machine, Mr Mallya told me that he believed ""clearly this is extremely political, it's really obvious"". While awaiting his hearing, Mr Mallya paced around the corridors, intermittently sitting among reporters in the public gallery. When his case was called, Mr Mallya heard a detailed judgement against him, which concluded with the judge saying he should be extradited to stand trial in India. From the scrum to the judgement, Mr Mallya appeared calm - relaxed even. The case is now in the hands of Home Secretary, Sajid Javid. In 2012, Mr Mallya sold a majority stake in his United Spirits group to UK drinks giant Diageo. The deal was supposed to help Mr Mallya reduce United Spirits' debts and free up funds for Kingfisher Airlines. But the airline, which was grounded in 2012, lost its flying permit the following year. It made annual losses for five years in a row and finally collapsed after lenders refused to give it fresh loans.

"Debate on reconciliation in foreign policy and international development Georgina Pattinson Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Cancel Brexit, hand the decision to backbenchers or members of the public - or get the Queen involved? Thanks for joining us for today's debate. We'll be back on Monday at 2.30pm for the last week in Westminster before the Christmas recess. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament The Most Revd Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, points to contributions in the debate, and he says one phrase that stuck with him was ""costly forgiveness"". Another point that has come out of the debate is the importance of values, which ""give real authority"" to our interventions, he says. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Defence Minister Earl Howe says that reconciliation is a vital part of ending conflict and also preventing a relapse into conflict. What the debate has highlighted is that the government needs to do more with civil society, supporting grass roots figures such as church leaders and those in the private sector - and he points to the work of the British Council. He says the government must collaborate more closely with international partners to prevent conflict. But peacekeeping is becoming more dangerous, he says. He says the aid budget is designed to tackle great global challenges, including migration and terrorism, as well as climate change. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Collins of Highbury says the US president Donald Trump's tweets have been increasingly inflammatory, and they have impact beyond the US's borders. The maintenance of a rules-based international order has been tough in the face of challenges, he says. ""We need to do a better job of making the case than we have in the past,"" Lord Collins says. That includes supporting the UN, Nato and the World Trade Organisation. The Labour party would support a renewed commitment to internationalism, he says, developing sanctions and soft power as a response. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Lib Dem Lord Alderdice says the debate has included moving contributions. He says there is an important role for the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces; as well as the Department for International Development. But if ""it's not done in the right way"", he says, things go wrong. He cites Northern Ireland, saying money was put in there but it led to ""upwardly mobile terrorists"". The PM says her Brexit deal is ""at risk"", as her performance at an EU summit is called ""bad"" by diplomats. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Lord Jay of Ewelme, a crossbench or independent peer, and a former ambassador to France, says it is possible to conduct a foreign policy based on self interest. But he says if the UK seeks to follow moral values abroad, then those need to apply at home too. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Reconciliation in conflict zones is a necessary condition for lasting peace, Conservative peer Baroness Brady says. She says it is apposite that today's debate is called by the Archbishop of Canterbury, she says, because often faith-based organisations are all that is left in conflict areas. She says, though, that she doesn't believe it is right for the UK government to be involved. It is difficult to justify using taxpayers' money in such instances, and often there is a low chance of success, she says. The UK government should act but it is the armed forces who should be involved to bring about peace - and it is then that international development agencies and NGOs should be involved. She calls for the international aid budget to be repurposed to the defence budget and the UK's commitment to Nato. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Trimble is the next peer to speak. Lord Trimble was the first First Minister of Northern Ireland, from 1998 to 2002 and the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. He was instrumental in the party's acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement. He says he recognises the phrase ""bottom up"" when it comes to reconciliation - attempts to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland failed because they were not based in the local communities. Lord Trimble says he believes that although the two main parties in Northern Ireland today - the DUP and Sinn Fein - have fallen out, leading to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, he has ""no doubt"" that will be resolved.

Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament The Archbishop says the week past has been a week of deep division and although the debate focuses on foreign affairs, it could apply to the UK. He tells peers that at the heart of the church, is reconciliation. In a human world, ""disagreeing well"" is crucial, and says this is a theme he will return to. Welcome to our coverage of today in the House of Lords. The Archbishop of Canterbury has tabled today's debate on the role of reconciliation in British foreign, defence and international development policy. One Police and Crime Commissioner says it is still not enough, as crime rises. The Lords debate on young people finishes - they will now hear a repeat of the statement in the Commons earlier on police funding. However that's where we leave our coverage of Parliament for today. MPs are back in the Commons next Monday - do join us then. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Education Minister Lord Agnew of Oulton says the government has committed Â£70m for careers advisers in schools, which he calls an ""extremely important priority"". The government is delivering a ""manifesto commitment"" to address ""poor outcomes"" for children in need of ""help and protection"", he says. ""Bullying can come in many forms,"" he says, adding that it is no longer confined to the classroom. He adds that the number of people on zero-hour contracts is down on previous years. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Griffiths of Burry Port says young person with ""splendid A levels"" recently told him he didn't want to go to university because becoming a lawyer ""takes too long"" and there are too many obstacles for black people. Lord Griffiths said he told him there was too much quick money to be made in crime, football, drugs and fame. He says universities often insist their admissions processes are ""egalitarian"", but he adds they are ""anything but"". House of CommonsParliament The debate on a public health approach to youth violence has now ended. The last item of business tonight is a short adjournment debate on rural post offices, led by Tory MP Derek Thomas. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat education spokesman Lord Storey says four out of five people under the age of 13 have a social media presence. ""We cannot put the internet genie back in the bottle,"" he says, advocating education on using the internet rather than restricting it. He says that local support services for young people have been reduced by government cuts. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The so-called Stansted 15 broke through a perimeter fence to get to the plane Fifteen protesters who locked themselves around a deportation plane at Stansted Airport have been convicted of an aviation offence. The jet had been chartered by the Home Office to take people from UK detention centres to Africa on 28 March 2017. A jury heard the so-called Stansted 15, who cut through a perimeter fence, had ""placed the safety of the airport in a likelihood of danger"". Amnesty International branded the verdicts a ""blow for human rights"". The group will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court at a later date. One of the activists, Benjamin Smoke, 27, of Rowley Gardens, London, told the court: ""I was fighting to stop the plane deporting people to a place where they would be at risk of being killed or seriously harmed."" Amnesty International's UK director Kate Allen described the verdicts as a ""crushing blow for human rights in the UK"". Protesters outside Chelmsford Crown Court during the trial The court was told the protesters secured themselves around the nose wheel and wing of the Boeing 767, which was due to transport people for repatriation to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. They locked themselves together with pipes and foam, having cut a 3ft by 3ft (1m by 1m) hole in the perimeter fence. Airport security and police spent hours removing the defendants before their arrests and flights in and out of the Essex airport were delayed as a result. The defendants had denied a single charge of intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome. Ms Allen said: ""The terrorism-related charge against these individuals was always a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. ""It's deeply disturbing that peaceful protesters who caused disruption but at no time caused harm to anyone, should now be facing a possible lengthy prison sentence. ""This whole case will send a shiver down the spine of anyone who cares about the right to protest in our country."" Amnesty International placards were held up outside Chelmsford Crown Court during the trial Brighton Pavilion MP and former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said she found the convictions ""absolutely shocking"".

Judith Reed, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Fifteen protesters used equipment such as industrial bolt cutters, chains, expanding foam, scaffolding poles and lock box devices to prevent the take-off of a plane. ""These people placed themselves, the flight crew, airport personnel and police at serious risk of injury or even death due to their actions on the airfield. ""The CPS worked with the police to build a strong case which reflected the criminality of the defendant's actions, regardless of their motivation.""

"Crossrail - to be known as the Elizabeth Line - had an original budget set at Â£15.9bn in 2007, which was then cut to Â£14.8bn in 2010 A Â£1.4bn bailout has been announced for Crossrail, as Europe's biggest infrastructure project is pushed back beyond its launch date of autumn 2019. Londonâs Â£15bn route, to be known as the Elizabeth Line, had originally been due to open this month. The rescue plan - the third this year - will be used to plug a predicted Â£2bn hole in the project's finances. The scheme will connect major landmarks such as Heathrow Airport and the Canary Wharf business district. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the deal means ""Crossrail's new leadership can get the job done"". Crossrail received a Â£590m cash injection in July, followed by an ""interim"" Â£350m loan announced in October Transport for London (TfL) estimates it will miss out on at least Â£20m in revenue due to the delay. Between Â£1.6bn and Â£2bn is needed to complete the project, a review by accountancy firm KPMG found. The scheme is currently runningalmost Â£600m over budget,and the previous bailouts have not come without criticism. The project received a Â£590m cash injection in July, followed byan ""interim"" Â£350m loanannounced in October. It wasannounced in Augustthat the route was to open nine months after the original scheduled launch of December 2018 to allow more time for testing. Crossrail said on Monday that the launch had once again been pushed back, and a new ""robust and deliverable schedule"" would be announced later. Elizabeth Line trains are already operating between Shenfield and Liverpool Street, and between Paddington and Hayes & Harlington. When open, the project will help ease London's chronic congestion. Trains will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west through 13 miles of new tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, when fully operational. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes and described the 10-year project as ""hugely complex"". An estimated 200m passengers will use the new underground line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Analysis Tom Edwards, BBC London Transport Correspondent Crossrail was the industry's mega star. The largest infrastructure project in Europe once had its own documentary and was even the backdrop for adverts for nice 4x4s. But the project's catchphrase ""on time and on budget"" has been totally obliterated. And it is Londoners who will have to pay through increased borrowing. All kinds of questions need answering: if the project was in such bad shape why didn't anyone spot it? Who knew what when? This is also a terrible scenario for Transport for London. Its finances were already in a bad way with a Â£1bn deficit. This will have consequences for Tfl. It'll probably mean cuts. Crossrail could one day be a great service and large complicated projects often suffer delays, but this latest announcement goes beyond embarrassment into the realms of calamity. Under the new deal the Greater London Authority (GLA) will borrow up to Â£1.3bn from the Department for Transport, and provide an extra Â£100m itself. The GLA will repay this loan through business rates. Mike Brown, TfL's commissioner, said the extra costs would mean bosses will ""have to look at"" other transport projects in the capital ""but that will all come out in the next few days."" The announcement comes amid a row over when Mr Khan knew about the delays. Sir Terry Morgan,the former chairman of Crossrail Ltd, said the firm had ""raised concerns"" about progress with the mayor in July but had still been working towards a December launch. Mr Khan claimed he only found out about the delay two days before it was made public in late August, despite having regular briefings with the Crossrail board. The mayor said: ""This agreement means that, working with TfL and the Government, Crossrail's new leadership can get the job done."" A DfT spokesman said: ""The government remains committed to the rapid completion of the project, in a way that is fair to UK taxpayers.""

BeyoncÃ© took to the stage on Sunday night for the sangeet, an evening of music and dance that typically precedes the wedding. She shared photos on her Instagram account of her jewel-studded outfit and elaborate gold jewellery. Her fee hasn't been made public, but would likely not have been a problem for the Ambanis.

"Growth in the UK's economy has slowed as car sales fell and the manufacturing sector stalled, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. The economy grew by 0.4% in the three months to October, slower than the 0.6% in the three months to September. The UK's trade deficit also widened as imports grew faster than exports in October. Economists expect growth to slow in the last three months of the year. The latest three-month growth figure follows a stronger-than-expected set of data for the three months to September, when the economy grew at its fastest pace since late 2016 buoyed by consumers spending in the warm weather. ""GDP growth slowed going into the autumn after a strong summer, with a softening in services sector growth mainly due to a fall in car sales,"" said  Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS. ""This was offset by a strong showing from IT and accountancy."" ""Manufacturing saw no growth at all in the latest three months, mainly due to a decline in the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry,"" he added. ""Construction, while slowing slightly, continued its recent solid performance with growth in housebuilding and infrastructure."" The services sector grew by 0.3% on the three-month rolling measure - the lowest since the three months to April 2018. The sector's performance is closely watched as it makes up 80% of the economy. There were some negative signs in the latest economic growth figures, but on the whole they were benign, with services such as accountancy driving modest economic growth. But here we meet the frustration of lagging economic indicators. If we want to know what effect the upheaval at Westminster over the Brexit withdrawal agreement has had, the more recent indicators tell a less benign story. In November, retail sales grew by 0.5 per cent overall (including online). But if you exclude food they were flat, and sales in shops were down. Similarly, the leading indicator of business activity, the purchasing managers' index which tracks buying decisions by business executives, recorded its worst reading in the services sector since the month after the referendum, July 2016. Activity expanded, but only just. Unfortunately we won't know the effect of Theresa May's troubles on November's economic growth (GDP) until January, by which time it will be far too late to influence decision making. GDP grew by 0.1% in October - after being flat in both September and August. In October, the first month of the last quarter of the year, the services sector was the only major part of the economy to expand. Industrial production fell 0.6%, with manufacturing output down 0.9%. Output in the construction industry fell 0.2%. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the latest growth figures ""come on the heels of more up-to-date survey evidence which suggests the economy is approaching stall speed and could even contract as we move into 2019 unless demand revives"". In October, the UK imported more than it exported despite the weakness in the pound. The trade deficit widened to Â£3.1bn in October, the ONS said, as imports increased by Â£3.6bn, faster than the amount exported, which rose by Â£1.9bn. The ONS also revised the trade data for September, which now shows a deficit of Â£2.3bn compared with Â£0.1bn. ""The widening in the UK's trade deficit is a concern and reflects a sharp rise in goods imports,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). ""Trading conditions for UK exporters are deteriorating amid moderating global growth and uncertainty over Brexit. Businesses continue to report that the persistent weakness in sterling is hurting as much as its helping, with the weakening currency raising input costs."" With October marking the start of the fourth quarter, economists said the economy's progress in remaining months of the year could be determined by Brexit negotiations. Mr Williamson said: ""The outlook for growth... very much depends on Brexit developments over the coming days, weeks and months, and the surrounding uncertainty makes forecasting extremely difficult. ""However, what's clearly evident is that the widely-expected slowing of the economy in the lead-up to the UK's separation from the EU is now upon us, leaving the big question of whether the economy will bounce back alongside a smooth Brexit process or slide into decline,"" he said. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said that surveys of the services sector were also showing weak growth which do ""not augur well"" for the last quarter of the year. Capital Economics is forecasting annual GDP growth of 1.3% for this year - the lowest since the financial crisis.

Goldman Sach's chief economist thinks further rises in US interest rates are on hold until the middle of next year. Tougher financial conditions and trade uncertainties are likely to dampen any Federal Reserve rate hike in the very near term. ""We think the probability of a move
in March has now fallen to slightly below 50%,"" Goldman's
Jan Hatzius wrote in a research note. But ""we see a return to quarterly
hikes in June that last through the end of 2019"". US stocks staged a modest recovery on Monday after the turmoil of last week. At the close of trading, the Dow was up 0.14% or 34.31 points at 24,423.26, while the broader-based S&P 500 was 0.18% or 4.64 points higher at 2,637.72. The high-tech Nasdaq rose 0.74% or 51.27 points to 7,020.52. French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a â¬100-per month increase in the minimum wage from next year 
in a major concession to ""yellow vest"" protesters. The minimum wage was set at â¬1,498 per month pre-tax in 2018 and â¬1,185 after tax. He also rolled back most of an unpopular increase in taxes on 
pensioners which was introduced by his government. In an address to the nation this evening, the former investment banker also 
struck a more humble tone than usual as he sought to address criticism of his 
style of leadership. ""I know that I have hurt some of you with my statements,"" he said. The S&P 500 has turned positive with help from technology stocks in a volatile session. The energy index was the S&P's biggest percentage loser
followed by financials, which have been dogged by worries about
cooling global growth, interest rates and trade tensions. But an afternoon comeback in Apple shares
appeared to cheer up investors in the broader technology sector. The Dow Jones was up 0.04% at 24,398.6 points, while the S&P 500
 gained 0.14% to 2,636.7. The
Nasdaq added 0.79% to
7,023.9. After a sea of red in the morning, seven of the 11 major S&P
sectors were positive by late afternoon. The technology sector
 led the gainers with a 1.4% gain. Apple was trading up 0.6% at $169.54
after hitting a low of $163.33 earlier in the day.

GoPro is pulling production out of China of its cameras that are destined for the US market to avoid tariffs. Cameras for countries other than the US will remain 
in China, according to the Silicon Valley-based electronics firm. ""Today's geopolitical business environment requires agility, and we're 
proactively addressing tariff concerns by moving most of our US-bound camera 
production out of China,"" said GoPro finance director Brian McGee. The company gave no details on 
where it would relocate the production. Apple's confident rebuff to Qualcomm's claim that some iPhone models will be temporarily blocked from sale in China seems to have calmed investor nerves. The tech giant says all its models remain on sale in the country, and it will go to court to ensure that continues. Apple shares opened more than 2% down, but are now up about 0.2%. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says her party would support a no confidence motion in the UK government if it was proposed by the main opposition. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, Japan correspondent writes The new charges against Carlos Ghosnwill allow prosecutors
to continue detaining him until 30 December. His interrogations will continue and can be done without the former chairman of Nissan having his lawyer present. In Japan, there is nothing surprising about this. But
elsewhere there has been real shock at the draconian nature of Japanâs justice
system. US attorney Professor Alan Dershowitz today likened
Japanâs system to that of authoritarian regimes like Iran, Cuba and even
China. Secondly, Mr Ghosn has been effectively accused of the
same offence twice. The new arrest warrant accuses him of under-reporting his
pay for a further three years, between 2016 and 2018). A former prosecutor I have spoken to says this suggests the
Tokyo prosecutors have no other evidence of wrong doing against Mr Ghosn. If that is the case, the former prosecutor told me, the case
against Mr Ghosn is very weak. But he says, because it is such a high-profile case, they
will feel compelled to press charges and take the case to its conclusion. We reported earlier that chip maker Qualcomm said it has been granted injunctions against Apple in China that prevent the sale of some iPhone handsets. Qualcomm makes a range of semiconductor and telecommunications equipment, and the Snapdragon processors used in most Android smartphones. As you might expect, Apple is not taking this lying down and has issued this statement: ""Qualcommâs effort to ban our products is another desperate
move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators
around the world. ""All iPhone models remain available for our customers in
China. Qualcomm is asserting three patents they had never raised before,
including one which has already been invalidated. ""We will pursue all our legal
options through the courts.â Business leaders may understand the political reasons for the delay, but todayâs announcement will be viewed by most as another extension of the frustration and uncertainty. While we wish the government well in their attempts to seek further assurances about the backstop, the clock is ticking and one of the only things we know for certain is that our exit date has been written into UK law for next March.  Many companies are still in the dark about what HMRC and border agencies would require the day after Brexit if there is no transition period. Partly because of a lack of information, only 14% of Institute of Directors members say they are fully prepared to manage no-deal, highlighting the scale of the challenge if a withdrawal agreement isnât ratified.â Stephen Martin, Director general, Institute of Directors Sky's economics editor tweets: Allow Twitter content?

investigating a former anti-money laundering official of
Deutsche Bank on suspicion of money laundering,
German broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk reported on Monday. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment, according to Reuters. It's unclear at the moment if the news is related to a police raid on the offices of the German banking giant on 29 November. Firms are looking on with utter dismay at the ongoing saga in Westminster, and express concern that politicians are seemingly acting in their own interest, with little regard for the millions of people whose livelihoods depend on the success of UK business and trade. Many business leaders will be intensely frustrated by yet another delay in this drawn-out process, which impacts real-world business conditions, not least currency markets.  âBusinesses are clear that time is rapidly running out. With just over 100 days to go until the 29th of March, many are already enacting contingency plans in the absence of clarity from Westminster. Even basic business planning for next year has become difficult, if not impossible, for many firms and their investors.  âBusinesses need clarity and precision on the UKâs future relationship with the EU and with other key trading partners. Businesses are clear that they do not want a messy and disorderly exit, which both government and far too many firms are underprepared for.""

"Debate on reconciliation in foreign policy and international development Georgina Pattinson Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Cancel Brexit, hand the decision to backbenchers or members of the public - or get the Queen involved? Thanks for joining us for today's debate. We'll be back on Monday at 2.30pm for the last week in Westminster before the Christmas recess. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament The Most Revd Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, points to contributions in the debate, and he says one phrase that stuck with him was ""costly forgiveness"". Another point that has come out of the debate is the importance of values, which ""give real authority"" to our interventions, he says. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Defence Minister Earl Howe says that reconciliation is a vital part of ending conflict and also preventing a relapse into conflict. What the debate has highlighted is that the government needs to do more with civil society, supporting grass roots figures such as church leaders and those in the private sector - and he points to the work of the British Council. He says the government must collaborate more closely with international partners to prevent conflict. But peacekeeping is becoming more dangerous, he says. He says the aid budget is designed to tackle great global challenges, including migration and terrorism, as well as climate change. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Collins of Highbury says the US president Donald Trump's tweets have been increasingly inflammatory, and they have impact beyond the US's borders. The maintenance of a rules-based international order has been tough in the face of challenges, he says. ""We need to do a better job of making the case than we have in the past,"" Lord Collins says. That includes supporting the UN, Nato and the World Trade Organisation. The Labour party would support a renewed commitment to internationalism, he says, developing sanctions and soft power as a response. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Lib Dem Lord Alderdice says the debate has included moving contributions. He says there is an important role for the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces; as well as the Department for International Development. But if ""it's not done in the right way"", he says, things go wrong. He cites Northern Ireland, saying money was put in there but it led to ""upwardly mobile terrorists"". The PM says her Brexit deal is ""at risk"", as her performance at an EU summit is called ""bad"" by diplomats. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Lord Jay of Ewelme, a crossbench or independent peer, and a former ambassador to France, says it is possible to conduct a foreign policy based on self interest. But he says if the UK seeks to follow moral values abroad, then those need to apply at home too. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Reconciliation in conflict zones is a necessary condition for lasting peace, Conservative peer Baroness Brady says. She says it is apposite that today's debate is called by the Archbishop of Canterbury, she says, because often faith-based organisations are all that is left in conflict areas. She says, though, that she doesn't believe it is right for the UK government to be involved. It is difficult to justify using taxpayers' money in such instances, and often there is a low chance of success, she says. The UK government should act but it is the armed forces who should be involved to bring about peace - and it is then that international development agencies and NGOs should be involved. She calls for the international aid budget to be repurposed to the defence budget and the UK's commitment to Nato. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Trimble is the next peer to speak. Lord Trimble was the first First Minister of Northern Ireland, from 1998 to 2002 and the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. He was instrumental in the party's acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement. He says he recognises the phrase ""bottom up"" when it comes to reconciliation - attempts to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland failed because they were not based in the local communities. Lord Trimble says he believes that although the two main parties in Northern Ireland today - the DUP and Sinn Fein - have fallen out, leading to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, he has ""no doubt"" that will be resolved.

Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament The Archbishop says the week past has been a week of deep division and although the debate focuses on foreign affairs, it could apply to the UK. He tells peers that at the heart of the church, is reconciliation. In a human world, ""disagreeing well"" is crucial, and says this is a theme he will return to. Welcome to our coverage of today in the House of Lords. The Archbishop of Canterbury has tabled today's debate on the role of reconciliation in British foreign, defence and international development policy. One Police and Crime Commissioner says it is still not enough, as crime rises. The Lords debate on young people finishes - they will now hear a repeat of the statement in the Commons earlier on police funding. However that's where we leave our coverage of Parliament for today. MPs are back in the Commons next Monday - do join us then. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Education Minister Lord Agnew of Oulton says the government has committed Â£70m for careers advisers in schools, which he calls an ""extremely important priority"". The government is delivering a ""manifesto commitment"" to address ""poor outcomes"" for children in need of ""help and protection"", he says. ""Bullying can come in many forms,"" he says, adding that it is no longer confined to the classroom. He adds that the number of people on zero-hour contracts is down on previous years. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Griffiths of Burry Port says young person with ""splendid A levels"" recently told him he didn't want to go to university because becoming a lawyer ""takes too long"" and there are too many obstacles for black people. Lord Griffiths said he told him there was too much quick money to be made in crime, football, drugs and fame. He says universities often insist their admissions processes are ""egalitarian"", but he adds they are ""anything but"". House of CommonsParliament The debate on a public health approach to youth violence has now ended. The last item of business tonight is a short adjournment debate on rural post offices, led by Tory MP Derek Thomas. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat education spokesman Lord Storey says four out of five people under the age of 13 have a social media presence. ""We cannot put the internet genie back in the bottle,"" he says, advocating education on using the internet rather than restricting it. He says that local support services for young people have been reduced by government cuts. Â© 2025 BBC.

Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Collins of Highbury says the US president Donald Trump's tweets have been increasingly inflammatory, and they have impact beyond the US's borders. The maintenance of a rules-based international order has been tough in the face of challenges, he says. ""We need to do a better job of making the case than we have in the past,"" Lord Collins says. That includes supporting the UN, Nato and the World Trade Organisation. The Labour party would support a renewed commitment to internationalism, he says, developing sanctions and soft power as a response. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Lib Dem Lord Alderdice says the debate has included moving contributions. He says there is an important role for the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces; as well as the Department for International Development. But if ""it's not done in the right way"", he says, things go wrong. He cites Northern Ireland, saying money was put in there but it led to ""upwardly mobile terrorists"". The PM says her Brexit deal is ""at risk"", as her performance at an EU summit is called ""bad"" by diplomats. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Lord Jay of Ewelme, a crossbench or independent peer, and a former ambassador to France, says it is possible to conduct a foreign policy based on self interest. But he says if the UK seeks to follow moral values abroad, then those need to apply at home too. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Reconciliation in conflict zones is a necessary condition for lasting peace, Conservative peer Baroness Brady says. She says it is apposite that today's debate is called by the Archbishop of Canterbury, she says, because often faith-based organisations are all that is left in conflict areas. She says, though, that she doesn't believe it is right for the UK government to be involved. It is difficult to justify using taxpayers' money in such instances, and often there is a low chance of success, she says. The UK government should act but it is the armed forces who should be involved to bring about peace - and it is then that international development agencies and NGOs should be involved. She calls for the international aid budget to be repurposed to the defence budget and the UK's commitment to Nato. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Trimble is the next peer to speak. Lord Trimble was the first First Minister of Northern Ireland, from 1998 to 2002 and the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. He was instrumental in the party's acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement. He says he recognises the phrase ""bottom up"" when it comes to reconciliation - attempts to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland failed because they were not based in the local communities. Lord Trimble says he believes that although the two main parties in Northern Ireland today - the DUP and Sinn Fein - have fallen out, leading to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, he has ""no doubt"" that will be resolved.

Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament The Archbishop says the week past has been a week of deep division and although the debate focuses on foreign affairs, it could apply to the UK. He tells peers that at the heart of the church, is reconciliation. In a human world, ""disagreeing well"" is crucial, and says this is a theme he will return to. Welcome to our coverage of today in the House of Lords. The Archbishop of Canterbury has tabled today's debate on the role of reconciliation in British foreign, defence and international development policy. One Police and Crime Commissioner says it is still not enough, as crime rises. The Lords debate on young people finishes - they will now hear a repeat of the statement in the Commons earlier on police funding. However that's where we leave our coverage of Parliament for today. MPs are back in the Commons next Monday - do join us then. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Education Minister Lord Agnew of Oulton says the government has committed Â£70m for careers advisers in schools, which he calls an ""extremely important priority"". The government is delivering a ""manifesto commitment"" to address ""poor outcomes"" for children in need of ""help and protection"", he says. ""Bullying can come in many forms,"" he says, adding that it is no longer confined to the classroom. He adds that the number of people on zero-hour contracts is down on previous years. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Griffiths of Burry Port says young person with ""splendid A levels"" recently told him he didn't want to go to university because becoming a lawyer ""takes too long"" and there are too many obstacles for black people. Lord Griffiths said he told him there was too much quick money to be made in crime, football, drugs and fame. He says universities often insist their admissions processes are ""egalitarian"", but he adds they are ""anything but"". House of CommonsParliament The debate on a public health approach to youth violence has now ended. The last item of business tonight is a short adjournment debate on rural post offices, led by Tory MP Derek Thomas. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat education spokesman Lord Storey says four out of five people under the age of 13 have a social media presence. ""We cannot put the internet genie back in the bottle,"" he says, advocating education on using the internet rather than restricting it. He says that local support services for young people have been reduced by government cuts. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Walkers said packets kept the crisps fresher for longer and therefore cut food waste A recycling scheme for crisp packets has been launched by Walkers after it was targeted by protests on the issue. Walkers was the focus of a campaign where its crisp packets were posted back to the snack firm, which led to problems at Royal Mail sorting offices. Now the company said it had put in place collection points across the UK and also offers a free courier service. Environmental group Beach Guardian welcomed the move, but said ""the most vital thing is that people use it"". Campaigner Emily Stevenson with a Walkers crisp packet with a sell by date from 1997 - the year she was born Leicester-based Walkers had faced months of criticism that its metallised plastic packets were contributing to litter and marine pollution.

Another campaign saw people encouraged to post packets back to Walkers,prompting Royal Mail to interveneas the plastic pouches were slowing down its systems. PepsiCo launches bid for Pipers Crisps Crisp packets solution 'needed now' 'Don't post crisp packets without envelopes' The new recycling scheme was first announced in the summer,but is officially launched on Monday,external. A spokesman for Walkers said: ""Crisp packets are technically recyclable, the issue until now has been that they weren't being separated or collected for recycling. ""This scheme will tap into an established network of recycling collection points around the UK. ""It is simple and free to use, all brands of crisp packets will be accepted and will ultimately be turned into other basic plastic items."" It is planned the packets will be recycled into basic household items Those who cannot get to a recycling centre can use a dedicated courier service free of charge, the company said.

Goldman Sach's chief economist thinks further rises in US interest rates are on hold until the middle of next year. Tougher financial conditions and trade uncertainties are likely to dampen any Federal Reserve rate hike in the very near term. ""We think the probability of a move
in March has now fallen to slightly below 50%,"" Goldman's
Jan Hatzius wrote in a research note. But ""we see a return to quarterly
hikes in June that last through the end of 2019"". US stocks staged a modest recovery on Monday after the turmoil of last week. At the close of trading, the Dow was up 0.14% or 34.31 points at 24,423.26, while the broader-based S&P 500 was 0.18% or 4.64 points higher at 2,637.72. The high-tech Nasdaq rose 0.74% or 51.27 points to 7,020.52. French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a â¬100-per month increase in the minimum wage from next year 
in a major concession to ""yellow vest"" protesters. The minimum wage was set at â¬1,498 per month pre-tax in 2018 and â¬1,185 after tax. He also rolled back most of an unpopular increase in taxes on 
pensioners which was introduced by his government. In an address to the nation this evening, the former investment banker also 
struck a more humble tone than usual as he sought to address criticism of his 
style of leadership. ""I know that I have hurt some of you with my statements,"" he said. The S&P 500 has turned positive with help from technology stocks in a volatile session. The energy index was the S&P's biggest percentage loser
followed by financials, which have been dogged by worries about
cooling global growth, interest rates and trade tensions. But an afternoon comeback in Apple shares
appeared to cheer up investors in the broader technology sector. The Dow Jones was up 0.04% at 24,398.6 points, while the S&P 500
 gained 0.14% to 2,636.7. The
Nasdaq added 0.79% to
7,023.9. After a sea of red in the morning, seven of the 11 major S&P
sectors were positive by late afternoon. The technology sector
 led the gainers with a 1.4% gain. Apple was trading up 0.6% at $169.54
after hitting a low of $163.33 earlier in the day.

GoPro is pulling production out of China of its cameras that are destined for the US market to avoid tariffs. Cameras for countries other than the US will remain 
in China, according to the Silicon Valley-based electronics firm. ""Today's geopolitical business environment requires agility, and we're 
proactively addressing tariff concerns by moving most of our US-bound camera 
production out of China,"" said GoPro finance director Brian McGee. The company gave no details on 
where it would relocate the production. Apple's confident rebuff to Qualcomm's claim that some iPhone models will be temporarily blocked from sale in China seems to have calmed investor nerves. The tech giant says all its models remain on sale in the country, and it will go to court to ensure that continues. Apple shares opened more than 2% down, but are now up about 0.2%. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says her party would support a no confidence motion in the UK government if it was proposed by the main opposition. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, Japan correspondent writes The new charges against Carlos Ghosnwill allow prosecutors
to continue detaining him until 30 December. His interrogations will continue and can be done without the former chairman of Nissan having his lawyer present. In Japan, there is nothing surprising about this. But
elsewhere there has been real shock at the draconian nature of Japanâs justice
system. US attorney Professor Alan Dershowitz today likened
Japanâs system to that of authoritarian regimes like Iran, Cuba and even
China. Secondly, Mr Ghosn has been effectively accused of the
same offence twice. The new arrest warrant accuses him of under-reporting his
pay for a further three years, between 2016 and 2018). A former prosecutor I have spoken to says this suggests the
Tokyo prosecutors have no other evidence of wrong doing against Mr Ghosn. If that is the case, the former prosecutor told me, the case
against Mr Ghosn is very weak. But he says, because it is such a high-profile case, they
will feel compelled to press charges and take the case to its conclusion. We reported earlier that chip maker Qualcomm said it has been granted injunctions against Apple in China that prevent the sale of some iPhone handsets. Qualcomm makes a range of semiconductor and telecommunications equipment, and the Snapdragon processors used in most Android smartphones. As you might expect, Apple is not taking this lying down and has issued this statement: ""Qualcommâs effort to ban our products is another desperate
move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators
around the world. ""All iPhone models remain available for our customers in
China. Qualcomm is asserting three patents they had never raised before,
including one which has already been invalidated. ""We will pursue all our legal
options through the courts.â Business leaders may understand the political reasons for the delay, but todayâs announcement will be viewed by most as another extension of the frustration and uncertainty. While we wish the government well in their attempts to seek further assurances about the backstop, the clock is ticking and one of the only things we know for certain is that our exit date has been written into UK law for next March.  Many companies are still in the dark about what HMRC and border agencies would require the day after Brexit if there is no transition period.

investigating a former anti-money laundering official of
Deutsche Bank on suspicion of money laundering,
German broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk reported on Monday. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment, according to Reuters. It's unclear at the moment if the news is related to a police raid on the offices of the German banking giant on 29 November. Firms are looking on with utter dismay at the ongoing saga in Westminster, and express concern that politicians are seemingly acting in their own interest, with little regard for the millions of people whose livelihoods depend on the success of UK business and trade. Many business leaders will be intensely frustrated by yet another delay in this drawn-out process, which impacts real-world business conditions, not least currency markets.  âBusinesses are clear that time is rapidly running out. With just over 100 days to go until the 29th of March, many are already enacting contingency plans in the absence of clarity from Westminster. Even basic business planning for next year has become difficult, if not impossible, for many firms and their investors.  âBusinesses need clarity and precision on the UKâs future relationship with the EU and with other key trading partners. Businesses are clear that they do not want a messy and disorderly exit, which both government and far too many firms are underprepared for.""

In the video, that went viral on social media, a woman can be heard screaming off-camera. Two children were inside the home at the time of the alleged assault. The man was live-streaming himself playing Fortnite on streaming platform Twitch on Sunday night when people watching heard the altercation. Footage shared on Twitter showed the man shouting to someone who cannot be seen ""I said I'll be out soon"". He then moves away from the camera and a woman's voice is heard saying ""woman basher"" and ""you hit me in the face"". Australian media have identified her as a 21-year-old woman who is either his wife or partner.

"Indian business tycoon Vijay Mallya can be extradited from the UK to India where he faces fraud charges, a London court has ruled. The extradition ruling will be passed to the Home Secretary for approval. Mr Mallya, whose business empire once included Kingfisher beer, left India in March 2016 after defaulting on debts of more than $1bn (Â£785m). He denies ""fleeing"" from India, and says he made an ""unconditional"" offer to pay back the sum in full in July. Mr Mallya attended Westminster Magistrates Court for the hearing. Following the hearing, Mr Mallya declined to say if he would appeal against the ruling. ""My legal team will be reviewing the judgment in detail and determining the next steps forward,"" he said. Vijay Mallya: India's most controversial businessman? India's 'King of Good Times' to learn fate The businessman's fall from grace is being avidly tracked in India, where he was once listed as one of India's wealthiest people. Mr Mallya built his fortune from Kingfisher beer, before branching out into Indian cricket and Formula 1 racing. He set up the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines in 2005. He faces a raft of charges relating to financial irregularities at Kingfisher Airlines. His monetary affairs are being investigated by India's Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate, which handles financial crimes. Nick Vamos, partner at Peters & Peters and former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, said the court decision was ""a hugely significant judgment for the Indian government"". ""Although Mr Mallya failed to convince the court that his prosecution was politically motivated, the Indian authorities pulled out all of the stops to achieve this result and undoubtedly will try to make political capital from it back home. ""However, they would be wise not to be too triumphalist as Mr Mallya has 14 days to appeal to the High Court, who might look askance at excessive gloating in the meantime,"" he added. Vijay Mallya entered the court surrounded by a scrum of reporters shouting questions in English and Hindi. As we stood in line for our turn at the x-ray machine, Mr Mallya told me that he believed ""clearly this is extremely political, it's really obvious"". While awaiting his hearing, Mr Mallya paced around the corridors, intermittently sitting among reporters in the public gallery. When his case was called, Mr Mallya heard a detailed judgement against him, which concluded with the judge saying he should be extradited to stand trial in India. From the scrum to the judgement, Mr Mallya appeared calm - relaxed even. The case is now in the hands of Home Secretary, Sajid Javid. In 2012, Mr Mallya sold a majority stake in his United Spirits group to UK drinks giant Diageo. The deal was supposed to help Mr Mallya reduce United Spirits' debts and free up funds for Kingfisher Airlines. But the airline, which was grounded in 2012, lost its flying permit the following year. It made annual losses for five years in a row and finally collapsed after lenders refused to give it fresh loans. Mr Mallya's total debts, including unpaid wages and operating costs, are estimated to exceed $1bn. He is a high-profile figure who has in the past been called ""India's Richard Branson"" and the ""King of Good Times"" for his lavish lifestyle. Vijay Mallya: India's most controversial businessman?

"The case was heard by all 27 European judges last month The European Court of Justice has ruled the UK can cancel Brexit without the permission of the other 27 EU members. The ECJ judges ruled this could be done without altering the terms of Britain's membership. A group of anti-Brexit politicians argued the UK should be able to unilaterally halt Brexit, but they were opposed by the government and EU. The decision came as Theresa May announced a Commons vote on whether to approve her deal would be postponed. MPs had been widely expected on Tuesday to reject the EU withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. But she pre-empted their decision, saying the vote would be deferred to a later date so she could seek ""further assurances"" from EU leaders about the application of the Irish border backstop. May calls off MPs' vote on her Brexit deal In a subsequent statement to MPs, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said the government noted the ECJ ruling but insisted ""our policy has not changed"". He said the UK would be leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the EU's Article 50 process, and had ""absolutely no intention"" of overturning the 2016 Brexit vote. ""The government's firm and long held policy is that we will not revoke the Article 50 notice,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The case was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians and the Good Law Project who wanted to know whether the UK could revoke the decision to leave the EU without getting approval from the other member states. They believed that if the ruling went in their favour, it could pave the way for an alternative option to Brexit, such as another referendum. A group of politicians brought the case including (from top left) Catherine Stihler MEP; Joanna Cherry MP; David Martin MEP; (from bottom left) Alyn Smith MEP; Ross Greer MSP and Andy Wightman MSP Both the UK government and the EU had been against it going to the ECJ. The EU warned that it would set a dangerous precedent by encouraging other countries to announce they were leaving in an attempt to secure better membership terms, before cancelling their withdrawal. The UK government's lawyers also argued that the case was purely hypothetical as ""the UK does not intend to revoke its notification"" and those politicians behind it wanted to use the case as ""political ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK Parliament"". The ECJ ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke its withdrawal from the EU, broadly following the non-binding opinion given last week bya senior ECJ official - the advocate general. Thestatement from the court,externalsaid the ability for a member state to change its mind after telling the EU it wanted to leave would last as long as a withdrawal agreement had not been entered into, or for the two-year period after it had notified the bloc it was leaving. If that two-year period gets extended, then a member state could change its mind during that extra time too. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Brexit: A really simple guide Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? The court said the UK would be able to stay on the same terms it has now, so it would not be forced to join the euro or the Schengen area - where there are no passport controls between countries. But the decision to stay must ""follow a democratic process"". The member state would then have to write to the EU to notify them of the ""unequivocal and unconditional"" decision. The ECJ said it made the ruling to ""clarify the options open to MPs"" ahead of voting on Mrs May's deal. The politicians involved hope the victory will increase the chances of Brexit being called off completely, potentially through another referendum. Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer - one of the politicians who launched the case - said: ""This is a massive moment at the start of a vital week, pointing to a clear way out of the Brexit mess."" And the SNP's Alyn Smith, who was also involved in the case, said: ""A bright light has switched on above an exit sign."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project which took the case to the court, said that the ruling was ""arguably the most important case in modern domestic legal history"". ""It is up to MPs to remember what they came into politics for and find the moral courage to put the country's interests before private ambition,"" he added. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - who backed Remain - said the ruling meant it was ""now open to the House of Commons"" to extend Article 50 to allow time for another vote. And Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake tweeted that it was the ""best news possible"" and said it was now ""full steam ahead for a People's Vote"". Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a prominent Brexiteer, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme those calling for a second vote were ""people who never accepted that first vote, who didn't accept that democratic mandate and who want to overturn it"". ""We don't want to stay in the EU. We voted very clearly, 17.4 million people sent a clear message that we want to leave the European Union, and that means also leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,"" he added. ""So, this case is all very well, but it doesn't alter the referendum vote or the clear intention of the government to make sure that we leave on 29 March."" Allow Twitter content?

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC people would be ""shocked and very angry"" if any government delayed leaving the EU and it was ""certainly not the intention of the government"". Brexiteer Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg hailed the decision as the right one, but told LBC radio: ""I think this government would find it very difficult to remain the government if it went away from what it said in its manifesto and the referendum result."" A spokeswoman for the European Commission said it would ""take note"" of the judgement, but there was an ""agreement on the table"". ""As President [Jean-Claude] Juncker said, this deal is the best and only deal possible. We will not renegotiate,"" he said. ""Our position has therefore not changed and as far as we are concerned the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on the 29 March 2019."" BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the ruling made staying in the EU ""a real, viable option"" and that may ""sway a few MPs"" in the way they vote. But he said ""a lot would have to change in British politics"" to see the UK remain in the EU, with Mrs May and the government having to change its mind to make it a ""political reality"".

"This video can not be played Theresa May announces Tuesday's planned Brexit deal will not go ahead: ""I've listened very carefully"" Prime Minister Theresa May has called off Tuesday's crucial vote on her Brexit deal so she can go back to Brussels and ask for changes to it. As it stands the deal ""would be rejected by a significant margin"" if MPs voted on it, she admitted. But she said she was confident of getting ""reassurances"" from the EU on the Northern Ireland border plan. But European Council President Donald Tusk said the remaining 27 EU countries would not ""renegotiate"" the deal. While EU leaders would be willing to ""discuss how to facilitate UK ratification"" of the withdrawal agreement at Thursday's summit in Brussels, he suggested the controversial Northern Irish backstop, which the DUP and many Tories want removed, would remain in place. Parliament live: Rolling updates on Brexit developments Backstop changes 'not possible' - Irish PM Sturgeon: Brexit vote delay is 'cowardice' The prime minister's U-turn came after she and senior ministers had spent days insisting the vote would go ahead, despite the scale of opposition from MPs being obvious. This video can not be played How the mace drama unfolded It prompted angry scenes in the Commons, with MPs from all sides complaining that the government had denied them the right to have any say in the move. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, who accused Mrs May of ""losing control of events"" and ""disregarding"" MPs, was granted an emergency debate in the Commons on Tuesday while Commons Speaker John Bercow said the government's handling of the issue had been ""regrettable"". And Lloyd Russell-Moyle, the Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown, was expelled from the Commons after grabbing the ceremonial mace and trying to take it out of the chamber. He was stopped by an officer of the House who returned it to its place on the table. The pounddived to an 18-month lowagainst the dollar when news of the delayed vote broke The European Court of Justiceruled the UK can cancel Brexit if it wants Commons Speaker John Bercowcalled on the government to give MPsa vote on whether Tuesday's vote should be cancelled. But his plea was rejected by Downing Street Theresa May refused to say when the Commons vote on her deal would now be held - saying it would depend how long fresh talks with the EU last. Some MPs called for it to come back to the Commons before Christmas, but Mrs May would only say the final deadline for the vote was 21 January. She said the the UK's departure date from the EU - 29 March next year - was written into law and the government was ""committed"" to delivering on it. Conservative Remainer Justine Greening said she hoped the PM would not wait until 28 March before holding the vote. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says the government has ""lost control"" and was in ""complete disarray"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had been hoping to force a general election if Mrs May had lost Tuesday's planned vote, by tabling a vote of no confidence. In his reaction to Mrs May's announcement that the vote would be delayed, he urged the PM to stand down because her government was now in ""chaos"". But Labour has rejected calls from the SNP, the Lib Dems and some of its own MPs, to hold a vote of no confidence in the prime minister on Tuesday. A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""We will put down a motion of no confidence when we judge it most likely to be successful. ""It is clear to us that Theresa May will not renegotiate the deal when she goes to Brussels, and will only be asking for reassurances from EU leaders. ""When she brings the same deal back to the House of Commons without significant changes, others across the House will be faced with that reality. ""At that point, she will have decisively and unquestionably lost the confidence of Parliament on the most important issue facing the country, and Parliament will be more likely to bring about the general election our country needs to end this damaging deadlock."" Dozens of Conservative MPs had been planning to join forces with Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the DUP to vote down Mrs May's deal. The Tory rebels and the DUP do not like the Northern Ireland ""backstop"", a legally-binding proposal for a customs arrangement with the EU, which would come into force if the two sides cannot agree a future relationship which avoids the return of a visible Northern Ireland border. Tory MPs say it is unacceptable because it would result in new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and could continue indefinitely, because the UK would not be able to leave without the EU's approval. This video can not be played Theresa May asks MPs: âDoes this House want to deliver Brexit?â The prime minister vowed to put the deal to a vote but said there was no point at this stage because it would have been defeated. She told MPs she would be speaking to EU leaders ahead of a summit later this week, about the ""clear concerns"" expressed by MPs about the backstop. And she would also be ""looking closely at new ways of empowering the House of Commons to ensure that any provision for a backstop has democratic legitimacy"". Mrs May wants to enable MPs to place obligations on the government ""to ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely"". She again rejected all other alternatives that have been proposed to her deal - including a further referendum and leaving without a deal. Her deal ""gives us control of our borders, our money and our laws - it protects jobs, security and our Union"", she said. ""It is the right deal for Britain. I am determined to do all I can to secure the reassurances this House requires, to get this deal over the line and deliver for the British people,"" she added. Asked by Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable if EU leaders would be ready to ditch the backstop, she said they had shown they were aware of MPs' concerns that the backstop should be temporary. ""A number of European leaders I've spoken to have indicated that they are open to discussions to find a way to provide reassurance to members of this House on that point,"" she added. Leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said in a statement that Mrs May lacked the ""gumption"" to put her ""undeliverable"" deal before MPs. ""This is not governing, it risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into government by failing to deliver Brexit. We cannot continue like this. The prime minister must either govern or quit."" Mr Rees-Mogg is trying to get enough Tory MPs to submit letters of no confidence in the PM to trigger a leadership contest. Graham Brady, who receives those letters as chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said some MPs were angry and others were ""fidgety"" but many were glad not to be ""going through the motions of a needless defeat"". ""We've just seen the PM doing the right thing but also quite bravely standing up... and making her case to an angry opposition,"" he added. The deputy leader of the DUP - the Northern Ireland party whose backing Theresa May needs to win key votes - Nigel Dodds, said the situation was ""quite frankly a bit of a shambles"" and the PM was paying the price for crossing her ""red lines"" when it came to Northern Ireland. He told Mrs May: ""Come back with the changes to the withdrawal agreement or it will be voted down."" DUP leader Arlene Foster said she had told the prime minister in a phone call that the ""backstop must go"". Theresa May's deal has been agreed with the EU - but it needs to be backed by the UK Parliament if it is to become law ahead of the UK's departure. Mrs May has also been speaking to EU leaders about re-opening the withdrawal agreement, something both sides have previously ruled out. European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the EU would not renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement. ""As President Juncker said, this deal is the best and only deal possible,"" she said. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said Mrs May was ""trying get more legal oomph behind the language"" in the withdrawal agreement about the EU using ""best endeavours"" to get a trade deal which would remove the need for the backstop to be used.

"""Nothing is off the table"" when it comes to reassuring MPs over the Northern Ireland backstop, Downing Street sources say. This could include reopening the EU withdrawal agreement, even though that comes with risk, the sources say. Theresa May is understood to be pushing the EU for flexibility on the backstop. This is the clause in the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement that is meant to prevent the return of border checks in Northern Ireland. It would see the UK aligned with EU customs rules until a future trade deal is agreed that does not include a physical border between the EU and the UK on the island of Ireland. UK can cancel Brexit, says EU court Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Brexit: A really simple guide The backstop is meant to be a temporary measure but the UK can't leave it without the EU's say-so, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement. Many MPs fear this will mean the UK will end up indefinitely tied to the EU with no say over its rules - and that is why they are planning to vote against the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday. Those campaigning for another EU referendum have, meanwhile, been given a boost by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which hasruled that the UK can cancel Brexitwithout the permission of the other 27 EU members. Former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett, who is campaigning for another referendum, said: ""This is confirmation that it is still up to us to decide whether we want to keep the existing deal we've got in the EU rather than accept a bad deal negotiated by the government."" But Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the ruling does not alter the government's intention to leave the EU in March 2019. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We voted very clearly - 17.4 million people sent a clear message that we wanted to leave the European Union and that means also leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. ""So, this case is all very well but it doesn't alter either the referendum vote or the clear intention of the government to make sure that we leave on 29 March."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson said it was a ""relatively simple job"" to change the withdrawal agreement He rejected newspaper reports that Tuesday's Commons vote will be cancelled to prevent the prime minister suffering a defeat of historic proportions that could end her premiership. Mrs May has previously insisted there can be no deal with the EU without the backstop - and it would be impossible to change the terms of the withdrawal agreement. She has repeatedly warned her own MPs that a rejection of her deal could lead to a general election - or possibly""no Brexit"" at all.,external That has so far failed to convince dozens of Tory MPs who are planning to join Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the DUP and the SNP in voting against it. So, in a change of tone, Downing Street is now saying the withdrawal agreement could be tweaked to reflect concerns about the backstop. By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg On the face of it, it's pretty extraordinary to imagine that the UK government could be genuinely asking to reopen an agreement that took 18 months to put together, has already been through the grinder on multiple occasions and was only concluded a fortnight ago. But since the ink dried, it has become clear that the chance of getting the deal through Parliament is very small. One minister said: ""It's only a deal if it's ratified."" Perhaps for wavering MPs, even the sign of the PM continuing to push for more will make a difference. Read Laura's blog Mr Gove said the prime minister was ""seeking to improve"" the agreement but there were ""risks"" involved. ""If we do attempt a fundamental reopening or renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement, European Union countries, who recognise just how uncomfortable the backstop is for them, may change the withdrawal agreement in a way that may not necessarily be to our advantage,"" he said. He said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that he would mount a Tory leadership challenge if Theresa May stood down or was forced out after losing Tuesday's vote. On Sunday evening, Mrs May spoke on the phone to Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, whose support could be vital if she were to negotiate further with the EU. She also spoke to the European Council President Donald Tusk,who tweeted,externalit would be ""an important week for the fate of Brexit"". Boris Johnson said Mrs May could stay on if she lost Tuesday's vote - but must renegotiate the deal with Brussels. Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit strategy, told the BBC he did not want a ""no-deal"" Brexit or another referendum, but it was not right to say there were no alternatives. He said the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" put the UK in a ""diabolical negotiating position"". MPs could give Mrs May ""a powerful mandate to change that backstop"" by voting it down on Tuesday, he said. Former Cabinet minister and Leave campaigner Theresa Villiers has said that the UK could cope with a no-deal scenario if ""preparation is stepped up"" and the EU co-operated. Please upgrade your browser Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable believes Brexit may not happen at all. ""Increasingly I doubt it,"" he said when asked about it becoming a reality, adding it was ""more likely that it won't happen"". He added there could be a ""hell of a backlash"" if Mrs May's ""economically damaging"" Brexit were to be imposed without another referendum. Are rivals lining up to oust Theresa May?

"Tom Tyreman died in February from cancer The family of a man who died after receiving a liver transplant from a donor with undetected cancer has called for more thorough tests. Tom Tyreman, 63, from Stockton, initially recovered after the operation at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital a year ago, but died of cancer in February. There was later found to be a small cancerous tumour in the donor organ that was not picked up by screening. The hospital said the ""tragic outcome"" could not have been anticipated. NHS Blood and Transplant Service said it does everything it can to make sure all donated organs are suitable, but because of the sudden and speedy nature of organ donation it was not normally possible to screen a donor in advance. Pauline Hunt, 49, from Kilmarnock, has also developed cancer after receiving a kidney from the same donor; a woman who died from a blood clot. Mr Tyreman's sister Jane Bird said ""stringent tests"" are needed Mr Tyreman's sister, Jane Bird, said hospital staff needed to be ""more upfront"" about what could potentially go wrong. ""We were told that he could develop cancer further down the line because his immune system was so suppressed, which we accepted"", she said. ""But we were never told that potentially he could get it from the donated organ. ""I think there need to be more stringent tests. It's just unacceptable in this day and age that more vigorous tests cannot be done."" This video can not be played ""I shouldn't be fighting somebody else's cancer.""

"Thirteen members of staff were suspended following allegations of ill-treatment The mother of a severely-disabled man who is a patient at Muckamore Abbey Hospital described a seclusion room her son was placed in as ""a dark dungeon"". The woman said she was horrified that in 2017 the room was being used for people with learning disabilities. Families want a public inquiry to investigate allegations of physical and mental abuse at the hospital. The Belfast Trust said it ""apologised sincerely"" for behaviour it said fell below professional standards. In July, it emerged that13 members of staff at the County Antrim hospital had been suspendedby the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust following allegations of ill treatment. At the time it said: ""This regrettable and unacceptable situation in no way reflects the work of our 500 dedicated and professional staff who provide excellent care every day to the 80 patients in Muckamore."" This video can not be played Muckamore seclusion room was 'a dark dungeon' The man who was secluded at the hospital's Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) last year has complex disabilities including autism and epilepsy and cannot speak or feed himself. His family says he has the mental capacity of a two year old, and was locked in the room for up to two hours more than once. His mother, who has asked for her identity to be protected, said alarm bells started ringing as soon as she saw the room. ""I saw a room 12 by eight, with padded walls, and a leather chair sitting in the middle of it,"" she told BBC News NI. ""There was nothing to look at, no stimulation whatsoever. ""The room had no toilet, nor drinking facilities. ""All I thought of was my poor boy was in there with not even a drink,"" said the mother. ""In 2017 this was happening in our country."" CCTV footage from the PICU unit shows her son being punched in the stomach by a nurse. The footage, taken over a three-month period, also shows patients being pulled, hit, punched, flicked and verbally abused by nursing staff. Sources have told the BBC the CCTV footage shows some of the most degrading and cruel behaviour against vulnerable adults ever captured in the UK. A father was visibly upset as he described what he had been told about his son's treatment. This father said he felt guilty for putting his son in Muckamore Abbey ""They swung him round by the arm for over a minute and then let him go and he fell. He has epilepsy, he's on medication,"" he said. ""They tipped him out of his chair. Knuckles were rubbed against his head and various other incidents that I still don't know about but that is on the CCTV footage. ""I only know a short resumÃ© of the allegations. I have been advised they are horrendous. ""I feel so guilty for putting him in, but as a parent you thought you were doing the best thing for him. ""He was let down so badly by the system and so were others. ""It is deeply distressing for a parent to be aware that you have entrusted your son into care and it went so miserably wrong."" The Belfast Trust said the seclusion room was still used in emergencies, but its use was being reviewed. An adult safeguarding investigation began in September 2017 following reports of inappropriate behaviour and the alleged physical abuse of patients by staff in the PICU and another ward in the hospital. Each family affected will receive a report about the care and treatment of their child, and the BBC understands families are being offered the opportunity to view some of the CCTV footage from Muckamore. A Serious Adverse Incident (SAI) report is due to be published, which the BBC understands will outline ""catastrophic and systemic failures"" involving senior management and nursing staff. Its author, Margaret Flynn, headed up the review into the Winterbourne View abuse scandal in England. In 2012, six health care workers were jailed for a catalogue of abuse against adults with learning difficulties. The level of abuse at Muckamore Abbey is on a similar scale, sources say. The PSNI confirmed last week it was investigating 132 potential criminal cases, but that figure is expected to rise: The BBC understands the scale of the investigation is unprecedented. A specially commissioned panel is reviewing more than 90,000 hours of CCTV footage, which may trigger more investigative actions. Since November 2017, 13 staff members have been placed on ""precautionary suspension"" after ill-treatment allegations. They remain off duty, on full pay. One senior manager is understood to have offered to retire early after allegations were made, and is currently off sick. A senior nurse is also on long-term sick leave. One County Down mother, whose daughter was an in-patient at Muckamore, said she repeatedly voiced her concerns to management and the regulatory body the RQIA, but was ignored. ""I felt powerless that no matter what I did or who I spoke to, including the RQIA and health trust management, the same things kept happening over and over again,"" she said. ""I raised concerns about the continuous incidents. She was black and blue, being hit by other patients. ""She was trailed up the corridor by her hair but no one listened. She was failed, I was failed."" The woman raised her own concerns about the seclusion room after her daughter appeared traumatised and said she had been ""put in jail"". The Belfast Health and Social Trust said it took the concerns raised by relatives extremely seriously, and had arranged to meet one of the families. The RQIA said it followed up each case raised ""in line with our powers"". ""We are constantly working to improve out accessibility, so as people can bring their concerns to us in the knowledge action will be taken. ""The abuse, by its very nature, was hidden from management at this service, from visiting professional staff such as psychiatrists who were present on a daily basis."" Due to the complexity and scale of the investigation, the National Crime Agency has been asked to provide advice to the PSNI if requested, but has not been asked to play an active role.

"The 22-year-old arrived in New Zealand in mid-November for the second part of her round-the-world trip A 26-year-old man has appeared in court in New Zealand charged with the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane. Miss Millane, 22, disappeared in Auckland on 1 December - police ended their search on Sunday after finding a body in the outskirts of the city. The man, who cannot be named, is due back in court next month. Court documents showed he had been living at the Citylife Hotel on Queen Street in central Auckland, which is where Miss Millane was last seen. The judge acknowledged Miss Millane's family's grief ""must be desperate"". Documents also showed police believe the University of Lincoln graduate from Essex was killed between 1 December and 2 December. At a news conference, the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said there was an ""overwhelming sense of hurt and shame that this has happened in our country"". ""On behalf of New Zealand, I want to apologise to Grace's family,"" she said. ""Your daughter should have been safe here, and she wasn't, and I'm sorry for that."" The body - which has not yet been formally identified but the police believe to be Miss Millane's - was found ""about 10 metres"" off Scenic Drive, a countryside road outside the city, Det Insp Scott Beard said. This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern held back tears as she commented on the murder of British tourist Grace Millane On Sunday, Declan Millane, one of Miss Millane's brothers, shared a collection of photographs of his sister online, alongside the lyrics to the chorus of the song You Are My Sunshine. The University of Lincoln, from which Miss Millane graduated earlier this year, paid tribute and said its community was ""deeply saddened"". Floral tributes for the recent graduate have been growing outside the Willows Centre in her home town of Wickford. A tribute at the roadside at the start of Scenic Drive Miss Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks, following a six-week group trip through South America.

He also thanked the New Zealand prime minister ""for standing shoulder to shoulder with the UK with such grace and dignity which speaks volumes for the deep friendship between our countries"".

"Saturday's protesters left graffiti in parts of Paris - this reads: ""Burn the ElysÃ©e"", referring to the presidential palace French President Emmanuel Macron is meeting trade unions and employers' organisations, in a bid to defuse weeks of unrest in Paris and other cities. The meeting comes ahead of a TV address in which he is expected to announce measures in response. France has seen four weekends of violent protests against fuel tax rises, living costs and other issues. About 136,000 ""yellow-vest"" protesters took to the streets on Saturday. More than 1,200 were taken into custody. The capital, Paris, was particularly badly hit, with windows smashed, cars burned and shops looted, as 10,000 people took part in demonstrations. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire described the situation as a ""catastrophe for businesses"" and the economy. On Monday, the Bank of France said the economy would grow only 0.2% in the last quarter of 2018, down from an earlier estimate of 0.4%, as a result of the protests. In pictures: France's latest protests Why the 'yellow vests' won't stop protests French students 'humiliated by police' Protesters have staged demonstrations and road blocks across the country over the past four weekends. Analysis by the BBC's Hugh Schofield, in Paris The moment must be distressing for President Macron.  He is a man who has spent his life receiving nothing but praise and plaudits.  He was the princeling prodigy,  who would use his exceptional personal gifts to save France. How must it feel now to know there are crowds baying for your head,  or to see graffiti on Paris walls saying ""Hang the King."" He will need every ounce of his massive self-belief to turn this crisis into something less than a full-blown disaster.  He must know that his address on TV will have to contain real, fast-acting measures to put money in protesters' pockets.  ""Let them eat a deferred rise in fuel-tax,"" is no longer going to work. But how to do that without unsaying everything he has said about keeping down state spending and staying the course?  His famous ""au mÃªme temps""  (at the same time) catchphrase - which lets him pretend that everything and its opposite is possible as long as you say it charmingly enough - is being stretched to breaking point. Mr Macron was meeting representatives of five major trade unions and three employers' organisations, as well as local officials. Correspondents say that the yellow vests are an organic grassroots movement with no affiliations to any party, but some trade unions have taken up their cause and encouraged the government to listen to their grievances. Le Figaro newspaper reported that Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe and nine government ministers were expected to be present at Mr Macron's meeting. Mr Macron will then address the nation at 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT). Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud said he would announce ""immediate and concrete measures"" in response to the crisis. Mr Macron has kept a low profile so far during the protests. Many of the protesters have called for his resignation. He has been criticised for being out of touch and not listening to the struggles of ordinary people. This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets of Paris for a fourth weekend of demonstrations Last week, following talks with representatives of the yellow-vest movement, the government announced it was abandoning the fuel taxes that have angered the protesters. But this failed to placate them and on Saturday they turned out in similar numbers to last week's demonstration. The protesters adopted the name after a social-media campaign urging people to take to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow jackets that must be carried in every vehicle in France. They were initially protesting against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. About 50 vehicles were set on fire during last Saturday's protests Diesel prices have risen by about 23% over the past 12 months - and Mr Macron's decision to impose a tax increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol from 1 January angered many, particularly in rural areas. Mr Macron had said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? But protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. The movement's core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, still has widespread support. This video can not be played Gilets Jaunes: Are nationalists infiltrating the ""yellow vests""? An opinion poll on Friday suggested a dip in support for the protests, but it still stood at 66%. Meanwhile, President Macron's ratings have fallen to 23% amid the crisis, an Elabe poll suggests. 17 November:282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 wounded - 73 in custody 24 November:166,000 protesters - 84 wounded - 307 in custody 1 December:136,000 protesters - one dead, 263 wounded - 630 in custody 8 December:136,000 protesters - 118 wounded - 1,220 in custody Police fire tear gas.

"Legal professionals have warned cuts ""threaten the quality of justice"" Cuts to legal aid have created ""deserts"" of provision across England and Wales, a BBC investigation found. Analysis shows up to a million people live in areas with no legal aid provision for housing, with a further 15 million in areas with one provider. Campaign group Liberty said access to justice had been ""significantly undermined"". The Ministry of Justice said it took ""urgent action"" whenever it had concerns over provision. The BBC's Shared Data Unit has analysed Ministry of Justice and Legal Aid Agency data since 2011-12. It found: Around a million fewer claims for legal aid are being processed each year. More than 1,000 fewer legal aid providers were paid for civil legal aid work than in 2011-12. Four legal aid providers for welfare cover Wales and the South West while 41 cover London and the South East. Almost half of all community care legal aid providers are based in London. Richard Miller, head of justice at the Law Society, said provision of legal advice across England and Wales was disappearing, creating ""legal aid deserts"". ""Even for those cases where legal aid is still supposed to be available, it can be very difficult for a client to find a lawyer willing to take on the case,"" he said. This has prompted a more than five-fold rise in people representing themselves in court. Volunteers at the Personal Support Unit helped around 65,000 of them last year. Six years ago it was fewer than 10,000. Ian Howgate successfully fought two court cases alone, but said the experience was ""terrifying"" Ian Howgate successfully fought two court cases alone after failing to find a legal aid solicitor. The 54-year-old from Berkshire said his family was ""living below the breadline"" for more than a year after their housing benefit was stopped in 2015. They were able to manage with the support of friends, and after winning his case Mr Howgate reclaimed Â£15,000 in lost income from his local authority. Two months before that case was completed his son, recently diagnosed as autistic, was unfairly expelled from school and Mr Howgate had to bring a discrimination case on his behalf before a Special Educational Needs tribunal. ""People need to know this could be them tomorrow,"" he said. ""We weren't able to even find a solicitor who, had we had the money, would be able to deal with the case."" Mr Howgate, who had been diagnosed with PTSD, said the courtroom experience had a dramatic effect on his mental health, and he had contemplated taking his own life as the case loomed. ""Preparing for it was intolerable,"" he said. ""It is terrifying. ""As a lay person going into that courtroom it is like playing the lottery where your entire future is at stake. ""If you do not play your cards right, you are never going to forgive yourself."" The problem is recognised by court staff, who attempt to seek a fair outcome with litigants in person. Malcolm Richardson, aged 70, retired as a family court magistrate in August after serving 37 years on the bench in the Bristol area. He said legal advisors were increasingly having to guide litigants in person through the court process ""out of necessity"". ""It puts all the judiciary in a difficult position but also burdens the whole court system,"" he said. ""We are not there to sit as advocates, but as a human being who has committed themselves to judging their fellow man on sensitive issues, we all want to make the right decision. ""On many occasions in my courtroom, people have been reduced to tears, unable to cope and unable to put their view forward. Trying to help them do that is a harrowing experience for everyone."" The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) withdrew aid from areas of law including family, welfare, housing and debt. It also lowered the means test and scrapped automatic eligibility for those in receipt of means-tested benefits. Solicitors working on legal aid contracts say they have to turn people away ""every single day"", but there is no longer anywhere to send them. Nicola Mackintosh QC, sole principal of Mackintosh Law, said: ""We see people more desperate and in more extreme need than they were five years ago, and there is nowhere to send them. Those people are invisible to the system."" Nicola Mackintosh QC said the legal aid support network had been decimated Her firm specialises in community care law, primarily for disabled people. With almost half of community care providers based in London, she travels across the country to reach clients. She said: ""Pre-LASPO, we had a network of advice centres, CABs, law centres and specialist high-street practices.  It was not perfect, but it was pretty good. Now we have a complete decimation of the advice and representation network. ""Everybody recognises disabled people have rights but if you do not provide the advice and representation to them, those rights are theoretical in practice."" The people solicitors have to turn away will reappear in other public services, but only after their problems have spiralled out of control, says Steve Hynes, director of the Legal Action group. He said the lack of legal aid supply was ""shocking"", while the MoJ said it ""keeps availability under constant review"". ""For many people across the country, getting help from a legal aid lawyer comes down to a postcode lottery which they are destined to lose,"" said Mr Hynes. LASPO's objectives included making ""significant savings"" and delivering ""better overall value for money"". But experts and campaigners say it has simply shifted the burden of cost onto the courts, NHS and social care - ultimately costing the state more. And Labour's shadow secretary of state for justice, Richard Burgon MP, echoed the belief cuts to legal aid have been a ""false economy"". ""A lack of early legal advice can create unnecessary costs for the taxpayer as legal problems go to court when they could have been resolved earlier or spiral into costly social problems as people lose their homes or jobs,"" he said. Shadow Secretary of State for Justice Richard Burgon MP He added: ""These figures highlight the grim reality of a justice system in crisis. These legal aid cuts have deliberately weakened people's ability to challenge injustices and enforce their rights."" Gaps in provision of civil legal aid are often filled by law centres, which have formed in communities since the 1970s to meet need in more deprived areas. But 15 centres have had to close since LASPO - 11 in the first 18 months, as funding was withdrawn. Nimrod Ben-Cnaan, head of policy at the Law Centres Network, said the legal aid market was ""failing"" as cuts have ""shattered local ecologies of advice"". ""Legal aid deserts appear when there are not enough local providers of legal assistance, normally because of the Legal Aid Agency's preference of fewer, larger agencies, meaning that if those pull out of a local area there is little provision left."" Mr Ben-Cnaan said: ""The lost goodwill, subject expertise and local knowledge would take time to be rebuilt - but it is vital for communities that they are rebuilt."" The MoJ last month agreed a Â£23m fee rise for criminal defence barristerslast month, after the Bar took industrial action in April in protest over changes to the fee system. An MoJ spokeswoman said there were ""enough solicitors and barristers for criminal legal aid funded cases across England and Wales."" ""Every person should have access to legal advice when they need it - that's why the Legal Aid Agency keeps availability under constant review and takes urgent action whenever it has concerns,"" she added.

"Walkers said packets kept the crisps fresher for longer and therefore cut food waste A recycling scheme for crisp packets has been launched by Walkers after it was targeted by protests on the issue. Walkers was the focus of a campaign where its crisp packets were posted back to the snack firm, which led to problems at Royal Mail sorting offices. Now the company said it had put in place collection points across the UK and also offers a free courier service. Environmental group Beach Guardian welcomed the move, but said ""the most vital thing is that people use it"". Campaigner Emily Stevenson with a Walkers crisp packet with a sell by date from 1997 - the year she was born Leicester-based Walkers had faced months of criticism that its metallised plastic packets were contributing to litter and marine pollution.

Another campaign saw people encouraged to post packets back to Walkers,prompting Royal Mail to interveneas the plastic pouches were slowing down its systems.

A spokesman for Walkers said: ""Crisp packets are technically recyclable, the issue until now has been that they weren't being separated or collected for recycling. ""This scheme will tap into an established network of recycling collection points around the UK. ""It is simple and free to use, all brands of crisp packets will be accepted and will ultimately be turned into other basic plastic items."" It is planned the packets will be recycled into basic household items Those who cannot get to a recycling centre can use a dedicated courier service free of charge, the company said.

"This video can not be played The moment Harry Redknapp found out he had won Almost 11 million viewers tuned in live to see Harry Redknapp crowned King of the Jungle on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, overnight ratings show. The ex-Tottenham and West Ham manager beat fellow finalists Emily Atack and John Barrowman on the ITV reality show. He was a popular winner and the programme itself has been a hit this year, with an average of 10.8 million watching Sunday's final live. Those are the highest ratings the show's final has had for five years. Another 170,000 watched on ITV+1. Last year, an average of 9.2 million watched live to see Georgia ""Toff"" Toffolo crowned. Redknapp became the show's oldest ever winner at 71 and said it was ""so surreal"" to emerge victorious. ""My grandkids will be jumping around the living room now. They'll be so excited,"" he said after being crowned. He said he didn't think he would survive so long in the show, and praised his campmates for being ""amazing"" and pulling him through. While he has a ""very happy home life"", he added that football can be a ""lonely business"" and the show had ""taught me how to laugh again"". But he admitted he had struggled with the meagre rations - and unusual foods - and that he thought the contestants would get well-fed with a ""nice bit of grub"" every night. Host Holly Willoughby said more than 11 million votes were cast in this year's final. ""Harry was the favourite all the way though,"" TV critic Emma Bullimore told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""With all of his little idiosyncrasies and little catchphrases, he was absolutely brilliant entertainment value and a very worthy winner. ""There was no game plan, there was no pretence, he was just himself. He came across as such a genuinely nice man."" Atack said the experience had changed her life Atack came second and said she was ""honoured"" to be in the final two with Redknapp. She said she had met ""so many amazing souls"" on the show, and discovered a new-found love and respect for herself. The Inbetweeners star said: ""It's changed my life in so many ways. I came into this with a bit of a difficult start to the year. ""I didn't really know what I was doing and where I wanted to go and this place has just given me so me so much self-acceptance."" Willoughby made the actress promise to never cover up her freckles again, after Atack said: ""This is my skin, this is my hair - this is what I look like."" Barrowman came in third place, and said I'm a Celebrity had been one of the best experiences of his life. The actor and singer appeared emotional as he told Willoughby and Donnelly: ""I can't tell you how happy I am."" This year's contestants have been put through a series of Bushtucker trials involving snakes, cockroaches and other creatures. They've also had to negotiate assault courses blindfolded, bake cakes while plastered in treacle and climb through ""sickening sewers"" in order to win food and other necessities. The trio had to each carry out a final trial in order to win treats for their last supper together, after 23 days in the jungle. Barrowman had to eat a range of gruesome items like worms, a dead spider, goats' eyes and a bull's penis. Atack had to wear a helmet filled with insects while Redknapp's trial saw him trapped in an underground chamber while rats and bugs ran over him in the pitch black. The former football manager was the bookies' favourite to win this year's series, despite having never watched the show before. After leaving the show and being shown his highlights, he said: ""Great show, innit?"" Many viewers agreed. Lots thought it was one of the best series in the show's 16-year history, and Redknapp was one of the most popular winners. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The number of people out shopping in the UK in November dropped to its lowest level since the 2008 recession, retail researchers say. Footfall at shopping centres, retail parks and High Streets fell 3.2%, according to analysis firm Springboard. The figures showed the Black Friday effect was driving more shopping online during a longer period, the firm said. The decline was ""indisputable evidence"" that Black Friday was of no benefit to physical stores, it added. Springboard said it expected footfall to decline by 4.2% year-on-year in December, a bigger drop than the 3.5% decrease seen in December 2017. ""These figures are the worst footfall figures that Springboard has recorded since the recession and we're not actually in recession,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard's marketing and insights director. ""It's clear that something significant is happening out there in consumer demand. It has really railed back this year."" Ms Wehrle warned that more High Street chains could collapse in January. Carphone Warehouse faces Black Friday backlash Black Friday shoppers 'spending less' The growth of online shopping has been one of the main challenges facing the UK's High Streets, which have seen a number of store chains collapse this year as trading conditions worsen. Springboard said the UK's political turmoil over Brexit was also having an impact on shoppers' purchasing decisions. ""As we head into the zenith of the retail trading calendar, both retailers and consumers alike are in the midst of the greatest degree of uncertainty in recent times,"" said Ms Wehrle. ""However, the fact that the Parliamentary vote is not taking place until the middle of December might deliver a slight glimmer of hope for some large-ticket item retailers, as consumers may purchase now rather than later, in an attempt to outrun inflationary pressures that are expected should the Brexit deal not be ratified.""

"Legal professionals have warned cuts ""threaten the quality of justice"" Cuts to legal aid have created ""deserts"" of provision across England and Wales, a BBC investigation found. Analysis shows up to a million people live in areas with no legal aid provision for housing, with a further 15 million in areas with one provider. Campaign group Liberty said access to justice had been ""significantly undermined"". The Ministry of Justice said it took ""urgent action"" whenever it had concerns over provision. The BBC's Shared Data Unit has analysed Ministry of Justice and Legal Aid Agency data since 2011-12. It found: Around a million fewer claims for legal aid are being processed each year. More than 1,000 fewer legal aid providers were paid for civil legal aid work than in 2011-12. Four legal aid providers for welfare cover Wales and the South West while 41 cover London and the South East. Almost half of all community care legal aid providers are based in London.

Barrowman came in third place, and said I'm a Celebrity had been one of the best experiences of his life. The actor and singer appeared emotional as he told Willoughby and Donnelly: ""I can't tell you how happy I am."" This year's contestants have been put through a series of Bushtucker trials involving snakes, cockroaches and other creatures. They've also had to negotiate assault courses blindfolded, bake cakes while plastered in treacle and climb through ""sickening sewers"" in order to win food and other necessities. The trio had to each carry out a final trial in order to win treats for their last supper together, after 23 days in the jungle. Barrowman had to eat a range of gruesome items like worms, a dead spider, goats' eyes and a bull's penis. Atack had to wear a helmet filled with insects while Redknapp's trial saw him trapped in an underground chamber while rats and bugs ran over him in the pitch black. The former football manager was the bookies' favourite to win this year's series, despite having never watched the show before. After leaving the show and being shown his highlights, he said: ""Great show, innit?"" Many viewers agreed. Lots thought it was one of the best series in the show's 16-year history, and Redknapp was one of the most popular winners. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Saturday's protesters left graffiti in parts of Paris - this reads: ""Burn the ElysÃ©e"", referring to the presidential palace French President Emmanuel Macron is meeting trade unions and employers' organisations, in a bid to defuse weeks of unrest in Paris and other cities. The meeting comes ahead of a TV address in which he is expected to announce measures in response. France has seen four weekends of violent protests against fuel tax rises, living costs and other issues. About 136,000 ""yellow-vest"" protesters took to the streets on Saturday. More than 1,200 were taken into custody. The capital, Paris, was particularly badly hit, with windows smashed, cars burned and shops looted, as 10,000 people took part in demonstrations. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire described the situation as a ""catastrophe for businesses"" and the economy. On Monday, the Bank of France said the economy would grow only 0.2% in the last quarter of 2018, down from an earlier estimate of 0.4%, as a result of the protests. In pictures: France's latest protests Why the 'yellow vests' won't stop protests French students 'humiliated by police' Protesters have staged demonstrations and road blocks across the country over the past four weekends. Analysis by the BBC's Hugh Schofield, in Paris The moment must be distressing for President Macron.  He is a man who has spent his life receiving nothing but praise and plaudits.  He was the princeling prodigy,  who would use his exceptional personal gifts to save France. How must it feel now to know there are crowds baying for your head,  or to see graffiti on Paris walls saying ""Hang the King."" He will need every ounce of his massive self-belief to turn this crisis into something less than a full-blown disaster.  He must know that his address on TV will have to contain real, fast-acting measures to put money in protesters' pockets.  ""Let them eat a deferred rise in fuel-tax,"" is no longer going to work. But how to do that without unsaying everything he has said about keeping down state spending and staying the course?  His famous ""au mÃªme temps""  (at the same time) catchphrase - which lets him pretend that everything and its opposite is possible as long as you say it charmingly enough - is being stretched to breaking point. Mr Macron was meeting representatives of five major trade unions and three employers' organisations, as well as local officials. Correspondents say that the yellow vests are an organic grassroots movement with no affiliations to any party, but some trade unions have taken up their cause and encouraged the government to listen to their grievances. Le Figaro newspaper reported that Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe and nine government ministers were expected to be present at Mr Macron's meeting. Mr Macron will then address the nation at 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT). Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud said he would announce ""immediate and concrete measures"" in response to the crisis. Mr Macron has kept a low profile so far during the protests. Many of the protesters have called for his resignation. He has been criticised for being out of touch and not listening to the struggles of ordinary people. This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets of Paris for a fourth weekend of demonstrations Last week, following talks with representatives of the yellow-vest movement, the government announced it was abandoning the fuel taxes that have angered the protesters. But this failed to placate them and on Saturday they turned out in similar numbers to last week's demonstration. The protesters adopted the name after a social-media campaign urging people to take to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow jackets that must be carried in every vehicle in France. They were initially protesting against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. About 50 vehicles were set on fire during last Saturday's protests Diesel prices have risen by about 23% over the past 12 months - and Mr Macron's decision to impose a tax increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol from 1 January angered many, particularly in rural areas. Mr Macron had said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? But protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. The movement's core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, still has widespread support. This video can not be played Gilets Jaunes: Are nationalists infiltrating the ""yellow vests""? An opinion poll on Friday suggested a dip in support for the protests, but it still stood at 66%. Meanwhile, President Macron's ratings have fallen to 23% amid the crisis, an Elabe poll suggests. 17 November:282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 wounded - 73 in custody 24 November:166,000 protesters - 84 wounded - 307 in custody 1 December:136,000 protesters - one dead, 263 wounded - 630 in custody 8 December:136,000 protesters - 118 wounded - 1,220 in custody Police fire tear gas.

"""Nothing is off the table"" when it comes to reassuring MPs over the Northern Ireland backstop, Downing Street sources say. This could include reopening the EU withdrawal agreement, even though that comes with risk, the sources say. Theresa May is understood to be pushing the EU for flexibility on the backstop. This is the clause in the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement that is meant to prevent the return of border checks in Northern Ireland. It would see the UK aligned with EU customs rules until a future trade deal is agreed that does not include a physical border between the EU and the UK on the island of Ireland. UK can cancel Brexit, says EU court Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Brexit: A really simple guide The backstop is meant to be a temporary measure but the UK can't leave it without the EU's say-so, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement. Many MPs fear this will mean the UK will end up indefinitely tied to the EU with no say over its rules - and that is why they are planning to vote against the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday. Those campaigning for another EU referendum have, meanwhile, been given a boost by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which hasruled that the UK can cancel Brexitwithout the permission of the other 27 EU members. Former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett, who is campaigning for another referendum, said: ""This is confirmation that it is still up to us to decide whether we want to keep the existing deal we've got in the EU rather than accept a bad deal negotiated by the government."" But Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the ruling does not alter the government's intention to leave the EU in March 2019. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We voted very clearly - 17.4 million people sent a clear message that we wanted to leave the European Union and that means also leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. ""So, this case is all very well but it doesn't alter either the referendum vote or the clear intention of the government to make sure that we leave on 29 March."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson said it was a ""relatively simple job"" to change the withdrawal agreement He rejected newspaper reports that Tuesday's Commons vote will be cancelled to prevent the prime minister suffering a defeat of historic proportions that could end her premiership. Mrs May has previously insisted there can be no deal with the EU without the backstop - and it would be impossible to change the terms of the withdrawal agreement. She has repeatedly warned her own MPs that a rejection of her deal could lead to a general election - or possibly""no Brexit"" at all.,external That has so far failed to convince dozens of Tory MPs who are planning to join Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the DUP and the SNP in voting against it. So, in a change of tone, Downing Street is now saying the withdrawal agreement could be tweaked to reflect concerns about the backstop. By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg On the face of it, it's pretty extraordinary to imagine that the UK government could be genuinely asking to reopen an agreement that took 18 months to put together, has already been through the grinder on multiple occasions and was only concluded a fortnight ago. But since the ink dried, it has become clear that the chance of getting the deal through Parliament is very small. One minister said: ""It's only a deal if it's ratified."" Perhaps for wavering MPs, even the sign of the PM continuing to push for more will make a difference. Read Laura's blog Mr Gove said the prime minister was ""seeking to improve"" the agreement but there were ""risks"" involved. ""If we do attempt a fundamental reopening or renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement, European Union countries, who recognise just how uncomfortable the backstop is for them, may change the withdrawal agreement in a way that may not necessarily be to our advantage,"" he said. He said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that he would mount a Tory leadership challenge if Theresa May stood down or was forced out after losing Tuesday's vote. On Sunday evening, Mrs May spoke on the phone to Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, whose support could be vital if she were to negotiate further with the EU. She also spoke to the European Council President Donald Tusk,who tweeted,externalit would be ""an important week for the fate of Brexit"". Boris Johnson said Mrs May could stay on if she lost Tuesday's vote - but must renegotiate the deal with Brussels. Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit strategy, told the BBC he did not want a ""no-deal"" Brexit or another referendum, but it was not right to say there were no alternatives. He said the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" put the UK in a ""diabolical negotiating position"". MPs could give Mrs May ""a powerful mandate to change that backstop"" by voting it down on Tuesday, he said. Former Cabinet minister and Leave campaigner Theresa Villiers has said that the UK could cope with a no-deal scenario if ""preparation is stepped up"" and the EU co-operated.

""Increasingly I doubt it,"" he said when asked about it becoming a reality, adding it was ""more likely that it won't happen"". He added there could be a ""hell of a backlash"" if Mrs May's ""economically damaging"" Brexit were to be imposed without another referendum. Are rivals lining up to oust Theresa May?

But lawyers acting for the EU said allowing countries to do so could create ""endless uncertainty"". The case has been brought by a group of Scottish politicians who oppose Brexit. They hope it will give clear guidance to the UK Parliament about the options open to it as MPs vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal - and that it will result in ""no Brexit"" being an alternative to either ""no deal"" or Mrs May's deal. Brexit deal is ""doomed"" - Fallon Trump: Brexit deal threatens UK-US trade deal A guide to where we are with Brexit The UK government says it has no intention of calling off Brexit, and says the politicians bringing the case are using it as ""ammunition"" in their campaign to halt the withdrawal process. The court also heard from lawyers representing the Council of the European Union and from the European Commission, who both argue that revoking Article 50 is possible - but that it would require unanimous agreement from the other 27 member states. They are concerned that the case could set a precedent where other countries would be able to formally notify their intention to leave and then seek better terms from the remaining EU countries, before cancelling their withdrawal. Analysis by Adam Fleming, BBC News in Luxembourg There were two emotions on display in the ECJ's gold-encrusted courtroom: hope and fear. The UK government was worried that anything said about Brexit by European judges could be used as ammunition in the battle to bring down Theresa May's deal. The EU fretted about Article 50 being re-written in a way that meant a country could announce it was leaving then change its mind again and again, creating a state of permanent anxiety. Or worse, using it as a tactic to secure a better deal at the EU's expense. The campaigners who brought the case were just glad that the concept of Brexit being reversed had a very public airing so close to the vote on the deal by MPs. Hubert Legal, the chief lawyer for the European Council, argued that allowing unilateral withdrawal could therefore lead to ""disaster"", of which ""the main victim could be the European project altogether"". This was echoed by lawyers for the European Commission, who said states could act in an ""abusive"" manner by stopping and restarting the countdown clock, creating ""endless uncertainty"" - which the two-year time limit built into Article 50 was designed to guard against. A four-hour hearing on Tuesday morning saw the full court of 27 judges consider the arguments in the case. The court has said it will aim to decide ""quickly"" on the case, but has not yet set a date for doing so. The case is being considered against the backdrop of Prime Minister Theresa May fighting to sell her draft Brexit deal to MPs, ahead of a vote in the Commons in December. The UK will leave the EU on 29 March under the terms of ""Article 50"", a two-year notification of withdrawalwhich MPs triggered in March last year. The case has been brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians including Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, MEP Alyn Smith and MP Joanna Cherry of the SNP, and Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler. They say it could give MPs an extra option when considering whether to approve the draft deal or not, because it could keep alive the prospect of calling off Brexit Mr Wightman said the question was ""vital"", saying that ""the chaos around Brexit shows no sign of being resolved"" and that the UK parliament ""must be fully informed of all of its options"". Aidan O'Neill QC, who is representing the Scottish politicians, told the court that European lawyers were inviting the judges to act ""unconstitutionally and in contravention of the rule of law by reinterpreting the treaties"". He said: ""It cannot be in the interest of the union as a whole to force a member state to leave the union against the wishes of the people. ""The union's wider interest lies with member states remaining in the EU when their peoples wish to do so."" The UK government has opposed the case being heard from the outset, butfailed to prevent it going before judgesin Luxembourg after a series of appeals. TheUK government's position,externalis that the court has ""long refused for very good reasons"" to answer hypothetical questions which could interfere with domestic politics. They argue that because ""the UK does not intend to revoke its notification"", the question of whether it can do so unilaterally is a hypothetical one. Ms Cherry raised the case and the issue of revoking Article 50 with Mrs May in the Commons on Monday, prompting the prime minister to say that ""it is not going to happen because it is not government policy"". Advocate General Lord Keen, who is representing the UK government, argued in court that the case was being used as ""ammunition"" by opponents of Brexit, and said the judges should find it inadmissable.

"Mr al-Jubeir criticised the way Turkey has shared information with Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia's foreign minister has ruled out extraditing to Turkey suspects in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Adel al-Jubeir said: ""We do not extradite our citizens."" Just over a week ago, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded the extradition and on Wednesday a Turkish court issued arrest warrants. Saudi Arabia has charged 11 people with the murder, which took place in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Arrest warrants were issued in Turkey for former Saudi intelligence chief Ahmad al-Assiri and former royal adviser Saud al-Qahtani. Mr al-Jubeir criticised the way Turkey has shared information with the kingdom. ""The Turkish authorities have not been as forthcoming as we believe they should have been,"" he said, quoted by AFP news agency. ""We have asked our friends in Turkey to provide us with evidence that we can use in a court of law. We have not received it in the manner that it should have been received."" Where the Saudi prince stands revealed Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far Journalist who stepped into a consulate and vanished Mr Erdogan says the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government but insists he does not want to damage the Saudi royal family. It denies that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the killing. The Gulf kingdom's public prosecutor has said Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate as a result of a ""rogue operation"" on the orders of an intelligence officer. Khashoggi was given a lethal injection after a struggle. His body was then dismembered inside the consulate in Istanbul and the body parts were handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the grounds, the prosecutor said.

"Japanese prosecutors have charged former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn with financial misconduct, accusing him of under-reporting his pay package over a five-year period. He has also been re-arrested on further allegations of under-stating his pay, which is likely to keep him in detention until 30 December. Mr Ghosn has previously denied the accusations. Prosecutors have also charged Nissan in relation to the case. Mr Ghosn was arrested in November after the allegations first surfaced. Monday was the last day he could be held by authorities before he either had to be charged or released. His defence team say the accusations against Mr Ghosn are invalid because they do not relate to his salary, but to future payments that he was expected to receive after retirement. Nissan said it was taking the situation ""extremely seriously"". ""Making false disclosures in annual securities reports greatly harms the integrity of Nissan's public disclosures in the securities markets, and the company expresses its deepest regret,"" the carmaker said in a statement. A source close to the firm said that the charges were not unexpected ""given the company flagged its concerns"" to prosecutors after it had conducted an internal investigation. Carlos Ghosn: The driven 'cost killer' Five charts on the Carlos Ghosn scandal The new charges against Carlos Ghosn will allow prosecutors to continue detaining him until 30 December. His interrogations will continue and can be done without Mr Ghosn having his lawyer present. In Japan there is nothing surprising about this. But elsewhere there has been real shock at the draconian nature of Japan's justice system. American attorney Professor Alan Dershowitz today likened Japan's system to that of authoritarian regimes like Iran, Cuba and even China. Secondly Carlos Ghosn has been effectively accused of the same offence twice. The new arrest warrant accuses him of under-reporting his pay for a further three years (2016-18). A former prosecutor, I have spoken to, says this suggests the Tokyo prosecutors have no other evidence of wrongdoing against Mr Ghosn. If that is the case, the former prosecutor told me, the case against Mr Ghosn is very weak. But he says, because it is such a high-profile case, they will feel compelled to press charges and take the case to its conclusion. If Mr Ghosn is convicted, the charges could mean up to 10 years in prison.  The charges also carry a fine of up to 700m yen ($6.2m; Â£4.9m), according to the Japanese regulator, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission. Originally, prosecutors said that Mr Ghosn and senior executive Greg Kelly - who has also been charged with financial misconduct - had conspired to understate Mr Ghosn's pay from 2011 to 2015. The fresh charges, issued on Monday, allege they did the same thing from 2016 to 2018. From 2010, Japanese firms have been required to disclose the salaries of executives who earn more than 100m yen ($888,000; Â£697,000). His hero status was so big that his life was serialised in one of Japan's famous cartoon comic books The Brazilian-born boss of Lebanese descent and a French citizen says his background left him with a feeling of being different, which helped him adapt to new cultures In France he was known as Le Cost Killer, a comment on the deep cuts he made to revive Renault He was once tipped as a potential president of Lebanon, a move he eventually dismissed because he already had ""too many jobs"" In a 2011 poll of people the Japanese would like to run their country Mr Ghosn came seventh, in front of Barack Obama (ninth) Carlos Ghosn profile: The driven ""cost killer"" Brazil-born Mr Ghosn, aged 64, known as the Le Cost Killer for his radical approach to restructuring, was the architect of the Renault-Nissan alliance, and brought Mitsubishi on board in 2016. In the past, he has been hailed a hero in Japan for turning around the ailing Nissan. French car maker Renault was seen as the dominant partner due to its 43% shareholding in Nissan, despite selling fewer vehicles. Nissan's shareholding in Renault is only 15%. Sources close to Mr Ghosn have previously described the accusationsas a ""clinically planned hatchet job"",arguing they were aimed at resetting the balance of power in the carmakers' alliance. While the governments of Japan and France insisted that the alliance of companies that manufactured 10 million cars last year should be preserved, it is widely thought that Nissan executives were uncomfortable at the power wielded over the company by Renault and concentrated in the hands of Mr Ghosn. NissanandMitsubishiboth sacked Mr Ghosn as chairman after the arrest last month. But Renault has held off doing so, saying he would remain as its chairman and chief executive, buthas appointed a temporary deputy chief executiveto take over the running of the firm.

"This video can not be played 'In this job sometimes things get very difficult. That doesn't mean you should run away from them', he said Carwyn Jones considered resigning as first minister after Carl Sargeant's death, he has revealed. Mr Sargeant was found dead in his home in November 2017, days after being fired from Mr Jones' cabinet over claims of inappropriate behaviour towards women. Aninquestinto his death was adjourned last week and a QC-led inquiry into the handling of the case is due in 2019. Mr Jones is standing down as first minister on Tuesday after nine years. Despite intense scrutiny of his actions since the death, Mr Jones has always denied he considered quitting at the time, until now. Mr Jones made the revelation in a BBC One Wales documentary, Being First Minister, to be broadcast on Monday, 24 hours before he steps down from the role. Carl Sargeant 'didn't have enough support' Drakeford set to be Walesâ first minister ""It was so intense I thought - well - the only way this is going to stop, is if I go,"" he said. ""If I'd have resigned a few days afterwards, it would have looked as if I was accepting blame. I couldn't do that. I couldn't do that."" Mr Jones announced last April he would stand down and Mark Drakeford, who won the Welsh Labour leadership contest last week, is set to take over on Wednesday. Carl Sargeant's conduct was under investigation when he was found dead at his home In the documentary, Mr Jones also discussed the impact Mr Sargeant's death has had on him. ""There's not been a day since Carl died that I haven't thought of it,"" he added. ""It does chip away at you. And you do then find yourself going down in terms of your mood. It's inevitable. ""It does affect the way you see the world - you wouldn't be human otherwise."" Mr Jones' wife Lisa said: ""Carl has been the biggest challenge for him.

"""Nothing is off the table"" when it comes to reassuring MPs over the Northern Ireland backstop, Downing Street sources say. This could include reopening the EU withdrawal agreement, even though that comes with risk, the sources say. Theresa May is understood to be pushing the EU for flexibility on the backstop. This is the clause in the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement that is meant to prevent the return of border checks in Northern Ireland. It would see the UK aligned with EU customs rules until a future trade deal is agreed that does not include a physical border between the EU and the UK on the island of Ireland. UK can cancel Brexit, says EU court Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Brexit: A really simple guide The backstop is meant to be a temporary measure but the UK can't leave it without the EU's say-so, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement. Many MPs fear this will mean the UK will end up indefinitely tied to the EU with no say over its rules - and that is why they are planning to vote against the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday. Those campaigning for another EU referendum have, meanwhile, been given a boost by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which hasruled that the UK can cancel Brexitwithout the permission of the other 27 EU members. Former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett, who is campaigning for another referendum, said: ""This is confirmation that it is still up to us to decide whether we want to keep the existing deal we've got in the EU rather than accept a bad deal negotiated by the government."" But Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the ruling does not alter the government's intention to leave the EU in March 2019. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We voted very clearly - 17.4 million people sent a clear message that we wanted to leave the European Union and that means also leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. ""So, this case is all very well but it doesn't alter either the referendum vote or the clear intention of the government to make sure that we leave on 29 March."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson said it was a ""relatively simple job"" to change the withdrawal agreement He rejected newspaper reports that Tuesday's Commons vote will be cancelled to prevent the prime minister suffering a defeat of historic proportions that could end her premiership. Mrs May has previously insisted there can be no deal with the EU without the backstop - and it would be impossible to change the terms of the withdrawal agreement. She has repeatedly warned her own MPs that a rejection of her deal could lead to a general election - or possibly""no Brexit"" at all.,external That has so far failed to convince dozens of Tory MPs who are planning to join Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the DUP and the SNP in voting against it. So, in a change of tone, Downing Street is now saying the withdrawal agreement could be tweaked to reflect concerns about the backstop. By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg On the face of it, it's pretty extraordinary to imagine that the UK government could be genuinely asking to reopen an agreement that took 18 months to put together, has already been through the grinder on multiple occasions and was only concluded a fortnight ago. But since the ink dried, it has become clear that the chance of getting the deal through Parliament is very small. One minister said: ""It's only a deal if it's ratified."" Perhaps for wavering MPs, even the sign of the PM continuing to push for more will make a difference. Read Laura's blog Mr Gove said the prime minister was ""seeking to improve"" the agreement but there were ""risks"" involved. ""If we do attempt a fundamental reopening or renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement, European Union countries, who recognise just how uncomfortable the backstop is for them, may change the withdrawal agreement in a way that may not necessarily be to our advantage,"" he said. He said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that he would mount a Tory leadership challenge if Theresa May stood down or was forced out after losing Tuesday's vote. On Sunday evening, Mrs May spoke on the phone to Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, whose support could be vital if she were to negotiate further with the EU. She also spoke to the European Council President Donald Tusk,who tweeted,externalit would be ""an important week for the fate of Brexit"". Boris Johnson said Mrs May could stay on if she lost Tuesday's vote - but must renegotiate the deal with Brussels. Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit strategy, told the BBC he did not want a ""no-deal"" Brexit or another referendum, but it was not right to say there were no alternatives. He said the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" put the UK in a ""diabolical negotiating position"". MPs could give Mrs May ""a powerful mandate to change that backstop"" by voting it down on Tuesday, he said. Former Cabinet minister and Leave campaigner Theresa Villiers has said that the UK could cope with a no-deal scenario if ""preparation is stepped up"" and the EU co-operated.

""Increasingly I doubt it,"" he said when asked about it becoming a reality, adding it was ""more likely that it won't happen"". He added there could be a ""hell of a backlash"" if Mrs May's ""economically damaging"" Brexit were to be imposed without another referendum. Are rivals lining up to oust Theresa May?

"The number of people out shopping in the UK in November dropped to its lowest level since the 2008 recession, retail researchers say. Footfall at shopping centres, retail parks and High Streets fell 3.2%, according to analysis firm Springboard. The figures showed the Black Friday effect was driving more shopping online during a longer period, the firm said. The decline was ""indisputable evidence"" that Black Friday was of no benefit to physical stores, it added. Springboard said it expected footfall to decline by 4.2% year-on-year in December, a bigger drop than the 3.5% decrease seen in December 2017. ""These figures are the worst footfall figures that Springboard has recorded since the recession and we're not actually in recession,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard's marketing and insights director. ""It's clear that something significant is happening out there in consumer demand. It has really railed back this year."" Ms Wehrle warned that more High Street chains could collapse in January. Carphone Warehouse faces Black Friday backlash Black Friday shoppers 'spending less' The growth of online shopping has been one of the main challenges facing the UK's High Streets, which have seen a number of store chains collapse this year as trading conditions worsen. Springboard said the UK's political turmoil over Brexit was also having an impact on shoppers' purchasing decisions. ""As we head into the zenith of the retail trading calendar, both retailers and consumers alike are in the midst of the greatest degree of uncertainty in recent times,"" said Ms Wehrle. ""However, the fact that the Parliamentary vote is not taking place until the middle of December might deliver a slight glimmer of hope for some large-ticket item retailers, as consumers may purchase now rather than later, in an attempt to outrun inflationary pressures that are expected should the Brexit deal not be ratified.""

"Theresa May has attended a church service near her Maidenhead constituency The Commons vote on Tuesday will not be delayed, the Brexit Secretary has said, amid growing calls for the PM to go back to Brussels to renegotiate. Stephen Barclay also said Theresa May could stay in post if, as expected, MPs reject her Brexit plan. The PMhas warned Tory rebels,externalit could lead to a general election, and there was a ""very real risk of no Brexit"". Boris Johnson said the PM could stay on if she lost but must renegotiate the deal with Brussels. The withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and EU has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by Parliament. Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Brexit deal 'huge step into the unknown' Brexit: A really simple guide But the government is widely expected to lose the vote with Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the DUP, the SNP and dozens of Conservative MPs saying they cannot support the deal. European Council President Donald Tusktweeted on Sunday,externalit would be ""an important week for the fate of Brexit"", after a phone call with Theresa May. This video can not be played Stephen Barclay said MPs shouldn't ""let the perfect be the enemy of the good"" Despitenewspaper speculation it could be called off,external, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said: ""The vote is going ahead and that's because it's a good deal and it's the only deal"". He warned against suggesting negotiations could be reopened: ""The French, the Spanish and others will turn round, if we seek to reopen the negotiation, and ask for more."" Alternative ways to break Brexit impasse The backstop explained And he insisted that Theresa May could remain prime minister, even if her deal is heavily defeated by MPs: ""Yes, the prime minister is fighting for us and will continue in post."" Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit strategy, told the BBC he did not want a ""no-deal"" Brexit or another referendum, but it was not right to say there were no other alternatives. He said theNorthern Ireland ""backstop""- effectively an insurance policy to prevent a hard border if no free trade deal is struck in time - put the UK in a ""diabolical negotiating position"". MPs could give Mrs May ""a powerful mandate to change that backstop"" by voting it down on Tuesday, he said. The border issue should instead be covered in negotiations over a future trading relationship with Europe, he said, and the UK should ""incentivise"" the EU by withholding ""at least half"" of the UK's agreed Â£39bn ""divorce"" payment, until a free trade is signed at the end of 2020. This video can not be played Boris Johnson said it was a ""relatively simple job"" to change the withdrawal agreement He dismissed suggestions he had already offered other Tory MPs jobs if they backed a future leadership bid by him as ""nonsense"" and said the public wanted to see a plan ""to get out of this mess"" rather than ""stuff about leadership elections and personalities"" - although he did not rule out challenging Mrs May for the leadership. And the former foreign secretary, a key figure in the 2016 campaign to leave the EU, said: ""Don't underestimate the deep sense of personal responsibility I feel for Brexit and what's happened. ""It breaks my heart to think that after all we fought for... that we should consign ourselves to a future in which the EU effectively rules us in many respects and yet we have no say around the table in Brussels."" By BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley Some Conservatives are urging Theresa May to defer Tuesday's vote, fearing a humiliating defeat which would destabilise the government. They hope more clarity or compromise on the backstop issue can be provided - and some wavering Tories won over. But others point out that no acceptable compromise has been found so far - and question whether one will be found now. They also point out that Brussels has shown little enthusiasm for revisiting the backstop. Indeed there are some who believe only a strong rejection of Theresa May's deal will encourage the EU to rethink. The Brexit Secretary said the vote would go ahead. With some still seeking to persuade the prime minister, it cannot be completely certain the vote will go ahead until Monday. If the deal is rejected, it is unclear what happens next.Mrs May told the Mail on Sunday,externalit would mean ""grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal"". Protesters calling for another referendum to decide the issue were joined by politicians from across the political spectrum at a rally on Sunday, including Tory peer Lord Heseltine, Green MP Caroline Lucas, and Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan. Actor Charles Dance was among those at the rally Conservative former minister Philip Lee told the rally in east London: ""I think a People's Vote is the best hope that we have of reuniting our country after this sorry episode."" Ms Lucas said the message to Mrs May was: ""We don't want your vision of a mean-minded little Britain, with our borders closed and our horizons narrowed."" And Dr Allin-Khan said: ""The promises made in 2016 are so far removed from the reality of the 585-page Withdrawal Agreement that it's time to take the Brexit decision back to the people."" She was careful to say that the vote should only take place if there was not a general election - it is Labour Party policy to call for an election and, only if that does not happen, to keep ""all options"" open, including a referendum. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn told ITV News that he would ""have a discussion"" with Rosena Allin-Khan, who is a shadow minister, about her appearance at the rally: ""She's entitled to her point of view. I would rather she and every other Labour MP spent today and tomorrow and Tuesday concentrating solely on making sure we defeat this deal."" And former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said there was ""a very large chunk of people who would feel utterly betrayed"" if another referendum was called. AUKIP-organised ""Brexit Betrayal"" march also took placein London, amid controversy over leader Gerard Batten's decision to appoint controversial activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser. On Saturday, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd suggested a so-called ""Norway Plus"" option - which would see the UK remaining in the European Economic Area and joining a customs union with the EU - could be another possibility, if the deal was rejected. But Mr Barclay told the BBC: ""I don't think it honours the referendum result"" - saying it would not give the UK control over immigration. Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet over the deal, also said Mrs May should ""immediately"" renegotiate with Brussels, if MPs reject her deal. Asked if she would consider a leadership bid, she told Sky News it was not about ""personalities"" and she would back the PM if she renegotiated the deal. This video can not be played The BBC's Leila Nathoo on how the Commons vote will play out But she did not rule it out, saying she'd give it ""serious consideration"" if she were asked to stand. Justice Minister Rory Stewart told the BBC that the government ""should come back again"" to Parliament if it loses Tuesday's vote, potentially with some ""small adjustment"" to the deal but suggested some MPs were using the backstop ""as an excuse"" to reject it. Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey would not confirm that Labour would immediately put down a motion of no confidence in the prime minister. She said: ""We will have to see what happens on Tuesday... we will have to make an assessment at the time and we will be in discussions with other political parties across the House to assess the best thing to do."" She added that the PM should call a general election, having lost a key proposal, but added ""alternatively she could offer to renegotiate around a deal that would provide consensus in Parliament"".

"Fortnite is more than a game - it's a global phenomenon. Not many titles in recent years have merited their own clothing range or kept England footballers glued to their screens after training. The popularity of the survival game, with its tense Battle Royale format, has grown and grown over time. It now has 200 million registered players worldwide - last January it had 40 million players. But despite being a global hit, Fortnite has never topped the UK charts. That's simply because the game itself is free - players can then spend money on purchases within the game, most of which are downloaded digitally. And the industry is still using physical units sold rather than revenue to measure a game's success. Watchdog: Parental controls on in-game purchases Five things we've learnt about Fortnite Fortnite being blamed for divorce While the launch of a new season of the game has become a regular event, the idea of having lots of updates and downloadable content - meaning the experience of the game is ever-evolving - is not unique to Fortnite. In fact, the days where the game that came in the box is the same one you're playing weeks, months or even years later are long gone. Instead, they are increasingly seen as a service rather than a product. While Fortnite is perhaps the most successful example of it to date, other major releases like Call of Duty and Fifa are following the same script. In the UK in 2017, gamers spent Â£2.67bn on digital, mobile and online products including in-game purchases. In comparison, they spent Â£790m on box software - physical games used in consoles. It is this second category on which the charts are based. Epic Games, the company that owns Fortnite, is tight-lipped about how much it makes from the game. Bloomberg has estimated that the whole company, with all its products, is worth between Â£3.9-6.2bn ($5-8bn). The industry faces challenges when it comes to regulation, too, as the laws and guidelines have to keep up with the fast-evolving world of gaming. The Gambling Commission has raised concerns that in some instances the worlds of online gaming and gambling could become blurred. It has highlighted ""unlicensed third-party websites offering illegal gambling linked to popular video games,"" where players can stake a bet on things like the value of their virtual weapons inventory. Astudy conducted by gambling psychology researchers,externalat the University of Adelaide in Australia found online gaming's system of ""microtransactions"" closes the gap between gaming and gambling, and may pose a risk for vulnerable players. In September, the World Health Organization added a definition of gaming disorder to its latest edition of the International Classification of Diseases. On top of this, some parents have been caught out by their children unwittingly making large purchases on their credit cards. A Fortnite spokesperson pointed out that most consoles do have the option to set a spending limit (which can include zero) as well as age restrictions. And anyone concerned about interactions with other players can switch off the chat function in-game, as well as on the console itself. As well as the regulators, the wider gaming industry itself has had to evolve to keep up with the latest innovations. While it has traditionally been dominated by major titles that are developed by hundreds of people, cost millions to make and at least Â£50 to buy, games like Fortnite have lower up-front costs and are free. By keeping players engaged with in-game purchasing and frequent updates, they can make a company a lot of money. Meanwhile, the latest estimates from theDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport,externalsuggest that jobs across the wider computer games sector more than doubled between 2011 and 2017, from 13,000 to 30,000. In Fortnite's seventh season, which is released on Thursday, players can expect more costume additions, map changes and plenty of snow. These might seem like small adjustments but, by adding more content, tweaking the game map and updating what players can see and experience, developers are trying to give audiences a reason to keep coming back.

"Surveyor Myrddyn Phillips said the popularity of Foel Penolau might increase now it has been upgraded to a mountain Two Welshmen went up a hill, but came down a mountain. That's because Myrddyn Phillips and Aled Williams are surveyors who found a Snowdonia hill was in fact a mountain. While Foel Penolau is over the 2,000ft (609.6m) required to be a mountain, the minimum drop between the col - the lowest point on a ridge between two peaks - and summit was under 98ft. The pair have found that the drop has now increased to 104.6ft, and is therefore a mountain. As a result of the survey, Foel Penolau has been included in the list of Hewitts - hills in England, Wales or Ireland over 2,000ft high which have a minimum drop of 98ft. Antarctic mountain heights re-measured How Greenland would look without its ice sheet Rocket rumbles give volcanic insights Foel Penolau, in the northern Rhinogydd range, was previously classified as a hill because there was just 85ft (26m) of drop from col to summit. This is how Foel Penolau compares to other mountains in the UK and further afield Myrddyn Phillips has been measuring mountains for almost 20 years Col is a French word used universally to refer to the lowest point on a mountain ridge between two peaks. The feature is called a bwlch in Welsh, or a saddle in English. Mr Phillips and Mr Williams suspected the drop at Foel Penolau might have changed because the col is made up of a large boulder field liable to movements. ""It is one of the many ridges I and colleagues measured over many years - it is a fantastic ridge,"" said Mr Phillips, 57, a mountain surveyor andblogger,externalfrom Welshpool. In August,Fan y Big in the Brecon Beacons was downgraded to a hillafter Mr Myrddin measured its col to summit height at 93.5ft. Previously mountain heights were recorded by a process called photogrammetry, which involved flying over and taking measurements of the distance to the land below. The Trimble GeoXH 6000 is far more accurate - and easier - than older methods Mr Phillips explained that the device he uses, a Trimble GeoXH 6000, has a margin of error of just 4in (10cm) compared with 9.8ft (3m) for the older process. But the decision to measure Foel Penolau came from good old-fashioned gut instinct. Drone's film shows Scots climber injured in Himalayas Nepal storm kills climbers on Himalayan peak Gurja Mountain rescue plea after man's Snowdon climb in pants Foel Penolau is in the Rhinogydd range of Snowdonia National Park ""We had an inkling. It is one we have wondered about for a few years but you never know until the results come in,"" he said. ""But everything tied up so nicely and all matched. It is a stunning mountain, and one of the best in Wales in my opinion."" Wales now has 136 Hewitts and it is the first time a Welsh hill has entered the classification due to its drop value since the list was first published in 1992.

"Do you need to be Korean to be a K-pop artist? That's the question Bora Kim wanted to answer when she created EXP Edition. What started as an academic assignment soon developed into the world's first non-Korean K-pop band. They've faced criticism, accusations of cultural appropriation and even death threats, but three years on, the band is still going strong. How have they done it? And... why? Growing up in South Korea, Bora Kim spent her high school days listening to K-pop - the pop/hip-hop, Korean/English blend that has become a cultural juggernaut and spawned a thousand ""idols"". But it was only when she went to the US in 2014 to study for a masters at the prestigious Columbia University in New York that she started to question the real meaning of K-pop. ""When I was young I never imagined that people outside of Korea would consume Korean culture,"" she said. ""[When I got to the US] K-pop was really gaining momentum and I started seeing it in a different light. I started thinking... Is it only K-pop if Korean people do it? How can we push K-pop? What limits are there?"" Bora made the decision to start a boyband while she was studying at Columbia She decided the best way to answer her question was to make a K-pop band of her own - consisting of solely non-Koreans. This would be her thesis project over her next two years at Columbia. The only question left was: ""How am I going to materialise this?"" Her goal was to make a K-pop band that could exist in the real world. ""We wanted to pick non-Korean members that would represent New York,"" she said. ""So the first thing we did were auditions."" Six members were eventually chosen and would go on to make up EXP Edition. ""Some of them were really strong vocally, others were really good at dancing, but all of them just had a lot of personality,"" said Bora. The final hopefuls were: Croatian Sime Kosta, Portuguese-American Frankie DaPonte from Rhode Island, half Japanese-German Koki Tomlinson who grew up in Texas, New Yorkers Hunter Kohl and David Wallace and Texan Tarion Anderson. (L-R) The band's original members consisted of Hunter, Sime, David, Koki, Frankie and Tarion None of them had any Korean heritage - and many of them had never really listened to K-pop before. And didn't speak Korean. Bora decided to name the band EXP Edition, short for experiment. The band needed to release a single in the summer of 2015 as part of Bora's thesis show - but they had a lot of catching up to do. Most Korea artists go through a vigorous training process. They're managed by huge music companies who train them from a young age before their debut into the K-pop world. As a result, the average K-pop star is incredibly polished - able to dance to impeccably choreographed numbers, sing in pitch perfect Korean and look flawless from head to toe. To be a K-pop band, EXP Edition would have to do in months what most Korean artists do in years. They started learning Korean from Bora herself, going for singing classes and throwing themselves into dance practice. Their songs were written by a music producer - a friend of Bora's who was working at Columbia. She would then translate the lyrics to Korean - and they would have to memorise it by heart - something Bora calls a very ""DIY"" process. After months of training, the band finally debuted their first single, Luv/Wrong. It's fair to say it wasn't... brilliant. And it wasn't a huge success. But by that point, they had been training for months and already had a full set put together - so they decided to start performing in live shows, and were slowly booked for events across New York.

When Bora's MFA programme ended - and she was awarded her masters - the obvious question was: ""What's next?"" ""The boys expressed to me that they wanted to concentrate on EXP Edition,"" said Bora. They decided to launch a Kickstarter - and managed to raise $30,000. They also received an additional investment from a private investor. Hunter, Frankie, Sime and Koki decided to go ahead with the move to Korea ""It seemed like the next logical move as a K-pop group would be to move to Korea,"" said Bora. ""It was a huge decision especially for the guys, leaving their friends and family behind."" Two band members - David and Tarion - decided that they would not go through with the move. But the other four were onboard. ""We realised if we didn't give it a shot we would regret it so we were like - let's do it,"" said Hunter. In August 2016, the band made their official move to Korea. ""It was so hard when we moved to Korea,"" said Bora. ""The boys were learning Korean and their dance and vocal instructors were all Korean... they were waking everyday at 6AM to practice. Whenever they talk about those early days they tear up."" Their Korean debut came in the summer of 2017, when they released a music video and performed live on a Korean variety show. EXP Edition were featured across Korean media outlets when they debuted in Korea The boys performing in downtown Seoul ""People in Korea were so intrigued by the guys and so welcoming and supportive,"" said Bora. ""I remember one audience member came up to me after the show and said the band really made her rethink what K-pop is."" But are they K-pop? EXP Edition has faced a non-stop backlash - from the early days when they launched - even up to today, with many saying they are not and will never be K-pop. They've received death threats, hundreds of insults online and have even been called out by YouTubers for being ""fake K-pop"". Some accused the band of cultural appropriation - disrespectfully cashing in on Korean culture. ""[People were] very vicious, very hateful. They said what we were doing was a disgrace,"" said Bora. ""I think they thought our intention was to disrespect K-pop - that was always my fear, that people would think we're here to mock K-pop,"" said Sime. Can a girl from the Bronx become the next K-pop star? The hidden Westerners in Korean drama What do non-Koreans love about K-pop? Why foreign language music is now a hit How to be the perfect K-pop fan It's obvious when speaking to the band that their newfound passion for K-pop is truly genuine - and that Korea is really starting to grow on them. When talking about Bora, they use the Korean word for CEO and then turn to each other in confusion when I ask what it means: ""Wait what's the English word for that?"" one of them asks. Their latest music video - a huge improvement from their Luv/Wrong days - could signal that K-pop is slowly outgrowing its roots. Bora says the accusations of cultural appropriation are not entirely fair, because K-pop itself draws on so many influences. ""There is no single origin or traditional Koreaness to K-pop, it's such a mixture of everything - it has influences from US and Japan,"" she said. Allow YouTube content?

New York-based journalist and K-pop expert Jeff Benjamin says there are other elements than Koreanness that make K-pop what it is. ""K-pop music itself is less defined by the sounds - basically every song has singing, rapping, a dance break and fuses different genres - and more about elements such as the intense training system, the glossy music video production, the variety shows and music programs they perform on, among other non-musical elements,"" he told the BBC. ""EXP Edition can recreate the sound, the look, the vibe of K-pop acts, but they can't recreate the literal blood sweat and tears to go into becoming a 'K-pop star' and that is what I think makes them lack the ability to be called K-pop."" K-pop BTS - undoubtedly the most famous K-pop band - is known not only for their music but also their unique visual aesthetic Dr Haekyung Um, a music lecturer at Liverpool University echoes this. ""Would I consider EXP Edition to be K-pop? It's a difficult question. What they sing and dance could be in line with K-pop style, but they are created outside the South Korean music industry that produces 'authentic' K-pop."" EXP Edition have in recent months been appearing on Korean variety shows, live music programs. They're still training vigorously and though they haven't made it to the big time yet, they have accrued a small but growing group of fans. For Bora, there's no longer any doubt about what they are. ""Are we K-pop? Yes we are,"" she says. ""But we're something different at the same time because all the guys come from different backgrounds - we're a fresh hybrid of it.""
