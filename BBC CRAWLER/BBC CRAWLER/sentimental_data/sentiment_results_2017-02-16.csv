"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored 23 goals so far for Manchester United this season Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his first hat-trick for Manchester United and the 17th of his career in a Europa League win over Saint-Etienne at Old Trafford. Ibrahimovic's deflected free-kick wrong-footed goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier and dribbled over the line for the opener, and he tapped home from close range after good work from Marcus Rashford, as well as adding a late penalty - his 23rd goal of the season. Saint-Etienne caused United problems on the break in the first 45 minutes, particularly with Romain Hamouma's pace, while Henri Saivet and Nolan Roux both clipped efforts narrowly off target. Ruffier's double save denied Juan Mata, Anthony Martial forced the visiting goalkeeper into sharp saves and Paul Pogba headed against the crossbar from close range. The two sides meet for the second leg on Wednesday, 22 February (kick-off 17:00 GMT). Relive Man Utd's win over Saint-Etienne Three goals allowed man-of-the-match Ibrahimovic to keep the match ball There were question marks over the signing of veteran striker Ibrahimovic on a free transfer from Paris St-Germain in the summer, but the former Sweden international has responded by taking his tally to 23 for the season. The 35-year-old former Juventus, Barcelona and AC Milan man has now netted 17 career hat-tricks. It was his first since joining United, his second in European competition and his third against Saint-Etienne. ""Every time I have played against Saint-Etienne, with hard work there has been a couple of goals,"" Ibrahimovic said after the game. ""I have scored a couple of goals tonight and hopefully I can do the same next week."" The Ligue 1 side will be pleased to see the back of Ibrahimovic when he retires having scored 17 times against them during his career. Ibrahimovic has 11 titles and three domestic cups to his name, but a major European trophy remains missing from his illustrious CV. Like Ibrahimovic, United have never won this competition, but the result keeps alive their hopes of a cup treble this season. They face Blackburn in the FA Cup fifth round on Sunday and Southampton in the EFL Cup final the following week. In his first season at Old Trafford, Jose Mourinho's side are just two points off a Champions League spot in the league, but triumph in the Europa League would give them an automatic passage through to Europe's elite club competition. Against Saint-Etienne, the Red Devils tested Ruffier on numerous occasions but he was left floundering for the first goal, while his parry into the danger area allowed the second. On the other hand, the Ligue 1 side carved United's backline open with ease at times, with defender Eric Bailly looking particularly suspect, but they failed to work goalkeeper Sergio Romero into a single save with their 14 shots. Florentin Pogba (left) sported brother Paul's number six on the side of his head The world's most expensive player, Paul Pogba, was up against his brother Florentin, who was signed by the French side for 500,000 euros in 2012. Mother Yeo and third brother Mathias watched from the stands as the two shared a warm embrace before kick-off, with the elder sibling Florentin sporting a number 19 on one side of his head and his brother's six on the other. ""It is something very magical, it does not happen every day and I really enjoyed playing against my brother,"" said the United player. France international Paul showed why the club spent Â£89m to sign him from Juventus in the summer with a dominant midfield performance in which he controlled the tempo of the match. However, on one occasion he inadvertently gave the ball away to Florentin, whose burst forward eventually saw the ball reach Saivet, but the on-loan Newcastle man could not find the target with his shot. Florentin's rising drive in the first half almost saw him nick an away goal for his side, while Paul wasted good chances in the second period, the best of which came as he headed against the woodwork when unmarked. The Saint-Etienne defender's evening ended early as he hobbled off with an injury with 12 minutes remaining. While his side ran out comfortable winners in the end, Mourinho was not happy with the start his side made, and accused his players of lacking focus. This video can not be played Mourinho could tell Man Utd players 'weren't focused' in warm-up ""In the first half, we played so bad, and we managed to finish it winning 1-0 when we don't deserve,"" he said. ""It was down to lack of concentration. I had the feeling immediately in the dressing room - too noisy, too funny, too relaxed. Then my assistants had the feeling in the warm-up, with some of the guys not really focused on getting the right adrenaline in their bodies. ""So, lack of concentration. And when you don't have it, it's difficult to recover it. So the first half was hard. We were lucky to be winning 1-0. I am not happy with it. I always think we have to play every game with the same attitude."" He said the second half was a ""different story"" and brushed off suggestions the players lacked focus because they were playing in the less-heralded Europa League than the premier European competition, the Champions League: ""We don't play Champions League, so if that is the case I would prefer to play in the Europa League than be at home watching TV. So I think with the players it is the same."" Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had a hand in 18 goals in 17 appearances at Old Trafford this season (12 goals, six assists). Jose Mourinho has kept five consecutive clean sheets as a manager for the first time since November 2011 when he was Real Madrid boss. Goalkeeper Sergio Romero has kept six consecutive clean sheets for United and hasn't conceded a goal since an Alex Revell penalty for Northampton in September 2016. The Red Devils have won three consecutive European games without conceding a goal for the first time since November 2010 under Sir Alex Ferguson. Despite not registering their first shot until the 30th minute, Saint-Etienne had 11 shots in the first half, the most by an opponent at Old Trafford in the first half of a match since Athletic Bilbao had 13 in March 2013. Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic told BT Sport:""We created good chances. It was important to get a good win at home and we bring it with us in the second leg. It was a good game but I think we can do better. ""We are winning but in a short time everything can change. It's important to keep getting the wins we need. Everything can change but we're happy at the moment. ""This is the decisive moment for the season. We are still in all four competitions. The fifth we already won [the Community Shield].""

"This video can not be played Facebook could be fined in Germany, if it refuses to remove stories which are proved false I have been in Dortmund and Berlin this week, investigating how Germany is leading the fightback against fake news. There have been some high-profile cases here.Breitbart reported that a mob attacked,externalGermany's oldest church, St Reinold's Church in Dortmund. The website has subsequently published alengthy defence,externalof its original article, together with an admission that it is not in fact the oldest church in Germany. I visited the church and spoke at length to locals, including a pastor who works in the city (and was named in the Breitbart report), and a local refugee support worker. They were unanimous in the view that the Breitbart report misrepresented true events in service of an anti-Islamist agenda that was divisive and unjust. In Berlin, I spoke to Anas Modamani, a 19-year-old Syrian who enjoys taking selfies. So much so that three weeks after turning up in the German capital, having come from the outskirts of Damascus via a boat trip, Turkey, Greece and Macedonia, he took a selfie with Angela Merkel, who was visiting his hostel. It promptly went viral, together with the false claim that he was a terrorist.He is now suing Facebook,external. Germany's political class wants to take action.Lars Klingbeil,external, a fast-rising star of the Social Democratic Party who is a close associate ofMartin Schulz,external, told me his plan to tackle fake news. Perhaps Damian Collins, the Tory chairman of Parliament's culture select committee here, who has launchedan inquiry into fake news, could pick up some ideas. Anas Modamani's selfie with Angela Merkel led to him being falsely accused of being a terrorist Facebook now employs independent fact-checkers here. Correctiv is a smart outfit whose employees are mostly young. Correctiv monitors suspicious stories, looking at how much they are being liked and shared. If the headline looks suspicious, or it appears on a website known to be dubious, the Correctiv team will contact the original sources for the story, to verify if it's true or not. They then mark it true or false, and send a message to all German users of the social media platform, indicating its rectitude or otherwise. They don't accept money from Facebook, because they want to retain total editorial independence. But they too are a sign of how, outside of America, Germany is leading the fight against fake news. Read more: MPs' inquiry into fake news examines threat to democracy How do fake news sites make money? How Facebook is starting to tackle fake news in your news feed Based on my conversations here, there are several reasons why Germany has got ahead of the curve on this important issue. First, Mrs Merkel's refugee policy is hugely controversial, and has galvanised that part of the political spectrum that, thus far, has shown the greatest propensity for creating fake news internationally: the nationalist far-right. It turns out letting in a huge number of refugees is a good way to mobilise purveyors of fake news. Second, because of Germany's 20th Century history, there is a hyper-sensitivity about the rise of that far-right. The success of Alternative for Germany, a nationalist party, and the ever-present but low-level threat from neo-Nazi groups make many Germans determined to act fast. Third, the traditional media sector here is very different to those of Britain and America. The most influential newspapers are staid rather than raucous; the cable news channels are more BBC or CNN than Fox News, and talk radio has nothing like the oomph that is generated by the likes ofRush Limbaugh,externalor, now on LBC,Nigel Farage,external. Germany's most influential newspapers are considered to be staid Germany's conventional media market has created an opening for fake news, which of its very nature is salacious and exciting. Fourth, there have been several high-profile cases. The Modamani case is perhaps the most notorious. Groups like the Resistance of German Patriots have been happy to spread nationalist propaganda, with a limited regard for facts. Fifth, my sense is that Germany retains a strong belief in the competence and capability of government. If there is a social problem, goes this thinking, perhaps it is capable of a political solution, by virtue of smart regulation. That was the impression Mr Klingbeil gave, but the belief that fake news should be combated by regulation is not restricted to social democrats: Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats are also putting pressure on Facebook to make it easier for users to flag suspicious content and delete posts, while those targeted by fake news would be given a right of reply. Sixth, there are local and national elections coming. Fearing a repeat of America's recent experience, where fake stories went viral and may have influenced some voters, Germany believes prevention is better than cure. And Facebook, damaged by the fallout from fake news about Donald Trump, appears to agree. Fake news is not a problem that is going to disappear soon; nor is it one thatany journalist can ignore, or be neutral toward. It behoves all of us in this trade - at least those of us who retain a belief that truth is possible and necessary - to wish Germany success in this fight.

"When I first read Mark Zuckerberg's 5,500-word letter to the Facebook community, I was struck by two things. How far it ranged - over subjects as diverse as globalisation, the people who feel left behind, our spiritual and communitarian well-being - as well as the rather more obvious social media issues of fake news, polarisation and sensationalism. And secondly, thatthis letter could be described very fairly as a manifesto,external. It is not just a statement of where Facebook as a business is going. It is also a statement of the type of world Facebook believes it can help create. As such, it is political (although carefully crafted to contain no direct reference to the new US president). And when I interviewed Mr Zuckerberg, the same sense of political purpose was clear. And the same care not to reference Donald Trump. Of course, many will find talk of ""connectedness"", ""community"" and ""bringing people together"" very easy to dismiss. Here is a very rich man running a very powerful - and often controversial - company, who, one assumes, might find it hard to relate to the ordinary concerns of the ex-steel workers of Monessen, Pennsylvania, or the former pottery workers of Stoke in the west Midlands. But in an era of technology giants like Facebook which have so much ""reach"" - 28.5m users in Britain alone - the rebuttal is simple. Better that Mark Zuckerberg is public about his vision for his company - agree or disagree with that as you like - than the alternative of corporate silence. In my interview with him, I did push on taxes paid (or not) and privacy violations. Mr Zuckerberg answered that he wanted Facebook to be a ""good corporate citizen"". And on fake news it is clear that Facebook, and other technology giants, have been ill-prepared for the type of editorial controls necessary in an era when millions of people receive their news via their chosen ""filter bubble"" with little mediation. Facebook, Google and others have a central philosophy - act quickly to launch new products and then ""iterate"" if there is a problem. That has led to mistakes, which Mr Zuckerberg does admit to. This is a century when the most powerful are not simply the elected leaders or dictators of the world, but are the corporate leaders who can do so much to influence - and control - what billions of people experience every day. Speaking publicly about how they view that role is, for many, better than the alternative. We can then at least test his company, this global behemoth, against the standards Mr Zuckerberg has set himself. Does the Facebook founder want to be a politician? Particularly given that he sounds so much like one - and I mean that in the broadest sense, not pejoratively. Not yet, certainly. And maybe not ever. As the head of a company with 1.86 billion active users a month, he is probably well aware that he has plenty of power already.

"This video can not be played Trump and Netanyahu - in 90 seconds A playful exchange between President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actually said a great deal about the dim prospects of a successful negotiation with the Palestinians under current circumstances. ""I think we're going to make a deal,"" President Trump said on Tuesday as he rolled out the red carpet for Mr Netanyahu at the White House. The contrast in the tone of the US-Israeli relationship was tangible given the well-documented tension between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. ""It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That's a possibility,"" Mr Trump added. ""So let's see what we do."" ""Let's try,"" responded Mr Netanyahu. When Mr Trump chided him for not sounding sufficiently optimistic, the prime minister quipped, ""That's the 'art of the deal'."" Actually, it's the reality of the Middle East peace process, a hall of mirrors with a grim regional reality, a host of historical grievances, and zero-sum politics that make the odds of a meaningful negotiation remote, much less an actual agreement. US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, here next to wives Melania and Sara Notwithstanding the obvious chemistry between Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu - and a longstanding personal connection between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Trump's designated Middle East envoy and son-in-law, Jared Kushner - there is no chemistry between the Israeli leader and his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas. ""As with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises,"" Mr Trump observed correctly. However, the parties themselves are farther apart on the substance of the process - the borders of a Palestinian state, Israeli security arrangements within a Palestinian state, the right of return for Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem - than they were at the end of the Clinton administration. What will Trump mean for Israel? Is one homeland the solution? Blame and bitterness keeping peace at bay Both the Bush and Obama administrations expended considerable effort to close existing gaps and achieve at least a framework agreement that would set the stage for a final deal. Neither was successful. Obstacles were less about substance than politics. The centre of Israeli politics has moved markedly to the right; the left that embraced the essential bargain of the Oslo process, land for peace, has receded. The existing Israeli governing coalition is not wired to make concessions. In fact, it is pushing Mr Netanyahu to increase the settlement presence in the West Bank while accelerating construction in East Jerusalem. An Israeli soldier stands inside a guarding booth in the Gush Etzion Israeli settlement block in the occupied West Bank In 2009, the Obama administration demanded a freeze to all settlement activity. Israel reluctantly agreed, although some growth continued within settlements Israel would keep in any final deal. Rather than accelerate negotiations, settlements became a bone of contention within them. When the 10-month settlement moratorium ended, so did direct negotiations. Secretary of State John Kerry tried to achieve a framework agreement during Mr Obama's second term, but his one-year effort fell short. In a parting shot at Israel, when a resolution came before the UN Security Council declaring settlement activity to be an impediment to peace, the Obama administration abstained. President Trump criticised the ""unfair and one-sided"" treatment of Israel at the UN, a gesture Mr Netanyahu welcomed. Days before the meeting, the Trump White House cautioned the Israeli government that expansion of settlements beyond their existing borders was not helpful. Mr Netanyahu may moderate the current pace of settlement activity but he is not going to stop it. The Palestinians will continue to see settlement activity as a fundamental problem. A woman in the US during a ""Muslim and Jewish Solidarity"" protest. Mr Netanyahu is nicknamed ""Bibi"" The Palestinians are deeply divided. In 2006, Hamas won an unexpected majority of seats in the Palestinian legislature over Mr Abbas' Fatah Party. The Palestinians have lacked political unity ever since. Today, Hamas, not the Palestinian Authority, is the de facto government in Gaza. Full elections have not been held in more than a decade. The bottom line is that both sides prefer the status quo to making the politically painful concessions that a negotiation would require. Both Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu hope to pursue an ""outside-in"" strategy, building on shared regional concern regarding Iran and radical extremists including the Islamic State group to create momentum to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While reasonable in theory - Mr Netanyahu spoke of partnership with Arab states in opposition to Iran - co-operation at the governmental level does not necessarily translate to popular support. For many in the region, the plight of the Palestinians continues to resonate. Given the limited prospects confronting a two-state solution - progress that likely requires different leaders and mandates on both sides - President Trump made a small, but significant adjustment in US policy, expressing a willingness to support a one-state solution if both parties agree. But the two sides have very different visions of what a one-state solution looks like. A Palestinian man watches a joint press conference in the West Bank city of Hebron A key Netanyahu prerequisite for any deal is preservation of Israel as a Jewish state. On the other hand, in any agreement, Palestinians would insist on citizenship, voting rights and a government of and for the people - all of them. This could redefine Israel's identity. President Trump may see his one-state acknowledgement as the opening gambit in a lengthy negotiation. But a one-state solution potentially presents Israel with an existential choice. It can be a Jewish state or a democracy, but not both. That is a choice the United States has never wanted Israel to confront since the answer could have grave implications for the US-Israeli relationship.

"Making glasses and sunglasses fashionable has been the key to selling them at a high price Since their impending merger wasannounced in January, there has been remarkably little comment about the huge proposed deal to combine Essilor and Luxottica. But there certainly should be. These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer. It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is. ""The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,"" says Essilor. But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry. Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: ""This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user. ""Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them. ""Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,"" Mr Ilett adds. If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry. It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica. One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors. ""If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,"" he argues. The international chain Sunglass Hut is part of the Luxottica group In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. ""I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,"" he adds. Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by. But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor. Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was""an undisputed leader with only 25% market share"",externalof the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses. When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market. For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace. Luxottica makes frames carrying several well-known brands under licence, including Prada In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses. The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories. Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as ""a complex and extremely competitive market-space"". Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for aformal review,external. These are: a combined worldwide turnover of all the merging firms of over 5bn euros an EU-wide turnover for each of at least two of the firms of over 250m euros An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers. Hubert Sagnieres (left), chief executive of Essilor, and Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder and chairman of Luxottica A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal. ""The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,"" he said. ""We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,"" he added. The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules. But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution. ""Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,"" the firm says. ""It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself."" If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds. Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers. Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit. They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising. But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business. On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros. For the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros. With cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further. Will customers benefit as well?

" A shocking look at Russian football firms, from the thugs who terrorised Marseille to the next generation preparing for the 2018 World Cup by arranging brutal forest fights. At the 2016 European Championships, violent clashes between Russian and English supporters in Marseille put the spotlight on Russian hooliganism. Russian hooligans injured over 100 English supporters, beating two into a coma, and it raised serious concerns ahead of Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup. Filmmaker Alex Stockley von Statzer travels to Russia to experience the country's football fan culture first hand. Featuring footage filmed in Marseille in 2016, rare interviews with members of some of the most feared firms like the Spartak Gladiators and Orel Butchers, and new footage of an organised fight for wannabe recruits, this show uncovers a world where brutal violence has become a mark of honour and a symbol of newly resurgent Russian masculinity. Most Russian hooligans have moved away from the English movement that inspired them in the 70s and 80s. Today they are organised in firms that are teetotal, physically fit and trained in mixed martial arts. Police have enacted new laws promising bans and jail for any fans that cause trouble and are heavily policing stadiums. Alex travels to Oryol to speak to the Orel Butchers who violently attacked English fans in Marseille. We hear one hooligan taking relish in describing a merciless attack by a number of Russians who kicked an England fan in the head - an attack that was also caught on camera. Alex also travels to Rostov, which will host five games at the World Cup, to film an organised fight in the woods. Here he meets with a local firm getting ready to audition for new members. Young men fight in a no-holds-barred brawl against young fighters from another local firm. It's a vicious clash similar to what was witnessed in Marseille and is one of the hundreds of fights that firms arrange all across Russia. 59 minutes",Positive,1.0

"Arsenal's heavy defeat in Munich left their hopes of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals in tatters A decision on the future of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will be made at the end of the season - but a new contract remains on the table. Despite Wednesday's Champions League last-16 first-leg thrashing at Bayern Munich, there is currently no prospect of Wenger leaving before the summer. It is expected the decision for him to stay or leave will be mutual between the club and the Frenchman, 67. Wenger, in charge since 1996, was offered a new deal earlier this season. He typically makes his decisions at the end of a campaign, when he is able to reflect on how the year has unfolded and what needs to happen next. His current contract with the Premier League club expires at the end of the season. Match report: Arsenal torn apart by Bayern 'Outclassed', 'lowest point', 'embarrassing' - is Wenger's time up? Arsenal collapse a nightmare - Wenger Listen: Arsenal are a laughing stock - journalist Henry Winter Arsenal have not won the league since 2004, though Wenger has consistently guided them to Champions League qualification, reaching the knockout stages 14 years running. However, the Gunners will almost certainly exit the competition at the last-16 round for the seventh straight year after the5-1 defeat at Bayern Munich. The nature of the loss, coupled with successive league defeats by Chelsea and Watford, has prompted several former Arsenal stars - some of whom played under Wenger - to suggest his time at Emirates Stadiumis coming to an end. This video can not be played FA Cup: Sutton boss Doswell wins battle to scout Arsenal and not watch EastEnders The Gunners ended a nine-year wait for a trophy by beating Hull City in the2014 FA Cup final,and won the competition againthe following season, Speaking after the4-0 winover Aston Villa at Wembley in 2015, Arsenal's players said they were convinced the consecutive titles would herald greater success, but failure to secure further silverware has seen pressure on Wenger grow. After the Gunners lost 3-1 to Premier League leaders Chelsea earlier this month - a result that left them 12 points behind the Blues - ex-England defender Danny Mills said Arsenal""have settled for fourth again"". Earlier, former striker Ian Wright, who scored 185 goals for the club between 1991 and 1998, said he believed Wenger's time as Arsenal boss was ""coming to the end"", although the Frenchman laterdenied giving any indicationof his future plans.

"In a letter, a group of mental health professionals said Mr Trump was incapable of serving as president It seems an incredible question to ask of a man who ran a multi-billion-dollar business and vanquished seasoned political opponents on his way to highest office in the US. But experts are debating the mental health of the US president. The discussion of Donald Trump's mental health has come to the fore following an open letter from dozens of professionals who say his ""grave emotional instability"" makes him unfit for the presidency. The call seems to break a long-standing rule among experts of not diagnosing public people, and has been condemned by a leading psychiatrist, who described the ""psychiatric name-calling"" as an insult to the mentally ill. Debate over Mr Trump's mental fitness is nothing new, andexisted even before his election,external, last November. But the majority of mental health professionals have refrained from making public statements, following a self-imposed principle known as the ""Goldwater rule"", adopted by theAmerican Psychiatric Association (APA),externalin 1973. It prohibits psychiatrists from giving diagnosis about someone they have not personally evaluated. It was instated after a magazine asked thousands of experts in 1964 whether Republican nominee Barry Goldwater was psychologically fit to be president. The APA warned last year that breaking the rule in trying to analyse the candidates in the presidential election was ""irresponsible, potentially stigmatising, and definitely unethical"". Psychiatrists were warned against making assumptions about the mental health of the candidates But now, some professionals have spoken out, including those who have signed a petition asking for Mr Trump's removal. It has now gathered more than23,000 signatures,external. Some have suggested,externalthat Mr Trump has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). People with this condition often show some of the following characteristics, according toPsychology Today,external: Grandiosity, a lack of empathy for other people and a need for admiration They believe they are superior or may deserve special treatment They seek excessive admiration and attention, and struggle with criticism or defeat In aletter to the New York Times,external, 35 mental health professionals warned that the ""grave emotional instability"" indicated in Mr Trump's speech and actions made him ""incapable of serving safely as president"". They said experts had remained silent because of the Goldwater rule, but that it was time to speak out. ""This silence has resulted in a failure to lend our expertise to worried journalists and members of Congress at this critical time. We fear that too much is at stake to be silent any longer."" 24 things Trump believes Are things as bad as Trump says? The letter says Mr Trump has demonstrated an inability to tolerate different views The letter added: ""Mr Trump's speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behaviour suggest a profound inability to empathise. ""Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists)."" Earlier this week, Democratic Sen Al Franken said that ""a few"" of his Republican colleagues had expressed concern to him about Mr Trump's mental health. The concerns, he said, stemmed from questions about the president's truthfulness and the suspicion that Mr Trump ""lies a lot"". Apart from theapparent break of the Goldwater rule,external, other professionals say the psychiatric diagnosis of Mr Trump is an insult to the mentally ill. Also in aletter to the NYT,external, Dr Allen Frances, who helped write the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, one of the main key manuals used to classify mental disorders, said that ""most amateur diagnosticians have mislabelled"" Mr Trump with the diagnosis of ""narcissistic personality disorder"". ""He may be a world-class narcissist, but this doesn't make him mentally ill, because he does not suffer from the distress and impairment required to diagnose mental disorder."" He added: ""Mr Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy. ""It is a stigmatising insult to the mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped with Mr Trump (who is neither). ""Bad behaviour is rarely a sign of mental illness, and the mentally ill behave badly only rarely. Psychiatric name-calling is a misguided way of countering Mr Trump's attack on democracy.""

"Miranda Hart as orphanage owner Miss Hannigan She's best known for falling over and breaking ""the fourth wall"" on her BBC One sitcom. Now Miranda Hart is making her West End theatre debut in the musical Annie. The Call the Midwife star, who will play orphanage owner Miss Hannigan, described it as ""a dream role"" that she never thought would become a reality. ""But here we are and I have a newly found musical theatre-esque spring in my step,"" she said. Set in 1930s New York during the Great Depression, Annie tells the story of an 11-year-old girl who wants to escape from a life of misery at Miss Hannigan's orphanage and find her parents. The score includes the songs It's A Hard Knock Life, Tomorrow and Easy Street. The sitcom Miranda began on BBC Two in 2009 before moving to BBC One ""I hope people will leave the theatre feeling life is a little better and dreamier and jollier after watching it, as much as we feel that performing it,"" added Hart, who broke the ""fourth wall"" by addressing the audience directly in her sitcom Miranda. ""Now if you'll excuse me, I have some leg-warmers to put on."" The show will begin previews at London's Piccadilly Theatre on 23 May. Further casting will be announced shortly.

"Camila Morrone, Laura Love, Harley Viera-Newtorn and Emily Ratajkowski at the Michael Kors show New York Fashion Week came to an end on Wednesday, marking the end of seven days of extremely good looking people wearing clothes we can't afford. NYFW is held twice a year - February and September - and this one focused on autumn/winter collections. We'll leave aside the fact that Wednesday is nobody's idea of the end of the week and focus on some of the highlights instead. 1. The hot convict's catwalk debut In 2014, 30-year-old convicted felon Jeremy Meeks was arrested during a gun sweep in California. But then something unusual happened. His mugshot went viralafter it was posted on the Stockton Police Department's Facebook page. It received more than 15,000 likes and several users left comments like ""hottest convict ever"" and ""Is it illegal to be that sexy?"" The blue-eyed bandit, as some fans branded him, was quickly snapped up by a modelling agent and his Instagram account now has 834,000 followers. Philip Plein must have been one of those who had his head turned, as Meeks has now popped up on the catwalk of the designer's autumn/winter collection. 2. The plethora of political statements L-R: Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, Bob Bland and Carmen Perez The way things are at the moment, it would be much more groundbreaking if someone in the public eyedidn'ttry to make a political statement. Nonetheless, there were politics aplenty at NYFW, perhaps most notably on the runway for the Mara Hoffman collection. The designer's show kicked off with opening remarks by the national co-chairs of the Women's March on Washington (pictured above). The Women's March was an international protest against US president Donald Trump which took place last month. Prabal Gurung incorporated political slogans into his collection Designers Public School also kitted out their models with hats reading ""Make America New York"" - a reference to President Trump's Make America Great Again campaign slogan. Models were also seen wearing shirts with slogans such as ""The Future is Female"" and ""We Will Not be Silenced"". It's unusual for fashion to dip its toes into the world of politics, but it seems even the most high-profile designers are keen to have their say on President Trump and his policies. 3. The rise of plus-size Ashley Graham for Michael Kors and Candice Huffine for Prabal Gurung This was not the first time that plus-sized models appeared at New York Fashion Week, but it may well be the most significant. Previously, designers have included plus-size models, very often in frumpy outfits, to gain publicity for their show. This time around, however, models like Ashley Graham (for Michael Kors) and Candice Huffine (for Prabal Gurang) were styled in a similar way to the other models. 4. Kanye West didn't do anything controversial Or he might've done. We don't know, as he didn't allow any photographers into his Yeezy Season 5 runway show. For all we knew he might have unveiled a new range of ""Taylor Swift Rules"" T-shirts. All we had to go on from the show were some grainy photos and shaky mobile phone footage from those who flouted the photography rules. However, all of the designs have now been posted online, making the camera ban somewhat pointless. One thing we do know is Kanye refused to walk the runway at the end of his show, as is customary for the designer. It seems that's about as controversial as it got. 5. Michael Kors brought an orchestra No recorded hip-hop or dance music for Michael Kors's show, oh no. He brought an orchestra. AN ORCHESTRA. This is a seriously classy touch. 6. The hijab catwalk show Indonesian Muslim designer Anniesa Hasibuan has made the hijab her trademark over the last two seasons. This week, she built it into the outfits on display at her NY Fashion Week show, styling it with flowing gowns. All of the models in Hasibuan's autumn/winter 2017 collection were seen with grey hijabs, signalling that such sightings on the catwalk could become more common. Interviewed backstage, the designer said her dream would be to dress Kate Middleton, adding that she admires the Duchess of Cambridge for ""her elegance"".

"The inspiration for Chloe's letter had been internet research showing Google's offices including bean bags, go karts and slides An ""entrepreneurial"" seven year old wrote to Google for a job and its CEO replied. After discussing her father's work, Chloe Bridgewater decided she would like to work for Google and penned a letter beginning ""dear Google boss"". It was only the schoolgirl's second letter, after her first missive to Father Christmas, but the search engine's CEO Sundar Pichai wrote back. Her father Andy said the girl ""took it all in her stride"". Google offers Chloe Bridgewater tour of London HQ, family reveal,external Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Chloe to work hard and follow her dreams ""We were gobsmacked, but I don't think Chloe could understand the magnitude of the reaction she'd got afterwards,"" said father Andy, a sales manager from Hereford. ""She's got a great entrepreneurial spirit. Ever since nursery, she's always been told in school reports she's bright, hard-working and polite - we're very proud of her and her younger sister [Hollie, five] is similar,"" he said. Chloe (centre left) with her sister Hollie and parents Julie and Andy Mr Pichai's full reply ""Thank you so much for your letter. I'm glad that you like computers and robots, and hope that you will continue to learn about technology.

""I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :) ""All the best to you and your family."" Chloe took the reply 'all in her stride', father Andy said Mr Pichai,who rose from humble beginnings in India, was appointed Google's CEO in 2015. The inspiration for Chloe's letter had been internet research showing Google's offices including bean bags, go karts and slides but she also highlighted a keen interest in computers in her application. Chloe also admitted to an interest in a job in a chocolate factory or as a swimmer at the Olympics in the letter, and Mr Pichai's reply said ""if she kept working hard and following her dreams, she could accomplish everything she set her mind to."" Mr Bridgewater said he and his wife Julie, a HR advisor, had seen Chloe's business acumen in action already. Besides her love of swimming - 20 lengths on Tuesdays with her mum - Chloe has also volunteered to clean the kitchen for 20p, he said. ""She is only young so she needs to play with her friends, jump on a trampoline but whenever she shows an interest in something else - like this letter - we want to encourage her,"" Andy said.

"Matt Lucas thanked Bristol University for ""this extraordinary honour"" TV comedy star Matt Lucas has been awarded an honorary degree by his former university. The actor studied Theatre, Film and Television at Bristol University in 1993 but did not complete the course. He took a year long sabbatical to join television show Shooting Stars and did not return. After high-fiving the chancellor, he said comedy partner David Walliams, also a university alumnus, would be fuming. David Walliams and Matt Lucas created characters such as Charles Gray and Vicky Pollard for Little Britain He and Walliams later wrote comedy sketch show Little Britain which became a huge hit. After being awarded the honorary degree, Lucas high-fived university chancellor Sir Paul Nurse. Matt Lucas described himself as a ""charlatan"" who had left Bristol University before completing his course He said: ""I stand here before you in receipt of this great tribute. You fools."" He said he quickly realised he had enrolled on a ""serious course"" but while other students found and challenged themselves, he just ""walked up and down nearby Whiteladies Road with a cough"". ""I was also just generally useless at university life. I had few friends and rarely left my room, unless it was to go and cook something in the kitchen. ""Today, you bring the entire university honours system into question by celebrating a charlatan who left university a year early in 1995, when most of this year's graduates were still in nappies, so that he could indeed wear a romper suit of his own, appear in a Cadbury Creme Egg advert and then do a sketch show with his friend,"" he said.

"Arsenal's heavy defeat in Munich left their hopes of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals in tatters A decision on the future of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will be made at the end of the season - but a new contract remains on the table. Despite Wednesday's Champions League last-16 first-leg thrashing at Bayern Munich, there is currently no prospect of Wenger leaving before the summer. It is expected the decision for him to stay or leave will be mutual between the club and the Frenchman, 67. Wenger, in charge since 1996, was offered a new deal earlier this season. He typically makes his decisions at the end of a campaign, when he is able to reflect on how the year has unfolded and what needs to happen next. His current contract with the Premier League club expires at the end of the season. Match report: Arsenal torn apart by Bayern 'Outclassed', 'lowest point', 'embarrassing' - is Wenger's time up? Arsenal collapse a nightmare - Wenger Listen: Arsenal are a laughing stock - journalist Henry Winter Arsenal have not won the league since 2004, though Wenger has consistently guided them to Champions League qualification, reaching the knockout stages 14 years running. However, the Gunners will almost certainly exit the competition at the last-16 round for the seventh straight year after the5-1 defeat at Bayern Munich. The nature of the loss, coupled with successive league defeats by Chelsea and Watford, has prompted several former Arsenal stars - some of whom played under Wenger - to suggest his time at Emirates Stadiumis coming to an end. This video can not be played FA Cup: Sutton boss Doswell wins battle to scout Arsenal and not watch EastEnders The Gunners ended a nine-year wait for a trophy by beating Hull City in the2014 FA Cup final,and won the competition againthe following season, Speaking after the4-0 winover Aston Villa at Wembley in 2015, Arsenal's players said they were convinced the consecutive titles would herald greater success, but failure to secure further silverware has seen pressure on Wenger grow. After the Gunners lost 3-1 to Premier League leaders Chelsea earlier this month - a result that left them 12 points behind the Blues - ex-England defender Danny Mills said Arsenal""have settled for fourth again"". Earlier, former striker Ian Wright, who scored 185 goals for the club between 1991 and 1998, said he believed Wenger's time as Arsenal boss was ""coming to the end"", although the Frenchman laterdenied giving any indicationof his future plans.

"It was Abraham Lincoln's 208th birthday last weekend. The US Republican Party's social media feeds honoured the 16th president by sharing a picture of his iconic memorial in Washington DC, with an inspiring quote laid over the top. ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that counts, it's the life in your years,"" was the message on Twitter and Instagram, also shared by President Trump. There was just one problem: the words have been attributed to Lincoln many times over the years, but there is no evidence he ever said them. The post has since been deleted. It was the latest example of a growing modern phenomenon, the fake political quote. Some have said ""fake news"" could have swung the outcome of November's US presidential election. Bogus stories like ""Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President"" were extensively shared online. Made up quotes are perhaps more benign than fictitious news stories with a clear political agenda. But they still raise concerns, says James Ball of Buzzfeed News, who is writing a book about ""post-truth"" politics. There is no evidence that the 16th president ever said this ""If enough people share and believe these fake quotes, then they can contribute to the polarisation of politics, making each side think less of the other, especially as many partisans think fake news is a problem which affects primarily (or only) their opponents."" These fake quotes don't just come from right-wing politicians and activists. In the days after the US election, a quote supposedly taken from a 1998 Donald Trump interview went viral online. ""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up,"" the quote said. It seemed too obnoxious to be true - and it was. Fake George Orwell quotes are a specialty in left-wing social media circles. One example is ""during times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."" There is no evidence the 1984 author ever said these words, but social media is awash with shareable pictures of them alongside Orwell's monochrome face. So how do bogus quotes like this get into circulation? Many fake quotes doing the rounds purport to be by George Orwell ""Sometimes people just want new followers or shares on social media, and either invent a quote or (naively or otherwise) lift a questionable one,"" says James Ball. ""Others invent quotes as a hoax or parody to show up people they disagree with, or to fire up their own side - or simply to make money from adverts on fake news sites."" The internet means fake quotes can spread very quickly. ""It's easier to fabricate things than it is to debunk them,"" says Rasmus Nielsen, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. ""As communication gets easier, there is going to be more and more of this stuff floating about online."" Jenni Sargent runs First Draft News,which is working with social media companies and news organisationsto look at innovative solutions to the problem. ""People are experimenting with the most engaging way to spread false information,"" she says. She wants news websites to come up with entertaining ways of debunking fake facts and quotes. A blue tick next to a name on Twitter tells you the account has been verified as ""authentic"". Sargent wants to come up with ways to highlight unreliable sources, ""like the opposite of a blue tick"". Facebook is introducing tools for German users to flag false stories ahead of that country's parliamentary elections in the autumn. Third-party fact checkers would mark unreliable stories as ""disputed"". Could a ""blue tick""-type system be used to verify online quotes? The BBC has also said it will fact check deliberately misleading stories ""masquerading as news"". British MP Damian Collins is chairing a parliamentary inquiry into these issues, which will look at the possibility of news websites having ""verified"" markers. Collins thinks fake quotes attributed to electoral candidates could end up ""distorting the democratic process"". Often verifying quotes is simply a case of rigorously searching through publicly available information, says Kim LaCapria, who works for rumour-busting website Snopes. The volume of dubious content online is greater than ever before, but verification can be easier because far more information is digitised, she says. ""It's actually pretty easy for average social media users to fact check online."" Her job involves looking at outright fake quotes, but also real quotes presented in a misleading way. For example, Al Gore has been ridiculed for claiming he ""invented the internet"". The former vice president did once say ""I took the initiative in creating the Internet,""but taken in full context, that line seems rather more modest,external. We are less likely to expend energy verifying a quote which confirms our political beliefs, says LaCapria, an effect which psychologists call confirmation bias. Whether a fake quote comes from the left or the right, it tends to have one common feature, she says. ""It validates our preconceived beliefs or feelings, and that's often proffered as a valid reason to spread it.""

"Is this cool? Yes, it's ICE COLD What thoughts do the store Iceland conjure up? Luxury goods, lobsters for Â£6 and award-winning mince pies, considered better than Fortnum and Mason or Selfridges? Or rows of freezing aisles stalked by former girl band members in track suits, and your mum, who can't be found elsewhere, because she has, of course, gone to Iceland? For a frozen goods specialist that's been around since 1970 and now has 900 stores, its image is remarkably fluid. But for customers today, it is seen as having excellent customer service. The consumer group Which? asked 7,000 people to rate the leading chains and theyvoted Iceland best for online- for the second year running. Respondents considered categories such as quality, value for money, service from delivery drivers, how easy it was to find products, and whether shoppers would recommend the retailer to a friend - and Iceland scored tops. Retail analysts have also got the Iceland message. ""You could have seen it as a bit of a dinosaur,"" says Paul Martin, head of retail at consultancy KPMG. But now, he is remarkably impressed at how Iceland's management team have updated a business that was ""not seen as cool"". And it's not just the online service he admires. ""They have improved the look and feel of stores, there's a new website, [and] they focused more on the healthy side of frozen. You can also now buy fresh food - something that just didn't exist in the past,"" he says. Ah, the past. Back in the 1970s, frozen food was hip. A chest freezer - the size you could put a body into - was the smart TV of its day. Not everyone had one, but if you could, you did. Iceland isn't all cool Bejam was the go-to High Street supplier, and they even provided the freezer. Iceland bought the chain out in 1989. It has ticked along outside the big league since then, changing ownership - neatly, actually owned by an Icelandic company at one time - but its core remains frozen food. But frozen food hasn't been cutting it these days with the upper echelons of society. Style arbiter Peter York, who has advised many luxury firms and enjoys the high life himself, has always thought it's not quite his thing. ""I see frozen Christmas treats full of sugar. I don't see [Iceland] as having things that won't make you as big as a pig. The imagery of Iceland is the Atomic Kitten woman [Kerry Katona, who fronted its TV ads in 2008]. ""I fear it wouldn't meet my metropolitan liberal elite needs."" But, given its popularity, even he would be willing to explore its range, as long as he didn't have to walk too far: ""I'd be in like Flynn if there was one near me. 'Dear Iceland, send us one - we the people of Pimlico want an Iceland.'"" I explained that its popularity was in fact for online shopping, and therefore he needn't extend his morning walk. Peter York's food assistant won't even have to push one of these... customers scored Iceland highest for its online delivery ""Oh,"" he says. ""I'm going to make the person who does my food ordering have a look."" Perhaps it should not be a surprise that it scores so highly on home delivery. It started doing this in 1999 - way before its rivals got serious. Not a lot of people know that. And that could be why, says KMPG's Paul Martin, it scores highly. ""[Because it's not as popular as the Big Four supermarkets], it's easier to book a delivery slot."" But he has praise for both the design of the website and the ""very friendly"" drivers. Iceland's joint managing director, Nick Canning, promises there will be more to notice the chain for in future. ""It feels like people are finally opening up their eyes to the quality we deliver, and we have much more innovation planned for the year ahead, so please stay tuned - Iceland's customers won't be disappointed.""

"A stiff upper lip, a pot of tea and a nice orderly queue. So far, so British. But the great British pastime of standing in line may not be as simple as it seems. According to academics if you want to truly master the art of the queue, you need to follow the rules. It's all about the power of six, professors say. People will wait for six minutes in a queue before giving up and are unlikely to join a line of more than six people, researchers at the University College London found. Six is also the magic number when it comes to spacing - gaps of fewer than six inches between people can spark anxiety or stress. But the biggest faux pas of all is the push-in; queue jump at your peril. The report's author, Adrian Furnham, Professor of Psychology at UCL, said the public nature of queuing means that queue jumping sparks a ""huge sense of injustice"" among those in line. He pointed to previousresearch,externalby Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede, which claimed: ""The British believe that inequalities between people should be minimized, and everyone should have the autonomy to pursue goals with equal opportunity."" The UCL study was based on a review of academic literature on queuing at banks, cash points and supermarkets. Other queue no-nos include striking up a conversation while queuing and standing on the wrong side of escalators - though this was mainly a complaint of Londoners who feel tourists ""misuse"" the Underground. The report found the most confusing rule for foreigners could be the practice of one person offering their place in the queue to another. Professor Furnham said: ""The British have a well-established culture of queuing and a very specific type of queue conduct, one that has been known to confuse many a foreign visitor. ""In a time when Britain is changing rapidly, and the ways in which we queue are shifting, the psychology behind British queuing is more important than ever - it is one of the keys to unlocking British culture."" Is forming an orderly queue really the British way?

"Sammy Blair and his children Ellie (10) and Lennon (7) in hospital in December 2016 It is news that no-one wants to say and no-one wants to hear. But what is the best way to tell your child that you have cancer? One in two,externalof those born after 1960 in the UK will be diagnosed with some form of cancer during their lifetime - many of those will be families with children who will face that question. University College London Hospital Cancer Collaborative hasreleased a video,externalexplaining how to go about it. Honesty is the best strategy and crying is OK because it communicates to children that showing emotion is normal, it explains. This video can not be played Here's some advice on how to approach such a tricky subject. Animation by Fruit Fly Collective The animation also reminds parents that young children can have a very basic understanding of sickness and may think wrongly that you can ""catch"" cancer like you catch a cold. It also warns that some children might blame themselves or think that all people with cancer will die. A short version of the video was posted on theBBC Family and Education Facebook page,externaland parents and children began to share their advice. Thirty-seven-year-old Sammy Blair lives in Motherwell and found out just before Christmas that he has terminal stomach cancer. He immediately told his young children Ellie and Lennon. ""I told them I had been for an operation but they couldn't get the cancer out and there is nothing we can do. I told them that even though I look OK on the outside, I don't feel fine inside. ""I said that yes, I will die but that I'll fight for as long as I can. ""It was devastating to hear my wee boy say, 'Daddy, I don't want you to go.'"" Sammy told his children to ask him any questions but they still refuse to discuss his illness with close family and he worries that they are blocking out the information. Adele Hanna, 52, and her late husband, Richard, broke the news of Richard's prostate cancer when their three-year-old sons saw him taking tablets at dinner. ""I was cooking tea, and one of the boys asked if the medicine was going to make Daddy better. ""Me and Richard just looked at each other - we both became tearful. Eventually I took a deep breath before starting a simple conversation saying, 'No, Daddy isn't going to get better, Daddy is seriously ill and he is going to die. You're not going to see him again."" Richard and Adele Hanna with their twin sons shortly after they shared the news that Richard had cancer She said that brutal honesty was the best strategy for her family. ""It was hard, very hard. My husband had to walk out of the room. ""When he returned we talked about Daddy's tears and mine - after all, it's normal to cry when you feel sad. ""We had a big hug and all cried, followed by lots of kisses. The boys finished their dinner, swinging their feet and chitter-chatting. ""It is about being kind, being honest and being clear, which is not easy at a time of fear, panic, anger and denial,"" Adele says. Adele Hanna with her sons Christopher and Louis, who are now nine Adele and Richard also emphasised to their sons that their dad did not want to die and that it was nobody's fault but it would definitely happen. ""Say the big words and be as factual as you can,"" she explains. Natasha Boor's mum, Rebecca, died from cancer 10 years ago - but Natasha, who is 26 and now a care assistant in Kendal, barely remembers her mum discussing it. ""She said it was an illness like a growth or alien growing in her stomach and she would get surgery. ""When it didn't work she said she just needed some medicine."" Rebecca died shortly afterwards, but even to this day, Natasha is not sure what type of cancer she had. ""I overheard her she saying she was scared of dying - but that was different to what she was telling me. ""I don't remember her telling me she would die."" Natasha Boor does not remember if her mum ever told her she would die from cancer The mystery around her mum's sickness made Natasha feel like her family were keeping secrets, and she connects this to anxiety and hypochondria she has experienced as an adult. ""I grew paranoid about things being kept quiet and I have unanswered questions and memories about things that happened at the time, things I can't ask anyone about."" Natasha doesn't blame her mum for hiding information. ""My mum was an amazing, honest and open woman but she was also very proud - she didn't want me to see her upset or in pain."" Now Natasha tries to channel her memories of her mum. ""I've adopted her loud laugh so I feel like she's shining through me - I am getting married on her birthday so I feel like she is part of my wedding too."" Natasha's advice to parents who find themselves having to tell their children about a serious illness is to be fully open.

"The rejection by the Church of England's ruling body of a statement that marriage in church could only be between a man and a woman is one of the main topics in the day's papers. The Daily Telegraph believes the Church of England,externalhas now moved a step closer towards allowing gay marriages. It also says the vote exposes deep divisions within the Anglican church. The Church of England's general synod rejected a report that maintained church marriages should be between men and women The Times calls it a ""historic vote"" which narrows the gap between the law of the land and the doctrine of the established church.

"Seal hunting in Norway is a dying industry Captain Bjorne Kvernmo, who first began hunting seals more than four decades ago, guides MS Havsel into the harbour of Tromso, the Norwegian city that owes its existence to his trade. But his vessel is not arriving laden with dead seals. Rather, he and his crew are in Tromso for the premiere of a documentary about Norway's last seal-hunting expedition to the dangerous ice edge off the coast of Greenland. Sealers - One Last Hunt,externalis an unashamed celebration of a controversial industry that a century ago numbered more than 200 ships. Their owners, captains and crews did much to shape the economy of coastal Norway, which stretches north of the Polar Circle towards Russia and the Barents Sea. Along with many locals, the documentary's producers lament the demise of the seal-hunting industry. Captain Bjorne Kvernmo of the MS Havsel ""People buy meat in the store that's packed in plastic, and they don't want to see how animals are killed,"" says co-producer Trude Berge Ottersen. ""Seal hunting is an old culture and tradition. It's been a big part of northern Norwegian culture. So for me it's better to eat seal meat than to eat chicken or produced salmon."" Accusations of animal cruelty have long been levelled at seal hunters in the Arctic by campaigners. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) describes the commercial hunts as ""cruel and wasteful"". The Humane Society refers to ""defenceless pups [that] die a cruel death"". Greenpeace is opposed to what it calls an ""inhumane and cruel industrial hunt"", while defending traditional hunting by Arctic Indigenous communities. Seal hunting has been a big part of northern Norwegian culture Images of bleeding seals purportedly clubbed to death by brutal hunters have been a persuasive feature of anti-sealing campaigns that eventually brought the Norwegian seal-hunting industry to its knees. And while the film also features pools of red-hot seal blood as it mixes with pristine white snow and blue ice, it paints a more nuanced picture by offering an insight into the harsh conditions endured by the Arctic hunters. Mr Kvernmo believes the protesters who have shaped public opinion have misunderstood the situation. ""I know a lot of their information is wrong - it's not a real picture of what's going on,"" he says. Gry Elisabeth Mortensen, who co-produced the documentary with Ms Ottersen, agrees. Ending government subsidies has rendered seal hunting uneconomic Seals are no longer clubbed to death, she explains. Rather, high-powered guns with expanding bullets are used to deliver a swift death. ""I think it's perhaps the most ethical meat you can have,"" Ms Mortensen argues. ""The seals are lying on the ice, maybe sleeping, and then they get a shot in the head, and that's it."" After the seals have been shot, dedicated ""jumpers"" use the hakapik hunting tool - a heavy wooden club with a hammer head and a hook. The jumpers deliver blows to the animals' heads to ensure they are dead, before hooking them and dragging them back to the boat. ""Jumpers"" approach the seals after they have been shot to deliver the final blow with a club ""We are doing it in the most humane way that it could be done,"" Mr Kvernmo says. However, the entire debate about whether Norwegian seal hunting is cruel has been rendered largely irrelevant by a 2009 European Union ban on trade in seal products. That includes skins that are made into boots and jackets, omega 3-rich oil used in food supplements, and meat that has been served in restaurants or cooked in homes across the Arctic region. Seal-skin boots can still be bought in Tromso's shoe shops, but probably not for much longer. Boots made from seal skin can still be bought in Tromso ""It's over,"" says Mr Kvernmo as he heads into the cinema for the screening of the documentary. ""In Norway, there's nobody hunting anymore. The protest industry has been the winner."" However, the withdrawal in 2015 of a 12m kroner (about Â£1m) Norwegian government subsidy means the practice is no longer economically viable. Subsidies had accounted for up to 80% of sealers' income. More lucrative opportunities now await Mr Kvernmo. These days, his boat is kept afloat by fees from film crews, which help ensure seasoned seal hunters' knowledge about the Arctic lives on. Sealers are now having to look for other opportunities ""Throughout all these years on the ice and at sea, Bjorne really has a lot of knowledge and respect for the nature and the animal life there,"" says Ms Ottersen. Mr Kvernmo is also working for the oil and gas sector, again putting him at odds with environmentalists. ""We don't think there's any room for oil in the Arctic,"" Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace, told the recent Arctic Frontiers conference in Tromso. Greenpeace is one group opposing oil exploration in the Arctic Norwegian energy giant Statoil has been exploring the Arctic for oil and gas. Bjorn Otto Sverdrup, its head of sustainability, defends its policy and says there has to be a gradual shift to renewable energy. ""We cannot change that system overnight."" The Norwegian government also argues that oil and gas exploration can take place safely in the Arctic. ""We have shown that it is fully possible to combine ocean-based industries, such as fisheries, aquaculture, shipping and energy, and a healthy marine environment,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg told the Arctic Frontiers conference. ""But it is crucial to set high environmental standards and ensure that these are met."" Norway is also set to announce a national ocean strategy. ""Sustainable use of ocean resources is the very foundation of Norway's prosperity and well-being,"" Ms Solberg said. Although the formerly lucrative seal hunt has become a thing of the past, Norway's Arctic gold rush appears to be far from over.

"The European Commission says the UK has two months to address ""persistent breaches"" of air pollutants - specifically nitrogen dioxide - after itissued a ""final warning"". Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from sources including factories and vehicles, particularly diesel engines, and is linked to an increased risk of respiratory problems. Under EU law, when air pollution limits are breached member states must implement air quality plans to bring the levels back down. The commission says the UK failed to address repeated breaches of legal air pollution limits for nitrogen dioxide levels in 16 areas including London, Birmingham, Leeds, Southampton and Glasgow. It says if the UK fails to act within two months, it could take the matter to the European Court of Justice. The UK could face a lump sum fine or a daily penalty payment decided by the court. The commission says more than 400,000 people die prematurely in the EU every year as a result of poor air quality. Germany, France, Spain and Italy were also served with warnings. To date, legal action on NO2 has been taken against 12 member states, the commission says, with ongoing infringement cases against Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the UK. The commission says air quality standards are being exceeded in 23 out of 28 member states - including more than 130 cities across Europe. What are your solutions for air pollution? It suggests possible measures to lower polluting emissions include reducing overall traffic volumes and switching to electric cars. The European Commission says reducing overall traffic volumes will help reduce the amount of pollutants The commission says reducing emissions from diesel-powered vehicles is an ""important step"" towards meeting the EU air quality standards. The warning has reignited calls from organisations for a ""clean air act"" with targets to reduce pollution levels in the UK. Friends of the Earth say an act will be needed to protect the public from air pollution once the UK leaves the EU to ""help safeguard existing legal protections"". The charity is also calling for: ""Clean air zones"" in all areas failing limits for NO2, for all vehicle types, in place by 2018 A government commitment to phasing out diesel by 2025 Vehicle tax changes so that diesel vehicles are discouraged A ""carefully-designed"" vehicle scrappage scheme for clean vehicles and alternatives to driving Jenny Bates, Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, says road traffic is the biggest problem and diesel vehicles are the ""worst of all"". Friends of the Earth wants road tax changes to discourage diesel vehicles Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, agrees that traffic emissions are ""the main culprit"", particularly those from diesel. ""Scrappage incentive schemes will help drivers to move to cleaner vehicles, without being financially penalised,"" she said. Diesel cars: What's all the fuss about? The government says it is ""firmly committed"" to improving the UK's air quality and cutting harmful emissions. It says the UK meets the legal limits for ""almost all"" pollutants. In October,proposals were announcedfor clean air zones for Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, Derby and Southampton by 2020. The zones aim to encourage drivers to choose less-polluting electric cars and will also introduce restrictions on older, polluting commercial vehicles. Under the plans, electric cars could be given priority at traffic lights and exempted from one-way systems. They could also be given preferential parking spaces and lower charges. Electric cars could be given priority at traffic lights in the proposed clean air zones Councils with clean air zones are also expected to restrict access to older buses, coaches, taxis and lorries with emit high levels of gases such as nitrogen dioxide. Birmingham and Leeds also plan to extend restrictions to polluting vans. This could mean a charging zone for commercial vehicles with high levels of emissions, or by introducing stricter licensing requirements for buses and taxis. Are electric cars ready to go mainstream? The clean air zones are the government's response to a UK Supreme Court ruling, which ordered it to take action to meet European limits on air pollution. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the government had committed more than Â£2bn since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emissions vehicles and support greener transport schemes. ""We will update our air quality plans in the spring to further improve the nation's air quality,"" the spokesperson said.

"This video can not be played Bayern Munich 5-1 Arsenal... in memes Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has reached ""his lowest point"" and may quit the club this season, says his former Gunners captain Martin Keown. He is one of several of Wenger's former players who feel they have seen a change in the long-serving boss. Arsenal are facing a seventh successive last-16 Champions League exit following a5-1 thrashing at Bayern Munich. Ex-Arsenal defender Lee Dixon said: ""This team is getting no response from him. I've never seen him like that."" Frenchman Wenger, at the helm since 1996 but whose contract expires at the end of this season, has not won the Premier League since 2004, but Keown told BT Sport: ""Arsene must be considering his future now."" Match report: Arsenal torn apart by Bayern Arsenal collapse a nightmare - Wenger Listen: Arsenal are a laughing stock - journalist Henry Winter Former England full-back Dixon added on ITV: ""He just seems so low. ""That is the first time where I've seen him where I've thought, 'he thinks it's time'. The fact that he hasn't been able to get a response from the players in the last few weeks might be the final straw."" Arjen Robben fired German champions Bayern into the lead at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday, but Arsenal fought back and equalised when Alexis Sanchez followed up and finished his own saved penalty. However, in the second half the Gunners capitulated, as Bayern excelled in a 10-minute period during which Robert Lewandowski restored Bayern's lead before Thiago Alcantara scored twice. Substitute Thomas Muller scored late on to surely put the tie beyond the Gunners. Keown - a defender who made 449 appearances for Arsenal - said recently he expected his former manager to get one more season. However, after watching the Bayern defeat as a pundit for BT Sport, Keown questioned whether he should stay. ""It's almost embarrassing. Outclassed, outplayed,"" he said. ""I can't ever say I'd like to see him go (but) this is his lowest point ever as Arsenal manager."" Last week, former striker Ian Wright, who scored 185 goals for the Gunners from 1991-98,told BBC Radio 5 livehe did not expect Wenger to stay on next season. After the drubbing in Germany, Wright posted his frustrations on social media and declared he was ""not watching anymore"". Bob Wilson, goalkeeper in the first Arsenal side to win the double in 1971,told BBC Radio 5 live on Thursday:""I wouldn't be at all surprised that Arsene now, with the amount of headlines that are coming his way, will look at that and say 'two decades'. ""He might just look at that and say 'OK enough is enough' because I think as a human being you can only take so much. ""He's a very sensitive guy and he's hurt, I doubt he will sleep very much between now and a horrible game on an artificial pitch at Sutton."" Arsenal's next fixture is an FA Cup fifth-round tie at non-league Sutton United on Monday (19:55 GMT kick-off). This video can not be played Bayern Munich 5-1 Arsenal: Wenger on Gunners 'nightmare' Arsenal's only major silverware in recent years has been consecutive FA Cups in 2014 and 2015. Successive defeats by Watford and Chelsea dented their league campaign, and although Wenger's side returned to winning ways with a 2-0 victory over Hull last weekend, the Gunners are fourth in the table, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea. Former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin was at the Allianz Arena for BBC Radio 5 live and described Arsenal's performance as ""shambolic"". ""The negativity before the game feels more like a realism,"" he said. ""Arsenal were totally outplayed by a team who are good but weren't utterly brilliant. ""The one team at the top level they have beaten is Chelsea with that3-0 (at the Emirates in September). ""Other than that, they've got draws, they've been beaten and it's the top ones - I include Everton in that as well - they don't seem to be able to overcome them. ""It's exactly the same in the Champions League and it's a real shame, it just feels very close to the end. I've never said it before about Arsene but it does feel that way now."" Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said Arsenal showed no fight or aggression. ""They looked spineless,"" the ex-England captain said on BT Sport.

""He has lost his leadership skills, there's no invincible streak in him any more,"" he said. ""From top to bottom there's no leadership. They have a silent owner who is sleepwalking towards the abyss. Wenger has been overtaken by Conte, Klopp and other managers.""

Be grateful for what you've had Gooners because you won't find a better manager than him prepared to come to Arsenal. These are the glory years. ThePundit:Has anyone seen Mesut Ozil? He has been missing since last November, last seen strolling around the Emirates against a mediocre Premier League team. If found, please contact A. Wenger.

"Every year in the UK, 3,000 people's sight is damaged by a condition called giant cell arteritis. The symptoms can appear very suddenly and end in irreversible blindness.  Dr Saleyha Ahsan met a group of people who've been affected and explains what to look out for. ""My mother in law lost a lot of weight, she was very low mood, very painful scalp, jaw pain - and when I say painful scalp, brushing her hair became impossible,"" says Amanda Bartlett. ""Within the four hours that we were in eye casualty, towards the end she reached round her chair and grabbed my hand and said 'Amanda, I can't see anything.'  And she lost her sight that afternoon."" Another woman tells me she felt ""jaw ache, neck ache, earache and painful shoulders"". It culminated in a ""sort of flash in one eye, and I actually lost the sight in this eye for about three minutes"". Section of a temporal artery damaged by GCA At first, some people mistake the symptoms for a migraine - one describes it as ""a cap of pain like my brain was being squeezed"". But these are all classic signs of giant cell arteritis (GCA). It occurs when arteries in the head and neck become inflamed and giant cells accumulate in the artery walls. One of the arteries commonly affected provides blood to the optic nerve, which transmits information from the retina to the brain. Blocking the nerve and starving it of blood can cause permanent blindness. The window of treatment is small - in some cases, sight can be lost within days or even hours. The only thing that can save it is immediate treatment with steroids. Severe, often sudden headaches not relieved by painkillers - they tend to affect one side of the head or temples Tenderness to the head and scalp - brushing hair can be painful Swollen temporal arteries visible to the naked eye Jaw pain especially when talking and chewing Vision problems including double vision, blurred vision and sight loss in one or both eyes The symptoms of GCA usually develop quickly but there may be earlier warning signs such as weight loss, day and night sweats, tiredness, mild fever, loss of appetite and depression. It is related to another, less serious, condition called polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) which causes muscular pain and immobility.  These illnesses can appear independently but often come together. GCA affects about a tenth of people with PMR in the UK. GCA tends to affect adults over 50 and is three times more common in women than in men. It's also seven times more common in white people than in black or Asian people. In order to reduce the number of people losing their sight from GCA, the NHS has set up a new system to make sure people are diagnosed as quickly as possible. In some parts of the UK there are now dedicated phone lines so GPs can get patients an appointment with a rheumatologist within 24 hours. A healthy artery on the left and one affected by GCA on the right Anyone at risk is then screened using ultrasound - if a patient has GCA, the scan will reveal a dark band, known as the halo sign, around the temporal artery. This fast-track system, pioneered by consultant rheumatologist Prof Bhaskar Dasgupta in 2013 at Southend University Hospital, saved Roger Keay's sight. Dr Saleyah Ahsan, Prof Bhaskar Dasgupta and Roger Keay ""He recognised the condition immediately,"" says Roger. ""He did an ultrasound test and showed me on the screen  - it saved my sight. I'm a very lucky man. If I had a million pounds I'd give it to him."" In Southend, this approach cut the number of cases of full or partial sight loss from 17 a year to one in the year the trial was carried out - and that one was a referral from outside the area. But it's not just doctors who need to be aware of the signs of GCA and I would encourage everyone to heed the warning of one of my lecturers at medical school. His words have stuck with me with superglue-like ferocity for the past 10 years: ""Beware the patient who complains of their scalp hurting when combing their hair.""

"Kanye West attended Paris Fashion Week in a fur-style coat in 2014 ""Would you consider going fur free?"" That's the challenge Sia issued to Kanye West, hours before he unveiled his latest fashion collection. The pop startweeted,externalher question to Kanye, linking to a YouTube video that contained harrowing scenes of rabbits being slaughtered for their coats. ""This is the reality of fur ,"" said Sia. ""It's so sad."" West's Yeezy Season 5 appeared to include both fur coats and accessories. The most striking item was a floor-sweeping fur coat, showcased by hijab-wearing model Halima Aden, who was the first Miss Minnesota contestant to compete wearing a hijab and burkini. Vogue magazine said,externalthe garments were faux fur, although the BBC has been unable to verify that report. Model Halima Aden posted a photo of her fur coat on Instagram It is not the first time that Sia - who worked with Kanye on songs including Wolves and Reaper - has challenged celebrities over animal rights. Last June, she tweeted the same video at Kanye's wife, Kim Kardashian, writing, ""Hey @KimKardashian I think you're lovely. Would you consider going fur free? This is what animals go through for it."" In December, after rapper Azealia Banks posted an Instagram video apparently showing the remains of several chickens killed in a witchcraft ritual, Sia tweeted, ""Sacrificing animals for your gain is the wackest [thing] I've ever heard."" The Australian singer is a vegan and supporter of animal rights' group Peta. Kanye's show won praise from critics, who called it his most ""demure"" show yet and welcomed the fashion range's expanding colour palette - he added blues and reds to the line's traditional black and brown colour scheme. Kim Kardashian was among the guests on the front row for the Yeezy Season 5 launch Kanye did not make the traditional ""wave"" to his audience, but posed for a photo with ASAP Ferg (outside the bathroom) Unlike last year's show - a massive production that required models to stand still for hours in the middle of a New York heatwave, causing some to faint - the Season 5 launch was decidedly low-key, with images projected one by one onto the surface of a giant black rectangle, from a live feed of models standing on a turntable backstage. Photographers were not allowed - and Kanye didn't even appear to take a bow at the end of the 13-minute spectacle. The audience, apparently conditioned to expect more drama at the rapper's fashion shows, remained seated for almost five minutes after the lights went up before finally shuffling out to their next appointment at New York Fashion Week. Among those watching the launch were Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Hailey Baldwin, Zoe Kravitz, ASAP Ferg, Anna Wintour, Pusha T and Teyana Taylor. The collection itself featured a lot of denim, paired with knee-high boots and a new shoe dubbed the Yeezy Runner. Hoodies and bomber jackets also featured heavily, many sporting the Adidas stripes, while sweatshirts were stamped with the phrase Lost Hills - the name of Kanye's forthcoming album with Drake.

"Nato members will want to be reassured by General Mattis This meeting of Nato defence ministers is the first formal alliance get-together since the arrival of the Trump administration in Washington. Mr Trump's initial suggestion that Nato was in some sense ""obsolete"", along with his stated desire to do deals with Moscow, set alarm bells ringing in many capitals, where Russia is seen as a re-emerging strategic threat. Many in Europe see elements in the Trump administration as having an in-built antipathy towards multilateral  institutions. There were also fears about certain officials' closeness to Moscow - a worry that the US might seek a strategic dialogue with Russia over Europeans' heads. Accordingly, the resignation of the president's controversial National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will not prompt many tears in Europe. America's European allies will, though, at least to some extent, have been reassured by the subsequent noises that have come out of Washington. But they will want to hear direct reassurance from Gen James Mattis - Mr Trump's new defence secretary - that the alliance retains its centrality in US security thinking. They will also want confirmed that all of the steps that the Obama administration took to reinforce deterrence in Europe - the deployment of additional combat brigades and an intensive series of exercises -  will continue under the new man in the White House. Poland is one of just five Nato members to meet spending the spending benchmark in 2016 Of course Gen Mattis will come with some messages of his own. President Trump - indeed the US Congress - wants to see the European allies shoulder more of the cost of their own defence. Washington has shown that it is willing to stump up troops and equipment, but while collective Nato expenditure is rising, too many Nato governments have been sluggish in bringing their expenditure up to the agreed target of 2% of GDP. According to the latest Nato figures only five allies, Estonia, Greece, Poland, the UK and the United States met or exceeded the 2% benchmark in 2016. The demand from Washington that its allies spend more on their collective defence has been a consistent one over recent years. As a former Nato commander, Gen Mattis knows the alliance well and he has heard all of the excuses before. He will deliver the familiar message with more punch and with a clear implication that this time the US administration expects to see prompt action. Gen Mattis also wants to see Nato become more agile and better at decision-making especially at times of crisis. Washington wants to see the alliance playing a greater role in international efforts to defeat terror and to help prop up failing states. Reality Check: Is the UK spending 2% of GDP on defence? Profile: Nato Where Trump stands on key issues This is a difficult area which causes divisions among the alliance's European members as much as between European capitals and Washington. Iraq - where Nato has already agreed to conduct a small amount of training - could become a test case. The Americans are already thinking about what will happen after Mosul is fully re-captured. As the situation on the ground transitions from all-out war-fighting, there will be a continuing need to build Iraqi capabilities. Here there are lots of things that the US believes Nato countries could do - training for border patrolling, instituting defence reforms and so on. So far the response among allies to the small-scale effort in Iraq has been, shall we say, limited. As far as Washington is concerned, Nato countries don't just need to spend more - they need to significantly enhance their capabilities and be relevant to the sort of real-world tasks in which the US wants its partners to be engaged. Nato's response to a more assertive Russia is all very well but it threatens to open up fissures between northern and eastern allies, on the one hand, who directly face Russia's modernising forces and countries on Nato's Mediterranean flank, on the other, who confront a very different set of challenges. The alliance is faced with a more militarily assertive Russia As the paroxysms in Syria and Libya have shown, the migrant or refugee crisis has repercussions throughout the Middle East and much of Europe. At this meeting, Nato ministers want to apply a small corrective to enhance the focus on threats from the south. It's a modest start - a small command hub at the joint forces headquarters in Naples whose job will be to explore what Nato can contribute to dealing with the complex security challenges on its southern flank. But as well as a demand for a more dynamic Nato agenda the US is eager to reassure its allies. A senior US Congressional delegation is visiting the Nato headquarters this week. The Nato meeting is followed by Europe's premier annual security event - the Munich conference - after which the US vice-president himself will also be stopping by at Nato. It is all something of a curtain-raiser for the US president's own first visit to the alliance which will take place in late May. That looks set to be a fairly brief event - little more than a lunch - in Nato's brand new headquarters building, which inconveniently will not be finished in time for the summit. By then it is hoped that Mr Trump will have fully made his peace with Nato. If not, a reduced scale summit in an unfinished building holds risks as well as opportunities. The headline writers could have a field day. The hope is that this Nato ministerial meeting will set the course for more harmonious relations between the alliance and its most important, albeit mercurial member.

"It was Abraham Lincoln's 208th birthday last weekend. The US Republican Party's social media feeds honoured the 16th president by sharing a picture of his iconic memorial in Washington DC, with an inspiring quote laid over the top. ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that counts, it's the life in your years,"" was the message on Twitter and Instagram, also shared by President Trump. There was just one problem: the words have been attributed to Lincoln many times over the years, but there is no evidence he ever said them. The post has since been deleted. It was the latest example of a growing modern phenomenon, the fake political quote. Some have said ""fake news"" could have swung the outcome of November's US presidential election. Bogus stories like ""Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President"" were extensively shared online. Made up quotes are perhaps more benign than fictitious news stories with a clear political agenda. But they still raise concerns, says James Ball of Buzzfeed News, who is writing a book about ""post-truth"" politics. There is no evidence that the 16th president ever said this ""If enough people share and believe these fake quotes, then they can contribute to the polarisation of politics, making each side think less of the other, especially as many partisans think fake news is a problem which affects primarily (or only) their opponents."" These fake quotes don't just come from right-wing politicians and activists. In the days after the US election, a quote supposedly taken from a 1998 Donald Trump interview went viral online. ""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up,"" the quote said. It seemed too obnoxious to be true - and it was. Fake George Orwell quotes are a specialty in left-wing social media circles. One example is ""during times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."" There is no evidence the 1984 author ever said these words, but social media is awash with shareable pictures of them alongside Orwell's monochrome face. So how do bogus quotes like this get into circulation? Many fake quotes doing the rounds purport to be by George Orwell ""Sometimes people just want new followers or shares on social media, and either invent a quote or (naively or otherwise) lift a questionable one,"" says James Ball. ""Others invent quotes as a hoax or parody to show up people they disagree with, or to fire up their own side - or simply to make money from adverts on fake news sites."" The internet means fake quotes can spread very quickly. ""It's easier to fabricate things than it is to debunk them,"" says Rasmus Nielsen, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. ""As communication gets easier, there is going to be more and more of this stuff floating about online."" Jenni Sargent runs First Draft News,which is working with social media companies and news organisationsto look at innovative solutions to the problem. ""People are experimenting with the most engaging way to spread false information,"" she says. She wants news websites to come up with entertaining ways of debunking fake facts and quotes. A blue tick next to a name on Twitter tells you the account has been verified as ""authentic"". Sargent wants to come up with ways to highlight unreliable sources, ""like the opposite of a blue tick"". Facebook is introducing tools for German users to flag false stories ahead of that country's parliamentary elections in the autumn. Third-party fact checkers would mark unreliable stories as ""disputed"". Could a ""blue tick""-type system be used to verify online quotes? The BBC has also said it will fact check deliberately misleading stories ""masquerading as news"". British MP Damian Collins is chairing a parliamentary inquiry into these issues, which will look at the possibility of news websites having ""verified"" markers. Collins thinks fake quotes attributed to electoral candidates could end up ""distorting the democratic process"". Often verifying quotes is simply a case of rigorously searching through publicly available information, says Kim LaCapria, who works for rumour-busting website Snopes. The volume of dubious content online is greater than ever before, but verification can be easier because far more information is digitised, she says. ""It's actually pretty easy for average social media users to fact check online."" Her job involves looking at outright fake quotes, but also real quotes presented in a misleading way. For example, Al Gore has been ridiculed for claiming he ""invented the internet"". The former vice president did once say ""I took the initiative in creating the Internet,""but taken in full context, that line seems rather more modest,external. We are less likely to expend energy verifying a quote which confirms our political beliefs, says LaCapria, an effect which psychologists call confirmation bias. Whether a fake quote comes from the left or the right, it tends to have one common feature, she says. ""It validates our preconceived beliefs or feelings, and that's often proffered as a valid reason to spread it.""

"This video can not be played 'I was sweating and anxious' Secondary school teacher Daniel Gray has always kept his sexuality to himself at work. But to mark LGBT History Month, the 32-year-old from Brighton made the nerve-wracking decision to come out to more than 1,000 students. He tells his story to the BBC's Jennifer Scott. I didn't actually know I was gay when I was at secondary school. But it seemed everyone else in 1990s Basingstoke did. I was bullied every single day. I would get called homophobic names, be followed around by boys in gangs, pushed in corridors. There was an openly gay boy at school being bullied too. But when we went to a teacher, she said it was just the kind of thing you had to put up with. I wanted to be either a teacher or a pop star, there was never doubt in my mind. Teacher turned out to be the most realistic goal. It felt I could go back into a school and make up for the experience I had, right a few wrongs. It wasn't until I went to university that I realised. Going to a final year house party as a plus one led to me meeting a lot of gay people and I just felt more at home and comfortable then I ever had been. Daniel faced bullying throughout school, despite him not knowing he was gay until going to university in Brighton I took my first job in 2008. But as comfortable as I was with my sexuality, words from my teacher training stuck with me. The woman who ran the course said categorically not to reveal it to pupils as ""you don't want to give the students any more ammunition"". When I started working in a very strict Catholic school, I kept quiet. In my next school, I was ""out"" to colleagues but not to students - even though some of them probably knew. Two-and-a-half years ago, I started working at the Harris Academy in South Norwood, south London. I never felt like being gay was an issue, but those words from training stayed with me still. I had only ever heard of one other person who had come out at school,a teacher and campaigner called David Weston,external, but I didn't follow suit. Until David came in to our school that is. He was just doing some training, nothing to do with LGBT issues at all, but I remembered him and thought again. It felt like an instinct. It felt like something I had to do. LGBT History Month was coming up. We had a new man [principal] in charge and I thought, here is my chance. I thought I would have to go in and fight. But he said yes. He embraced it and told me he wanted to endorse it with all the staff. So it was on. I was going to tell over 1,000 teenagers in Croydon that I was gay. We teach across two sites so I couldn't be everywhere at once. As a media teacher, I decided to do a video. I spoke about LGBT History Month, all the things the school was doing to mark it for the first time. Then I looked directly into the camera and said: ""As a gay man, I know how important it is to have positive role models."" Sat in those assemblies, pressing play, waiting for the reaction, I cannot describe my nerves. But then I came on screen. There. I had done it. Daniel told over 1,000 pupils he was gay I didn't want it to be a big thing. I just wanted people to know I was there and to accept it as normal. Just having one teacher as a visible gay person in their lives could make a huge difference. One student came up to me after the assembly who I didn't know. I have never taught him before. He looked very nervous and a little shy. But he had something to say. ""Sir, your assembly has changed my life."" He walked away. But that moment, that single moment right there, reminded me why I am a teacher. Another student said ""Oh my God"" and gave me a high five. I just could not have imagined that. It hasn't all been rosy. We have had one complaint from a parent and we may get more. But, this is not the lasting thought I have about that day.  I want to focus on the positives. What I found particularly moving was the support from colleagues who even made classroom displays supporting LGBT rights following my assembly. A sign put up by one of Daniel's Christian colleagues in their classroom We are part of a federation of academies and, with the support of my head teacher, I am going to talk to others about going in and doing similar things. By coming out to my students, they can see that Mr Gray, the teacher they already know, is no different from anyone else. They also know that if they are struggling or need the support, there is someone there they can turn to. The only thing I would change? Not waiting nine years to do it. Nick Soar, executive principal of Harris Federation South and Upper Norwood When Daniel asked me if we could foreground LGBT month, I knew it was a moment early in my tenure to highlight to the staff and pupil body, and all parents, that I wanted to eliminate homophobia and, more widely, all forms of prejudice and hate. Ofsted, the schools' watchdog, is absolutely clear about language of prejudice and homophobia. Inspectors are explicitly told to examine if schools are aware of their statutory duties. The pastoral support for LGBT young people and staff has often been appalling in schools. I see it as my role as the leader of the ethos and values to be both the lightning rod of any complaints and the beacon of hope for all pupils.

"Rumours suggest that Nokia are planning to bring back their iconic 3310 phone. Mobile users of a certain age have been getting very excited on social media about the return of this sturdy, reliable handset. If you were in the market for a new phone in the year 2000, then the 3310 may have been on your wish-list. But when Newsbeat contacted Nokia about the rumours, the company refused to comment. ""Though we're as excited as everyone else to hear their news, as we have often said about such stories, we do not comment on rumour or speculation,"" a spokesperson tells us. If you ever owned one of these phones then the return of the 3310 may be exciting news to you It may seem unlikely in the world of Android and iPhones that anyone would want a 17-year-old handset that was best known for playing Snake, but the experts believe there is a place in the market. ""I'm fairly confident my grandmother could use a 3310, but she wouldn't know where to start with an iPhone or Android,"" Alistair Charlton, deputy technology editor at the IB Times, tells Newsbeat. ""You can take a Â£20 phone to a festival and leave your expensive, glass-fronted iPhone at home. ""Backpackers and the like probably appreciate them too, given their tough build, cheap price and long battery life."" Many smartphone users complain about their handset's battery and this could prove the main selling point for users. ""What an interest in the 3310 does show us though is that battery life is still a major concern for consumers, and one that's not being well-addressed by some smart phones, namely the iPhone,"" Elizabeth Varley, founder and CEO of tech communityTechHub,external, tells Newsbeat. And let's not forget, when Adele revealed the video for Hello back in 2015, she was seen in it making a call on a retro flip phone - not a smart device. Greg James tweeted a picture of the moment.,external Around that time, the media reported a rise in people seeking old phones, as the 1990s were firmly back in fashion and people like Rihanna were walking round chatting on a chunky mobile. So it's not just a phone for drug dealers, as many Twitter users seem to think. Some have joked that non-smart phones are used for illegal business.,external Alistair also backs the author of the original source of the 3310 rumours, VentureBeat writer Evan Blass, as a credible source for technology leaks. He describes the journalist as ""a renowned tech leaker who is often accurate with his predictions."" But Alistair also says that to succeed in the current market, Nokia will need to update the 3310's basic features to be relevant in 2017. ""We don't communicate through calls and SMS as much as we did in the days of the 3310,"" he says. ""If it had an internet connection and access to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, then maybe it has a place."" But Elizabeth Varley doesn't believe Nokia's future can be built on models from the past. ""The best way forward is rarely backwards,"" she says. ""To really compete, innovation is the key.""

"Peruvian artist and photographer Christian Fuchs is obsessed with his illustrious ancestors and spends months painstakingly recreating portraits of them, posing for them himself whether the ancestors were men or women. It's an unusual way to get close to your forefathers, but it works for Christian Fuchs. The walls of his elegant apartment overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Lima's bohemian Barranco district are covered with paintings of his aristocratic European and Latin American ancestors. But if you look closer, you soon realise that many of the portraits are, in fact, photographs of the 37-year-old himself, dressed up as his relatives. It all started when Fuchs was 10 years old. Fuchs's great-great-great-great-grandfather led a distinguished military career and participated in the Peruvian war of independence His mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she died five years later. His father left the family, remarried and disappeared. Fuchs and his brother and sister were brought up by their paternal grandparents. ""I grew up with portraits and objects that had been in my family for up to five generations,"" he explains. ""As a child I looked at the portraits and played with them. If I didn't know the names of the characters, I invented them. I remember watching them for hours and feeling that they were watching me back. Sometimes I would talk to them, and eventually that led to my reinterpretations of them."" Fuchs's grandmother, Catalina del Carmen Silva Schilling, played a very important part in all of this. Born in Chile of German ancestors, she too was brought up by her grandparents. ""She would tell me stories about our relatives from Chile and Germany, and I learned to look at things through her eyes,"" Fuchs says. ""It was magical. She told me about relatives like my granny's great-grandmother, Marie Schencke, who also came from Germany. Her family brought electricity to the Chilean town, Osorno."" Years later Fuchs went to university to study law, but after a few months working as a lawyer he quit to become an artist and found himself once again gazing at the portraits. Fuchs's great-great-great-great-grandmother, Luise Friederike Charlotte Eleonora Chee, was his first recreation ""I was looking at one of the family portraits from 1830 of Eleanora, my grandmother's great-great-grandmother"" he says. ""I began to think, 'Considering we share the same genes, could I actually look like her?' That afternoon I went to the hairdresser and got them to put my hair up in ringlets. I thought it was a cool idea for a new project."" The process of reinterpreting his ancestors can take many months. Fuchs reads their letters and talks to relatives about them. He takes photos of their portraits to a local tailor who tries to imitate the garments - some of which date back to the 18th Century - as faithfully as possible, and to a jeweller who creates replicas of the jewellery. Dressing up as a woman can be especially problematic Fuchs says, and not only because he finds the corsets very uncomfortable. ""It's complicated because I have to wax,"" he says, ""and I have tons of hair."" It took Fuchs's great-great-grandfather Carl Schilling three months to sail from Germany to Chile. He lived there until his death in 1923 aged 93 Making up his face can also take between three and five hours, depending on the character. Fuchs says that his most difficult project was recreating ""the family's patriarch"" Carl Schilling, his grandmother's great-grandfather, who arrived in Chile as a 19-year-old in 1850, on a boat full of German immigrants. ""He went down south to work as an estate manager for an aristocratic family called Buschmann and ended up marrying their daughter, Johanna,"" says Fuchs. ""Carl was a real character. He learned the native language so he could talk to the indigenous Mapuche people, and he was one of the founders of the German school in Osorno - one of the oldest German schools in the world."" To become his great-great-great-grandfather Fuchs had to grow a beard. It was slow work - taking more than a year - and when it was finally long enough to be dyed white he had a severe allergic reaction to the chemicals. But Fuchs says that he knew the transformation had been a success when on a trip to the bank he was asked if he wanted to join the special queue for elderly people. Fuchs's great-great-great-great-grandmother Dona Natividad Martinez de Pinillos Cacho y Lavalle. Her brother-in-law was President of Peru, Luis Jose de Orbegoso Although the finished works look very much like paintings they are, in fact, digital photographs taken under very bright lighting, which makes Fuchs's made-up skin appear very pale, almost like porcelain. The photographs are then printed on matt, cotton paper and, as a final touch, Fuchs displays them in frames which are appropriate to the period in which the person he is recreating lived. He exhibits and sells his recreations to art collectors around the world, but for him the project is primarily a means to help him connect with his past. ""At first my family thought I was strange,"" Fuchs says, ""but now they really like the pieces and want to find out more about their relatives."" This video can not be played See how Fuchs is able to transform himself into his ancestors Fuchs is currently working on transforming himself into his great-great-great-great-great-great-aunt, Dorothea Viehmann, who was born in Kassel, Germany, in 1755. The daughter of an innkeeper, she heard many tales from the guests at her father's tavern. The Priest of the Huguenot church introduced Viehmann to the Brothers Grimm, and with that her work as a muse began. Most of Viehmann's tales were subsequently published in the second volume of the Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales. To achieve a good likeness, make-up artist Juan Diego Peschiera painstakingly applies layer upon layer of liquid latex to Fuchs's face. ""The eyes are the most difficult part of the face to do,"" he explains. Fuchs's great-great-great-grandfather Eulogio Elespuru y Martinez de Pinillos lived in Paris for many years ""Wrinkles go in different directions, so we have to make the latex go in different directions to create that effect. If we do it in just one layer it looks fake, so we need to build up lots of different layers. At first I apply alcohol-based make-up and then the liquid latex, it's translucent and you can see all the different capillaries under the skin."" Fuchs has recreated 11 ancestral portraits so far and has many more in mind, including Queen Elizabeth I, Mary Queen of Scots, and William Shakespeare. Fuchs believes they are all distantly related to him and plans to confirm that using a genetic genealogy website. But there is one very special person he would particularly like to transform himself into, his grandmother, Catalina del Carmen. Carmen, who was like a mother to Fuchs, died just after Christmas and he is still grieving. ""It will be really hard to do her justice,"" he says, ""she was so pretty and had a much smaller nose than me, but I definitely want to try."" Fuchs's great-great-great-aunt Benjamina was friends with many famous poets and authors, including novelist and diplomat Alberto Blest Gana All images courtesy of Christian Fuchs unless otherwise indicated Listen toChristian Fuchs speaking to Outlookon the BBC World Service Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

"One heartbroken person sent a collection of font examples they ""mutually loved"" with their partner After a relationship ends, even the most mundane objects can become painful reminders. One museum in Los Angeles puts them on display. When you're heartbroken, everything reminds you of the person who's no longer there. So do you burn your love letters? Throw away your wedding dress after a divorce? Send back that single mismatched sock? At the Museum of Broken Relationships in Hollywood, everyday stuff is exhibited as art along with each object's story of betrayal or loss. The result is a moving collection of heartbreak. One woman from San Francisco crammed her wedding dress into a pickle jar after her husband of five years left her. Even though her dress was ""non-traditional"" -  meaning the kind you could wear again - she never did. ""I hate throwing perfectly functional items in landfills but would hate to see someone walking around in my once beautiful but now sadness-infused dress,"" the woman wrote on a card now on display next to the jar. The jar was used mainly for space, she wrote, but ""any sort of appropriate pickle metaphors can also be invoked"". All of the items at the museum are exhibited anonymously. The museum, which opened this summer, was created by a lawyer who visited the original Museum of Broken Relationships in Croatia and wanted to bring the concept to Los Angeles. Two artists opened the Croatian museum after breaking up and deciding to curate the debris from their relationship. The exhibits in the LA museum are donated from around the world. A Norwegian donated an iron with the short story:  ""This iron was used to iron my wedding suit. Now it is the only thing left."" One exhibit displays an expensive bottle of wine a British couple having an affair planned to drink once they both left their spouses. But the wine remains untouched, the bottle never opened. What happened to their marriages, or if their spouses knew about their infidelity, is left unsaid. A Slovenian donated a key - a small gift from a friend. The story behind the key says: ""You turned my head; you just did not want to sleep with me. I realized how much you loved me only after you died of Aids."" The museum attracts both the broken-hearted having a cathartic cry and couples on dates, says Alexis Hyde, the director of the museum. But she was surprised that it's become a family destination for parents looking for ways to talk about love with their teenage children. ""It becomes this really safe place to talk about sex and relationships in a way that's not like 'Gross, mom stop talking to me,'"" Ms Hyde says. ""It's a really beautiful way to open a dialogue about what is OK and what is not,"" she says. ""You're going to have your heart broken and that's normal. Even though you feel so alone, you're actually very normal."" ""It's a little less isolating I think."" One of the more unusual exhibits is a pair of sizeable silicone breast implants a woman says she felt pressured to get by an ex-boyfriend. Her body rejected the implants and she had to have multiple surgeries to remove them and reconstruct her body. ""She held on to them to remind herself don't change for someone else. You have to love yourself to be loved and be in a productive relationship,"" Ms Hyde says, adding that the woman hoped her donation would inspire others to have healthier relationships. ""She was hoping that people would read this and take the cautionary tale."" The museum also includes a broken promise ring and a collection of tins, boxes and books with examples of the ""mutually loved font"" of a former couple. There's a dress bought by a girl who planned to wear it to impress a boy. But the boy killed himself before she had the chance. Mix tapes - a sign of love - now in the museum There's also a drawer full of mix tapes on display. If you don't remember mix tapes, they were the ultimate romantic gesture of the 1980s - painstakingly-made collections of music put together by recording songs off the radio on to cassette tapes. If you missed the start of the song you planned to record, you had to wait for the DJ to play it again the next hour or day, depending on the song's popularity. The collection is not what people have come to expect from a museum on Hollywood Boulevard, where tourists frequent Madame Tussauds wax museum and where actors dressed as Chewbacca and Spider-Man hustle tourists for photos. ""This museum cuts through to the truth of the human experience now like a scalpel. I think that it's a very sophisticated, conceptual art museum even though maybe the objects that compose it themselves individually might not be necessarily considered art,"" says Ms Hyde. Alexis Hyde says the museum ""cuts through to the truth of the human experience"" Visitors here are more from the local Los Angeles art scene than tourists. Inside, it's a quiet, cathartic museum and many visitors walk the museum alone, quietly crying. Many visitors say they come to feel less alone and more connected to their fellow lonely hearts. But one visitor says the experience is overwhelming. ""I'm feeling their pain,"" he says of the people who donated items to the museum. ""I just feel so alone in here.""

"Professional footballers can perform dozens of headers during a match, and hundreds more over a week's training - adding up to tens of thousands of blows to the head over their career. Scientists now say that repeated blows to the head from headers may belinked to long-term brain damage. The research examined the brains of six players renowned for headers - all of whom developed dementia in later life. Here, players and coaches share their reactions. Ian St John (left) and his Liverpool teammates celebrate their FA Cup Final victory in 1965 Ian St John, who played for Liverpool between 1961-71, says six of his teammates - from a group of about 16 players - now have Alzheimer's. ""For people of my vintage, I would say all the facts that we have got, stand up,"" he told theVictoria Derbyshire programme. ""And I don't know why the FA and the PFA have covered this up for years. ""I talked about it to the PFA a couple of years ago, and their answer was: 'Well, women get dementia, so therefore it's not an industrial injury'. Which is a load of nonsense isn't it? ""I don't know about today's light ball, but in our era, heading that heavy ball day in and day out - not just at matches but training as well - the lads know at this stage of their lives we're either dying or have dementia. ""The footballs that we've been heading for years are causing this, but they're [the FA] in denial about it. ""How many goalkeepers have got dementia over the years? If they did a survey, it would be interesting if the answer was none, which means that the goalkeeper - the only guy on the field who is not heading the ball on the field - is OK."" Former striker Kevin Davies says he may have performed up to 50,000 headers during his career Former England striker Kevin Davies says contact sportsmen know there's always going to be a risk, but more research needs to be done. ""I'm well renowned for heading the ball and we used to get all the stats back - during the game it can be between 25 and 40 times. ""When you start to look at the numbers in terms of professional players, the amount of contact they have with the ball - if you look at my career, 800 career games, and then you take into training, the numbers start to stack up and it could be anywhere between 10,000 and 50,000 times that you're heading the ball. ""The ball has changed a lot, the training methods have changed a lot now. ""[Previously] you'd see some sessions where you were hurling balls at defenders and it was a bit scary at the time - I think that has changed a lot and the style of football has changed a lot but there needs to be more research with the new footballs."" The former SFA chief executive believes a ban on heading for under-12s will come into effect Gordon Smith, former Scottish Football Association chief executive, says he expects youth football to ban headers. ""Certainly, I know, I'm an ambassador of the Scottish Youth FA in Scotland and they're looking at it because they understand what's happened in America regarding the banning of kids heading the ball from 11 downwards. ""I see football at the younger level and because now the game has changed from 11-a-side up until they're 12 years old to seven-a-side games, the ball is very rarely ever in the air. The kids aren't heading the ball as much as they used to - there's no doubt about that. ""And the secondary aspect of it is that from Ian [St John's] day, the ball has improved a lot - they were very, very heavy. I think a lot of the damage was done because of those types of balls. And people were doing a lot of heading backwards - there's no doubt about it. ""I think that ban [on young players heading] will come to this country soon. I would say that from 12 years downwards there should definitely be no heading the ball at all. ""You can imagine sometime in the future they might be a scenario where each player has to sign a disclaimerâ¦to say that if I'm playing football I am taking this risk."" Youth coach Nathan Sargeson says training sessions should limit the amount of headers Nathan Sargeson, lead football coach with Little Lions football club in East Lancashire, says children rarely perform headers. He says: ""The latest footballs that are used have come a long way and the technology around the ball - where it's more synthetic leather, rather than the solid leather casing. ""But it's like Kevin [Davies] said; in grassroots football you don't see a lot of kids heading the ball - it's really how much is done at training. ""Obviously you've got to limit that amount and think about it - and obviously with the findings and the studies, you've got to take it all into account.""
