Commonwealth Games set a record for the most gold medal-winning countries at a
single Games. The previous best was 28 different medal winning nations, at
Manchester 2002, but that mark has been surpassed over the past 11 days of
competition. On the Gold Coast, 29 countries claimed gold, with medals shared
between 43 countries, another record, beating the previous best of 39 which was
set at Manchester 2002 and equalled at Melbourne 2006. Australia topped the medal table at GC2018 with 198 medals - 80 of
them gold - but couldnât improve its own record at Melbourne 2006 when the host
nation won 221 medals, 84 gold. England finished second with 136 medals (45 gold), with India in
third with 66 medals (26 gold). Commonwealth Games closing ceremony Wherever there's a pop party, you can be sure our BBC crew aren't far away.

"John Corcoran grew up in New Mexico in the US during the 1940s and 50s. One of six siblings, he graduated from high school, went on to university, and became a teacher in the 1960s - a job he held for 17 years. But, as he explains here, he hid an extraordinary secret. When I was a child I was told by my parents that I was a winner, and for the first six years of my life I believed what my parents had told me. I was late in talking, but I went off to school with high hopes of learning to read like my sisters, and for the first year things were fine because there weren't many demands on us other than standing in the right line, sitting down, keeping our mouths shut and going to the bathroom on time. And then in the second grade we were supposed to learn to read. But for me it was like opening a Chinese newspaper and looking at it - I didn't understand what those lines were, and as a child of six, seven, eight years old I didn't know how to articulate the problem. I remember praying at night and saying, ""Please Lord, let me know how to read tomorrow when I get up"" and sometimes I'd even turn on the light and get a book and look at it and see if I got a miracle. But I didn't get that miracle. At school I ended up in the dumb row with a bunch of other kids who were having a hard time learning to read. I didn't know how I got there, I didn't know how to get out and I certainly didn't know what question to ask. The teacher didn't call it the ""dumb row"" - there wasn't any cruelty or anything - but the kids called it the dumb row, and when you're in that dumb row you start thinking you're dumb. At teacher conferences my teacher told my parents, ""He's a smart boy, he'll get it,"" and they moved me on to the third grade. ""He's a smart boy, he'll get it,"" and they moved me on to the fourth grade. ""He's a smart boy, he'll get it,"" and they moved me on to the fifth grade. But I wasn't getting it. By the time I got to the fifth grade I'd basically given up on myself in terms of reading. I got up every day, got dressed, went to school and I was going to war. I hated the classroom. It was a hostile environment and I had to find a way to survive. By the seventh grade I was sitting in the principal's office most of the day. I was in fights, I was defiant, I was a clown, I was a disruptor, I got expelled from school. But that behaviour wasn't who I felt inside - it wasn't who I wanted to be. I wanted to be somebody else, I had a desire to succeed, I wanted to be a good student, but I just couldn't do it. By the time I got to the eighth grade I got tired of embarrassing myself and my family. I decided I was going to behave myself now - if you behave in high school you can find your way through the system. So I was going to be a teacher's pet and do everything necessary to pass that system. I wanted to be an athlete - I had athletic skills, and I had maths skills - I could count money and make change before I even went to school and I learned the times tables. I had social skills too -  I ran around with college kids, I dated the valedictorian - the student with the highest grades who gives a speech at the graduation ceremony, I was the homecoming king, I had people - mostly girls - do my homework for me. I could write my name and there were some words that I could remember, but I couldn't write a sentence - I was in high school and reading at the second or third grade level. And I never told anybody that I couldn't read. When I was taking a test I would look at someone else's paper, or I'd pass my paper over to somebody else and they'd answer the questions for me - it was fairly easy, amateur cheating. But when I went off to college on a full athletic scholarship it was a different story. I thought, ""Oh my gosh, this is way over my head, how am I going to be able to get through this?"" I belonged to a social fraternity who had copies of old exam papers. That was one way to cheat. I tried to take classes with a partner, somebody who would help me through. There were professors who used the same test year after year. But I also had to resort to more creative and desperate things. In one exam the professor put four questions on the board. I was sitting at the back of the room, near the window, behind the older students. I had my blue book and I painstakingly copied the four questions off the board. I didn't know what those questions said. I had arranged for a friend of mine to be outside the window. He was probably the smartest kid in school, but he was also shy and he'd asked me to fix him up with a girl by the name of Mary who he wanted to go to the spring formal dance with. I passed my blue book out the window to him and he answered the questions for me. I had another blue exam book underneath my shirt and I took it out and pretended I was writing in it. I was praying that my friend was going to be able to get my book back to me and that he was going to get the right answers. I was so desperate. I needed to pass courses. I was at risk. Listen to John Corcoran onOutlookWeekend on the BBC World Service Or download the podcasthere There was another exam that I couldn't figure out how I was going to pass. One night I went by the professor's office about midnight, he wasn't there. I opened the window with a knife and I went in like a cat burglar. I'd crossed the line now - I wasn't just a student that was cheating, I was a criminal. I went inside and I looked around for the exam. It had to be in his office but I couldn't find it. There was a file cabinet that was locked - it had to be in the file cabinet. I did the same thing two or three nights in a row looking for that exam but I still couldn't find it. So one night, about one o'clock in the morning, I brought three of my friends with me and we went to the office. We carried out a four-drawer file cabinet, put it in a vehicle, and took it off campus to a college apartment. I had arranged for a locksmith to come. I put my suit and tie on - I was pretending to be a young businessman who was leaving for Los Angeles the next day and the locksmith was saving my job by opening it. He opened it, gave me a key, and sure enough, to my great relief there were more than 40 copies of the exam - a multiple choice paper - in the top drawer of the file cabinet. I took one copy back to my dormitory, where a ""smart"" classmate made a cheat sheet with all the correct answers. We carried the file cabinet back and at five o'clock in the morning I was walking up to my room and thinking, ""Mission impossible accomplished!"" - and I was feeling pretty good that I was so clever. But then I walked up the stairs, lay down in my bed and started weeping like a baby. Why didn't I ask for help? Because I didn't believe there was anybody out there who could teach me to read. This was my secret and I guarded that secret. This video can not be played John Corcoran tells Outlook how he hid his inability to read My teachers and my parents told me that people with college degrees get better jobs, they have better lives, and so that's what I believed. My motivation was to just get that piece of paper. Maybe by osmosis, maybe by prayer, maybe by a miracle I would one day learn to read. So I graduated from college, and when I graduated there was a teacher shortage and I was offered a job. It was the most illogical thing you can imagine - I got out of the lion's cage and then I got back in to taunt the lion again. Why did I go into teaching? Looking back it was crazy that I would do that. But I'd been through high school and college without getting caught - so being a teacher seemed a good place to hide. Nobody suspects a teacher of not knowing how to read. I taught a lot of different things. I was an athletics coach. I taught social studies. I taught typing - I could copy-type at 65 words a minute but I didn't know what I was typing. I never wrote on a blackboard and there was no printed word in my classroom. We watched a lot of films and had a lot of discussions. I remember how fearful I was. I couldn't even take the roll - I had to ask the students to pronounce their names so I could hear their names. And I always had two or three students who I identified early - the ones who could read and write best in the classroom - to help me. They were my teaching aides. They didn't suspect at all - you don't suspect the teacher. One of my biggest fears was faculty meetings. We had them once a week and if the teachers were brainstorming the principal would call on somebody to get those ideas on to the board. I lived in fear that he would call on me, every week I was terrified, but I had a backup plan. If he had called on me I was going to get out of my chair and take two steps, grab my chest, drop to the floor and hope they called 911. Whatever it took not to get caught, and I never got caught. Sometimes I felt like a good teacher - because I worked hard at it and I really cared about what I was doing - but I wasn't. It was wrong. I didn't belong in the classroom, I was trespassing. I wasn't supposed to be there and sometimes what I was doing made me physically sick, but I was trapped, I couldn't tell anybody. I got married while I was a teacher. Getting married is a sacrament, it's a commitment to be truthful with another person and this was the first time I thought, ""OK, I'm going to trust this person, I'm going to tell her."" I practised in front of the mirror: ""Cathy, I can't read. Cathy, I can't read."" And one evening we were sitting on the couch and I said, ""Cathy, I can't read."" But she didn't really understand what I was saying. She thought I was saying that I didn't read much. You know, love is blind and deaf. So we got married and we had a child and years later it really came home to her. I was reading to our three-year-old daughter. We read to her routinely, but I wasn't really reading, I was making the stories up - stories that I knew, like Goldilocks and The Three Bears, I just added drama to them. But this was a new book, Rumpelstiltskin, and my daughter said, ""You're not reading it like mama."" My wife heard me trying to read from a child's book and that was the first time that it dawned on her. I had been asking her to do all this writing for me, helping me write things for school, and then she finally realised, how deep and severe this was. But nothing was said, there was no confrontation, she just carried on helping me get by. John Corcoran and his granddaughter, Kayla Mertes: It was when ""reading"" to his daughter that John's secret was revealed It didn't relieve anything because in my gut I felt dumb and I felt like a fake. I was deceitful. I was teaching my students to be seekers of truth and I was the biggest liar in the room. The relief only came when I finally learned to read. I taught high school from 1961 to 1978. Eight years after I quit my teaching job, something finally changed. I was 47 going on 48 when I saw Barbara Bush - then Second Lady of the US - talking about adult literacy on TV. It was her special cause. I'd never heard anybody talking about adult literacy before, I thought I was the only person in the world that was in the situation I was in. I was at this desperate spot in my life. I wanted to tell somebody and I wanted to get help and one day in the grocery store I was standing in line and there were two women in front of me talking about their adult brother who was going to the library. He was learning to read and they were just full of joy and I couldn't believe it. So one Friday afternoon in my pinstriped suit I walked into the library and asked to see the director of the literacy programme and I sat down with her and I told her I couldn't read. That was the second person in my adult life that I had ever told. Barbara Bush inspired John Corcoran to ask for help and finally learn to read I had a volunteer tutor - she was 65 years old. She wasn't a teacher, she was just somebody who loved to read and didn't think anybody should go through life without knowing how to. One of the things that she had me do in the early stages was to try to write because I had all these thoughts in my mind and I'd never written a sentence. The first thing that I wrote was a poem about my feelings. One of the things about poetry is that you don't have to know what a complete sentence is, and you don't have to write in complete sentences. She got me to about sixth-grade-level reading - I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. But it took me about seven years to feel like I was a literate person. I cried, I cried, and I cried after I started learning to read - there was a lot of pain and a lot of frustration -  but it filled a big hole in my soul. Adults who can't read are suspended in their childhoods, emotionally, psychologically, academically, spiritually. We haven't grown up yet. I was encouraged to tell my story by my tutor to motivate others and promote literacy, but I said, ""No way. I've lived in this community for 17 years, my children are here, my wife is here - she's a professional, my parents are here, I'm not going to tell this story."" John Corcoran and members of his family today But eventually I decided I would. It was an embarrassing secret and it was a shame-based secret, so it was a big decision. It wasn't easy but once I'd made up my mind I was going to tell the story I told it all across America, I spoke to anybody that would listen. I guarded this secret for decades and then I blasted it to the world. I was on Larry King, I was on the ABC News magazine show 20/20, I was on Oprah. John Corcoranset up a foundation,externalin his name to help adults and children with literacy skills - in California and online In the UK the National Literacy Trust websitelists organisations,externalthat promote adult literacy These includeRead Easy,externaland theReading Agency,external It was uncomfortable for people to hear the story of the teacher who couldn't read. Some people said it was impossible and that I was making the whole story up. But I want people to know there is hope, there is a solution. We are not ""dumb"", we can learn to read, it's never too late. Unfortunately we are still pushing children and teens through school without teaching them basic reading and writing skills. But we can break this cycle of failure if instead of blaming teachers we make sure they are properly trained. For 48 years I was in the dark. But I finally got the monkey off my back, I finally buried the ghost of my past. Written by Sarah McDermott. Photographs courtesy of John Corcoran.

"This video can not be played Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's casket was draped in the national flag Large crowds gathered in South Africa for the funeral of the anti-apartheid campaigner Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Thousands of mourners crowded into a stadium in Soweto, near Johannesburg, where the campaigner was given a high-level send-off before her burial in Johannesburg. Her casket was draped in the national flag, and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered the eulogy. The former wife of Nelson Mandela died earlier this month at the age of 81. A controversial figure, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was lauded for her role in the anti-apartheid struggle. But she was later shunned by the political elite for endorsing punishment killings for government informers. Obituary: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela The women who loved Nelson Mandela What Winnie Mandela meant to South Africans At the funeral, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's daughter Zenani Mandela-Dlamini berated the ""extreme cruelty"" of those she said had led smear campaigns against her mother and isolated her - only to clear her name after her death. ""It is so disappointing to see how they withheld their words during my mother's lifetime, knowing very well what they would have meant to her. Only they know why they chose to share the truth with the world after she departed,"" Mrs Mandela-Dlamini said. Mr Ramaphosa apologised for only belatedly recognising Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's contribution President Ramaphosa described Mrs Madikizela-Mandela as a symbol of resistance who laid bare the edifice of patriarchy. He apologised for only belatedly recognising her contribution. ""I'm sorry, Mama, that your organisation delayed in according you its honour, to this point in time and moment. As president, I will propose that we award you the highest order of our movement, you richly deserve to be awarded"", Mr Ramaphosa said. There were loud cheers when the radical Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema paid tribute to Mrs Madikizela-Mandela. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was a social worker when she met her future husband, then a prominent anti-apartheid campaigner, in the 1950s. They were married for a total of 38 years but for almost three decades of that time, they were separated by Mr Mandela's long imprisonment. They had two daughters together. Nelson and Winnie Mandela were married for 38 years After Mr Mandela was imprisoned by the apartheid regime, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela became an international symbol of resistance to apartheid. She too was jailed for her role in opposing white minority rule. To her supporters, she became known affectionately as ""Mother of the Nation"". But Mrs Madikizela-Mandela also found herself mired in scandal for decades. She was accused of conducting a virtual reign of terror in parts of Soweto by other members of the ANC in the late 1980s, and in 2003 she was convicted of fraud. Nomsa Maseko at the Orlando Stadium, Soweto, for BBC News Orlando Stadium reverberated as thousands sang liberation songs, paying tribute to the freedom fighter known to many simply as Mama Winnie. Supporters of various political parties who are often at odds with each put their differences aside to pay tribute to the anti-apartheid activist. During the dark days of apartheid, Orlando Stadium in Soweto was always often associated with politicians delivering fiery speeches - and today was no different. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's death managed to unite different political parties who are often at odds with each other. Many agreed to put their differences aside to give her the send-off she deserved. A reassessment of her contribution to South Africa's apartheid struggle has been playing out in local media. While once she was shunned by South Africa's political elite, including her own party the ANC, in death she has been almost universally lauded. 1936: Born in Cape Province 1958: Married Nelson Mandela 1969: Jailed for 18 months for anti-apartheid activities 1976: Banished to rural area by apartheid authorities 1991: Convicted of kidnapping 1996: Divorced from Nelson Mandela 2003: Convicted of fraud What Winnie Mandela meant to me Obituary: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Nelson Mandela death: The women who loved him Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"A gang of men, one armed with a machete, ""terrorised"" a family during a robbery at their home in East Kilbride in South Lanarkshire. A couple, aged 55 and 56, and their son, aged 26, were woken by smashing glass at Castlehill Farm, Kittochside, on Saturday morning. Four masked men threatened them and the homeowner was struck with a machete. They were held in a bedroom while the property was ransacked, with cash, jewellery and a Range Rover stolen. Detectives said the family ""genuinely feared for their lives"" during the ""abhorrent incident"". They have appealed for information. Officers were called to the property at about 04:30, after the suspects left. During the raid, the 55-year-old male householder was struck on the leg by one of the men who was armed with the machete. The men left the house after about 20 minutes and joined another man who was waiting outside in a black Nissan Qashqai. They drove off along Carmunnock bypass and then towards Croftfoot Road and Blairbeth Road, before abandoning the stolen black Range Rover in the Mount Vernon area of Glasgow. One of the men is described as being in his early 20s with a local accent and was wearing a grey hoodie with his face covered. The rest of the men are described as having local accents and wearing dark clothing with scarves/balaclavas covering their faces. Det Sgt Alan MacDonald, from Cambuslang CID, said: ""This group of despicable individuals completely terrorised this family and made threats of extreme violence, which made them genuinely fear for their lives throughout the ordeal. ""They have been left absolutely traumatised and it is vital that we trace the criminals responsible for this abhorrent incident. ""The house is in an isolated location, near to the Museum of Rural Life in East Kilbride, and I would appeal to anyone who was in the area in the early hours of this morning and may have noticed a black Nissan Qashqai to please get in touch. ""I would also ask anyone who saw a black Nissan Qashqai or black Range Rover driving along the route described following the incident to come forward."" Any motorists with dashcams who were driving in the area at about 04:30 have also been urged to contact police.

"112 of the 276 Chibok schoolgirls who were abducted in 2014 are still missing A Nigerian journalist with links to the Islamist group Boko Haram has claimed only 15 out of the 112 missing Chibok girls are still alive. The 276 schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram exactly four years ago. Many have since been released. Ahmad Salkida said he had negotiated for the girls' release on behalf of the government, but several opportunities to have them freed had been missed. The Nigerian government said there was no reason to think some may be dead. A spokesperson told the BBC the government was still in discussions with Boko Haram to secure the release of the 112 girls who remain missing. Mr Salkida said the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan had asked him to negotiate for the release of the Chibok schoolgirls two weeks after they were abducted. He said he had arranged for a prisoner swap on five occasions, but delays from the then government led to a breakdown in negotiations. What happened to the 276 kidnapped girls? Chibok abductions: What we know The town that lost its girls Mr Salkida would not reveal the names of the remaining girls, stating that this was the responsibility of the Nigerian government. The kidnapping led to a global outcry for their release. Parents marked the fourth anniversary on Saturday by marching with thousands of others to the school in north-eastern Borno state where the girls were abducted in 2014. Parents whose children had been released wore white during a multi-faith ceremony, the AFP news agency reported - while those whose daughters were still missing wore black. ""Our only prayer is for our girls to be released and returned to us,"" one parent, Hannatu Daudu, said at the gathering. ""We need to know if they are alive or dead. If they are alive, let them come back to us. If they are dead, let us know so we can at least pray for them and then overcome this grief."" What happened to the 276 kidnapped girls?

"This video can not be played The PM said the use of chemical weapons could not be allowed Prime ministers don't choose the decisions that face them. But they have to judge which way to jump. In 2013, Theresa May's predecessor tried and failed to get approval for military action against President Assad. There was international alarm, then as now, about his suspected use of chemical weapons. But MPs rejected David Cameron's plan and he didn't try again to persuade Parliament it was necessary. This time, she has avoided that particular obstacle by taking action alongside the US and France while MPs are away. US and allies launch strikes on Syria chemical weapons sites PM - 'No alternative' to Syria air strikes UK 'confident' of successful mission Corbyn's letter to Theresa May in full Syria strikes: Latest updates Time and again at a press conference at Downing Street this morning the prime minister spelled out the strikes that took place overnight were limited, targeted and a response to the suspected use of chemical weapons in Douma. With no clear indication of public support or consent, she time and again was at pains to say that she had authorised action for a specific reason - to punish President Assad for gassing his own people, as the government believes he has. She will face an almighty row in the coming days over going ahead without consulting Parliament. Her defence is that ""security and operational reasons"" meant the attack had to go ahead overnight. That won't wash with her political critics, and Labour is also pushing for more clarity on the legal justification. To try to close down a giant fight, the government is publishing a summary of the legal advice later today. But while the strikes themselves were limited, Theresa May's mission is a broader one - to force a return to respect for the international rules that are meant to prevent the use of chemical weapons. It was notable this morning that she mentioned the attack in Salisbury alongside the use of chemical weapons in Syria - events many thousands of miles and weeks apart, but both using banned substances. And notable, too, that the prime minister on several occasions did not rule out more strikes. When asked if Assad repeated the suspected attack she said ""no one should doubt our resolve"".  The government's hoped-for outcome is that the RAF, alongside French and US planes, has made it impossible for President Assad to carry out any other chemical attacks. But if the bombing has not wiped out his capability, and he was to repeat the suspected horror at Douma, the prime minister seems willing to act again. No 10 sees the actions of the last 24 hours as a direct response to Douma and an effort to stop the slide to a situation where the use of chemical weapons becomes the norm. As for any British resident of No 10, Theresa May's first decision to take military action is a huge political moment. But clearly it may also not be her last. Why is Brexit taking sooo long?

"This video can not be played Theresa May said the UK had taken part in ""limited and targeted strikes"" Air strikes on Syria were legally justified on humanitarian grounds, government documents say. Downing Streetpublished its legal case,externalfor military action hours afterTheresa May said she was ""confident""the strikes carried out by the UK, France and the US had been successful. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the action as ""legally questionable"". Bases near Damascus and Homs were targeted in response to an alleged chemical attack on the town of Douma. Syrian state media said the military action had been ""a flagrant violation of international law"", while ally Russia's President Vladimir Putin condemned it ""in the most serious way"". US President Donald Trumphailed the overnight strikes as ""perfectly executed"",tweeting: ""Mission Accomplished!"". US and allies launch strikes on Syria As it happened: Western powers strike Syria targets Theresa May: Syria statement in full,external Jeremy Corbyn: Letter in full Syria air strikes: Were they legal? At a meeting of the UN's Security Council, the UK's ambassador Karen Pierce said the strikes had been ""limited, targeted and effective"", with the impact on civilians ""minimised"". She said repeated attempts to hold the Syrian regime to account had been met with Russian ""obstruction and resistance"", and the UK and its allies would ""continue to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the crisis"". The US's ambassador Nikki Haley told the council diplomacy had been given ""chance after chance"", and the US remained ""locked and loaded"". The Security Council rejected a resolution drafted by Russia, which condemned ""the aggression against the Syrian Arab Republic by the US and its allies"". A resolution needs nine votes to pass and only Russia, China and Bolivia voted in favour. Meanwhile, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said all allies had given the action their full support. Both the Pentagon and Russian defence ministry said they had no confirmation of civilian casualties while the Russians also said there were no military casualties. Speaking in Downing Street earlier, Mrs May said: ""This collective action sends a clear message that the international community will not stand by and tolerate the use of chemical weapons."" Drawing a link with the recentnerve agent attack in Salisbury, Mrs May added: ""We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised - either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere."" Mrs May will make a statement in Parliament on Monday and give MPs a chance to ask questions. Mr Corbyn said MPs should have been consulted before the strike and earlier called on the PM to ""publish in full the legal justification and basis for"" the action. Party leaders including Scotland's First MinisterNicola Sturgeon,externaland the Liberal Democrat's Sir Vince Cable said MPs should have had a vote on the action - whilePlaid Cymru's Leanne Wood,externalaccused the government of putting UK security at risk. But Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party said Mrs May had ""the full authority"" to order the air strikes. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn wants the PM to publish the legal justification for air strikes In thesummary of legal advicegiven by Attorney General Jeremy Wright to Mrs May, Downing Street outlined why the UK was ""permitted under international law"" to take measures in the face of ""overwhelming humanitarian suffering"". It said there were three reasons why the strikes met international laws for military action on humanitarian grounds: The ""repeated lethal use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime constitutes a war crime"" and it was ""highly likely the regime would seek to use"" such weapons again Other attempts to ""alleviate the humanitarian suffering caused by the use of chemical weapons"" had been blocked and there was ""no practicable alternative"" to the strikes The action was ""carefully considered"" and the ""minimum judged necessary for that purpose"" By Norman Smith, BBC chief political correspondent Ever since the war in Iraq, the legal advice received by the government has been central to the inevitable political argument over the rights and wrongs of military action. It's no surprise then that Jeremy Corbyn should hone in straight away on doubts over the legality of the air attacks. And no surprise either that Downing Street should choose to publish so swiftly a summary of the legal advice it has received - in order to avoid the sort of damaging criticism suffered by the Blair government over its refusal to do so. Equally unsurprising, the advice received by Theresa May gives her clear backing for the case for military action - citing the right of governments to act to alleviate ""overwhelming human suffering"". And just for good measure, it also suggests that the Syrian regime is guilty of a war crime and crimes against humanity over the use of chemical weapons. But will this legal advice shift public or political opinion? The Ministry of Defence said eight Storm Shadow missiles had been launched by four RAF Tornados at a former missile base, 15 miles west of Homs. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons there, it said. A spokesperson added the facility was located ""some distance"" from ""concentrations of civilian habitation"", and the risk of contamination to the surrounding area had been minimised. Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Mrs May said she believed the strike action had been ""the right thing to do"" and was ""absolutely in Britain's national interest"". ""This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change,"" she said. ""It is about a limited and targeted strike that does not further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything possible to prevent civilian casualties."" Jonathan Beale: RAF missiles minimised risk President Trump statement in full Nicola Sturgeon: Air strikes risk dangerous escalation Syria 'chemical attack': What we know She said the UK government believed it was ""clear"" the Assad regime was responsible for the""despicable and barbaric"" attack on civilianson 7 April. Evidence suggested a barrel bomb and a regime helicopter had been used, she added. ""No other group could have carried out this attack."" This video can not be played RAF planes took off from their airbase in Cyprus ahead of the strikes in Syria Reporting from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, the BBC's Jonathan Beale said the Tornados had left the airbase in the early hours of Saturday. He added the cruise missiles had been fired ""well away from Syrian airspace"" and were out of the range of the regime's air defences. Downing Street also said Mrs May has spoken to several world leaders from countries including Germany, Canada, Australia, Jordan, Turkey, Italy and Cyprus as well as EU President Donald Tusk. A spokesman said ""all the leaders agreed"" with Mrs May about ""the importance of restoring the international norm that the use of chemical weapons is never acceptable"". Mrs May has also spoke to Mr Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron about the ""success"" of their joint mission.

The RAF sent four Tornado GR4 aircraft from Cyprus, each armed with two Storm Shadow cruise missiles. The Tornado has been one of the mainstays of the RAF since first entering service in 1980 and the aircraft were used to enforce no-fly zones in Iraq. Weighing in at 2,866lb (1,300kg), measuring 16.7ft (5.1m) in length and with a range in excess of 150 miles (240km), the ""bunker busting"" Storm Shadow has been described by the air force as ""arguably the most advanced weapon of its kind in the world"". The range means that none of the GR4s would have been required to cross into Syrian airspace to launch the assault. The aircraft were sent from RAF Akrotiri, a British base since the 1950s on the southern side of Cyprus, some 213 miles (343km) west of Homs.

"This video can not be played The PM said the use of chemical weapons could not be allowed Prime ministers don't choose the decisions that face them. But they have to judge which way to jump. In 2013, Theresa May's predecessor tried and failed to get approval for military action against President Assad. There was international alarm, then as now, about his suspected use of chemical weapons. But MPs rejected David Cameron's plan and he didn't try again to persuade Parliament it was necessary. This time, she has avoided that particular obstacle by taking action alongside the US and France while MPs are away. US and allies launch strikes on Syria chemical weapons sites PM - 'No alternative' to Syria air strikes UK 'confident' of successful mission Corbyn's letter to Theresa May in full Syria strikes: Latest updates Time and again at a press conference at Downing Street this morning the prime minister spelled out the strikes that took place overnight were limited, targeted and a response to the suspected use of chemical weapons in Douma. With no clear indication of public support or consent, she time and again was at pains to say that she had authorised action for a specific reason - to punish President Assad for gassing his own people, as the government believes he has. She will face an almighty row in the coming days over going ahead without consulting Parliament. Her defence is that ""security and operational reasons"" meant the attack had to go ahead overnight. That won't wash with her political critics, and Labour is also pushing for more clarity on the legal justification. To try to close down a giant fight, the government is publishing a summary of the legal advice later today. But while the strikes themselves were limited, Theresa May's mission is a broader one - to force a return to respect for the international rules that are meant to prevent the use of chemical weapons. It was notable this morning that she mentioned the attack in Salisbury alongside the use of chemical weapons in Syria - events many thousands of miles and weeks apart, but both using banned substances. And notable, too, that the prime minister on several occasions did not rule out more strikes. When asked if Assad repeated the suspected attack she said ""no one should doubt our resolve"".  The government's hoped-for outcome is that the RAF, alongside French and US planes, has made it impossible for President Assad to carry out any other chemical attacks. But if the bombing has not wiped out his capability, and he was to repeat the suspected horror at Douma, the prime minister seems willing to act again. No 10 sees the actions of the last 24 hours as a direct response to Douma and an effort to stop the slide to a situation where the use of chemical weapons becomes the norm. As for any British resident of No 10, Theresa May's first decision to take military action is a huge political moment. But clearly it may also not be her last. Why is Brexit taking sooo long?

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn wants the PM to publish the legal justification for air strikes Dear Prime Minister, I want to thank you for speaking to me last night regarding the bombing raids in Syria overnight, and for the security briefing you shared. I am very glad that all British military personnel have returned home safely, and hope too that there have been no civilian casualties in Syria. As I said, I believe that Parliament should have been consulted and voted on the matter. The UK prime minister is accountable to Parliament, not to the whims of a US president. I believe the action was legally questionable, and this morning the UN secretary general has said as much, reiterating that all countries must act in line with the UN charter. You assured me that the attorney general had given clear legal advice approving the action. I would therefore be grateful if you would publish this advice in full today. Given that neither the UN nor the OPCW has yet investigated, it is clear that diplomatic and non-military means have not been fully exhausted. It is now vitally important that the OPCW inspectors, who are due to arrive in Douma today, are allowed to do their work and publish their report into their findings - and report to the United Nations Security Council. I would therefore welcome your assurance that there will be no further bombing raids while OPCW inspectors are on the ground. They must be allowed to complete their inspections without hindrance. Acting through the United Nations, I believe Britain should now take a diplomatic lead to negotiate a pause in this abhorrent conflict in which hundreds of thousands of Syrians have already been killed and millions displaced. The refugee crisis places a responsibility on all countries and I hope the government will now increase its commitment to take additional refugees. Hundreds of unaccompanied children remain in Europe and the UK must do more through the Dubs amendment. This means engaging with all parties that are involved in the conflict - including Iran, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the US - to ensure there is an immediate ceasefire. We have the grotesque spectacle of a wider geopolitical proxy battle being waged, with the Syrian people used as pawns by all sides. I would welcome your assurance that Britain will embark on renewed diplomatic efforts to end this conflict. Our only priority must be the safety and security of the Syrian people - which is best served by de-escalating this conflict, so that aid can get in.

"Stuart Olding and Paddy Jackson were cleared of rape charges after a nine-week trial in Belfast Ulster and Ireland rugby players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding have had their contracts terminated. Last month, the players werecleared of rape after a nine-week trial. In a joint statement on Saturday, the IRFU and Ulster said their contracts have been revoked with ""immediate effect"". While the pair were cleared of rape, there had been controversy over social media and text messages they had exchanged. Ulster rugby pair cleared of rape Rugby sponsor 'concern' after rape trial Who is Paddy Jackson? Who is Stuart Olding? The IRFU/Ulster Rugby statement said: ""In arriving at this decision, the Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby acknowledge our responsibility and commitment to the core values of the game: Respect, inclusivity and integrity. ""It has been agreed, as part of this commitment, to conduct an in-depth review of existing structures and educational programmes, within the game in Ireland, to ensure the importance of these core values is clearly understood, supported and practised at every level of the game."" Paddy Jackson has played 25 times for Ireland at outhalf They also said that Ulster and Ireland winger Craig Gilroy has been sanctioned over a text message he sent to Stuart Olding. He will be unavailable for selection by Ulster until 26 April 2018. Mr Jackson and Mr Olding were cleared of raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Two other men, Blane McIlroy, who was accused of exposure, and Rory Harrison, who was charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information, were also found not guilty. In a statement to the Press Association Mr Jackson said he was ""deeply disappointed"" about the outcome of the IRFU and Ulster Rugby's internal review, which was announced after the rape trial ended. ""However, I recognise that my behaviour has fallen far short of the values expected of me as an international player, a role model for the game of rugby and as a son and a brother.  I am truly sorry,"" he said. Mr Jackson, pictured here in 2013, said it is with ""sadness and regret"" that he is leaving Ulster Rugby ""Since I was a young boy it was my ambition to play for Ulster and Ireland and I am extremely proud, privileged and honoured to have done so. ""It is therefore with great sadness and regret, but with many cherished memories, that I leave that behind."" Mr Olding also issued a statement: ""It is with regret that I have been informed that the IRFU have decided to revoke my contract."" He added: ""I very much wished to continue to have the opportunity to represent them [Ulster and Ireland]. Stuart Olding said ""influences outside of my contractual arrangement"" have made it impossible for him to continue playing for Ulster and Ireland ""Regrettably, influences outside of my contractual arrangement have made it impossible for that to happen. ""I said outside court that the Stuart Olding that you read about in the trial is not the real Stuart Olding. ""The treatment that I have received since my acquittal, both fair and unfair, has made me even more determined to prove myself. ""With the support of my family and friends I shall seek new challenges elsewhere.  I bear no-one any ill will."" On Sunday, a former Ulster and Ireland rugby player told the BBC that he sensed anger among fans in the wake of the decision to let the players go. Paddy Wallace said such supporters may now ""vote with their feet"" as they believe their views were not taken into consideration. Describing the decision as one that was motivated by money, Mr Wallace said: ""Ulster felt they needed to protect their sponsors rather than the players involved. Paddy Wallace said some fans believe their views were not reflected in the decision ""That could come back to bite them, because a lot of the supporters are thinking: 'Do I renew my season ticket, do I come to the games, do I put money across the bar?' ""The CEO [Shane Logan] has been invisible through this whole process and a lot of fans are very disgruntled about that. ""Some are feeling a disconnect and the easiest thing to do is vote with their feet."" Ulster players have expressed their""sadness"" at the departures of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Oldingfollowing the termination of their contracts. On Friday evening, hundreds of peoplestaged a protestoutside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast ahead of Ulster Rugby's match against Ospreys. The rally was organised by Belfast Feminist Network. Dozens of people staged a protest outside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast on Friday night Last week, a crowd-funded advertisement was taken out in a Belfast newspapercalling for Mr Jackson and Mr Olding to be droppedby Ulster and Ireland. It described the Whatsapp messages that emerged during the trial as ""reprehensible"". Mr Jacksonlater apologised for the messages. However, a separate advert was published days later, calling on Ulster and Irish rugby to reinstate ""innocent men"" to playing duties. That advert was signed by ""real fans standing up for the Ulster men"". On Thursday,one of Ulster Rugby's key sponsors, Bank of Ireland, said it was ""highly concerned""by issues arising out of the rape trial. In a statement on Saturday, it said: ""We welcome the in-depth review of structures and education programmes which has been announced today, and look forward to the recommendations which arise being put into effect.""

"Milos Forman with an award at the Sevilla Festival Film in 2004 Film lovers are mourning director Milos Forman, who won Oscars for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus. The Czech-born film-maker, who was 86, was one of a small number of foreign directors to enjoy lasting commercial and critical success in Hollywood. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest starred Jack Nicholson and won five Oscars in 1976, while 1984's Amadeus won eight. Director Edgar Wright was among those paying tribute, saying he ""documented the rebel heart and human spirit"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Forman's other English-language films included 1996's The People vs Larry Flynt, which earned him his third best director Oscar nomination, and 1999's Man on the Moon. Antonio Banderas, who has said he was inspired to become an actor when he watched Forman's 1979 musical Hair, described him as a ""genius of cinematography and master in the portrayal of the human condition"".

Forman was born in Czechoslovakia in 1932 and became an orphan when both his parents were killed in Nazi death camps during World War II. He made his name as a leading figure in Czech new wave cinema in the 1960s, but moved to the US when Russian troops invaded in 1968. His first feature in the US, 1971's Taking Off, was a critical if not commercial success. But the follow-up, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, firmly established him in Hollywood. It was one of the biggest box office hits of 1975, taking more than $100m, and became only the second film in history to win Oscars for best picture, director, actor, actress and screenplay. He won his second best director Oscar for Amadeus in 1985 The film starred Nicholson as a man battling the system in a psychiatric establishment and was based on Ken Kesey's novel. ""To me it was not just literature but real life, the life I lived in Czechoslovakia from my birth in 1932 until 1968,"" Forman once said. ""The Communist Party was my Nurse Ratched, telling me what I could and could not do."" The director followed that with Hair and 1981's Ragtime before Amadeus, a look at the life of 18th Century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his rival Antonio Salieri. Its Oscars included best picture and best director. After 1989's Valmont, he made The People vs Larry Flynt, with Woody Harrelson cast as the porn publisher. With Courtney Love, who appeared in The People vs Larry Flynt Three years later, Forman cast Jim Carrey to star in Man On The Moon, the biopic of comedian Andy Kaufman. WhenForman was honoured with a lifetime achievement award from the Directors' Guild of Americain 2012, the guild's president Taylor Hackford said he ""finds the universality of the human experience in every story"". Forman was married to actresses Jana Brejchova and Vera Kresadlova, having twin boys with the latter. In 1999, he married screenwriter Martina Zborilova, with whom he also had twin sons, Andrew and James - named after Andy Kaufman and Jim Carrey. He died on Friday in the US after a short illness, Martina told Czech news agency CTK. ""His departure was calm and he was surrounded the whole time by his family and his closest friends,"" she said.

"Campaigners said 4x4s and motorbikes were damaging the area near Little Langdale The authority running the Lake District National Park has been accused of ""violating its World Heritage status"". Campaigners say a ""massive increase"" in motorbikes and 4x4 vehicles has ""profoundly changed the landscape"". They have accused the Lake District National Park Authority (LDNPA) of neglecting the fells and promoting the use of tracks by off-roaders. The LDNPA said it would be ""preferable if people did not take vehicles on these routes"" but it was legal. Head of park management Mark Eccles said: ""All unsealed routes with public vehicular access rights, including the ones in the Little Langdale, Oxen Fell and Tilberthwaite area, are subject to the same laws as surfaced [tarmac] roads. ""We encourage users to behave responsibly on what can be vulnerable tracks to minimise environmental impact and respect other users."" The Lake District National Park Authority said the tracks were subject to the same laws as surfaced roads Save The Lake District campaigners say the LDNPA has a statutory duty under the Environment Act 1995 to give greater weight to conservation in any conflict between it and recreational interests. They are asking Unesco, which oversees the World Heritage status designation, to force the LDNPA to use its traffic regulation powers to keep off-roaders off unsurfaced tracks. A petition demanding a ban has been signed by more than 4,300 people. Although traffic regulation orders ""cannot be ruled out"", using them was a last resort and the authority had ""no immediate plans"" to do so, Mr Eccles said.

Drawing a link with the recentnerve agent attack in Salisbury, Mrs May added: ""We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised - either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere."" Mrs May will make a statement in Parliament on Monday and give MPs a chance to ask questions. Mr Corbyn said MPs should have been consulted before the strike and earlier called on the PM to ""publish in full the legal justification and basis for"" the action. The Labour leader added that weapons inspectors were on their way to verify the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn wants the PM to publish the legal justification for air strikes By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent Whitehall officials say the aim of launching strikes against Syria has been to deal a big enough blow to the Assad regime that it deters it from using chemical weapons again - but not so big as to alter the course of the Syrian conflict or draw retaliation from Russia. Planners took the view that the limited US missile strike on Shayrat airbase a year ago had failed to dissuade the Assad regime from using poison gas. Before the green light was given by the prime minister for RAF participation in today's attack, the defence secretary spent time with the attorney general going over the legality of the targeting in precise detail. I am told that the lessons of the Chilcot Report - into the mistakes made over the Iraq invasion of 2003 - have been uppermost in people's minds. Decisions, phone calls and sign-offs made over the last few days may one day have to be scrutinised by lawyers. Russia too has been a major factor in choosing which targets to attack. Planners believe that the best way to mitigate against any Russian retaliation was to warn them in advance and avoid hitting any Russian positions in Syria. The Ministry of Defence said eight Storm Shadow missiles had been launched by four RAF Tornados at a former missile base, 15 miles west of Homs. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons there - in breach of Syria's obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, it said. A spokesperson added the facility was ""located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation"", and scientific analysis was used to ""minimise any risks of contamination to the surrounding area"". A Nato meeting will be held on Saturday where Britain, France and the US will brief allies on the action taken in Syria. US PresidentDonald Trump tweeted,externalit was a ""perfectly executed strike"" and thanked France and the UK for their ""wisdom and the power of their fine military"". He added: ""Could not have had a better result. Mission accomplished!"" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Prime ministers don't choose the decisions that face them. But they have to judge which way to jump. In 2013, Theresa May's predecessor tried and failed to get approval for military action against President Assad. There was international alarm, then as now, about his suspected use of chemical weapons. But MPs rejected David Cameron's plan and he didn't try again to persuade Parliament it was necessary. This time, she has avoided that particular obstacle by taking action alongside the US and France while MPs are away. Read the full blog here. Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Mrs May said she believed the strike action had been ""the right thing to do"" and was ""absolutely in Britain's national interest"". ""This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change,"" she said. ""It is about a limited and targeted strike that does not further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything possible to prevent civilian casualties."" She said the UK government ""judged it highly likely"" that Syria had been using chemical weapons, and it was ""clear"" the Assad regime was responsible for the""despicable and barbaric"" attack on civilianson 7 April. Evidence suggested a barrel bomb and a regime helicopter had been used, she added. ""No other group could have carried out this attack."" Jonathan Beale: RAF missiles minimised risk President Trump statement in full Nicola Sturgeon: Air strikes risk dangerous escalation Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Downing Street'ssummary of legal advicegiven by Attorney General Jeremy Wright to Mrs May said there were three reasons why the strikes met international laws for military action on humanitarian grounds: The ""repeated lethal use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime constitutes a war crime"" and it was ""highly likely the regime would seek to use"" such weapons again Other attempts to ""alleviate the humanitarian suffering caused by the use of chemical weapons"" had been blocked and there was ""no practicable alternative"" to the strikes The action was ""carefully considered"" and the ""minimum judged necessary for that purpose"" This video can not be played RAF planes took off from their airbase in Cyprus ahead of the strikes in Syria Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Britain, the US and France had played an important role in ""degrading the ability of the Syrian regime to use chemical weapons"". Reporting from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, the BBC's Jonathan Beale said the UK's Tornados had left the airbase in the early hours of Saturday. He added the cruise missiles had been fired ""well away from Syrian airspace"" and were out of the range of the regime's air defences. Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin of Russia - Syria's key ally - said he ""condemns the attack in the most serious way"". And Syria's official Sana news agency said ""American, French and British aggression against Syria will fail"". In the UK, Scotland's First MinisterNicola Sturgeon said,externalMrs May had not answered how the action, ""taken without parliamentary approval, will halt their [Syria's] use"" of chemical weapons, ""or bring long term peace"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also said MPs should have had a vote on the action, adding: ""Riding the coat-tails of an erratic US president is no substitute for a mandate from the House of Commons."" Plaid Cymruleader Leanne Wood accused the government,externalof being ""reckless"" and said the strikes ""risked an escalation"" that could put ""our security as well as the lives of innocent people at risk"". Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party said Mrs May had ""the full authority"" to order the air strikes and it rejected ""any suggestion that she was not entitled to do so"". The RAF sent four Tornado GR4 aircraft from Cyprus, each armed with two Storm Shadow cruise missiles. The Tornado has been one of the mainstays of the RAF since first entering service in 1980 and the aircraft were used to enforce no-fly zones in Iraq. Weighing in at 2,866lb (1,300kg), measuring 16.7ft (5.1m) in length and with a range in excess of 150 miles (240km), the ""bunker busting"" Storm Shadow has been described by the air force as ""arguably the most advanced weapon of its kind in the world"". The range means that none of the GR4s would have been required to cross into Syrian airspace to launch the assault. The aircraft were sent from RAF Akrotiri, a British base since the 1950s on the southern side of Cyprus, some 213 miles (343km) west of Homs.

"This video can not be played The PM said the use of chemical weapons could not be allowed Prime ministers don't choose the decisions that face them. But they have to judge which way to jump. In 2013, Theresa May's predecessor tried and failed to get approval for military action against President Assad. There was international alarm, then as now, about his suspected use of chemical weapons. But MPs rejected David Cameron's plan and he didn't try again to persuade Parliament it was necessary. This time, she has avoided that particular obstacle by taking action alongside the US and France while MPs are away. US and allies launch strikes on Syria chemical weapons sites PM - 'No alternative' to Syria air strikes UK 'confident' of successful mission Corbyn's letter to Theresa May in full Syria strikes: Latest updates Time and again at a press conference at Downing Street this morning the prime minister spelled out the strikes that took place overnight were limited, targeted and a response to the suspected use of chemical weapons in Douma. With no clear indication of public support or consent, she time and again was at pains to say that she had authorised action for a specific reason - to punish President Assad for gassing his own people, as the government believes he has. She will face an almighty row in the coming days over going ahead without consulting Parliament. Her defence is that ""security and operational reasons"" meant the attack had to go ahead overnight. That won't wash with her political critics, and Labour is also pushing for more clarity on the legal justification. To try to close down a giant fight, the government is publishing a summary of the legal advice later today. But while the strikes themselves were limited, Theresa May's mission is a broader one - to force a return to respect for the international rules that are meant to prevent the use of chemical weapons. It was notable this morning that she mentioned the attack in Salisbury alongside the use of chemical weapons in Syria - events many thousands of miles and weeks apart, but both using banned substances. And notable, too, that the prime minister on several occasions did not rule out more strikes. When asked if Assad repeated the suspected attack she said ""no one should doubt our resolve"".  The government's hoped-for outcome is that the RAF, alongside French and US planes, has made it impossible for President Assad to carry out any other chemical attacks. But if the bombing has not wiped out his capability, and he was to repeat the suspected horror at Douma, the prime minister seems willing to act again. No 10 sees the actions of the last 24 hours as a direct response to Douma and an effort to stop the slide to a situation where the use of chemical weapons becomes the norm. As for any British resident of No 10, Theresa May's first decision to take military action is a huge political moment. But clearly it may also not be her last. Why is Brexit taking sooo long?

"President Trump has signalled military intervention is likely in the near future As the US and UK governments continue to discuss their potential response tothe suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma in Syria, what could military intervention achieve? The critical military virtue of surprise has long since disappeared for theUnited States and its allies in the strikes it is planning against Syrianmilitary facilities. Indeed, Syrian forces have had more than two days to move their aircraft and other military assets into Russian bases at Latakia, Tartus and Khmeimim, where they will be within the protective bubbles of Russia's highly capable S-400 surface-to-air missiles. The Syrians have emptied their infantry bases and dispersed as much of their armed forces as possible, in anticipation of incoming Western missiles. The Russians will undoubtedly try to protect their bases, if attacked, so the situation is fraught with superpower brinkmanship and the danger of accidental conflict. For Western military planners the two greatest questions are what can they achieve militarily in this situation, and what strategic difference can it make? Theresa May summons cabinet to discuss Syria action Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria? Syria 'chemical attack': France's President Macron says he has proof Firepower of key countries in Syrian crisis With Syrian forces forewarned, dispersed and under Russian protection, Western strikes will have to concentrate on Syria's fixed military facilities - bombing runways, destroying buildings and capital equipment where it remains in place. This video can not be played The US president has said ""nothing's off the table"" - so what options are on the table? Western attacks will probably try to destroy Syria's military command and control system, possibly with bunker-busting bombs and deep penetration warheads. They are likely to try to dismantle the military infrastructure that Syria has effectively rebuilt since 2015. More ambitiously, and also more risky, the United States might declare a longer-term policy of revisiting these targets to keep them out of use and have Syrian aircraft bottled up inside their Russian bases - in effect trying to operate a quasi ""no-fly zone"" in Syria, at least for a while. In April 2017 the US launched 59 cruise missiles at the Shayrat airbase in response to a previous chemical weapons attack Last year when theUS struck President Assad's Shayrat airbase in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun,the Syrian air force made sure it was seen to be back in action within a day. The US will be determined that this does not happen again, which is why we can expect this to be a more prolonged air campaign with repeated attacks on key sites. What strategic purpose can be served by this? It certainly won't make any immediate difference to the civil population of Syria, who have suffered so much at the hands of their own government, and the multitude of rebel, terrorist and guerrilla groups, some of whom have intimidated, as much as they have represented, them. And President Assad is unlikely to relent in his determination to consolidate his hold on the country. Why is there a war in Syria? Experts: Are we heading for a third world war? So why take all the risks of escalation with Russia and the prospects of unintended consequences that normally follow? On its own, military force is meaningless. It has to be part of a political strategy and in this case the strategy is about bigger issues than Syria itself and only offers a long-shot hope for the Syrian population. The first objective is to push back against the increasing ""normalisation"" of chemical weapons being used in wars of any kind. The taboo against them has been surprisingly strong since the end of World War One.The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993,externalhas been one of the most effective disarmament measures in modern history. Syria is a signatory to it. In2013 President Obama claimed he would uphold that taboo as a ""red line"", but then didn't. And despite firm denials from the Assad government, there is an abundance of evidence that Syrian forces, with Russian connivance, have been using chemical weapons against their own people on a regular basis ever since. Many Western politicians feel that - with all the moral grey areas of this situation - they cannot sell the pass on this issue yet again. It has become a test case for the international rule of law, which is under severe pressure on many fronts. The World Health Organization has demanded ""unhindered access"" to Douma in Syria to verify claims about the attack Beyond that, some argue effective military action would represent an acceptance that Western powers have got to get back into the game of Middle East politics at a time when the region is melting down. The campaign against so-called Islamic State (IS) was always a geopolitical sideshow, and Western influence on what has been happening from Lebanon to the Yemen has been in steep decline. Of course, it is tempting, and understandable, for Western leaders to want to leave it all alone. But while they took their eye off the ball fighting IS, the future of the area was being determined by Iran, Russia and partly also by Turkey. Syria war: Why Turkey's battle for northern Syria matters Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? The calculation is whether long-term Western interests are served better by involvement than indifference to a constellation of powers that is sliding out of control. And the hope for the Syrian population is that an effective military campaign could possibly push President Assad back into negotiations so that the war might end with something more humane than a vicious victory. Using military force is never easy, but it can only be effective if it is part of a coherent and realistic political strategy.

The US's ambassador Nikki Haley told the council diplomacy had been given ""chance after chance"", and the US remained ""locked and loaded"".

It's no surprise then that Jeremy Corbyn should hone in straight away on doubts over the legality of the air attacks. And no surprise either that Downing Street should choose to publish so swiftly a summary of the legal advice it has received - in order to avoid the sort of damaging criticism suffered by the Blair government over its refusal to do so. Equally unsurprising, the advice received by Theresa May gives her clear backing for the case for military action - citing the right of governments to act to alleviate ""overwhelming human suffering"". And just for good measure, it also suggests that the Syrian regime is guilty of a war crime and crimes against humanity over the use of chemical weapons. But will this legal advice shift public or political opinion?

"This video can not be played Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's casket was draped in the national flag Large crowds gathered in South Africa for the funeral of the anti-apartheid campaigner Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Thousands of mourners crowded into a stadium in Soweto, near Johannesburg, where the campaigner was given a high-level send-off before her burial in Johannesburg. Her casket was draped in the national flag, and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered the eulogy. The former wife of Nelson Mandela died earlier this month at the age of 81. A controversial figure, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was lauded for her role in the anti-apartheid struggle. But she was later shunned by the political elite for endorsing punishment killings for government informers. Obituary: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela The women who loved Nelson Mandela What Winnie Mandela meant to South Africans At the funeral, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's daughter Zenani Mandela-Dlamini berated the ""extreme cruelty"" of those she said had led smear campaigns against her mother and isolated her - only to clear her name after her death. ""It is so disappointing to see how they withheld their words during my mother's lifetime, knowing very well what they would have meant to her. Only they know why they chose to share the truth with the world after she departed,"" Mrs Mandela-Dlamini said. Mr Ramaphosa apologised for only belatedly recognising Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's contribution President Ramaphosa described Mrs Madikizela-Mandela as a symbol of resistance who laid bare the edifice of patriarchy. He apologised for only belatedly recognising her contribution. ""I'm sorry, Mama, that your organisation delayed in according you its honour, to this point in time and moment. As president, I will propose that we award you the highest order of our movement, you richly deserve to be awarded"", Mr Ramaphosa said. There were loud cheers when the radical Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema paid tribute to Mrs Madikizela-Mandela. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was a social worker when she met her future husband, then a prominent anti-apartheid campaigner, in the 1950s. They were married for a total of 38 years but for almost three decades of that time, they were separated by Mr Mandela's long imprisonment. They had two daughters together. Nelson and Winnie Mandela were married for 38 years After Mr Mandela was imprisoned by the apartheid regime, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela became an international symbol of resistance to apartheid. She too was jailed for her role in opposing white minority rule. To her supporters, she became known affectionately as ""Mother of the Nation"". But Mrs Madikizela-Mandela also found herself mired in scandal for decades. She was accused of conducting a virtual reign of terror in parts of Soweto by other members of the ANC in the late 1980s, and in 2003 she was convicted of fraud. Nomsa Maseko at the Orlando Stadium, Soweto, for BBC News Orlando Stadium reverberated as thousands sang liberation songs, paying tribute to the freedom fighter known to many simply as Mama Winnie. Supporters of various political parties who are often at odds with each put their differences aside to pay tribute to the anti-apartheid activist. During the dark days of apartheid, Orlando Stadium in Soweto was always often associated with politicians delivering fiery speeches - and today was no different. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's death managed to unite different political parties who are often at odds with each other. Many agreed to put their differences aside to give her the send-off she deserved. A reassessment of her contribution to South Africa's apartheid struggle has been playing out in local media. While once she was shunned by South Africa's political elite, including her own party the ANC, in death she has been almost universally lauded. 1936: Born in Cape Province 1958: Married Nelson Mandela 1969: Jailed for 18 months for anti-apartheid activities 1976: Banished to rural area by apartheid authorities 1991: Convicted of kidnapping 1996: Divorced from Nelson Mandela 2003: Convicted of fraud What Winnie Mandela meant to me Obituary: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Nelson Mandela death: The women who loved him Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"A gang of men, one armed with a machete, ""terrorised"" a family during a robbery at their home in East Kilbride in South Lanarkshire. A couple, aged 55 and 56, and their son, aged 26, were woken by smashing glass at Castlehill Farm, Kittochside, on Saturday morning. Four masked men threatened them and the homeowner was struck with a machete. They were held in a bedroom while the property was ransacked, with cash, jewellery and a Range Rover stolen. Detectives said the family ""genuinely feared for their lives"" during the ""abhorrent incident"". They have appealed for information. Officers were called to the property at about 04:30, after the suspects left. During the raid, the 55-year-old male householder was struck on the leg by one of the men who was armed with the machete. The men left the house after about 20 minutes and joined another man who was waiting outside in a black Nissan Qashqai. They drove off along Carmunnock bypass and then towards Croftfoot Road and Blairbeth Road, before abandoning the stolen black Range Rover in the Mount Vernon area of Glasgow. One of the men is described as being in his early 20s with a local accent and was wearing a grey hoodie with his face covered. The rest of the men are described as having local accents and wearing dark clothing with scarves/balaclavas covering their faces. Det Sgt Alan MacDonald, from Cambuslang CID, said: ""This group of despicable individuals completely terrorised this family and made threats of extreme violence, which made them genuinely fear for their lives throughout the ordeal. ""They have been left absolutely traumatised and it is vital that we trace the criminals responsible for this abhorrent incident. ""The house is in an isolated location, near to the Museum of Rural Life in East Kilbride, and I would appeal to anyone who was in the area in the early hours of this morning and may have noticed a black Nissan Qashqai to please get in touch. ""I would also ask anyone who saw a black Nissan Qashqai or black Range Rover driving along the route described following the incident to come forward."" Any motorists with dashcams who were driving in the area at about 04:30 have also been urged to contact police.

"This video can not be played Theresa May said the UK had taken part in ""limited and targeted strikes"" The UK is ""confident"" that air strikes carried out by Britain, the US and France on suspected chemical weapons facilities in Syria have been successful, the PM has said. Theresa May also said it had been ""right and legal"" to take action. Military bases near the capital Damascus and the city of Homs were targeted, after an alleged chemical attack on the Syrian town of Douma. Jeremy Corbyn called it ""legally questionable"" in a letter to Mrs May. Downing Streetpublished a summary of the legal advice,externalit received on the strikes, stating that the UK was ""permitted under international law"" to take measures to ""alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering"". Syrian state media said the strikes had been ""a flagrant violation of international law"". The UN Security Council will meet on Saturday at Russia's request. US and allies launch strikes on Syria Live updates: Western powers strike Syria targets Theresa May: Syria statement in full,external Jeremy Corbyn: Letter in full Syria air strikes: Were they legal? Speaking in Downing Street, Mrs May said the ""limited and targeted strikes"" had degraded Syria's ability to use chemical weapons. ""This collective action sends a clear message that the international community will not stand by and tolerate the use of chemical weapons,"" she said. Drawing a link with the recentnerve agent attack in Salisbury, Mrs May added: ""We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised - either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere."" Mrs May will make a statement in Parliament on Monday and give MPs a chance to ask questions. Mr Corbyn said MPs should have been consulted before the strike and earlier called on the PM to ""publish in full the legal justification and basis for"" the action. The Labour leader added that weapons inspectors were on their way to verify the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn wants the PM to publish the legal justification for air strikes By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent Whitehall officials say the aim of launching strikes against Syria has been to deal a big enough blow to the Assad regime that it deters it from using chemical weapons again - but not so big as to alter the course of the Syrian conflict or draw retaliation from Russia. Planners took the view that the limited US missile strike on Shayrat airbase a year ago had failed to dissuade the Assad regime from using poison gas. Before the green light was given by the prime minister for RAF participation in today's attack, the defence secretary spent time with the attorney general going over the legality of the targeting in precise detail. I am told that the lessons of the Chilcot Report - into the mistakes made over the Iraq invasion of 2003 - have been uppermost in people's minds. Decisions, phone calls and sign-offs made over the last few days may one day have to be scrutinised by lawyers. Russia too has been a major factor in choosing which targets to attack. Planners believe that the best way to mitigate against any Russian retaliation was to warn them in advance and avoid hitting any Russian positions in Syria. The Ministry of Defence said eight Storm Shadow missiles had been launched by four RAF Tornados at a former missile base, 15 miles west of Homs. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons there - in breach of Syria's obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, it said. A spokesperson added the facility was ""located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation"", and scientific analysis was used to ""minimise any risks of contamination to the surrounding area"". A Nato meeting will be held on Saturday where Britain, France and the US will brief allies on the action taken in Syria. US PresidentDonald Trump tweeted,externalit was a ""perfectly executed strike"" and thanked France and the UK for their ""wisdom and the power of their fine military"". He added: ""Could not have had a better result. Mission accomplished!"" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Prime ministers don't choose the decisions that face them. But they have to judge which way to jump. In 2013, Theresa May's predecessor tried and failed to get approval for military action against President Assad. There was international alarm, then as now, about his suspected use of chemical weapons. But MPs rejected David Cameron's plan and he didn't try again to persuade Parliament it was necessary. This time, she has avoided that particular obstacle by taking action alongside the US and France while MPs are away. Read the full blog here. Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Mrs May said she believed the strike action had been ""the right thing to do"" and was ""absolutely in Britain's national interest"". ""This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change,"" she said. ""It is about a limited and targeted strike that does not further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything possible to prevent civilian casualties."" She said the UK government ""judged it highly likely"" that Syria had been using chemical weapons, and it was ""clear"" the Assad regime was responsible for the""despicable and barbaric"" attack on civilianson 7 April. Evidence suggested a barrel bomb and a regime helicopter had been used, she added. ""No other group could have carried out this attack."" Jonathan Beale: RAF missiles minimised risk President Trump statement in full Nicola Sturgeon: Air strikes risk dangerous escalation Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Downing Street'ssummary of legal advicegiven by Attorney General Jeremy Wright to Mrs May said there were three reasons why the strikes met international laws for military action on humanitarian grounds: The ""repeated lethal use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime constitutes a war crime"" and it was ""highly likely the regime would seek to use"" such weapons again Other attempts to ""alleviate the humanitarian suffering caused by the use of chemical weapons"" had been blocked and there was ""no practicable alternative"" to the strikes The action was ""carefully considered"" and the ""minimum judged necessary for that purpose"" This video can not be played RAF planes took off from their airbase in Cyprus ahead of the strikes in Syria Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Britain, the US and France had played an important role in ""degrading the ability of the Syrian regime to use chemical weapons"". Reporting from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, the BBC's Jonathan Beale said the UK's Tornados had left the airbase in the early hours of Saturday. He added the cruise missiles had been fired ""well away from Syrian airspace"" and were out of the range of the regime's air defences. Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin of Russia - Syria's key ally - said he ""condemns the attack in the most serious way"". And Syria's official Sana news agency said ""American, French and British aggression against Syria will fail"". In the UK, Scotland's First MinisterNicola Sturgeon said,externalMrs May had not answered how the action, ""taken without parliamentary approval, will halt their [Syria's] use"" of chemical weapons, ""or bring long term peace"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also said MPs should have had a vote on the action, adding: ""Riding the coat-tails of an erratic US president is no substitute for a mandate from the House of Commons."" Plaid Cymruleader Leanne Wood accused the government,externalof being ""reckless"" and said the strikes ""risked an escalation"" that could put ""our security as well as the lives of innocent people at risk"". Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party said Mrs May had ""the full authority"" to order the air strikes and it rejected ""any suggestion that she was not entitled to do so"". The RAF sent four Tornado GR4 aircraft from Cyprus, each armed with two Storm Shadow cruise missiles. The Tornado has been one of the mainstays of the RAF since first entering service in 1980 and the aircraft were used to enforce no-fly zones in Iraq. Weighing in at 2,866lb (1,300kg), measuring 16.7ft (5.1m) in length and with a range in excess of 150 miles (240km), the ""bunker busting"" Storm Shadow has been described by the air force as ""arguably the most advanced weapon of its kind in the world"". The range means that none of the GR4s would have been required to cross into Syrian airspace to launch the assault. The aircraft were sent from RAF Akrotiri, a British base since the 1950s on the southern side of Cyprus, some 213 miles (343km) west of Homs.

"Stuart Olding and Paddy Jackson were cleared of rape charges after a nine-week trial in Belfast Ulster and Ireland rugby players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding have had their contracts terminated. Last month, the players werecleared of rape after a nine-week trial. In a joint statement on Saturday, the IRFU and Ulster said their contracts have been revoked with ""immediate effect"". While the pair were cleared of rape, there had been controversy over social media and text messages they had exchanged. Ulster rugby pair cleared of rape Rugby sponsor 'concern' after rape trial Who is Paddy Jackson? Who is Stuart Olding? The IRFU/Ulster Rugby statement said: ""In arriving at this decision, the Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby acknowledge our responsibility and commitment to the core values of the game: Respect, inclusivity and integrity. ""It has been agreed, as part of this commitment, to conduct an in-depth review of existing structures and educational programmes, within the game in Ireland, to ensure the importance of these core values is clearly understood, supported and practised at every level of the game."" Paddy Jackson has played 25 times for Ireland at outhalf They also said that Ulster and Ireland winger Craig Gilroy has been sanctioned over a text message he sent to Stuart Olding. He will be unavailable for selection by Ulster until 26 April 2018. Mr Jackson and Mr Olding were cleared of raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Two other men, Blane McIlroy, who was accused of exposure, and Rory Harrison, who was charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information, were also found not guilty. In a statement to the Press Association Mr Jackson said he was ""deeply disappointed"" about the outcome of the IRFU and Ulster Rugby's internal review, which was announced after the rape trial ended. ""However, I recognise that my behaviour has fallen far short of the values expected of me as an international player, a role model for the game of rugby and as a son and a brother.  I am truly sorry,"" he said. Mr Jackson, pictured here in 2013, said it is with ""sadness and regret"" that he is leaving Ulster Rugby ""Since I was a young boy it was my ambition to play for Ulster and Ireland and I am extremely proud, privileged and honoured to have done so. ""It is therefore with great sadness and regret, but with many cherished memories, that I leave that behind."" Mr Olding also issued a statement: ""It is with regret that I have been informed that the IRFU have decided to revoke my contract."" He added: ""I very much wished to continue to have the opportunity to represent them [Ulster and Ireland]. Stuart Olding said ""influences outside of my contractual arrangement"" have made it impossible for him to continue playing for Ulster and Ireland ""Regrettably, influences outside of my contractual arrangement have made it impossible for that to happen. ""I said outside court that the Stuart Olding that you read about in the trial is not the real Stuart Olding. ""The treatment that I have received since my acquittal, both fair and unfair, has made me even more determined to prove myself. ""With the support of my family and friends I shall seek new challenges elsewhere.  I bear no-one any ill will."" On Sunday, a former Ulster and Ireland rugby player told the BBC that he sensed anger among fans in the wake of the decision to let the players go. Paddy Wallace said such supporters may now ""vote with their feet"" as they believe their views were not taken into consideration. Describing the decision as one that was motivated by money, Mr Wallace said: ""Ulster felt they needed to protect their sponsors rather than the players involved. Paddy Wallace said some fans believe their views were not reflected in the decision ""That could come back to bite them, because a lot of the supporters are thinking: 'Do I renew my season ticket, do I come to the games, do I put money across the bar?' ""The CEO [Shane Logan] has been invisible through this whole process and a lot of fans are very disgruntled about that. ""Some are feeling a disconnect and the easiest thing to do is vote with their feet."" Ulster players have expressed their""sadness"" at the departures of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Oldingfollowing the termination of their contracts. On Friday evening, hundreds of peoplestaged a protestoutside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast ahead of Ulster Rugby's match against Ospreys. The rally was organised by Belfast Feminist Network. Dozens of people staged a protest outside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast on Friday night Last week, a crowd-funded advertisement was taken out in a Belfast newspapercalling for Mr Jackson and Mr Olding to be droppedby Ulster and Ireland. It described the Whatsapp messages that emerged during the trial as ""reprehensible"". Mr Jacksonlater apologised for the messages. However, a separate advert was published days later, calling on Ulster and Irish rugby to reinstate ""innocent men"" to playing duties. That advert was signed by ""real fans standing up for the Ulster men"". On Thursday,one of Ulster Rugby's key sponsors, Bank of Ireland, said it was ""highly concerned""by issues arising out of the rape trial. In a statement on Saturday, it said: ""We welcome the in-depth review of structures and education programmes which has been announced today, and look forward to the recommendations which arise being put into effect.""

"Rock star Johnny Hallyday was married to fourth wife Laeticia for 21 years A French court has frozen real estate assets and royalties of French legend Johnny Hallyday while it deliberates on the rock star's will. The singer died of cancer in Decemberand left everything to his fourth wife Laeticia and their adopted daughters. His older children are contesting this as French law forbids children from being excluded from inheritance. French media speculate that the rock star left up to â¬100m (Â£86m). A posthumous album, expected to be a big seller, is due out in 2018. Hallyday's children fight 'hurtful' will Bardot wades into row over singer's will The court in Nanterre ruled against the the rock star's two children from a previous marriage and relationship - singer David Hallyday, 51, and actress Laura Smet, 34 - having a say on the album. Laeticia (2nd left) and her two daughters are pictured at the rock star's funeral with Laura Smet and her half-brother David Hallyday Hallyday, who was hugely popular in his native France, sold more than 100 million records in a nearly 60-year career. In 2014 he filed a will in California, where he had a home and was domiciled for tax purposes. How France saw itself in Johnny Hallyday The story of a French rock phenomenon While details of the rock star's will have not been made public, the older children's lawyers say everything - including a Swiss chalet and property in the Caribbean - was left to Laeticia, his fourth wife, and their daughters Jade and Joy. His older children say the will contravenes French inheritance laws that bar this from happening. A judge will now have to weigh up whether Hallyday, 74 when he died of lung cancer in France, was a US or French resident, thereby deciding if his will breaks French law.

"An RAF Tornado returns to its Cyprus base in 2014 The RAF crews involved in the overnight strikes on a Syrian chemical weapons target were well prepared for this operation. For the past three years they've regularly been carrying out bombing missions against the group known as Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria. For that they've been able to fly directly over targets in uncontested airspace dropping Paveway bombs or firing their smaller Brimstone missiles. But this time there were greater risks. Unlike IS, both the Syrian regime and its ally Russia have sophisticated air defences. If the RAF Tornados flew directly over their target there was the added danger they'd become a target too. That's why they used their Stormshadow cruise missiles. These ""fire and forget"" weapons can be pre-programmed. They use GPS mapping to find their target and have a range of up to 300 miles. The RAF Tornados which can carry two Stormshadows could stay well clear of any threat. The Stormshadow was first used in anger during the Iraq invasion in 2003. More recently it's been fired during the campaign to remove Libya's Colonel Gaddafi and on a rare occasion against IS too. Live: Western airstrikes on Syria UK 'confident' of Syria air strike success Watch: Eyewitness describes moment missiles struck The cruise missile is 5m long, weighs 1300kg and flies at speeds up to 1000km/h. It's difficult to shoot down. Once fired from the Tornado it would have flown low. When close to the target it climbs before making a final dive to penetrate its target before setting off the main warhead. In the past, the Stormshadow has been used to hit hardened targets such as concrete bunkers. The target this time was a chemical weapons facility 15 miles west of Homs. The Ministry of Defence says it believes the Assad regime had been using the former missiles base to store the precursors to make chemical weapons. Both Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and the prime minister say they believe the strike was a ""success"", although it'll take time to analyse satellite imagery to make the final Battle Damage Assessment. In terms of the quantity of missiles, the eight fired by Britain was well behind the US and France. But these strikes were not just a show of force. They were a a show of solidarity with allies trying to make a stand against the use of chemical weapons. Reaction - Western powers strike Syria targets Will Western strikes sway Syria's Assad?

"This video can not be played Missiles are launched from a ship in an unknown location and French Rafale jets take off The justifications put forward by the US, UK and France for the air strikes in Syria have focused on the need to maintain the international prohibition against the use of chemical weapons, to degrade President Assad's chemical weapons arsenal and to deter further chemical attacks against civilians in Syria. Prime Minister Theresa May argued that the UK has always stood up for the defence of global rules and standards in the national interest of the UK and of the organised international community as a whole. However, in its formal legal defence of the operation issued some time later, theUK government rather emphasises the need to protect the population of Syria,externalfrom further harm. Legally, the claim to enforce international law on chemical weapons by violent means would return the world to the era before the advent of the UN Charter. The Charter allows states to use force in self-defence and, arguably, for the protection of populations threatened by extermination at the hands of their own government. The use of force for broader purposes of maintaining international security is also possible. However, such action is subject to the requirement of a mandate from the UN Security Council. This arrangement tries to balance the need of states to preserve their security in the face of an actual or imminent attack through self-defence when strictly necessary with the need to ensure that force cannot be used as a routine tool of international politics. Hence, international law since 1945 precludes military strikes in retaliation - to teach other states a lesson, as it were - or by way of reprisal. Reprisals are acts that are in principle unlawful, but they can be excused because they aim to force a state back into compliance with its international obligations. Hence, in 1981 Israel was condemned by the UN Security Council when it attacked the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq. Israel had argued that it might contribute to the production of weapons of mass destruction in the future. A US attack against an alleged chemical weapons facility in Sudan in 1998 in response to US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania was also criticised. ""Righteous power"" in the words of President Trump - to deter ""the production, spread and use of chemical weapons"" In this instance, the three states mounting the air strikes have taken it upon themselves to force Syria into compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Syria joined the Convention in 2013 as part of the diplomatic settlement that followed the failure of the UK, and the US, to go through with threatened air attacks after gruesome chemical attacks in Eastern Ghouta. The Convention prohibits the production, possession and use of chemical weapons. No fewer than 192 states have signed. Syria was also subjected to additional duties contained in mandatory Security Council resolution 2118, reinforcing these obligations and providing for the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile. In an impressive example of international co-operation, also involving Russia, this was largely achieved a year later, by September 2014. However, since then, there have been some 40 recorded instances of alleged chemical weapons use in Syria. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has the ability to dispatch fact-finding missions to determine whether such weapons have actually been used. A special joint mechanism was set up by the OPCW and the Security Council with a mandate to assign responsibility for such uses. However, after the mechanism pointed the finger at the Assad government last year, Russia vetoed its renewal. UK publishes legal case for Syria strikes An attempt to establish a new mechanism empowered to determine responsibility for the latest use of chemical weapons in Douma failed this week, again due to a Russian veto in the Security Council. Russia's own proposed investigatory mechanism, which was opposed by the Western states and others, would have lacked that power. Supporters of President Assad were defiant after the air strikes The three states intervening in Syria now argue that there was no prospect of obtaining a mandate from the Council to confront chemical weapons use by Syria. In striking Syria, they claim to have fulfilled an international public order function of defending the credibility of the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons in general terms, and enforcing Syria's obligations in particular. Syria air strikes: How world reacted Will Western strikes sway Syria's Assad? This argument is somewhat reminiscent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, supposedly to enforce Baghdad's disarmament obligations imposed by the Security Council in the absence of clear Security Council authorisation. Moreover, in April of last year, President Trump launched 59 cruise missiles against the Syrian air-base at Shayrat. It was claimed that the installation had been involved in a chemical attack in the town of Khan Sheikhun, again to restrain further chemical weapons use. The blockage in the Security Council on Syria opens up some space for this kind of argument. The Chemical Weapons Convention provides for referral of grave instances such as the Douma attack to the Security Council for enforcement action. But the Council could not even agree on a mechanism to establish responsibility, not to speak of more decisive action to repress future uses of such weapons. The claim of the three states involved to act instead of the Council, as the world's enforcement agent of a highly important international rule, is of course being resisted by some. Russia has already asserted that the attacks flagrantly violate the prohibition of the use of force. The UN secretary general has also emphasised the need to respect the primacy of the Security Council. The arrogation of the functions of the Council by a group of states claiming to act in the common interest therefore reflects the reality of the present, little Cold War between Russia and the West. The breakdown of the consensus that facilitates the operation of collective security necessarily results in unilateral acts and, in consequence, further division. In addition to the general interest in maintaining the obligation to refrain from chemical weapons use, Mrs May also referred to the protection of civilians from further chemical attacks to alleviate further humanitarian suffering. This, in fact, is a stronger and more persuasive legal argument in favour of the strikes. In fact, the formal legal argument put forward by the UK government sometime after the prime minister addressed the nation does not rely on the claim to enforce the terms of the chemical weapons convention or of resolution 2118. Theresa May made the humanitarian argument In 2013, when the use of force was expected after the Ghouta attack, the UK already expressly invoked the doctrine of humanitarian intervention. A good argument has been made that states can act in cases of overwhelming humanitarian necessity that cannot be addressed by any other means to protect populations in danger of imminent destruction. The doctrine of forcible humanitarian action gained credence throughout the 1990s when it was applied to rescue the Kurds of northern Iraq and the Marsh Arabs in the south of Iraq from destruction by Saddam Hussein. It was later employed unopposed in cases including Liberia and Sierra Leone. However, international division about its application emerged in the wake of the operation on behalf of the Kosovo Albanians of 1999. Since then, the UN has embraced the concept that international action can be taken to rescue a population under immediate threat. However, the doctrine of responsibility to protect (R2P) was narrowed down to cover operations mandated by the Security Council. Still, a number of states claim a right to act when the Council cannot. Innocent civilians at risk of destruction should not pay the price for a political blockage at UN headquarters in New York. Others, including Russia and China, oppose humanitarian intervention. The application of this doctrine is not restricted to uses of chemical weapons against civilian populations. However, given the uncontrollable and indiscriminate effect of chemical weapons, their use against civilians offers perhaps the clearest trigger for the application of this doctrine. PM has chosen which way to jump on Syria Syria 'chemical attack': What we know In this instance, the UK points to the history of repeated uses of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, adding that it is ""highly likely"" that further such attacks would follow. Given the failure of previous attempts to rein in this practice, and the present blockage in the Security Council, it is argued that no means other than the use of force were available to secure the humanitarian objective of the operation. Moreover, it is asserted the force used was strictly limited and specifically targeted at objects connected with the objective of degrading the capacity to launch future chemical attacks and deterring such attacks in the future. These arguments conform to the legal requirements for humanitarian intervention. It could also be argued that the attacks aim to preserve the national security of the states involved in the attacks, by way of an extensive right to self-defence. Diluting the protection stemming from the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons in recent practice posed a threat to all states. Of course, every state may defend itself, under some circumstances even before an armed attack aimed at it has landed on its territory. But the attack must be imminent, leaving no choice of means and the response must be proportionate to the attack. In the run-up to the Iraq war of 2003, there was the famous 45-minute claim concerning Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction. Laying the ground for an argument of anticipatory self-defence against a strike that might come in the future, the UK argued that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction might reach UK military bases in Cyprus with minimum warning. But  there was no evidence that Baghdad was contemplating such an attack and the argument was abandoned. Similarly, there is no suggestion in this instance that Syria was preparing to launch an attack against the US, UK or France.

"The US leader has all but admitted the broader Syrian war is not a US interest Former US Assistant Secretary of State P.J Crowley says President Trump will be content to count the strikes as a victory and move on, but it's unclear if Syria, Russia and Iran will let him: As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump pledged: ""If I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me."" A year ago, as president, Mr Trump ordered a military strike involving 58 cruise missiles in response to a deadly sarin gas attack on civilians, and he essentially redeemed the red line that his predecessor, Barack Obama, drew in 2013. While Mr Trump received plaudits for his willingness to employ military force, if he expected that show of force to deter the further use of chemical weapons by Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in this brutal civil war, he was wrong. Follow live: Western powers strike Syria targets Four RAF fighters join Syria air strikes Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Secretary of Defence James Mattis acknowledged as much Friday night, that despite last year's strike Syria has continued to employ chemical weapons, most recently against an opposition stronghold outside Damascus. Mr Assad, he said, ""did not get the message last year"". So Mr Trump, together with British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron, launched coordinated military strikes against Syria's chemical weapons infrastructure, including a research centre, storage facility and command post. There is a new red line, but what is the message behind it? What are the odds that Syria, and its key international backers Russia and Iran, will heed it? And what are the consequences if they don't? This video can not be played Moment cruise missiles were launched from a French naval ship Mr Trump, Mrs May and Mr Macron have actually drawn a sharper red line than Mr Obama did â no further use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war, including chlorine barrel bombs that Syria has used routinely over seven years. While the latest strikes were described as a ""one-time shot,"" Mr Trump threatened to take further military action should Syria use chemical weapons in the future. ""We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents,"" Mr Trump said. Mr Trump was surprisingly understated Friday night in his comments regarding Russia and Iran. In the immediate aftermath of the Syrian chemical attack, Mr Trump promised that not just Syria, but Russia and Iran as well would ""pay a price"" for again violating international norms. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack If so, it will be through a different means. Friday's strikes targeted Syria's chemical weapons capability, but were specifically designed to avoid Russian and Iranian forces, avoiding the risk of an unwanted confrontation and possible escalation. Instead, he called on both Russia and Iran to re-evaluate their support for Assad, saying that nations are ""judged by the friends they keep."" PM has chosen which way to jump on Syria What can Western military intervention achieve? Were the Syria air strikes legal? While Mr Trump directly criticized Russia for failing to guarantee the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons as it promised in 2013, he incongruously suggested that the door was still open to better relations, even with Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and its recent use of a nerve agent against a former intelligence operative in London. ""Hopefully, someday we'll get along with Russia and maybe even Iran, but maybe not,"" he said. There is little prospect of cooperation regarding Syria because the two sides continue to wage different wars there. Both Russia's Putin (L) and Iran's Rouhani view Syria as a vital interest Both Russia and Iran consider Syria, and at least for now Mr Assad's survival, as a vital interest. Mr Assad's position has strengthened considerably in the year between Mr Trump's military strikes. Friday night's military action was designed to thread a pretty narrow needle - place boundaries around the war Syria, Russia and Iran are waging - without becoming a direct combatant in it. The US and its European partners have a narrower military interest in Syria - the defeat of the Islamic State caliphate, a task that is nearing completion. Just two weeks ago, Mr Trump stated his intention to bring home the roughly 2,000 US personnel deployed to Syria as quickly as possible, only to confront the chemical attack on Douma. Mr Trump said it was not up to the US to fix the Middle East Even with the new red line - Trump did declare the deterrence of the use of chemical weapons to be a ""vital national security interest of the United States"" - he all but admitted that the broader Syrian civil war was not. He described the Middle East as a ""troubled place"" and reiterated it was not the role of the US to fix it. ""We cannot purge the world of evil or act everywhere there is tyranny,"" he said, adding: ""The fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people."" Will Western strikes sway Syria's Assad? Mr Trump will be content to count this as a victory and move on - he has already declared ""Mission Accomplished!"" in a follow-up tweet - but that depends on Syria, Russia and Iran and whether they get the message this time. Of course, the last time an American president employed those words, it represented a serious misreading of the challenge he confronted. But Syria isn't Iraq. It's actually much more complicated.

"One of the sites hit, in Barzeh, Damascus, was practically destroyed The US, UK and France say their air forces and navies fired 105 missiles, targeting three key sites in Syria. US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said the allies had taken ""decisive action"",externalagainst the Syrian government's ""chemical weapons infrastructure"". The strikes took place at about 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on 14 April, a week after a suspected chemical attack on the then-rebel-held town of Douma, which opposition activists, medics and rescue workers say killed more than 40 people. President Bashar al-Assad's government has denied ever using chemical weapons, and its key ally Russia says it has evidence the Douma incident was ""staged"". The Syrian government insists its entire chemical arsenal was destroyed under a deal signed after an attack in 2013 that involved the nerve agent Sarin. However, experts from the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have ascribed four chemical attacks to the government since then, including a 2017 Sarin attack on rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun. The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, said the missiles had hit and destroyed three targets ""specifically associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme"". Barzeh scientific research centre The branch of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC) in the capital's northern Barzeh district was a ""centre for the research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological warfare technology"", Gen Dunford said. Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie, director of the US military's Joint Staff, said the US fired 76 missiles at the facility,external- 57 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 19 joint air-to-surface stand-off missiles. ""Initial assessments are that this target was destroyed. This is going to set the Syrian chemical weapons programme back for years,"" he said. A man identified by CBS News as a scientist who worked there for 38 years said it was ""totally incorrect"" that chemical weapons were being developed at the site. The Syrian state news agency reported that several missiles hit the SSRC facility, ""destroying a building that included scientific laboratories and a training centre"". This video can not be played ""Rumbling like thunder"": A CBS reporter in Damascus witnessed the start of the strikes The SSRC is a government agency that is officially tasked with advancing and co-ordinating scientific activities in Syria. However, a Western intelligence agency told the BBC in May 2017 that the SSRC branch in Barzeh - along with two others in nearby Dummar (Jamraya) and in Masyaf, in Hama province - were beingused to produce chemical and biological munitionsin violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Despite the allegations, the OPCW subsequently reported that it had carried out two inspections of Barzeh and Dummar facilities - which is also known as Jamraya - inFebruary,externalandNovember 2017,externaland not observed ""any activities inconsistent with obligations under the CWC"". Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage site, west of Homs Gen Dunford said the US believed the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage site was ""the primary location of Syrian Sarin and precursor production equipment"". Gen McKenzie said 24 missiles hit the facility - nine US Tomahawk missiles, eight British Storm Shadow missiles, and 5 naval cruise missiles and 2 SCALP cruise missiles launched by France. The UK Ministry of Defence said Royal Air Force Tornado GR4s had launched eight Storm Shadow missiles at a military facility in the same location,external- a former missile base some 25km (15 miles) west of the city of Homs. The facility was used to ""keep chemical weapon precursors stockpiled in breach of Syria's obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention"". Precursor chemicals are generally dual-use chemicals that can be combined to produce blister agents like sulphur mustard or nerve agents like Sarin. ""Very careful scientific analysis was applied to determine where best to target the Storm Shadows to maximise the destruction of the stockpiled chemicals and to minimise any risks of contamination to the surrounding area,"" the MoD added. Syria's state news agency reported that missiles had targeted a military position in Homs province, but that they had been ""thwarted and diverted from their path"". Three civilians were injured, it said, without providing any further details. Him Shinshar chemical weapons bunker Gen Dunford said the facility, about 7km from the storage site, ""contained both a chemical weapons equipment storage facility and an important command post"". Gen McKenzie said seven French SCALP missiles were deployed and that the bunker facility was ""successfully hit"". This video can not be played Gen Kenneth McKenzie describes the strikes Gen McKenzie said initial indications were that the objectives were ""accomplished without material interference from Syria"". ""We are confident that all of our missiles reached their targets. At the end of the strike mission, all of our aircraft safely returned to their bases."" The general said the US military assessed that more than 40 surface-to-air missiles were launched by Syrian government forces. ""Most of these launches occurred after the last impact of our strike was over,"" he noted, adding that it was likely most of the missiles were fired without guidance. Although he was confident the strikes ""took the heart out of"" the Syrian government's alleged chemical weapons capability, Gen McKenzie said he could not rule out that such weapons might be used again. ""There's still a residual element of the Syrian programme that's out there,"" he said. ""I'm not going to say that they're going to be unable to continue to conduct a chemical attack in the future. I suspect, however, they'll think long and hard about it."" Russian military spokesman Colonel-General Sergei Rudskoi told reporters in Moscow that ""a number of Syrian military airfields, industrial and research facilities"" were targeted by US, British and French missile strikes. He said preliminary reports suggested 103 cruise missiles were launched,external. Syria's mostly Soviet-era air defence systems had ""successfully countered the air and naval strikes"", intercepting 71 of the cruise missiles, Gen Rudskoi added. He cited Russian military data as showing: Four missiles targetedDamascus International Airport,external 12 targeted theDumayr airbase,external, east of Damascus, but all were shot down 18 targeted theMarj Ruhayil (Bulay) airbase,external, south of the capital 12 targeted theShayrat airbase,external, but all were shot down Five out of the nine that targeted theMezzeh military airport,externalwere shot down Thirteen of the 16 that targeted ""Homs aerodrome"" were shot down Thirty targeted facilities related to Syria's alleged chemical weapons programme inBarzeh,externalandJaramana,external, a south-eastern district of Damascus. Seven missiles were shot down. The facilities were partially destroyed, but had not been used for a long time, according to Gen Rudskoi ""Russia considers the strike to be a response to the success of the Syrian armed forces in fighting international terrorism and liberating its territory, rather than a response to the alleged chemical attack,"" Gen Rudskoi said.

"This was a heavier strike than a year ago - three targets rather than one. Then, the US acted alone; this time it was joined by its French and British allies. More than double the number of weapons were fired against Syrian targets than last year - a little more than 120 in all. But the fundamental question remains the same. Was this enough to achieve what the Americans say was their goal - to deter President Bashar al-Assad from using chemical weapons again? US and allies launch strikes on Syria Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Since April a year ago Syria's torment has not ended. But two fundamental things have changed. Firstly, the Assad regime has effectively won its war and terrorising civilians has played a key part in its strategy. President Assad may not control all of Syrian territory. But backed by Russia and Iran, there is nobody that can really stand against him. It is shortages of manpower, equipment and capacity that prevent him re-establishing wider control. Syrians wave Iranian, Russian and Syrian flags after the western strikes Secondly, relations between Washington and Moscow - and between Russia and the West more generally - have deteriorated significantly, to the extent that senior international officials are now talking of a new Cold War. This was the context in which President Trump determined to send his punitive message to the Assad regime. And this is the context in which they will have received it. Will they be cowed or defiant? Will public bluster conceal a more fundamental re-think on the part of Mr Assad? Might Russia, whatever its spokesmen say, have a stern word with the Syrian leader? And if they did, would it have any effect? Syria war: Fall of Eastern Ghouta pivotal moment for Assad Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? Watching this crisis unfold from the United States, I found it both perplexing and in many ways worrying. There seemed to be a lack of focus and clarity on the part of the Trump administration. Hardly surprising, perhaps, when the president himself was increasingly bogged down in his own domestic difficulties as allegations and recriminations about alleged past affairs and misbehaviour returned to haunt him. President Trump is dealing with multiple domestic issues At times he seemed more likely to strike out at the US justice system than at President Assad. Indeed over the past week, while much of the rest of the world worried about what Mr Trump might do about Syria, the media here has been dominated, absorbed and fascinated, in equal measure, by Mr Trump's difficulties almost to the exclusion of all else. President Trump's rhetoric suggested a major military strike against the Assad regime. In the event what has taken place falls far short of that. So what conclusion might Moscow and Damascus draw? Trump lawyer under criminal investigation Six claims about Trump in Comey book The president and the porn star: Why this matters The Pentagon seems to have gone out of its way to avoid both civilian and ""foreign"" casualties - for that read ""Russians"". The three targets hit were chosen both for their central role in the chemical weapons programme but also because the risk of collateral damage was smallest. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff noted at a subsequent briefing that the US had a list of other targets which it did not choose to strike this time. The clear message is that if the Assad regime resorts to chemical weapons again then more strikes will follow. But again, since last April there have been a number of other alleged chemical weapons attacks, generally using chlorine gas. But until now the US did not strike again. So what message did this send? An explosion seen in the night sky over Damascus Now the hope is that Mr Assad will change his behaviour. But what about the wider Syrian conflict? This brutal war shows no sign of ending. Many have pointed out that it is barrel bombs, artillery and bullets that are responsible for the overwhelming bulk of the deaths and mutilations in Syria, not chemical weapons, and yet it is these that prompt Western action. There is a good measure of truth in this sentiment, though for historical and cultural reasons chemical weapons have a particular horror in the West in the wake of their use in World War One. The treaty banning them is an important  disarmament agreement and its weakening threatens to unwind years of progress. But the wider question is to what extent these latest strikes change the picture in Syria? Do they bring the conflict any closer to an end? Sadly the answer is almost certainly no. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis briefed the media after the strikes took place Only a short while ago - much to his generals' horror - Mr Trump spoke about pulling all US troops out of Syria. Only days later he seemed to be threatening a major military intervention. There has been no consistency in the Trump administration's position. There is simply no clear strategy to help bring the war to an end. Indeed one of the arguments for keeping US troops in Syria to bolster their local allies like the Kurds, was in fact to keep the Assad regime and its Iranian backers off-balance. Constraining Iran is about the only unifying theme in the Trump administration's approach, but even this has not been raised to the level of a coherent strategy. In his statement after the strikes the President again asserted that the US was not seeking an indefinite presence in Syria. His hope was clearly that as others shouldered the burden (who?) the US might walk away. But this was followed by a catch-all statement about the intractability of the region and its problems, which hardly suggests a desire for a long-term engagement. If these are the signals coming from Washington, then why should Russia worry? It has, through its military, and political support for the Assad regime, re-established itself as a significant diplomatic actor in the region. Russia, of course warned the US and its allies not to strike Syria. So in the wake of this attack what might Russia do? In Syria itself, it might seek to further undermine Washington's already weak position but it is not going to war with the Americans - such fears, barring some extraordinary disaster, were always, probably, far-fetched. US Defence Secretary James Mattis has already hinted at Russia's likely response noting that ""we fully expect a significant disinformation campaign over the coming days by those who have aligned themselves with the Assad regime"". Indeed this campaign has in many ways already begun, with the Russians - who now have forces in the area where the recent chemical attack is alleged to have occurred - insisting first that there was no sign of a chemical attack and then, more recently, that the whole thing was staged by foreign agents to discredit Mr Assad and Moscow. Russia's President Putin was recently returned in a presidential election This is the same Russia that is accepted by most Western governments to have been behind the attempted assassination of a former Russian intelligence officer and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury, using a nerve agent. It is the same Russia that has tried to influence the US and other recent elections. It is President Putin's Russia that has seized part of Ukraine. One could go on. The misinformation battle has already been joined. There is indeed a new sort of Cold War developing. It may not risk nuclear annihilation, but because of that it is in many ways more direct and unpredictable, with Moscow taking much greater risks than it might have done in the past. Russia is not a global superpower like the Soviet Union. It no longer has an ideology that gathers support from liberation movements around the world. It is fundamentally a middle-ranking regional power with a significant nuclear arsenal and a relatively weak economy. But it knows how to wield influence and how to conduct information warfare. And Mr Putin is determined to defend Russia's interests - as he sees them - wherever he is able. A missile destined for Syria is launched from a French vessel in the Mediterranean Mostly this means in Russia's near-abroad, that is countries close to its borders that have been traditional Russian spheres of interest - such as Georgia or Ukraine. Syria is almost an honorary member of the near-abroad, affording Russia an entry point to regain its influence in a region that still matters. Russia's star is rising and Washington's influence is in many ways on the wane. And this matters. For instability in the region is growing. The ripples from a previous US administration's decision to remove Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq are still spreading. Iran was the principal benefactor of that decision. It has become a formidable regional player. Its growing influence in Syria risks a major conflict with Israel. Recently, Israel is believed to have struck at a Syrian base which was home to an Iranian facility. Tensions are rising. The region's many fault-lines risk merging. And the US, British and French attacks over-night have inevitably thrown another pebble into the pool. Russia v the West: Is this a new Cold War?

"Medical and rescue organisations say most of the victims were children and women Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed on 7 April in a suspected chemical attack on Douma, which was the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) says initial tests on samples from two sites detected ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"", along with explosive residues. However, no nerve agents were detected. The Syrian government denies ever using chemical weapons, and its ally Russia says it has evidence that the incident was staged with the help of the UK. In February, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad launched an assault on the Eastern Ghouta that reportedly left more than 1,700 civilians dead. In March, troops split the region into three pockets - the largest of which was around Douma, home to between 80,000 and 150,000 people. Facing defeat, rebel groups in the other two pockets agreed to be evacuated to northern Syria. But the group controlling Douma, Jaysh al-Islam, continued to hold out. On 6 April, after negotiations with the government stalled, air strikes resumed. The bombardment continued for a second day, with dozens of people reportedly killed or injured by conventional munitions before the suspected chemical attack. Activists from the Violations Documentation Center (VDC), which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, reportedtwo separate incidents of bombs believed to contain toxic substances being dropped by the Syrian Air Force,external. The first occurred at approximately 16:00 (13:00 GMT) and saw the Saada bakery on Omar Ibn Al-Khattab street in north-western Douma targeted, the VDC said. Activists say Douma came under intense aerial bombardment on Saturday It cited a member of the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets, as saying he smelt chlorine in the air after the strike, but that he could not determine its source. The VDC said the second incident took place not far to the east, near Martyrs' Square, at approximately 19:30. At 19:45, more than 500 patients - most of them women and children - were brought to medical facilities with symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,external, according to the Syria Civil Defence and the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which supports hospitals in rebel-held areas. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The patients showed signs of ""respiratory distress, central cyanosis [blue skin or lips], excessive oral foaming, corneal burns, and the emission of chlorine-like odour"", a joint statement issued on Sunday said. One woman who died had convulsions and pinpoint pupils. Rescue workers searching homes in the affected area also found the bodies of people with oral foaming, cyanosis, and corneal burns, the statement added. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which supports hospitals in rebel-held Syria, also saidit received reports of two incidents,external. Patients were hosed down with water to remove any chemicals on their skin People were treated for breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes following the first, the UOSSM said. After the second, patients were brought to hospital smelling strongly of a chlorine-like substance and presenting symptoms that included cyanosis, foaming of the mouth, and cornea irritation, it added. A medical student working at a hospital told the BBC he had treated a man who died,external. ""His pupils were dilated and he had foam in his mouth. His heart was very slow. Then he coughed blood into his mouth as well,"" he said. Two videos circulated by the opposition activist group Douma Revolution showed what it said werethe bodies of children, women and men found in one block of flats,external, which is believed to be located south-west of Martyrs' Square. Some had foam coming out of their mouths and noses. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Activists also posted avideo which they said showed a yellow industrial gas cylinder on the balcony of the same block of flats,external. One end of the cylinder was lying in a crater-like opening in the reinforced concrete floor. A second gas cylinder was filmed on the bed of a top-floor flat,externalto the south-west, below a crater-like opening in the concrete roof. The World Health Organization said on 11 April that it had received reports from its local ""health cluster partners"" of43 deaths related to symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals"",external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said rescue workers found 42 people dead in their homes. One person was declared dead on arrival at a hospital, and another six died while receiving treatment, they added. An earlier, now deleted tweet by the Syria Civil Defence put the number dead at more than 150. The UOSSM initially reported that 70 people were confirmed dead. On 9 April,it revised down the figure to at least 42,external. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said air strikes on 6 and 7 April killed almost 100 people. It said they included 21 who died as a result of suffocation, but that it was unable to identify the cause. The British investigative journalism website, Bellingcat, said it had counted at least 34 bodies,externalin the two videos circulated by Douma Revolution. Bellingcat also assessed that the block of flats near Martyrs' Square where the bodies were filmed wasvisited by Russian military personnel on 9 April,external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said the day after the incident that they believed those who died suffocated as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals, most likely an organophosphate - a compound grouping associated with pesticides and nerve agents, such as Sarin. The UOSSM also concluded that the symptoms of the casualties were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent, possibly one mixed with chlorine. On 13 April, the US said itassessed ""with confidence that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons"",external. The conclusion was ""based on descriptions of the attack in multiple media sources, the reported symptoms experienced by victims, videos and images showing two assessed barrel bombs from the attack, and reliable information indicating co-ordination between Syrian military officials before the attack"". It added: ""A significant body of information points to the regime using chlorine in its bombardment of Douma, while some additional information points to the regime also using the nerve agent Sarin."" A fact-finding team from the OPCW has travelled to Damascus to investigate the allegations The OPCW, which oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention, dispatched experts from its Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) to Damascus five days after the attack. But they were unable to visit any of the sites of interest until 21 April because of an attack on a UN security team conducting a reconnaissance mission. The FFM team interviewed witnesses and collected environmental samples and data from three locations:the hospital where victims were allegedly treated for chemical exposure,external;the block of flats with the cylinder on the balcony,external(referred to as ""Location 2"");the flat with the cylinder on the bed,external(""Location 4""). The team also gathered or received samples and interviewed witnesses, including alleged casualties, in a neighbouring country. On 6 July, a preliminary report issued by the OPCW said ""no organophosphorus nerve agents or their degradation products were detected,external, either in the environmental samples or in plasma samples from the alleged casualties"".  However, it added, ""various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from Locations 2 and 4, along with residues of explosive"". The OPCW said the FFM team was now working to establish the significance of the results. It is also assessing the association of the two gas cylinders with the incident, the relative damage to the cylinders and the roofs, and how the cylinders arrived at their respective locations. The chlorinated compounds included those used to treat drinking water, as a disinfectant, a wood preservative, or a flame retardant. However, the same compounds were detected at other sites in Syria where the OPCW has concluded that chlorine was likely used as a weapon, includingSaraqeb,externalandLatamina,external. President Assad has accused the US, UK and France of ""staging"" the incident in Douma,externalwith the help of the Syria Civil Defence, which receives funding from Western governments. ""It was a lie. After we liberated that area our information confirmed the attack did not take place,"" he told the Daily Mail on 9 June. ""The British government should prove with evidence that the attack happened, and then they should prove who is responsible. This did not happen."" Syrian government ground forces advanced towards Douma on Saturday Russian permanent representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on 9 April thatRussian military specialists had visited Douma and taken soil samples that showed no presence of nerve agents or substances containing chlorine,external. He also said no-one with symptoms of exposure to sarin or chlorine had been admitted to Douma's hospital, nor any bodies found. Four days later, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had ""irrefutable evidence that this was yet another attack, staged with the participation of special services of one state that is striving to be at the forefront of the Russophobic campaign"". This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media A British diplomat called the allegation ""bizarre"" and a ""blatant lie"". On 26 April, Russian and Syrian diplomats presented to a briefing at the OPCW's headquarters in The Hague more than a dozen people from Douma who said they had not seen any evidence of chemical weapons being used there. They included Hasan Diab,an 11-year-old boy who was seen being doused in water,externalin a video widely circulated online after the alleged attack. ""We heard cries on the street that we should go to the hospital. We got scared. We went to the hospital through the tunnel,""he told reporters,external. ""They started pouring water on me at the hospital. I don't know why."" Hasan Diab, 11, appeared at a briefing organised by Russian and Syrian diplomats in The Hague Western nations dismissed the event as ""nothing more than a crude propaganda exercise"",externaland an ""obscene masquerade"". The US said it had no information to suggest Jaysh al-Islam had ever used chemical weapons,external, and that it was unlikely that the opposition could have fabricated the number of reports that came from Douma on 7 April and ""deceived multiple media outlets while evading our detection"". United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was outraged by the reports from Douma,externaland warned that ""any confirmed use of chemical weapons, by any party to the conflict and under any circumstances, is abhorrent and a clear violation of international law"". Hours before the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission team arrived in Damascus on 14 April, the US, UK and France carried out missile strikes on three sites they said were ""specifically associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme"". This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded The US military said warships and jets launched 105 missiles,externalthat hit a branch of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC) in the capital's Barzeh district, the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility west of the city of Homs, and a nearby chemical weapons bunker. US President Donald Trump said he wanted ""to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons"",external. The Syrian foreign ministry denounced ""the barbaric aggression"". In August 2013, rockets containing Sarin were fired at several opposition-held suburbs in the Eastern and Western Ghouta, killing hundreds of people.UN experts confirmed that Sarin was used in the attack,external, but they were not asked to ascribe any blame. Western powers said only Syrian government forces could have carried out the attack. President Assad denied the allegation, but he did agree to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal. Experts from a joint UN-OPCW mission also said they were confident that government forces used Sarin in an attack in April 2017 on the rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun,external, which reportedly killed more than 80 people. President Assad dismissed the attack as a fabrication, but the US carried a cruise missile strike on a Syrian airbase in retaliation. The UN-OPCW mission also found that government forces used chlorine as a weapon on at least three occasions during the civil war.

"This video can not be played Missiles are launched from a ship in an unknown location and French Rafale jets take off The justifications put forward by the US, UK and France for the air strikes in Syria have focused on the need to maintain the international prohibition against the use of chemical weapons, to degrade President Assad's chemical weapons arsenal and to deter further chemical attacks against civilians in Syria. Prime Minister Theresa May argued that the UK has always stood up for the defence of global rules and standards in the national interest of the UK and of the organised international community as a whole. However, in its formal legal defence of the operation issued some time later, theUK government rather emphasises the need to protect the population of Syria,externalfrom further harm. Legally, the claim to enforce international law on chemical weapons by violent means would return the world to the era before the advent of the UN Charter. The Charter allows states to use force in self-defence and, arguably, for the protection of populations threatened by extermination at the hands of their own government. The use of force for broader purposes of maintaining international security is also possible. However, such action is subject to the requirement of a mandate from the UN Security Council. This arrangement tries to balance the need of states to preserve their security in the face of an actual or imminent attack through self-defence when strictly necessary with the need to ensure that force cannot be used as a routine tool of international politics. Hence, international law since 1945 precludes military strikes in retaliation - to teach other states a lesson, as it were - or by way of reprisal. Reprisals are acts that are in principle unlawful, but they can be excused because they aim to force a state back into compliance with its international obligations. Hence, in 1981 Israel was condemned by the UN Security Council when it attacked the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq. Israel had argued that it might contribute to the production of weapons of mass destruction in the future. A US attack against an alleged chemical weapons facility in Sudan in 1998 in response to US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania was also criticised. ""Righteous power"" in the words of President Trump - to deter ""the production, spread and use of chemical weapons"" In this instance, the three states mounting the air strikes have taken it upon themselves to force Syria into compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Syria joined the Convention in 2013 as part of the diplomatic settlement that followed the failure of the UK, and the US, to go through with threatened air attacks after gruesome chemical attacks in Eastern Ghouta. The Convention prohibits the production, possession and use of chemical weapons. No fewer than 192 states have signed. Syria was also subjected to additional duties contained in mandatory Security Council resolution 2118, reinforcing these obligations and providing for the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile. In an impressive example of international co-operation, also involving Russia, this was largely achieved a year later, by September 2014. However, since then, there have been some 40 recorded instances of alleged chemical weapons use in Syria. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has the ability to dispatch fact-finding missions to determine whether such weapons have actually been used. A special joint mechanism was set up by the OPCW and the Security Council with a mandate to assign responsibility for such uses. However, after the mechanism pointed the finger at the Assad government last year, Russia vetoed its renewal. UK publishes legal case for Syria strikes An attempt to establish a new mechanism empowered to determine responsibility for the latest use of chemical weapons in Douma failed this week, again due to a Russian veto in the Security Council. Russia's own proposed investigatory mechanism, which was opposed by the Western states and others, would have lacked that power. Supporters of President Assad were defiant after the air strikes The three states intervening in Syria now argue that there was no prospect of obtaining a mandate from the Council to confront chemical weapons use by Syria. In striking Syria, they claim to have fulfilled an international public order function of defending the credibility of the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons in general terms, and enforcing Syria's obligations in particular. Syria air strikes: How world reacted Will Western strikes sway Syria's Assad? This argument is somewhat reminiscent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, supposedly to enforce Baghdad's disarmament obligations imposed by the Security Council in the absence of clear Security Council authorisation. Moreover, in April of last year, President Trump launched 59 cruise missiles against the Syrian air-base at Shayrat. It was claimed that the installation had been involved in a chemical attack in the town of Khan Sheikhun, again to restrain further chemical weapons use. The blockage in the Security Council on Syria opens up some space for this kind of argument. The Chemical Weapons Convention provides for referral of grave instances such as the Douma attack to the Security Council for enforcement action. But the Council could not even agree on a mechanism to establish responsibility, not to speak of more decisive action to repress future uses of such weapons. The claim of the three states involved to act instead of the Council, as the world's enforcement agent of a highly important international rule, is of course being resisted by some. Russia has already asserted that the attacks flagrantly violate the prohibition of the use of force. The UN secretary general has also emphasised the need to respect the primacy of the Security Council. The arrogation of the functions of the Council by a group of states claiming to act in the common interest therefore reflects the reality of the present, little Cold War between Russia and the West. The breakdown of the consensus that facilitates the operation of collective security necessarily results in unilateral acts and, in consequence, further division. In addition to the general interest in maintaining the obligation to refrain from chemical weapons use, Mrs May also referred to the protection of civilians from further chemical attacks to alleviate further humanitarian suffering. This, in fact, is a stronger and more persuasive legal argument in favour of the strikes. In fact, the formal legal argument put forward by the UK government sometime after the prime minister addressed the nation does not rely on the claim to enforce the terms of the chemical weapons convention or of resolution 2118. Theresa May made the humanitarian argument In 2013, when the use of force was expected after the Ghouta attack, the UK already expressly invoked the doctrine of humanitarian intervention. A good argument has been made that states can act in cases of overwhelming humanitarian necessity that cannot be addressed by any other means to protect populations in danger of imminent destruction. The doctrine of forcible humanitarian action gained credence throughout the 1990s when it was applied to rescue the Kurds of northern Iraq and the Marsh Arabs in the south of Iraq from destruction by Saddam Hussein. It was later employed unopposed in cases including Liberia and Sierra Leone. However, international division about its application emerged in the wake of the operation on behalf of the Kosovo Albanians of 1999. Since then, the UN has embraced the concept that international action can be taken to rescue a population under immediate threat. However, the doctrine of responsibility to protect (R2P) was narrowed down to cover operations mandated by the Security Council. Still, a number of states claim a right to act when the Council cannot. Innocent civilians at risk of destruction should not pay the price for a political blockage at UN headquarters in New York. Others, including Russia and China, oppose humanitarian intervention. The application of this doctrine is not restricted to uses of chemical weapons against civilian populations. However, given the uncontrollable and indiscriminate effect of chemical weapons, their use against civilians offers perhaps the clearest trigger for the application of this doctrine. PM has chosen which way to jump on Syria Syria 'chemical attack': What we know In this instance, the UK points to the history of repeated uses of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, adding that it is ""highly likely"" that further such attacks would follow. Given the failure of previous attempts to rein in this practice, and the present blockage in the Security Council, it is argued that no means other than the use of force were available to secure the humanitarian objective of the operation. Moreover, it is asserted the force used was strictly limited and specifically targeted at objects connected with the objective of degrading the capacity to launch future chemical attacks and deterring such attacks in the future. These arguments conform to the legal requirements for humanitarian intervention. It could also be argued that the attacks aim to preserve the national security of the states involved in the attacks, by way of an extensive right to self-defence. Diluting the protection stemming from the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons in recent practice posed a threat to all states. Of course, every state may defend itself, under some circumstances even before an armed attack aimed at it has landed on its territory. But the attack must be imminent, leaving no choice of means and the response must be proportionate to the attack. In the run-up to the Iraq war of 2003, there was the famous 45-minute claim concerning Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction. Laying the ground for an argument of anticipatory self-defence against a strike that might come in the future, the UK argued that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction might reach UK military bases in Cyprus with minimum warning. But  there was no evidence that Baghdad was contemplating such an attack and the argument was abandoned. Similarly, there is no suggestion in this instance that Syria was preparing to launch an attack against the US, UK or France.

"Campaigners said 4x4s and motorbikes were damaging the area near Little Langdale The authority running the Lake District National Park has been accused of ""violating its World Heritage status"". Campaigners say a ""massive increase"" in motorbikes and 4x4 vehicles has ""profoundly changed the landscape"". They have accused the Lake District National Park Authority (LDNPA) of neglecting the fells and promoting the use of tracks by off-roaders. The LDNPA said it would be ""preferable if people did not take vehicles on these routes"" but it was legal. Head of park management Mark Eccles said: ""All unsealed routes with public vehicular access rights, including the ones in the Little Langdale, Oxen Fell and Tilberthwaite area, are subject to the same laws as surfaced [tarmac] roads. ""We encourage users to behave responsibly on what can be vulnerable tracks to minimise environmental impact and respect other users."" The Lake District National Park Authority said the tracks were subject to the same laws as surfaced roads Save The Lake District campaigners say the LDNPA has a statutory duty under the Environment Act 1995 to give greater weight to conservation in any conflict between it and recreational interests. They are asking Unesco, which oversees the World Heritage status designation, to force the LDNPA to use its traffic regulation powers to keep off-roaders off unsurfaced tracks. A petition demanding a ban has been signed by more than 4,300 people. Although traffic regulation orders ""cannot be ruled out"", using them was a last resort and the authority had ""no immediate plans"" to do so, Mr Eccles said.

The review found Mr McCabe, 50, authorised his aides to disclose internal FBI and justice department information about a Clinton Foundation investigation to a Wall Street Journal reporter in October 2016. He previously told investigators as well as his former boss, then FBI director James Comey, he did not authorise the leak and ""did not know who did"", according to the report. Mr McCabe, who argued he was being targeted because of his involvement in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, released a statement on Friday saying he was authorised to share information and did not intentionally mislead anyone. FBI's Andrew McCabe sacked days before retirement The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? ""Mr McCabe had no motive to lie or mislead about media contacts he had the authority to direct, nor did he make any effort to co-ordinate accounts of the events in question with the two other FBI employees with whom he worked on trying to correct a potentially false narrative,"" his lawyer Michael Bromwich said in a statement. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited the report when he fired Mr McCabe in March The report also argued he was not authorised to leak those details because it did not meet the ""public interest"" exception for disclosing ongoing investigations. Instead, the disclosure was made ""in a manner designed to advance his personal interests at the expense of department leadership"", it said. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump and the White House are trying to use the McCabe report to damage James Comey and paint the two as ""peas in a pod"", in the words of press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The document itself, however, tells a different story. One of the key points of the inspector general's findings was that Mr McCabe lacked ""candour"" in his discussions with the then-FBI director about his involvement in contacts with the Wall Street Journal. It was Mr McCabe's word against Mr Comey's, and the inspector general sided with the latter. Throughout the report, Mr Comey comes across as exceedingly cautious. He admonished his subordinates over the leaks about Clinton-related investigations that were bedevilling the bureau. He made Mr McCabe, who was the subject of allegations of political bias due to his wife's Democratic Party ties, distance himself from the Clinton email probe. That may not matter to Mr Trump, who sees the executive offices of the FBI as a ""den of thieves and lowlifes"" akin to a law-enforcement version of the fictional Star Wars' Mos Eisley cantina. But if Mr Trump thinks the former director is a lying, leaking ""slime ball"", a closer reading of the report does little to back that up. Mr McCabe, a 20-year veteran at the law enforcement agency, was fired in March two days before he became eligible to retire with a full government pension. FBI disciplinary officials recommended Mr McCabe's dismissal based on the report's findings. But Mr McCabe has disputed the review, contending that when he believed the inspector general misunderstood him, he again went to him to try and correct his answers. Mr McCabe's lawyer said in a statement his client was unfairly treated and the inspector general rushed to finish the report before he could retire.

"Publishers are being challenged to 'set up outside of London' A group of independent fiction publishers from across northern England has called on the book industry to be less ""London-centric"". The Northern Fiction Alliance (NFA) saidin an open letter,externalbig publishers should ""set up outside of London"". Publishers need to ""better reflect its readers and society"", it said. Penguin Random House UK said: ""In the past few years we have put a number of different schemes and initiatives in place to reduce barriers to entry."" The NFA said the industry should be ""diversifying our workforces and, perhaps more importantly, dispersing across the UK in order to better engage with and embolden a new generation of writers, readers and aspiring publishers"". London-based Penguin Random House said it had removed the need for a university degree from all jobs, introduced paid work-experience and held careers talks across the country. The company's WriteNow scheme finds talented new writers from under-represented communities and is mentoring 23 writers ""61% of whom are based outside London and we have already offered five of these writers publishing deals"", added the spokesperson. Joanne Harris, the Barnsley-born writer of Chocolat who is published in more than 50 countries, said there was ""a systematic leeching of resources by the current government from the provinces in general. ""Arts cuts, library closures, museum and theatre closures, etc all based on the idea that only London matters."" Harrogate Crime Writing Festival was founded by the Scottish crime writer Val McDermid Ann Chadwick, of Cause UK representing the Harrogate Crime Writing festival, said the idea of a northern base for big publishers was a ""brilliant idea"". Ms Chadwick said the annual festival, showed the north could have ""that kind of impact"" and confirmed ""life outside London"". Hannah Bannister, of Peepal Tree Press from Leeds, said: ""Power is concentrated in London and the South East and publishing is dominated by a handful of large corporations but there is more creativity than they can cope with."" Ms Bannister said a potential author in the north faced problems if he or she ""couldn't afford the ticket to London"". The NFA telling ""different stories"" The NFA was formed in 2016 and includes 11 independent publishers. These are Comma Press (Manchester), Peepal Tree Press (Leeds), Dead Ink Books (Liverpool), And Other Stories (Sheffield), Saraband (Salford), Blue Moose (Hebden Bridge) Tilted Axis (Sheffield) Mayfly (Newcastle), Route (Pontefract), Valley Press (Scarborough) and Wrecking Ball (Hull).

"Milos Forman with an award at the Sevilla Festival Film in 2004 Film lovers are mourning director Milos Forman, who won Oscars for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus. The Czech-born film-maker, who was 86, was one of a small number of foreign directors to enjoy lasting commercial and critical success in Hollywood. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest starred Jack Nicholson and won five Oscars in 1976, while 1984's Amadeus won eight. Director Edgar Wright was among those paying tribute, saying he ""documented the rebel heart and human spirit"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He was ""a great director"" with ""a tremendous filmography"", Wright wrote on Twitter. Forman's other English-language films included 1996's The People vs Larry Flynt, which earned him his third best director Oscar nomination, and 1999's Man on the Moon. Antonio Banderas, who has said he was inspired to become an actor when he watched Forman's 1979 musical Hair, described him as a ""genius of cinematography and master in the portrayal of the human condition"".

Forman was born in Czechoslovakia in 1932 and became an orphan when both his parents were killed in Nazi death camps during World War II. He made his name as a leading figure in Czech new wave cinema in the 1960s, but moved to the US when Russian troops invaded in 1968. His first feature in the US, 1971's Taking Off, was a critical if not commercial success. But the follow-up, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, firmly established him in Hollywood. It was one of the biggest box office hits of 1975, taking more than $100m, and became only the second film in history to win Oscars for best picture, director, actor, actress and screenplay. He won his second best director Oscar for Amadeus in 1985 The film starred Nicholson as a man battling the system in a psychiatric establishment and was based on Ken Kesey's novel. ""To me it was not just literature but real life, the life I lived in Czechoslovakia from my birth in 1932 until 1968,"" Forman once said. ""The Communist Party was my Nurse Ratched, telling me what I could and could not do."" The director followed that with Hair and 1981's Ragtime before Amadeus, a look at the life of 18th Century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his rival Antonio Salieri. Its Oscars included best picture and best director. After 1989's Valmont, he made The People vs Larry Flynt, with Woody Harrelson cast as the porn publisher. With Courtney Love, who appeared in The People vs Larry Flynt Three years later, Forman cast Jim Carrey to star in Man On The Moon, the biopic of comedian Andy Kaufman. WhenForman was honoured with a lifetime achievement award from the Directors' Guild of Americain 2012, the guild's president Taylor Hackford said he ""finds the universality of the human experience in every story"". Forman was married to actresses Jana Brejchova and Vera Kresadlova, having twin boys with the latter. In 1999, he married screenwriter Martina Zborilova, with whom he also had twin sons, Andrew and James - named after Andy Kaufman and Jim Carrey. He died on Friday in the US after a short illness, Martina told Czech news agency CTK. ""His departure was calm and he was surrounded the whole time by his family and his closest friends,"" she said.

"This was a heavier strike than a year ago - three targets rather than one. Then, the US acted alone; this time it was joined by its French and British allies. More than double the number of weapons were fired against Syrian targets than last year - a little more than 120 in all. But the fundamental question remains the same. Was this enough to achieve what the Americans say was their goal - to deter President Bashar al-Assad from using chemical weapons again? US and allies launch strikes on Syria Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Since April a year ago Syria's torment has not ended. But two fundamental things have changed. Firstly, the Assad regime has effectively won its war and terrorising civilians has played a key part in its strategy. President Assad may not control all of Syrian territory. But backed by Russia and Iran, there is nobody that can really stand against him. It is shortages of manpower, equipment and capacity that prevent him re-establishing wider control. Syrians wave Iranian, Russian and Syrian flags after the western strikes Secondly, relations between Washington and Moscow - and between Russia and the West more generally - have deteriorated significantly, to the extent that senior international officials are now talking of a new Cold War. This was the context in which President Trump determined to send his punitive message to the Assad regime. And this is the context in which they will have received it. Will they be cowed or defiant? Will public bluster conceal a more fundamental re-think on the part of Mr Assad? Might Russia, whatever its spokesmen say, have a stern word with the Syrian leader? And if they did, would it have any effect? Syria war: Fall of Eastern Ghouta pivotal moment for Assad Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? Watching this crisis unfold from the United States, I found it both perplexing and in many ways worrying. There seemed to be a lack of focus and clarity on the part of the Trump administration. Hardly surprising, perhaps, when the president himself was increasingly bogged down in his own domestic difficulties as allegations and recriminations about alleged past affairs and misbehaviour returned to haunt him. President Trump is dealing with multiple domestic issues At times he seemed more likely to strike out at the US justice system than at President Assad. Indeed over the past week, while much of the rest of the world worried about what Mr Trump might do about Syria, the media here has been dominated, absorbed and fascinated, in equal measure, by Mr Trump's difficulties almost to the exclusion of all else. President Trump's rhetoric suggested a major military strike against the Assad regime. In the event what has taken place falls far short of that. So what conclusion might Moscow and Damascus draw? Trump lawyer under criminal investigation Six claims about Trump in Comey book The president and the porn star: Why this matters The Pentagon seems to have gone out of its way to avoid both civilian and ""foreign"" casualties - for that read ""Russians"". The three targets hit were chosen both for their central role in the chemical weapons programme but also because the risk of collateral damage was smallest. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff noted at a subsequent briefing that the US had a list of other targets which it did not choose to strike this time. The clear message is that if the Assad regime resorts to chemical weapons again then more strikes will follow. But again, since last April there have been a number of other alleged chemical weapons attacks, generally using chlorine gas. But until now the US did not strike again. So what message did this send? An explosion seen in the night sky over Damascus Now the hope is that Mr Assad will change his behaviour. But what about the wider Syrian conflict? This brutal war shows no sign of ending. Many have pointed out that it is barrel bombs, artillery and bullets that are responsible for the overwhelming bulk of the deaths and mutilations in Syria, not chemical weapons, and yet it is these that prompt Western action. There is a good measure of truth in this sentiment, though for historical and cultural reasons chemical weapons have a particular horror in the West in the wake of their use in World War One. The treaty banning them is an important  disarmament agreement and its weakening threatens to unwind years of progress. But the wider question is to what extent these latest strikes change the picture in Syria? Do they bring the conflict any closer to an end? Sadly the answer is almost certainly no. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis briefed the media after the strikes took place Only a short while ago - much to his generals' horror - Mr Trump spoke about pulling all US troops out of Syria. Only days later he seemed to be threatening a major military intervention. There has been no consistency in the Trump administration's position. There is simply no clear strategy to help bring the war to an end. Indeed one of the arguments for keeping US troops in Syria to bolster their local allies like the Kurds, was in fact to keep the Assad regime and its Iranian backers off-balance. Constraining Iran is about the only unifying theme in the Trump administration's approach, but even this has not been raised to the level of a coherent strategy. In his statement after the strikes the President again asserted that the US was not seeking an indefinite presence in Syria. His hope was clearly that as others shouldered the burden (who?) the US might walk away. But this was followed by a catch-all statement about the intractability of the region and its problems, which hardly suggests a desire for a long-term engagement. If these are the signals coming from Washington, then why should Russia worry? It has, through its military, and political support for the Assad regime, re-established itself as a significant diplomatic actor in the region. Russia, of course warned the US and its allies not to strike Syria. So in the wake of this attack what might Russia do? In Syria itself, it might seek to further undermine Washington's already weak position but it is not going to war with the Americans - such fears, barring some extraordinary disaster, were always, probably, far-fetched. US Defence Secretary James Mattis has already hinted at Russia's likely response noting that ""we fully expect a significant disinformation campaign over the coming days by those who have aligned themselves with the Assad regime"". Indeed this campaign has in many ways already begun, with the Russians - who now have forces in the area where the recent chemical attack is alleged to have occurred - insisting first that there was no sign of a chemical attack and then, more recently, that the whole thing was staged by foreign agents to discredit Mr Assad and Moscow. Russia's President Putin was recently returned in a presidential election This is the same Russia that is accepted by most Western governments to have been behind the attempted assassination of a former Russian intelligence officer and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury, using a nerve agent. It is the same Russia that has tried to influence the US and other recent elections. It is President Putin's Russia that has seized part of Ukraine. One could go on. The misinformation battle has already been joined. There is indeed a new sort of Cold War developing. It may not risk nuclear annihilation, but because of that it is in many ways more direct and unpredictable, with Moscow taking much greater risks than it might have done in the past. Russia is not a global superpower like the Soviet Union. It no longer has an ideology that gathers support from liberation movements around the world. It is fundamentally a middle-ranking regional power with a significant nuclear arsenal and a relatively weak economy. But it knows how to wield influence and how to conduct information warfare. And Mr Putin is determined to defend Russia's interests - as he sees them - wherever he is able. A missile destined for Syria is launched from a French vessel in the Mediterranean Mostly this means in Russia's near-abroad, that is countries close to its borders that have been traditional Russian spheres of interest - such as Georgia or Ukraine. Syria is almost an honorary member of the near-abroad, affording Russia an entry point to regain its influence in a region that still matters. Russia's star is rising and Washington's influence is in many ways on the wane. And this matters. For instability in the region is growing. The ripples from a previous US administration's decision to remove Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq are still spreading. Iran was the principal benefactor of that decision. It has become a formidable regional player. Its growing influence in Syria risks a major conflict with Israel. Recently, Israel is believed to have struck at a Syrian base which was home to an Iranian facility. Tensions are rising. The region's many fault-lines risk merging. And the US, British and French attacks over-night have inevitably thrown another pebble into the pool. Russia v the West: Is this a new Cold War?

"A former cheerleader for the Miami Dolphins has filed a formal complaint against the team, claiming she was bullied due to her faith and virginity. Kristan Ann Ware, 27, says she quit the dance squad after a 2016 interview with the team director during which her sexual history was discussed. She is not the first cheerleader to complain of a hostile work environment. A former New Orleans Saints cheerleader claims that she was fired for a social media post of herself wearing lingerie. NFL cheerleader 'fired for Instagram post' Ms Ware told the BBC her complaint, which was submitted to the Florida Commission on Human Relations on Wednesday, should not be misconstrued as an attack on the American football team. ""I am not against them. I just want to make it a better place for the cheerleaders,"" she said in a telephone interview on Friday. Ms Ware quit the team after three years, claiming that an incident on a coach bus in London led to ongoing harassment. When her team played the New York Jets at Wembley Stadium in the fall of 2015, the dancers talked about their ""sex playlist"", Ms Ware says in her complaint. Ms Ware ""was pushed to give her playlist,"" she claims, which prompted her to admit she was a virgin. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Kristan told her teammates that she was waiting until she was married because of her personal relationship with God,"" her lawyer Sara Blackwell states in the complaint. Later, during a yearly performance review in which dancers must reapply for their jobs, Ms Ware says the team director, Dorie Grogan, confronted her about the claim. ""Let's talk about the fact that you're a virgin"", she claims the director said. Ms Ware claims she was told not to discuss her virginity any further, according to her lawyer. A team source told the BBC that ""in 2016, we were made aware of an incident with our cheerleaders that fell short of our standards and expectations.

But Ms Grogan is still serving in her same role, according to US media reports. As part of her claim, Ms Ware argues the team's main Instagram account did not promote her posts that mentioned her Christian religion. She also says that when she wrote a ""motivation Monday"" story for the Dolphins blog about her audition for the team, her references to God and Christ were edited out. The Miami Dolphins said in a statement to the BBC News: ""We are seriously committed to providing a positive work environment for everyone associated with the organisation. ""We hold every member of our organisation to the same standards and do not discriminate as it relates to gender, race and religious beliefs."" In a statement to US media, the National Football League (NFL) says the organisation and its teams ""support fair employment practices"".

"This video can not be played The PM said the use of chemical weapons could not be allowed Prime ministers don't choose the decisions that face them. But they have to judge which way to jump. In 2013, Theresa May's predecessor tried and failed to get approval for military action against President Assad. There was international alarm, then as now, about his suspected use of chemical weapons. But MPs rejected David Cameron's plan and he didn't try again to persuade Parliament it was necessary. This time, she has avoided that particular obstacle by taking action alongside the US and France while MPs are away. US and allies launch strikes on Syria chemical weapons sites PM - 'No alternative' to Syria air strikes UK 'confident' of successful mission Corbyn's letter to Theresa May in full Syria strikes: Latest updates Time and again at a press conference at Downing Street this morning the prime minister spelled out the strikes that took place overnight were limited, targeted and a response to the suspected use of chemical weapons in Douma. With no clear indication of public support or consent, she time and again was at pains to say that she had authorised action for a specific reason - to punish President Assad for gassing his own people, as the government believes he has. She will face an almighty row in the coming days over going ahead without consulting Parliament. Her defence is that ""security and operational reasons"" meant the attack had to go ahead overnight. That won't wash with her political critics, and Labour is also pushing for more clarity on the legal justification. To try to close down a giant fight, the government is publishing a summary of the legal advice later today. But while the strikes themselves were limited, Theresa May's mission is a broader one - to force a return to respect for the international rules that are meant to prevent the use of chemical weapons. It was notable this morning that she mentioned the attack in Salisbury alongside the use of chemical weapons in Syria - events many thousands of miles and weeks apart, but both using banned substances. And notable, too, that the prime minister on several occasions did not rule out more strikes. When asked if Assad repeated the suspected attack she said ""no one should doubt our resolve"".  The government's hoped-for outcome is that the RAF, alongside French and US planes, has made it impossible for President Assad to carry out any other chemical attacks. But if the bombing has not wiped out his capability, and he was to repeat the suspected horror at Douma, the prime minister seems willing to act again. No 10 sees the actions of the last 24 hours as a direct response to Douma and an effort to stop the slide to a situation where the use of chemical weapons becomes the norm. As for any British resident of No 10, Theresa May's first decision to take military action is a huge political moment. But clearly it may also not be her last. Why is Brexit taking sooo long?

"Russian intelligence agencies targeted poison victim Yulia Skripal's email account as early as 2013, the UK's national security adviser has said. In a letter to Nato, Sir Mark Sedwill also said Russia trained ""special units"" to use nerve agents, including applying them to door handles. Police said a nerve agent was found on Yulia's father Sergei Skripal's front door in Salisbury. The Russian government has denied any involvement in the 4 March attack. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Poisoned ex-spy's daughter leaves hospital Who is Sergei Skripal? Inspectors back UK in spy poisoning row The UK says Ms Skripal, 33, and her 66-year-old father, who were found slumped on a park bench in the city on 4 March, were exposed toa nerve agent belonging to the Novichok group. This analysis has been backed by the international chemical weapons watchdog. Mr Skripal remains at Salisbury District Hospital, while his daughter was discharged on Monday. Sir Mark's letter to Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg,externalis the first time the UK government has claimed to have specific information that the Russians were interested in the Skripal family. ""We have information indicating Russian intelligence service interest in the Skripals dating back at least as far as 2013,"" he said. ""Email accounts belonging to Yulia Skripal were targeted by GRU cyber specialists,"" he said, referring to Russia's foreign military intelligence agency. The letter accuses Russia of testing assassination methods with chemical weapons, including using nerve agents smeared on to door handles. Police say traces of a Novichok nerve agent have been found at sites across Salisbury at low concentrations following the attack - with thehighest concentration found on the door handle of Mr Skripal's front door.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. But the details contained in the letter do not identify the exact culprits behind the poison attack. Sir Mark said it was ""highly likely"" people such as Mr Skripal, who was exchanged in a spy swap in 2010 after being convicted of passing information to the UK, may be regarded as ""legitimate targets"" for ""state-sponsored assassination"" by Russia. He said the UK government continued ""to judge that only Russia has the technical means, operational experience and motive for the attack on the Skripals and that it is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible"". ""There is no plausible alternative explanation,"" he added. The letter also claims President Vladimir Putin was closely involved in the Russian chemical weapons programme in the mid-2000s, and that it was ""highly unlikely"" any former Soviet republic other than Russia pursued chemical weapons after independence. The Russian embassy has published an 8,000-word report on the Skripal case, including a timeline and details of the British response. The report accuses the British government of isolating the Skripals, concealing evidence and preventing an independent investigation. It also says the UK is using ""the same script, but in fast forward mode"" as it did on the case of Alexander Litvinenko - the former Russian agent poisoned in London in 2006. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said around 250 detectives were working on the Salisbury investigation. She said they would do everything to establish the facts and ""if at all possible"" bring those responsible to justice. Ex-spy's daughter leaves hospital What happened to the Skripals?

"President Trump has signalled military intervention is likely in the near future As the US and UK governments continue to discuss their potential response tothe suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma in Syria, what could military intervention achieve? The critical military virtue of surprise has long since disappeared for theUnited States and its allies in the strikes it is planning against Syrianmilitary facilities. Indeed, Syrian forces have had more than two days to move their aircraft and other military assets into Russian bases at Latakia, Tartus and Khmeimim, where they will be within the protective bubbles of Russia's highly capable S-400 surface-to-air missiles. The Syrians have emptied their infantry bases and dispersed as much of their armed forces as possible, in anticipation of incoming Western missiles. The Russians will undoubtedly try to protect their bases, if attacked, so the situation is fraught with superpower brinkmanship and the danger of accidental conflict. For Western military planners the two greatest questions are what can they achieve militarily in this situation, and what strategic difference can it make? Theresa May summons cabinet to discuss Syria action Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria? Syria 'chemical attack': France's President Macron says he has proof Firepower of key countries in Syrian crisis With Syrian forces forewarned, dispersed and under Russian protection, Western strikes will have to concentrate on Syria's fixed military facilities - bombing runways, destroying buildings and capital equipment where it remains in place. This video can not be played The US president has said ""nothing's off the table"" - so what options are on the table? Western attacks will probably try to destroy Syria's military command and control system, possibly with bunker-busting bombs and deep penetration warheads. They are likely to try to dismantle the military infrastructure that Syria has effectively rebuilt since 2015. More ambitiously, and also more risky, the United States might declare a longer-term policy of revisiting these targets to keep them out of use and have Syrian aircraft bottled up inside their Russian bases - in effect trying to operate a quasi ""no-fly zone"" in Syria, at least for a while. In April 2017 the US launched 59 cruise missiles at the Shayrat airbase in response to a previous chemical weapons attack Last year when theUS struck President Assad's Shayrat airbase in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun,the Syrian air force made sure it was seen to be back in action within a day. The US will be determined that this does not happen again, which is why we can expect this to be a more prolonged air campaign with repeated attacks on key sites. What strategic purpose can be served by this? It certainly won't make any immediate difference to the civil population of Syria, who have suffered so much at the hands of their own government, and the multitude of rebel, terrorist and guerrilla groups, some of whom have intimidated, as much as they have represented, them. And President Assad is unlikely to relent in his determination to consolidate his hold on the country. Why is there a war in Syria? Experts: Are we heading for a third world war? So why take all the risks of escalation with Russia and the prospects of unintended consequences that normally follow? On its own, military force is meaningless. It has to be part of a political strategy and in this case the strategy is about bigger issues than Syria itself and only offers a long-shot hope for the Syrian population. The first objective is to push back against the increasing ""normalisation"" of chemical weapons being used in wars of any kind. The taboo against them has been surprisingly strong since the end of World War One.The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993,externalhas been one of the most effective disarmament measures in modern history. Syria is a signatory to it. In2013 President Obama claimed he would uphold that taboo as a ""red line"", but then didn't. And despite firm denials from the Assad government, there is an abundance of evidence that Syrian forces, with Russian connivance, have been using chemical weapons against their own people on a regular basis ever since. Many Western politicians feel that - with all the moral grey areas of this situation - they cannot sell the pass on this issue yet again. It has become a test case for the international rule of law, which is under severe pressure on many fronts. The World Health Organization has demanded ""unhindered access"" to Douma in Syria to verify claims about the attack Beyond that, some argue effective military action would represent an acceptance that Western powers have got to get back into the game of Middle East politics at a time when the region is melting down. The campaign against so-called Islamic State (IS) was always a geopolitical sideshow, and Western influence on what has been happening from Lebanon to the Yemen has been in steep decline. Of course, it is tempting, and understandable, for Western leaders to want to leave it all alone. But while they took their eye off the ball fighting IS, the future of the area was being determined by Iran, Russia and partly also by Turkey. Syria war: Why Turkey's battle for northern Syria matters Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? The calculation is whether long-term Western interests are served better by involvement than indifference to a constellation of powers that is sliding out of control. And the hope for the Syrian population is that an effective military campaign could possibly push President Assad back into negotiations so that the war might end with something more humane than a vicious victory. Using military force is never easy, but it can only be effective if it is part of a coherent and realistic political strategy.

"This video can not be played Frances Carroll before and after her weight loss One in eight middle-aged adults in the UK could have a potentially serious form of liver disease - because they are overweight. Scans of nearly 3,000 individuals from the UK Biobank research project showed that 12% had inflamed, fatty livers. The British Liver Trust said the ""very alarming"" findings were a 'wake-up call' because the condition can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and death. Hepatologists said there was a silent epidemic of fatty liver disease. This is especially worrying because symptoms often do not emerge until permanent damage is done - but the condition is reversible if caught in time. Frances Carroll, aged 52, from Oxford, was told she had fatty liver disease seven years ago. At the time she weighed over 18 stone (116 kilos). She lost 7 stone, and went down from a size 22 to a 12. Frances said: ""I was shocked when I was told my liver was diseased, but determined to do something about it. I started by eating more healthily and then combined that with physical activity - I'm delighted my liver is back to normal."" Frances now teaches fitness classes and does nutrition coaching. She said: ""Back in 2011 I would not have believed that I would end up as a personal trainer. I used to get out of breath when I walked any distance - now I run up hills!"" And she has had a new type of MRI scan which has showed her liver is healthy again. The results of the MRI scanning study, led by scientists in Oxford, were announced at the International Liver Congress in Paris. They were made possible by an innovative software analysis tool called LiverMultiScan, developed by Perspectum Diagnositics, a spin-out company from the University of Oxford. Dr Rajarshi Banerjee, CEO of Perspectum Diagnostics said: ""LiverMultiScan is a great example of a smart health technology discovered and developed by UK clinicians and scientists with clear benefits for patients, the NHS, and taxpayers. ""Whilst liver biopsy remains an important part of hepatology practice, clearly we need better non-invasive tools at our disposal to evaluate the nature and severity of liver disease."" Frances is now a personal trainer An inflamed liver in red on the left and a healthy liver in green on the right Needle biopsies are the gold standard for assessing liver disease, but they are costly, invasive, painful and carry some health risks. The software tool can be used in any MRI scanner but is not yet in routine clinical practice. Southampton General is the first NHS hospital to use the new system outside of research. David Breen, associate professor of radiology at University Hospital Southampton believes it could reduce the need for biopsies. He said: ""The scan gives a map of the entire liver as opposed to a needle-core biopsy which samples just one area and can be unpleasant. ""It also allows us to re-scan patients over time and see if they improve."" Going from a size 22 to a 12 has meant Frances no longer has fatty liver disease Previous studies had suggested that around one in 20 adults might have the potentially serious form of fatty liver disease known as NASH (non-alcoholic steatophepatitis). This is where there is inflammation in and around the liver cells liver which, over time, can can lead to the build up of scar tissue known as fibrosis - eventually this can lead to cirrhosis. But the scanning study suggests the proportion could be much higher. Steve Ryder, consultant liver specialist in Nottingham said: ""This study accords with what we are seeing on the ground - a lot of people are coming to hospital with significant liver disease because they are overweight."" Ninety per cent of liver disease is reversible if caught in time. Judi Rhys, chief executive of the British Liver Trust said: ""Reducing alcohol is important which most people already know, but for fatty liver disease the key things are having a healthy weight and doing exercise.""

"This video can not be played The PM said the use of chemical weapons could not be allowed Prime ministers don't choose the decisions that face them. But they have to judge which way to jump. In 2013, Theresa May's predecessor tried and failed to get approval for military action against President Assad. There was international alarm, then as now, about his suspected use of chemical weapons. But MPs rejected David Cameron's plan and he didn't try again to persuade Parliament it was necessary. This time, she has avoided that particular obstacle by taking action alongside the US and France while MPs are away. US and allies launch strikes on Syria chemical weapons sites PM - 'No alternative' to Syria air strikes UK 'confident' of successful mission Corbyn's letter to Theresa May in full Syria strikes: Latest updates Time and again at a press conference at Downing Street this morning the prime minister spelled out the strikes that took place overnight were limited, targeted and a response to the suspected use of chemical weapons in Douma. With no clear indication of public support or consent, she time and again was at pains to say that she had authorised action for a specific reason - to punish President Assad for gassing his own people, as the government believes he has. She will face an almighty row in the coming days over going ahead without consulting Parliament. Her defence is that ""security and operational reasons"" meant the attack had to go ahead overnight. That won't wash with her political critics, and Labour is also pushing for more clarity on the legal justification. To try to close down a giant fight, the government is publishing a summary of the legal advice later today. But while the strikes themselves were limited, Theresa May's mission is a broader one - to force a return to respect for the international rules that are meant to prevent the use of chemical weapons. It was notable this morning that she mentioned the attack in Salisbury alongside the use of chemical weapons in Syria - events many thousands of miles and weeks apart, but both using banned substances. And notable, too, that the prime minister on several occasions did not rule out more strikes. When asked if Assad repeated the suspected attack she said ""no one should doubt our resolve"".  The government's hoped-for outcome is that the RAF, alongside French and US planes, has made it impossible for President Assad to carry out any other chemical attacks. But if the bombing has not wiped out his capability, and he was to repeat the suspected horror at Douma, the prime minister seems willing to act again. No 10 sees the actions of the last 24 hours as a direct response to Douma and an effort to stop the slide to a situation where the use of chemical weapons becomes the norm. As for any British resident of No 10, Theresa May's first decision to take military action is a huge political moment. But clearly it may also not be her last. Why is Brexit taking sooo long?

"Medical and rescue organisations say most of the victims were children and women Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed on 7 April in a suspected chemical attack on Douma, which was the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) says initial tests on samples from two sites detected ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"", along with explosive residues. However, no nerve agents were detected. The Syrian government denies ever using chemical weapons, and its ally Russia says it has evidence that the incident was staged with the help of the UK. In February, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad launched an assault on the Eastern Ghouta that reportedly left more than 1,700 civilians dead. In March, troops split the region into three pockets - the largest of which was around Douma, home to between 80,000 and 150,000 people. Facing defeat, rebel groups in the other two pockets agreed to be evacuated to northern Syria. But the group controlling Douma, Jaysh al-Islam, continued to hold out. On 6 April, after negotiations with the government stalled, air strikes resumed. The bombardment continued for a second day, with dozens of people reportedly killed or injured by conventional munitions before the suspected chemical attack. Activists from the Violations Documentation Center (VDC), which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, reportedtwo separate incidents of bombs believed to contain toxic substances being dropped by the Syrian Air Force,external. The first occurred at approximately 16:00 (13:00 GMT) and saw the Saada bakery on Omar Ibn Al-Khattab street in north-western Douma targeted, the VDC said. Activists say Douma came under intense aerial bombardment on Saturday It cited a member of the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets, as saying he smelt chlorine in the air after the strike, but that he could not determine its source. The VDC said the second incident took place not far to the east, near Martyrs' Square, at approximately 19:30. At 19:45, more than 500 patients - most of them women and children - were brought to medical facilities with symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,external, according to the Syria Civil Defence and the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which supports hospitals in rebel-held areas. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The patients showed signs of ""respiratory distress, central cyanosis [blue skin or lips], excessive oral foaming, corneal burns, and the emission of chlorine-like odour"", a joint statement issued on Sunday said. One woman who died had convulsions and pinpoint pupils. Rescue workers searching homes in the affected area also found the bodies of people with oral foaming, cyanosis, and corneal burns, the statement added. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which supports hospitals in rebel-held Syria, also saidit received reports of two incidents,external. Patients were hosed down with water to remove any chemicals on their skin People were treated for breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes following the first, the UOSSM said. After the second, patients were brought to hospital smelling strongly of a chlorine-like substance and presenting symptoms that included cyanosis, foaming of the mouth, and cornea irritation, it added. A medical student working at a hospital told the BBC he had treated a man who died,external. ""His pupils were dilated and he had foam in his mouth. His heart was very slow. Then he coughed blood into his mouth as well,"" he said. Two videos circulated by the opposition activist group Douma Revolution showed what it said werethe bodies of children, women and men found in one block of flats,external, which is believed to be located south-west of Martyrs' Square. Some had foam coming out of their mouths and noses. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Activists also posted avideo which they said showed a yellow industrial gas cylinder on the balcony of the same block of flats,external. One end of the cylinder was lying in a crater-like opening in the reinforced concrete floor. A second gas cylinder was filmed on the bed of a top-floor flat,externalto the south-west, below a crater-like opening in the concrete roof. The World Health Organization said on 11 April that it had received reports from its local ""health cluster partners"" of43 deaths related to symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals"",external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said rescue workers found 42 people dead in their homes. One person was declared dead on arrival at a hospital, and another six died while receiving treatment, they added. An earlier, now deleted tweet by the Syria Civil Defence put the number dead at more than 150. The UOSSM initially reported that 70 people were confirmed dead. On 9 April,it revised down the figure to at least 42,external. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said air strikes on 6 and 7 April killed almost 100 people. It said they included 21 who died as a result of suffocation, but that it was unable to identify the cause. The British investigative journalism website, Bellingcat, said it had counted at least 34 bodies,externalin the two videos circulated by Douma Revolution. Bellingcat also assessed that the block of flats near Martyrs' Square where the bodies were filmed wasvisited by Russian military personnel on 9 April,external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said the day after the incident that they believed those who died suffocated as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals, most likely an organophosphate - a compound grouping associated with pesticides and nerve agents, such as Sarin. The UOSSM also concluded that the symptoms of the casualties were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent, possibly one mixed with chlorine. On 13 April, the US said itassessed ""with confidence that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons"",external. The conclusion was ""based on descriptions of the attack in multiple media sources, the reported symptoms experienced by victims, videos and images showing two assessed barrel bombs from the attack, and reliable information indicating co-ordination between Syrian military officials before the attack"". It added: ""A significant body of information points to the regime using chlorine in its bombardment of Douma, while some additional information points to the regime also using the nerve agent Sarin."" A fact-finding team from the OPCW has travelled to Damascus to investigate the allegations The OPCW, which oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention, dispatched experts from its Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) to Damascus five days after the attack. But they were unable to visit any of the sites of interest until 21 April because of an attack on a UN security team conducting a reconnaissance mission. The FFM team interviewed witnesses and collected environmental samples and data from three locations:the hospital where victims were allegedly treated for chemical exposure,external;the block of flats with the cylinder on the balcony,external(referred to as ""Location 2"");the flat with the cylinder on the bed,external(""Location 4""). The team also gathered or received samples and interviewed witnesses, including alleged casualties, in a neighbouring country. On 6 July, a preliminary report issued by the OPCW said ""no organophosphorus nerve agents or their degradation products were detected,external, either in the environmental samples or in plasma samples from the alleged casualties"".  However, it added, ""various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from Locations 2 and 4, along with residues of explosive"". The OPCW said the FFM team was now working to establish the significance of the results. It is also assessing the association of the two gas cylinders with the incident, the relative damage to the cylinders and the roofs, and how the cylinders arrived at their respective locations. The chlorinated compounds included those used to treat drinking water, as a disinfectant, a wood preservative, or a flame retardant. However, the same compounds were detected at other sites in Syria where the OPCW has concluded that chlorine was likely used as a weapon, includingSaraqeb,externalandLatamina,external. President Assad has accused the US, UK and France of ""staging"" the incident in Douma,externalwith the help of the Syria Civil Defence, which receives funding from Western governments. ""It was a lie. After we liberated that area our information confirmed the attack did not take place,"" he told the Daily Mail on 9 June. ""The British government should prove with evidence that the attack happened, and then they should prove who is responsible. This did not happen."" Syrian government ground forces advanced towards Douma on Saturday Russian permanent representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on 9 April thatRussian military specialists had visited Douma and taken soil samples that showed no presence of nerve agents or substances containing chlorine,external. He also said no-one with symptoms of exposure to sarin or chlorine had been admitted to Douma's hospital, nor any bodies found. Four days later, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had ""irrefutable evidence that this was yet another attack, staged with the participation of special services of one state that is striving to be at the forefront of the Russophobic campaign"". This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media A British diplomat called the allegation ""bizarre"" and a ""blatant lie"". On 26 April, Russian and Syrian diplomats presented to a briefing at the OPCW's headquarters in The Hague more than a dozen people from Douma who said they had not seen any evidence of chemical weapons being used there. They included Hasan Diab,an 11-year-old boy who was seen being doused in water,externalin a video widely circulated online after the alleged attack. ""We heard cries on the street that we should go to the hospital. We got scared. We went to the hospital through the tunnel,""he told reporters,external.

"A businessman fighting for the ""right to be forgotten"" has won a UK High Court action against Google. The man, who has not been named due to reporting restrictions surrounding the case, wanted search results about a past crime he had committed removed from the search engine. The judge, Mr Justice Mark Warby, ruled in his favour on Friday. But he rejected a separate claim made by another businessman who had committed a more serious crime. The businessman who won his case was convicted 10 years ago of conspiring to intercept communications. He spent six months in jail. The other businessman, who lost his case, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiring to account falsely. He spent four years in jail. Both had ordered Google to remove search results about their convictions, including links to news articles, stating that they were no longer relevant. They took Google to court when it refused to remove the search results. Google said it would accept the rulings. ""We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest,"" it said in a statement. ""We are pleased that the Court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgements they have made in this case."" The right to be forgotten is a legal precedent set by the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2014, following a case brought by Spaniard Mario Costeja Gonzalez who had asked Google to remove information about his financial history. Google says it has removed 800,000 pages from its results following so-called ""right to be forgotten"" requests. However, search engines can decline to remove pages if they judge them to remain in the public interest. Explaining the decisions made on Friday, the judge said one of the men had continued to ""mislead the public"" while the other had ""shown remorse"". The Open Rights Group, which campaigns for internet freedoms, said the rulings set a ""legal precedent"". ""The right to be forgotten is meant to apply to information that is no longer relevant but disproportionately impacts a person,"" said Jim Killock, executive director. ""The Court will have to balance the public's right to access the historical record, the precise impacts on the person, and the public interest.""

"Israel said the drone it shot down in February was sent by Iran on an attack mission Israel has said the Iranian drone it shot down in February was loaded with explosives and ""tasked to attack"". On Friday, Israel's military said that it came to the conclusion after ""flight path analysis"" and an ""intelligence-based investigation"" of the remnants. Israel said its ""combat helicopters prevented the attack Iran had hoped to carry out in Israeli territory"". The drone was launched from an airbase in Syria, against which Israel later carried out air strikes. Israel lost one of its F-16 planes in the counter-offensive - a rare loss for the Israeli air force, thoughboth crew members survivedafter ejecting. Israel blamed for Syria airfield attack Iran building base in Syria - claim Syria neighbours in fear of war - Iran The same airbase  - known as T4 - came under attack again on Monday, two months after the Iranian drone was allegedly launched from the area. Syria and Russia said the latest attack, which killed 14 people, was also carried out by Israel, which declined to comment. Seven Iranians were among those killed. In an interview with the BBC in late February,Iran's deputy foreign minister refused to confirm that Iran had sent the drone into Israeland said that the drone belonged to the Syrian army. It was shot down on 10 February in the country's far north, once it crossed the border. ""It should be noted that the UAV was identified and tracked by Israeli defence systems until its destruction, effectively eliminating any threat the Iranian aircraft posed while flying towards Israeli territory,"" the Israeli military said in its statement.

Russia has accused the UK of faking an attack, an allegation Britain dismissed as a ""grotesque, blatant lie"".

On Friday, US state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: ""We know for a fact that it was a chemical weapon."" When she was asked whether the US had proof the Syrian government was behind the attack, she said: ""Yes."" The suspected attack, in which dozens of people reportedly died, was denied by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

Syria 'chemical attack': What we know What can Western military intervention achieve? Are we heading for a third world war? The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, told the network: ""We definitely have enough proof but now we just have to be thoughtful in our action."" Control over the town has since passed from rebels to the Syrian and Russian military authorities. A UN report last year found the Syrian government responsible for a deadly chemical attackon the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, in which more than 80 people died. That attack was followed by a US cruise missile attack on a Syrian airbase. A delegation from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will arrive in the area of the suspected attack on Saturday. General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia's defence ministry, said: ""We have... evidence that proves Britain was directly involved in organising this provocation."" In avideo produced by the Russian defence ministry,externaltwo men speaking Arabic say they were working in the casualty ward of Douma's central hospital when they assisted people brought in after the bombing of a multi-storey building. While they are clearly talking about the suspected chemical attack, both say the bombing occurred on Sunday 8 April when it actually occurred on Saturday 7 April. The two men say people were suffering from smoke inhalation, not chemical poisoning, but a panic began when one man said they were victims of a chemical attack. ""This is grotesque, it is a blatant lie, it is some of the worst pieces of fake news we've yet seen from the Russia propaganda machine,"" the UK's UN ambassador, Karen Pierce said. In a statement, the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""This simply shows (Russia's) desperation to pin the blame on anyone but their client: the Assad regime."" In the UK, cabinet ministers agreed it was ""highly likely"" the Syrian government was responsible for the alleged attack and said the use of chemical weapons must not ""go unchallenged"". This video can not be played Trump: Decisions on Syria will be made ""fairly soon"" The US president has said Russian President Vladimir Putin bears responsibility for the alleged attack in Douma because of his support for the Syrian government. On Wednesday he warned Russia that missiles were ""coming"" but later tweeted that he had ""never said when"". It ""could be very soon or not so soon at all"", Donald Trump said,external. What can Macron and Trump do? The significance of Eastern Ghouta's fall Why is there a war in Syria? Before the Security Council meeting, Mr Nebenzia accused Washington of putting international peace at risk. ""The immediate priority is to avert the danger of war,"" he said on Thursday. Senior Russian figures, including the head of the military, have warned that US missiles will be shot down and their launch sites targeted if Russian personnel come under threat.

"Western powers are believed to be considering air strikes against Syria in response to a suspected chemical attack near Damascus. The White House says it is continuing to assess intelligence and talk to its allies on how to respond while France's President Emmanuel Macron says he will decide ""in due course"" whether to take action. In the UK, Cabinet ministers have agreed the use of chemical weapons in Douma must not ""go unchallenged"". Location of suspected chemical attacks, 7 April The call for action comes after a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Douma, just outside Damascus, on Saturday, which killed dozens of people, according to opposition activists, rescue workers and medics. France's president says he has unspecified proof that the Syrian government attacked the town in the Eastern Ghouta without. Chemical weapons attacks have taken place in Syria before. Last year, the US retaliated with cruise missiles after at least 80 people died in Khan Sheikhoun, ina chemical attack the UN later blamed on the Syrian government. President Bashar al-Assad's government - which receives military backing from Russia - has denied involvement in any chemical attack, calling the reports ""fabricated"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the latest suspected attack was staged by foreign agents. Russia has also warned the US that launching air strikes could spark a war between the two countries. Dozens of people were killed when government aircraft dropped bombs filled with toxic chemicals on the formerly rebel-held town on Saturday, according to Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics. Activists from the Violations Documentation Center (VDC), an opposition network which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, reportedtwo separate incidents of bombs believed to contain toxic substances being dropped by the Syrian Air Force.,external 1) First chemical attack The first alleged incident occurred at approximately 16:00 local time and saw a bakery on Omar Ibn Al-Khattab street in north-western Douma targeted, the VDC said. A rescue worker from the Syria Civil Defence told the organisation he had smelt chlorine in the air after the strike. Patients were hosed down with water ""We later discovered the bodies of people who had suffocated from toxic gases,"" he added. ""They were in closed spaces, sheltering from the barrel bombs, which may have caused their quick death as no-one heard their screams."" 3) Second chemical attack The VDC said the second incident took place on Martyrs' Square - east of the first attack - at approximately 19:30. The Syrian-American Medical Society (Sams) saidmore than 500 people had been found with symptoms ""indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,external"" after the attacks. On Thursday, unnamed US officials said they had obtained blood and urine samples from victims which had tested positive for chlorine and a nerve agent, according to NBC News. Independent chemical weapons inspectors are en route to the Eastern Ghouta area to look for evidence. They are expected to arrive on Saturday. What we know about the attack Why is there a war in Syria? Among other assets,the UShas the guided-missile destroyer the USS Donald Cook in the Mediterranean and the US Navy has a sizeable number of fighter jets on carriers in the Gulf. A strike group, headed by the aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman, is also heading to the Mediterranean, the US Navy has confirmed. In addition, the Americans have long-range subsonic B-52 bombers, which they have deployed and used on targets in the region before. There are also an estimated 2,000 US troops on the ground in Syria, according to the Pentagon.,external Russiahas a contingent of warplanes based in Syria, which it has used in support of the Syrian government. It also has warships and support vessels deployed in the Mediterranean. Some are armed with cruise missiles. Anti-ship missiles stationed in Syria could also attack Western vessels in the Eastern Mediterranean. It could bring into play the advanced, but as yet untested, S-400 air defence system. The multi-layered anti-aircraft system was deployed to Syria after a Russian jet was downed there but has so far only served as a deterrent. How the S-400 system works Steps 1- 4 show how the S-400 system's radar tracks objects, assesses potential threats and launches missiles to destroy the targets. It can guide up to 12 missiles simultaneously, engaging up to six targets at once. The UKhas eight supersonic Tornados stationed in Cyprus and RAF Typhoons have also been operating in the region. The aircraft use Paveway IV laser-guided bombs and Brimstone missiles to target strikes. Britain also has a fleet of unmanned aircraft in the Middle East, including about 10 Reaper drones. The UK's Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft are also available. ForFrance,the frigate Aquitaine, which is equipped with cruise missiles, is currently in the Mediterranean, according to French media. France has also stationed several Mirage and Rafale fighter jets in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. With its nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier undergoing refitting, France has deployed sailors and aviators on board the US aircraft carrier USS George HW Bush for training and joint operations.

"This video can not be played Moment cruise missiles were launched from a French naval ship The US, UK and France have bombed three government sites in Syria in an early morning operation targeting chemical weapons facilities, they say. The move is a response to a suspected chemical attack on the town of Douma last week which killed dozens. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he condemned the Western strikes ""in the most serious way"". Russia, Syria's main ally, had threatened military retaliation if any Russian forces had been hit. ""The nations of Britain, France, and the United States of America have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality,"" US President Donald Trump said in an address from the White House at about 21:00 local time (01:00 GMT). ""The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons,"" he said.

Follow live: Western powers strike Syria targets Four RAF fighters join Syria air strikes Syria 'chemical attack': What we know At a Pentagon briefing shortly after Mr Trump's announcement, General Joseph Dunford listed three targets that had been struck: A scientific research facility in Damascus, allegedly connected to the production of chemical and biological weapons A chemical weapons storage facility west of Homs A chemical weapons equipment storage site and an important command post, also near Homs This video can not be played ""Rumbling like thunder"": A CBS reporter in Damascus witnessed the start of the strikes Reuters news agency cites a pro-Assad militia commander saying other locations were hit, including various sites close to Damascus: a military base in the Dimas area; army depots in the eastern Qalamoun;the Kiswah area, where Iran is believed to have been building a base; and a site in the Qasyoun hills, plus a research centre in Masyaf, further north. These reports are unverified. UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggested more targets than the three listed by the Pentagon had been hit. Russia said Syria had shot down 71 of 103 missiles fired. According to a Russian defence ministry statement, ""preliminary information"" said there had been no casualties among the Syrian army or civilians. There were initial reports that three civilians had been injured in Homs. US Secretary of Defence James Mattis told journalists there were no reports of US losses in the operation. He also said the scale of the strikes was about ""double"" what was launched in April 2017 after achemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed more than 80 people. Syria state TV showed images it claimed were of sites where it had brought down foreign missiles In his earlier address, President Trump had said: ""We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents."" But Secretary Mattis said that ""right now, this is a one-time shot"". Gen Dunford said the US had communicated with Russia ahead of the strikes through the normal procedures of their ""deconfliction"" hotline, which is used to prevent accidental clashes in a war zone with multiple international players. There had been concerns that if the US strike had hit Russian military personnel on the ground, it would further escalate tension. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Theresa May on the air strikes in Syria According to the UK Ministry of Defence, strikes carried out by four RAF Tornado jets hit one of the targets mentioned by the Pentagon - a military site near the city of Homs which is believed to have housed precursor materials for chemical weapons.

The strikes are over for now, but there was a clear warning that if the Assad regime resorts to chemical weapons again, then further strikes may well follow.

President Putin called them ""an act of aggression"". The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Moscow said President Putin had articulated Russian anger, but Moscow's claim that none of its own military assets were threatened may suggest that the threat of escalation through some sort of Russian retaliation has now been substantially reduced.

"This video can not be played Duke of Edinburgh waves as he is driven away from hospital The Duke of Edinburgh has been discharged from hospital following a successful hip replacement operation. Prince Philip, 96, waved as he was driven past the front entrance to King Edward VII's Hospital in London, having left through a different exit. He was admitted to hospital on 3 April and underwent the planned procedure the following day. The duke, who will continue his recovery in Windsor, thanked the public for their ""good wishes"". In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: ""His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh left King Edward VII's Hospital at midday today, following a hip replacement operation last week. ""His Royal Highness would like to convey his appreciation for the messages of good wishes he has received."" Prince Philip's decades of royal duty Queen bestows a new title on Prince Philip Princess Anne visited her father in hospital on Thursday and described him as ""on good form"". The Queen also gave an update, telling a well-wisher in Windsor who asked about Philip's recovery: ""He said he's getting on very well."" Prince Philip carried out his last solo engagement in August 2017 The duke retired from royal duties in August 2017. His hip problem came to light after his absence from the Easter service at Windsor. He also missed two other recent events at Windsor Castle - the Royal Maundy Service at St George's Chapel on 29 March, and a parade a week earlier to mark Prince Andrew's appointment as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. The duke's last solo engagement was on 2 August last year, when he reviewed a parade of Royal Marines outside Buckingham Palace in his capacity as captain general of the corps. By BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher A hip replacement completely rebuilds the hip joint. The top of the thigh bone is removed and replaced with a metal stem that has a smooth ball on the end. Part of the pelvis is also hollowed out and fitted with a socket for the ball to move in. Recovery will depend on the individual patient but, in general, doctors get patients on their feet as quickly as possible and discharge them three to five days after the procedure. There will be physiotherapy exercises to do at home and crutches are needed for about four to six weeks. Patients tend to feel back to normal after about three months. Most hip replacements are carried out on patients between the ages of 60 and 80 but overall fitness is a bigger factor than age in any decision to operate. Figures for the UK, excluding Scotland, show 851 people over 90 had a hip replacement in 2016. In the 1990s, the Queen Mother underwent two successful hip operations, aged 95 and 97.
