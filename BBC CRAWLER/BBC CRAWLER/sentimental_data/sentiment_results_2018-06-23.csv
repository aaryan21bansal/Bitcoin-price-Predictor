"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa has survived an apparent bomb attack at a rally in the city of Bulawayo. Mr Mnangagwa said an object ""exploded a few inches away from me - but it is not my time"". Video footage from White City Stadium shows an explosion happening close to Mr Mnangagwa as he leaves the stage after addressing supporters. Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said 15 people were injured, three of them seriously. The exact number of people hurt by the blast remains unclear - and reports suggest it may be significantly higher. The president was in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city and an opposition stronghold, to campaign for his Zanu-PF party ahead of nationwide elections taking place on 30 July. He is favourite to win the poll, but analysts say he also has enemies - both for overthrowing his former mentor, Robert Mugabe, and for being a previous enforcer of the Mugabe regime. A spokesman for Mr Mnangagwa said that while the president was unhurt, Vice-President Kembo Mohadi suffered a leg injury. Another vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, received bruises to his face. Red Cross personnel rush an injured army member away from the rally Other officials, including Zanu-PF party chairwoman Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, were also injured, as were some crew members from state broadcaster ZBC and security personnel. Mr Mnangagwa, 75, said he had visited the injured in hospital. He condemned the violence as senseless and pleaded for unity. ""I am used to these attempts,"" he told state media.

Mr Mnangagwa came to power last November after ousting Mr Mugabe. He was evacuated from the scene soon after the blast. ""People started running in all directions and then immediately the president's motorcade left at a very high speed,"" an AFP news agency correspondent at the scene reported. President Mnangagwa (centre) was campaigning ahead of elections next month The elections are the first in Zimbabwe since Mr Mugabe was forced out after 37 years in power. ""Vice-President Mohadi is nursing some leg injuries but he is in good spirit,"" he was quoted as saying. Marry Chiwenga, the wife of Vice-President Chiwenga, was also injured and pictures on social media showed the president visiting her in hospital. Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa condemned the attack. ""Political violence of any nature from any quarter is totally unacceptable,"" he said. ""In the past 38 years political violence has been a permanent feature and an anticipated ritual... which we must expunge."" The US Embassy in Harare tweeted ""thoughts & prayers"".

"The route will now be known as the London North Eastern Railway (LNER), a name last used in the 1940s Rail services on the East Coast Main Line are back under government control, following the failure of the franchise. Stagecoach and Virgin Trains, which had a 90% and 10% stake in the venture respectively, handed over control on Sunday after running it since 2015. The Department for Transport will run the service until a new public-private partnership can be appointed in 2020. The London to Edinburgh line connects London King's Cross to stations in the north and Scotland. The route - which services stations including York, Leeds, Newcastle, Aberdeen and Inverness - will now be known as the London North Eastern Railway (LNER), a name last used in the 1940s. The first LNER train left Newcastle at 07:54 BST on Sunday and is due to arrive at London King's Cross at 10:52. State takeover for failed rail franchise The companies promised to pay Â£3.3bn to run the franchise until 2023, but at the end of last year it had become clear they were running into trouble. In February it was announced that the franchise would end early, leading to accusations the government was bailing them out. This is the third time a franchise on the East Coast Main Line has failed. In 2005, GNER signed a Â£1.35bn, 10-year deal in what was then the biggest contract in European railway history. One year later it was stripped of the route. In August 2007, National Express agreed a Â£1.4bn deal, but then handed it back to the government in 2009 amid the financial crisis. It was then government-run until Stagecoach and Virgin's Â£3.3bn bid in 2015. Read more:What went wrong at the East Coast Main Line? Last month, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the franchise had failed because Stagecoach and Virgin Trains had ""got their bid wrong"", overestimating the profitability of the line. He told the House of Commons that Stagecoach and Virgin had lost almost Â£200m, but there had not been a loss to taxpayers ""at this time"". Mr Grayling has also rejected accusations from Labour and trade unions that his decision to end the deal early was a ""bailout"" worth Â£2bn. ""Stagecoach will be held to all of its contractual obligations in full,"" he said. The rail companies blamed their problems on Network Rail, saying it had failed to upgrade the line which would have allowed them to run more frequent services. Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC) managing director David Horne will be in the same role at LNER and all VTEC staff will transfer to the new franchise. As a result of the change Â£8m will be spent on marketing, rebranding, IT systems and staffing, according to LNER. The route connects London King's Cross to stations in the north and Scotland A report from VTEC said the route had experienced a 5% growth in passenger numbers in recent months, building on the 21.8 million journeys taken in 2017/18, up 1.3 million from when the franchise began. Stagecoach chief executive Martin Griffiths said the company's staff could be ""fiercely proud of everything they've achieved"". ""The growth we're now seeing proves our initiatives are paying off and the railway we hand over to LNER is not only better than we inherited, but one that has been positively transformed for customers,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Cedella Roman: ""I didn't understand what was going on"" A young French woman who went for an evening jog along a Canadian beach spent two weeks in US immigration detention after straying across the border. Cedella Roman, 19, who was visiting her mother in British Columbia, decided to run along the beach that leads to Canada's border with the United States on 21 May. Ms Roman told Canadian media she turned on to a dirt path for a few metres as the tide rose, and stopped to take a picture before retracing her steps. She was then confronted by two US border patrol agents who arrested her for crossing into Blaine, Washington. ""He started telling me that I had crossed the border illegally and I told him I really did not do it on purpose,""Ms Roman told Radio-Canada (in French),external. The French national thought that she might be given a warning or, at worst, be fined. ""I did not think they would put me in jail,"" she said. Who has said what about US border crisis US federal prison for immigration detainees Trump sets targets on immigration cases Migrant families separation: The big picture explained But to jail she did go, as the officers took her more than 220km (136 miles) south to the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, a privately run immigration prison in Washington state. With no identification on her and just the clothes she was wearing, Ms Roman started to realise the gravity of her situation. ""They asked me to remove all my personal belongings with my jewellery, they searched me everywhere,""Ms Roman told the Canadian broadcaster CBC,external. ""Then I understood it was getting very serious, and I started to cry a bit."" She said she was held in a room with about 100 other people. ""We were locked up all the time and in the yard there was barbed wire and dogs,"" she told French news agency AFP. ""We tried to help each other, there was a good atmosphere. ""Seeing people who had come from Africa and elsewhere locked up for trying to cross the border, it put my experience into perspective."" She was allowed to contact her mother, Christiane Ferne, who came to the detention facility with Ms Roman's passport and work permit. But US officials would not let her leave until Canadian immigration authorities first confirmed she was allowed back into the country. Both sides eventually agreed she could return to Canada, but only 15 days after Ms Roman first set off on her jog. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Jackie (left) and Gillian (right) are twins but have very different BMIs People might think battling obesity is down to sheer willpower, but medical research says otherwise. Here are five potentially surprising factors that can affect your weight, as unearthed byThe Truth About Obesity. Gillian and Jackie are twins - but one weighs over six stone (41kg) more than the other. Prof Tim Spector has been tracking their progress over 25 years, as part of the Twins Research UK study. He believes a lot of their weight differences are down to the tiny organisms - microbes - that live deep in the gut. ""Every time you eat anything, you're feeding a hundred trillion microbes. You're never dining alone,"" he says. Can we trust BMI to measure obesity? Is it wrong to be blunt about obesity? A stool sample from each twin revealed Gillian, the thinner of the two, had a very diverse range of microbes, whereas Jackie had very few species living in her gut. ""The greater the diversity, the skinnier the person.  If you're carrying too much weight, your microbes aren't as diverse as they should be,"" says Prof Spector, who found the same pattern in a study of 5,000 people. Having a healthy and varied diet, rich in different sources of fibre, has been shown to create a more diverse range of gut microbes. Prof Spector warns most Britons eat only half the fibre they should. Good sources of dietary fibre include: wholegrain breakfast cereals fruits, including berries and pears vegetables, such as broccoli and carrots beans pulses nuts Why do some people diligently follow diets and exercise regularly but still struggle to see results, while others do very little and don't pile on the pounds? Scientists at Cambridge University believe 40-70% of the effect on our weight is down to variation in the genes we inherit. ""It is a lottery,"" says Prof Sadaf Farooqi. ""It is now very clear that genes are involved in regulating our weight, and if you have a particular fault in some genes that can be enough to drive obesity."" Particular genes can affect a person's appetite, how much food they want to eat and what type of food they might prefer. Genes can also affect how we burn calories and whether our bodies can efficiently handle fat. There are at least 100 that can affect weight, including one called MC4R. It is thought about one in every 1,000 people carries a defective version of the MC4R gene, which works in the brain to control hunger and appetite. People with a fault in this gene tend to be more hungry and crave higher fat foods. Prof Farooqi says: ""There's not really anything you can do about your genes, but for some people, knowing that genes may increase their chances of gaining weight can help them to deal with changes in diet and exercise.""

Can we trust BMI to measure obesity? There's some truth to the old saying: ""Breakfast like a king, lunch like a lord and dinner like a pauper,"" but not for the reasons you might think. Obesity expert Dr James Brown says the later we eat, the more likely we are to gain weight. Not because we're less active at night, as is commonly believed, but because of our internal body clocks. ""The body is set-up to handle calories much more efficiently during the daytime period when it's light than it is at night when it's dark"" he says. For that reason, people who do shift-work and erratic hours might face a particular battle to stave off weight gain. During the night our bodies struggle to digest fats and sugars so eating the bulk of calories before about 19:00 can help you lose weight or prevent you from gaining it in the first place. ""Go to work on an egg"" isn't a bad idea Over the past decade, the average dinnertime in Britain has moved from 17:00 to around 20:00, and this has contributed to rising obesity levels, according to Dr Brown. But today's working patterns and hectic lifestyles aside, there are things we can do that will make a difference to our waistlines. Skipping breakfast or just having a piece of toast is a no-no in Dr Brown's book. Instead, eating something with lots of protein and some fat, as well as carbohydrates - such as eggs on wholegrain toast - will make you feel fuller for longer. Follow that up with a substantial nutritious lunch, and have something lighter at dinnertime. TheBehavioural Insights Team,externalsuggests Britons are bad at keeping track of how much they eat, and that calorie consumption is being underestimated by 30-50% as a result. Behavioural scientist Hugo Harper suggests a number of ways to subconsciously change your eating behaviour, rather than rely on calorie counting. For example, removing visual temptations might be more effective than relying on conscious willpower. So don't have unhealthy snacks out on the kitchen counter - put a fruit bowl or healthy snacks in reach instead. Don't sit down with a whole packet of biscuits in front of the television, put the number you plan to eat on a plate and take that through instead. Dr Harper also encourages substitution behaviours - swapping to lower calorie alternatives of favourite foods rather than trying to banish them all together. Opt for diet versions of soft drinks, for example. And reducing portion sizes can also be more effective than trying to cut out that ritual afternoon tea with a chocolate biscuit (or is that just us?). Not now Fido! ""People don't tend to notice a difference when their portion sizes are reduced by 5-10%,"" Dr Harper says. There is a tendency to eat without thinking about it, so following the serving suggestions on food packets and using a smaller plate when dishing up dinner can prevent someone absent-mindedly chomping through excess calories. The success of bariatric surgery isn't just down to creating a smaller stomach, but the change in hormones it creates. Our appetites are controlled by our hormones and it has been discovered that bariatric surgery - the most effective treatment of obesity - makes the hormones that make us feel full increase and the ones that make us feel hungry drop in number. But its a major operation that involves reducing the size of the stomach by up to 90% and is only carried out on people with a BMI of at least 35. Researchers at Imperial College London have recreated the gut hormones that cause appetite changes after bariatric surgery and are using this for a new clinical trial. A mixture of three hormones are given to patients as an injection every day for four weeks. ""Patients are feeling less hungry, they're eating less and they're losing between 2-8kg (4-17lb) in just 28 days,"" says Dr Tricia Tan.

"Knowing your weight and height is enough to calculate your body mass index You've been using ourfat calculatorin your droves, working out your BMI (body mass index) and comparing the result with people in your age group and your part of the UK. But a few people have been critical. They say using BMI to measure whether they are healthy, overweight or obese is misleading. So what's the truth? Can we trust what it tells us? Firstly, it is a quick and easy way of working out whether you are in the healthy category by using two simple measures - weight and height. Most doctors say it is the best method they have, it's pretty accurate, can be measured simply in clinic and is acceptable to patients. ""It works in the vast majority of people, the vast majority of time,"" says Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow. ""If two people are the same height and one has a BMI of 25 and the other a BMI of 40, then excess body fat is the reason."" Measuring BMI is also much more accurate and potentially less embarrassing than measuring someone'swaist circumference,external, which is also a good guide. BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight by the square of their height.  Your BMI is[bmi_result]which is in the[bmi_category]category. BMI is a standard way of measuring if people are a healthy weight for their height. For most adults 18.5 to 24.9 is the healthy range. Your BMI is[comparative]the average of[bmi_score]for a [gender_singular] in your age group ([user_age_group]) in [user_country].

In[region], the figure is about[percentage]%of [gender_plural]. Wales BMI data is gatherered through self measurement so may be an underestimate The information you've given us indicates you could be underweight. There can be health risks associated with a low BMI such as anaemia, osteoporosis, a weakened immune system and fertility problems. This is not a medical diagnostic tool so don't panic if this isn't the result you were expecting to see. If you're concerned about your weight, or your health in general, speak to a healthcare professional such as your GP.  Follow the links for more information and advice on what to do if you're underweight: You're in the healthy range which is great. Research shows that having a healthy BMI can reduce your risk of serious health problems, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and some cancers. But not all people with a BMI in this range have a lower risk. Other factors such as smoking, high blood cholesterol or high blood pressure will increase your risk. If you're of Asian descent you have a higher risk of heart disease and diabetes at a lower BMI and waist circumference. A healthy BMI for you would be 18.5-23.

Doctors say that carrying too much fat around your belly can increase your risk of health problems. Excess fat in this area can stress internal organs - even if your BMI is in the healthy range.   Your waist size is[size] For [gender_plural], the NHS says a waist size of: 80cm (31.5 inches) or more means an increased risk of health problems 88cm (34 inches) or more means a very high risk of health problems 94cm (37 inches) or more means an increased risk of health problems 102cm (40 inches) or more means a very high risk of health problems People from non-white ethnic groupsmay be at risk at a lower waist size How to check your waist with just a piece of string If you can't see the calculatortap or click here,external. No, not all. And this provoked a few comments along these lines: ""Why, in this day and age, are you using BMI to tell people they are overweight? It is an outdated method that does not take into consideration muscle and actual health!  I am extremely fit and healthy with a low body fat percentage, yet your BMI tells me (and many more self-conscious girls) that I am overweight!"" There are some people who carry a lot of muscle and little fat, like bodybuilders, boxers and rugby players. Muscle is much denser than fat so they may end up with a BMI that classes them as obese, despite the fact they may be fit and healthy. Some professional rugby players will be classed as obese because of their high muscle mass - but this is rare But this is thought to apply to fewer than 1% of the population. Most people aren't extreme athletes. Tim Cole, professor of medical statistics, at University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said BMI was ""still extremely relevant"". ""You don't see many bodybuilders around but you do see lots of people with large waists. Many people get exercised about that wrongly."" As people age, they lose muscle and may be classed in the ""healthy weight"" range even though they may be carrying excess fat. This is particularly true of smokers. BMI also doesn't apply to pregnant women, and some ethnic groups have a higher risk of health problems at lower BMI levels. It can't measure how much excess fat we have in our bodies - as opposed to muscle and bone - because that would require some pretty complicated and expensive medical procedures, which just aren't practical to carry out on the whole population. What it does do is give a healthy weight range for a particular height, taking into account variations in body shape - and it provides a good starting point for the majority of people. It also doesn't measure how fat is distributed throughout the body (some fat is ok; too much in the wrong place is a risk). Research shows that people who carry a lot of fat around their waists are at higher risk of health problems than those with more fat around their thighs and buttocks. They are more likely to have fat stored in their abdomen around key organs, which could increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. So waist size may be a better way to monitor your health than BMI. That's why our calculator included an option for giving your waist size too. ""If people think they have lots of muscle mass, their waists should be lower for a given BMI - so they can easily check,"" says Prof Sattar. find the bottom of your ribs and the top of your hips wrap a tape measure around your waist midway between these points breathe out naturally before taking the measurement Regardless of your height or BMI, you should try to lose weight if your waist is: men - 94cm (37ins) or more women - 80cm (31.5ins) or more On its own, it can't. But doctors use BMI in conjunction with other measures - like blood pressure, cholesterol and family history - to work out an individual's risk of type 2 diabetes or heart disease, for example. Body mass index is not specific to any particular health risk - and that's its strength, experts say. However, a BMI above the healthy range or too much fat around the waist is known to increase the risk of serious health problems, including stroke and certain cancers. One person said of the BBC calculator: ""Your unscientific method of calculating 'fatness' is an unhelpful tool that dehumanises those who are obese or overweight, shaming them into losing weight and threatening their fragile relationship with their bodies."" There was no intention of shaming people - merely offering a way of finding out about your own weight because excess fat is the cause of an increased risk of a range of diseases. If you think you would like to lose some weight, you should go and see your GP for advice first.

"The plan proposes bans on sweets and junk food promotions in the aisles and online Sweets and fatty snacks sold at checkouts and as part of supermarket deals will be banned under new government proposals to halve childhood obesity in England by 2030. Tighter restrictions on junk food ads on TV and online are also planned, as well as mandatory calorie labelling on restaurant menus. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the measures gave ""power to parents to make healthier choices"". The plans have been broadly welcomed. The proposals form part of the government's updated Childhood Obesity Plan, which was widely criticised for being too weak when it was launched two years ago. What to do if your child is overweight Is UK one of the worst child obesity nations? Will new obesity measures help you? With one in three children now overweight or obese by the age of 11, this updated plan targets stores, industry and advertisers that use ""pester power"" to sell food high in fat, sugar and salt to children and families. It also pledges to ""help close the deprivation gap"" by looking at why children from poorer areas are more than twice as likely to be overweight. The plan encourages all primary schools to introduce a daily ""active mile"" for children. Official advice recommends children should do 60 minutes of activity per day. The measures, which will open for consultation by the end of the year, include: Banning the sale of sweets and snacks at checkouts, shop entrances and in buy-one-get-one-free deals New restrictions on advertising unhealthy food to children on TV and online, which could include a pre-9pm ban Clear calorie labelling in restaurants, cafes and takeaways, to help families know what they are eating Ending the sale of energy drinks containing high levels of caffeine, to children Mr Hunt told the BBC that under the proposals all the big restaurant chains would have to provide calorie labelling, but there could be possible exemptions for smaller businesses. He said the cost of obesity was too great to ignore. ""Parents are asking for help - we know that over three quarters of parents find offers for sugary sweets and snacks at checkouts annoying. ""It's our job to give power to parents to make healthier choices, and to make their life easier in doing so."" Halving childhood obesity in England in the next 12 years would mean 700,000 fewer children being obese by 2030, the government said. Five surprising things that affect weight Can we trust BMI to measure obesity? Are 22,000 children 'severely obese'? Prof Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, called the plan ""strong, robust and bold"" while Public Health England said the steps announced would help ""turn the tide"" on the obesity epidemic. Prof Russell Viner, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the measures would ""help all families to make healthy choices and make a real difference in the lives of children and young people"". Tim Elwell-Sutton, assistant director at the Health Foundation, said it was a ""positive step forward"" but ""we await to see how these ideas will be turned into action"", while Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, urged ""swift action"" to ""make these commitments a reality"". The British Retail Consortium said retailers were ""fully committed"" to the health of their customers. Some supermarkets, including Tesco, Aldi and Waitrose, have already stopped selling sweets and chocolate at checkouts. Scotland's First Minister set atarget to cut child obesity by half by 2030in May. Scotland's Public Health Minister, Aileen Campbell, said the government would be setting out its diet and healthy weight delivery plan ""very soon"", adding that it had been ""clear in its intention"" to tackle price promotions on junk food. A sugar taxon manufacturers who sell high-sugar drinks came into force in April in the UK. It means some drinks have increased in price while other brands have cut the sugar content of their drinks to avoid the levy. The tax currently doesn't cover flavoured milk drinks but it could in the future. The jury is still out on whether the tax will have the intended effect of putting people off buying and consuming sugary soft drinks, which are thought to be the biggest contributor to obesity. Public Health England has also started a programme challenging manufacturers to reduce sugar content in products like cakes, biscuits and cereals by 20% over the next four years. The UK has one of the highest proportions of overweight and obese children in the EU. In England, 22% of children are overweight or obese when they start school at the age of four or five, increasing to 34% during their time at primary school. Recent figures show thatone in 25 children aged 10 or 11 is severely obese. Children are measured in different ways and at different ages across the UK. In Wales, 26% of children aged four to five are overweight or obese, and in Scotland 14% of under-16s are at risk of obesity. Childhood obesity is a worldwide problem, but it's estimated to cost the UK economy Â£27bn a year, and the NHS around Â£5bn, in treating illnesses related to the issue, such as type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.

"Thousands of protesters were in London on Saturday, calling for a vote on any final deal seeing the UK leave the European Union. But why were the marchers insisting on another say over Brexit? Before Saturday, Dodo Pearce had never joined a protest in her life. But the 69-year-old decided to travel from South Normanton in Derbyshire to call for a ""People's Vote"". ""I'm hoping it's not too late, but we have got to take the chance for goodness sake,"" she said. ""These crowds of people make me emotional. I've seen signs about futures being stolen and it brings tears to my eyes. I want to march and I want a vote."" Her husband, John Pearce, carried a placard saying ""grumpy old Brits"". ""The first referendum was won on spurious information from both sides,"" he said. ""Now we know a lot more, I think people have changed their minds, both ways, and deserve a chance to vote."" Marchers demand final Brexit deal vote PM 'not bluffing' over no-deal Brexit Reality Check: Will there be a Brexit dividend? Cinzia Sangiovanni has lived in the UK for 19 years, and lives in south London with her British husband and two children. The whole family took part in the march, as three of them hold Italian passports - and she fears for their future without a say on the deal. ""I want to march because I feel my rights are under threat,"" she said. ""If I was told to, I wouldn't be able to just turn around and go back to Italy. I just worry for the future."" Dodo and John Pearce travelled from Derbyshire to join the march Among the sea of EU flags was Erika Gallacher, who moved from Carlisle to London 11 years ago. ""I have friends who voted a different way to me, but I also have a lot of friends from the EU,"" she said. ""I work for a university and I'm worried about the students and what will happen to them. ""But for me, I also worry about my future, starting a family and bringing up children. I cannot see any good to it for them."" Leo Buckley was prominent at the head of the march with his placard, reading: ""Brexit has stolen my future."" The 16-year-old from Hampshire said: ""I think my placard says it all. ""It is stealing it economically - we have already seen the drop in the pound and the loss of jobs - so I will struggle to find employment and be worse off when I do. ""And also socially - look at the rise in hate crime and xenophobia. I don't want Brexit to become the poster boy of a return to attitudes from the 1930s."" Leo Buckley worried for young people's futures in the UK after Brexit A group calling themselves the ""Suffolk EU Alliance"" were also out in force carrying placards and plastered in stickers stating their cause. Christine Speer was one of them - originally from Canada, but a British citizen for 50 years who considers herself a ""citizen of nowhere"". ""The EU has its problems, but there are a number of problems at the time of the referendum that weren't because of the EU - the government was responsible,"" she said. ""Some people who voted for Brexit will actually find they are worse off. ""Ideally it would be better if Brexit didn't happen, but if it does, the public needs to have a say."" Pound remains close to post-Brexit high How has the economy fared since the Brexit vote? Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? Dr Horst-Dieter Haas proudly carried his German flag as he attended the march. He married a British woman, but the pair spent 30 years in his home country, bringing up their children, before moving to the UK. He has been working in the NHS since 2005, but says he will quit if Brexit goes ahead. He added: ""It is already impacting the NHS. We haven't got enough doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, we don't even have enough money, and that will all be worse if Brexit happens. ""The NHS is not performing and there are too many lies about the benefits. I will definitely be stopping if we leave."" German doctor Horst-Dieter Haas marched with his British wife Lesley But as the pro-EU protest reached its rally point in Parliament Square, another was heading in the same direction. The UK Unity and Freedom march said it was focusing on ""freedom from the EU, freedom from terror, freedom of speech, freedom from Sharia law, and unity of all people, irrespective of race or creed"". The pro-Brexit march was significantly smaller, but their voices rang out as they walked along Millbank, with supporters chanting for ""our country back"" and singing Rule, Britannia! Shazia Hobbs, who was speaking at the event, criticised those on the opposing protest. ""That march is silly,"" she said. ""We voted to leave so we should leave. ""What do they want, best of three? We voted for Brexit."" Shazia Hobbs is a campaigner and regularly speaks to events One woman, who didn't want to be named, had travelled from Brighton to join the march. She said: ""I'm on this march because I am a patriot. The EU is an undemocratic and authoritarian establishment. We need to be a self-governing nation."" And a man, who also did not want to be named, added: ""I don't like big government. That is what the EU is."" Whether either protest will impact the government's next steps is yet to be seen.

"Anti-Brexit campaigners are preparing to march to Parliament Square Senior Cabinet ministers have insisted the UK is prepared to walk away from Brexit talks without a deal, on the second anniversary of the referendum. Liam Fox said Theresa May was ""not bluffing"" over her threat to quit negotiations, while Boris Johnson called for a ""full British Brexit"". It comes as anti-Brexit campaigners, who want the public to have the final say on the UK's departure, prepare to march in London later. They say Brexit is ""not a done deal"". Brexit: All you need to know Reality Check: Will there be a Brexit dividend? Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? People's Vote - which wants a referendum on any exit deal - said people must make their ""voices heard"" about the ""damage"" of leaving next year without agreement. Speakers at the demo will include actor Sir Tony Robinson and campaigner Gina Miller, who fought a successful legal battle last year to ensure the UK could not trigger talks on leaving without the approval of Parliament. The UK voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.9% to 48.1% in a referendum held on 23 June 2016. This video can not be played Liam Fox says Theresa May is not bluffing over no-deal Brexit The UK is due to leave on 29 March 2019, 46 years after it first joined the European Economic Community, the forerunner to the EU. But the People's Vote campaign says this should happen only if the withdrawal deal negotiated by Mrs May and the other 27 EU members is approved in another public vote. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC it was in the interests of both sides to have a deal - but it was ""essential"" the EU understood that the UK could walk away if the terms offered were not good enough. ""The prime minister has always said no deal is better than a bad deal,"" Mr Fox said in an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, which was recorded on Wednesday - beforeFriday's warning from Airbusthat it might cease manufacturing in the UK in such a scenario. ""It is essential as we enter the next phase of the negotiations that the EU understands that and believes it... I think our negotiating partners would not be wise if they thought our PM was bluffing."" Meanwhile,Brexit Secretary David Davis told the Daily Express,externalthe prime minister was going to get a ""good deal"" from Brussels and Brexit was going to be ""fantastic"". ""The best option is leaving with a good deal but you've got to be able to walk away from the table,"" he said. Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Why is Brexit taking so long? Andwriting in the Sun, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson,externalwarned the prime minister not to allow ""bog roll Brexit"" that is ""soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long"" - calling for a ""full British Brexit"" instead. Mr Johnson said people ""just want us to get on with it"". By BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley Two years on from the referendum, there are two very different messages today. One is that Brexit is not a ""done deal"". That's the argument from the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable who will take part in a march in central London today. On the other side, there is optimism and defiance from key Brexiteers like Boris Johnson. Mr Johnson says the UK is confident and open. The government firmly opposes a vote on the final deal - Mr Johnson believes people want the government to just get on with it. Nine months before the UK is due to officially leave the EU, there are still very different visions. Labour said Mr Fox's comments about a no-deal Brexit were the ""height of irresponsibility"". ""The next time Liam Fox parrots the slogan no deal is better than a bad deal he should give some thought to the 14,000 people who work for Airbus, and the thousands of other people who have jobs dependent on trade with Europe,"" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. Both the prime minister and Labour leader have rejected calls for another public vote, saying the will of the people expressed in the 2016 ballot was clear, although many Labour MPs now want another referendum. Organisers of Saturday's demo say people ""from all walks of life"" will be present, demonstrating the ""growing popular demand"" for another vote. Beginning in Pall Mall and ending outside the Houses of Parliament, the protest is part of a ""summer of action"" by campaign groups designed to increase pressure on Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. This video can not be played Anti-Brexit campaigner Femi Oluwole wants the Labour leader to back calls for a referendum on the final deal By taking the UK out of the EU's single market and customs union, they say the Conservative government ""remains intent"" on a so-called hard Brexit that will - they say - destroy jobs and damage public services. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Vince Cable, who will be at the march, told BBC Breakfast: ""I think the public in general... do see there is a mess."" He added: ""We've only got a year to go. And I think for the big companies that employ hundreds of thousands of workers in the UK... they want some clarity about what the trading relationships will be and there is absolutely none whatever."" But Conservative MP Peter Bone - who supports Brexit - said if there were a second vote, the leave campaign would win again. ""The vast, vast majority of people, whether they are Leavers or Remainers, just want us to get on and come out this dreadful European Union super-state,"" he said. ""There were 17.4 million people that voted for leave and if there are a few thousand in London complaining about it - that doesn't seem to really make much difference."" The government is giving Parliament a vote on the final deal, if one is reached, in the autumn - but it remains unclear what will happen if they reject it.

"Around 230 migrants were rescued by German ship Lifeline on Thursday Italy has no right to ask Malta to accept the stranded migrant rescue ship Lifeline, according to Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said that Malta should take in the 226 migrants and arrest the crew. But the Maltese leader responded defiantly, saying: ""We're a sovereign country and nobody should dictate what we can and cannot do"". A similar case earlier this month led Spain to accept 630 migrants. Both Italy and Malta refused to allow the migrant rescue ship Aquarius to dock in the previous incident,before the Spanish port of Valencia intervened. The Lifeline, which is operated by German charity Mission Lifeline, picked up around 230 migrants in the Mediterranean on Thursday. The charity said on Saturday that the ship was in international waters to the south of Malta. Italy's transport minister accused Malta of an ""inhumane"" and ""absurd"" decision for refusing to accept the vessel, but Malta maintains that the ship is under Italian jurisdiction. However, the Maltese army says it is providing humanitarian supplies to the stranded vessel. Italy's new populist coalition government, which has taken a harsh stance on immigration, has warned that it will impound the Lifeline vessel, as well as another migrant rescue ship. It accuses the Lifeline of breaking the law by taking migrants onboard, in spite of a warning by the Italian authorities that the Libyan coastguards were conducting a rescue operation. Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? The EU has been supporting and training the Libyan coastguard to return migrants to the North African country - even if they are not from there -but there have been reports of widespread human rights abuses of migrantswhen they arrive. As the row over the Lifeline continues, other migrant rescues have continued. Danish shipping company Maersk Line said one of its container ships rescued 113 migrants off the southern Italian coast on Friday. Meanwhile, Maltese authorities asked the Aquarius,the ship at the centre of the stand-off earlier this month, to rescue a migrant boat in distress near the Tunisian coast. However, the crew of the Aquarius claim that Maltese authorities have refused to allow it permission to dock at any of its ports in the future, regardless of whether or not it has migrants onboard, BBC correspondent Gavin Lee reports. This video can not be played Gavin Lee reports from on board the Aquarius The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? The EU is due to hold a summit on Sunday to discuss illegal migration to Europe, butItaly's government has said it will not sign up to any plan unless help for its country is prioritised. More than 600,000 migrants have reached Italy's shores during the past four years. The new government says it plans to deport around half a million undocumented arrivals. Over 1,000 people have drowned while crossing the Mediterranean so far this year,external, according to the UN's refugee agency, with 220 people believed to have died in the space of several days last week.

"Sarah Sanders said she would continue to treat those with opposing views ""respectfully"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was kicked out of a restaurant on Friday night because she works for President Donald Trump. A co-owner of the Red Hen in Lexington, Virginia, asked Ms Sanders and her family to leave as a protest against the Trump administration. Ms Sanders tweeted that ""her actions say far more about her than about me"". Stephanie Wilkinson said she believed Ms Sanders worked for an ""inhumane and unethical"" administration. She told the Washington Post,externalthat she decided to ask the Trump spokeswoman to leave the 26-seat, ""farm-to-table"" restaurant after talking to her staff. ""Tell me what you want me to do. I can ask her to leave,"" she said she told them. ""They said yes."" The incident comes days afterHomeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was booed at a Mexican restaurantin Washington DC. Both cases come amid increasing pressure on the US government over its controversial policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the Mexican border. Migrant families separation: The big picture explained Who has said what about US border crisis Psychological impact on separated children A decision by the administration to criminally prosecute every undocumented migrant crossing the border led to some 2,300 children being separated from their parents in May and June, and sparked a global wave of outrage. President Trump has now halted family separations but says he remains committed to the ""zero tolerance"" policy. Critics of the Red Hen's decision said that it was discriminatory. However, others compared the restaurant's decision toa recent Supreme Court ruling in favour of a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, in a case seen by many conservatives as a test for religious freedom.

"A man has received a five-year football banning order after a video appearing to show fans singing anti-Semitic songs at the World Cup circulated online. Michael Herbert, 57, from Derby, was given the ban on Saturday at Leicester Magistrates' Court. Two other men, aged 52 and 58, appeared at Leeds Magistrates' Court, where the case has been adjourned until Tuesday. All three had been served with notices by police under section 21B of the Football Spectators Act 1989. Following a separate incident on a train near Moscow on Sunday, 17 June, Paul Johnson, of Banbury, Oxfordshire, was served with a 21B notice under the Football Spectators Act 1989. The 25-year-old received a three-year football banning order at Oxford Magistrates' Court. Football banning orders can last between three and 10 years and prevent an individual attending matches at home and abroad. Breaching an order is punishable by a maximum of six months in prison or a fine of Â£5,000, or both. Fans can have more than one banning order imposed.

"Father Capella (left, with his lawyer) was tried at the Vatican A former Vatican diplomat has been sentenced to five years in prison for child pornography offences. Monsignor Carlo Alberto Capella pleaded guilty at a Vatican court, which heard that indecent images of children and a video were found on his mobile phone. He said he had suffered a personal crisis while working at the Vatican embassy in Washington DC. The priest was recalled from the US last year after authorities notified the Vatican of their suspicions. The US had asked that Capella's diplomatic immunity be lifted so he could face charges there. Canadian police later issued an arrest warrant for Capella, an Italian. The former diplomat will serve his sentence in the Vatican's small prison, and pay a fine of â¬5,000 (Â£4,400; $5,800). A prosecution witness told the court that an examination of the priest's personal devices revealed more than 40 incriminating images, including an explicit video involving a small child. Sex abuse and the Catholic Church Pope renews anti-sexual abuse panel Pope Francis: 'Decisive' action on child abuse needed The case is the latest allegation involving child sexual abuse to hit the Catholic Church. All of Chile's 34 bishops offered to resign in Mayfollowing a child sex scandal and a cover up. Pope Francis has since accepted three of their resignations. Also in May,Australia convicted the archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson,of concealing historic child sexual abuse in the 1970s.He has stepped aside from his duties but not resigned as archbishop. In 2013, the Holy See recalled and defrocked its envoy to the Dominican Republic, Jozef Wesolowski, and ordered he be tried for child sex offences. Wesolowski was found dead in 2015 before he could stand trial.

"The girls were stuck at Birmingham Airport for nearly 24 hours A group of dancers delayed for almost 24 hours have made it to the second part of the ""biggest competition of their lives"". The girls, aged between 10 and 13, missed the first part of the Dance World Cup event in Barcelona. But the team, who are from a Cardiff club and representing Wales, made it to the display on Saturday evening. Airline Vueling blamed technical issues with an aircraft and an air traffic control strike in France for the delay. The Planet Gymnastics acro dance team's 13:30 BST flight on Friday was cancelled but, after a day at Birmingham Airport, they took off at about 14:00 BST on Saturday afternoon. The dancers have accused the Spanish budget airline of ""not keeping them in the loop"" although Vueling did put them up in a hotel at Birmingham Airport overnight. The girls missed Friday's World Cup opening ceremony and their first event on Saturday morning. The club made it to Barcelona in time to perform Team organiser Eirian Thomas admitted there had been ""some tears"". ""It's so disappointing for the girls, they've been gearing up for this for more than six months,"" said Ms Thomas, whose daughter Mairwen, 10, is in the group. The club have raised more than Â£3,000 to help to pay for the trip to compete against 50 nations and 5,000 other competitors. ""This is all their world has been about for months,"" Ms Thomas added. ""The girls were disappointed to miss the opening ceremony as we were meant to take part,"" added Ms Thomas. ""So we sang the Welsh anthem in the departure lounge and the girls did some moves."" A spokeswoman for Vueling confirmed there had been ""technical issues"" with the plane meaning it could not fly. She added that sending another plane would have taken longer and the company understood it had been a ""painful situation for the clients"".

"Vinnie Paul saw his brother and bandmate assassinated on stage Vinnie Paul, co-founder and drummer of the metal band Pantera, has died aged 54, the band announced on Facebook. ""Vincent Paul Abbott aka Vinnie Paul has passed away,"" a statement said. There was no cause of death given. Paul started Pantera in 1981 with his brother, ""Dimebag"" Darrell Abbott - the pair were sons to the country-western producer Jerry Abbott. The band had a number one album in 1994 and earned four Grammy nominations, but disbanded in 2003 amid rumours of a rift. Paul said at the time the breakup was a result of the band's singer, Phil Anselmo, wanting to move on. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

"Raheem Sterling was replaced by Marcus Rashford during the 2-1 victory over Tunisia after a disappointing performance England continue their World Cup adventure against Panama with manager Gareth Southgate looking to build on their first opening-game win at a major tournament since 2006. Victory for England in Sunday's 13:00 BST match in Nizhny Novgorod will put them into the last 16. So what are the key factors to consider against the Central American underdogs? World Cup Daily: It's England Day.... again! Marcus Rashford is expected to replace Raheem Sterling in England's starting XI against Panama Raheem Sterling's projected absence from England's team courtesy of assistant managerSteve Holland's now infamous team-sheethas not come to pass. He gets another chance against Panama - but Marcus Rashford is ready to turn up the pressure if Sterling continues to misfire for England. No-one doubts Sterling's ability or attitude, confirmed with 18 league goals and 11 assists in Manchester City's title-winning campaign. He has matured and developed. Sterling's problem, one Rashford may eventually be able to exploit, is his lack of impact for England. The Manchester City man has the pace and movement to cause chaos but 21 internationals without a goal is a damning statistic. Southgate has huge faith in Sterling, the manager greeting him with a warm embrace after his disappointing night against Tunisia, and firmly believes he will deliver for England. Sterling must, however, start delivering soon or Southgate will be left with an interesting selection choice. Southgate will need more than 11 players to progress in this World Cup and the win over Tunisia provided promising indicators about the strength of his squad. As England struggled to break down the increasingly entrenched Tunisians, he made key changes to introduce Rashford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. And both did enough to mark themselves down as potential starters as England hopefully drill further down into this World Cup. Rashford's pace and running instantly troubled Tunisia but Loftus-Cheek was, if anything, even more impressive. Tall and powerful, he is an elegant presence on the ball and showed great self-confidence in possession plus a willingness to try the unorthodox that enabled England to gather late momentum building to Harry Kane's winner. Southgate, who also has the experienced Eric Dier to augment his midfield and Jamie Vardy's pace in attack, wants his players to take responsibility and play with freedom. Rashford and Loftus-Cheek did exactly that. Southgate showed commendable foresight when he warned on arrival in Repino that England's squad must have the resilience to win games in ""the 93rd or 94th minute"" if required. And he was suitably impressed when England did exactly that to secure three points against Tunisia with Kane's injury-time header. Tunisia, once they had the lifeline of an equaliser, dug in and tested England's patience to the limit - and Panama will provide more of the same. Panama proved for 45 minutes against Belgium that they are organised and have the ability to frustrate. This will be their initial aim against England and Southgate will no doubt have prepared his players for this eventuality. To their credit, England did not fall into the trap Tunisia had set for them and refused to resort to long balls, preferring instead a willingness to allow John Stones and Harry Maguire to bring the ball out from the back as well as trying to deliver service from wide positions. More of the same will be needed in Nizhny Novgorod. Adolfo Machado has made 76 appearances for Panama but he was left on the bench for their 3-0 defeat by Belgium Panama's threat is a very obvious one - and one that will revive painful memories for England. Southgate's side must be wary of conceding throw-ins in dangerous positions as this will be bring the danger of Adolfo Machado into play. He has a trademark looping long throw and England need only to look back to Euro 2016 to know the pain this can inflict. Iceland's Aron Gunnarsson caused havoc for England in Nice using this ploy, leading to Ragnar Sigurdsson's goal. Panama lack serious quality but they are experienced, organised and physical. They may adopt a more positive approach as this is now a game they need to win - but the smart money is on coach Hernan Dario Gomez adopting an initial 'safety first' approach. Just watch the long throws. World Cup quiz: How much do you know about Panama? Blas Perez: The Panama striker with a tattoos Roman Torres: Panama's 'film star' footballer dreaming of beating England Panama captain Roman Torres is seen as a national icon and is one of the most experienced players in the squad England have been training in extremely mild conditions at their Zelenogorsk base with temperatures around 15 and 16C. As with their first game in Volgograd, they now travel to searing heat in Nizhny Novgorod, where the temperature will soar into the 30s. Southgate has been well aware of the taxing conditions but they acclimatised in Volgograd - although this game kicks off at 3pm local time, six hours hours earlier than against Tunisia. Defender John Stones has no worries: ""It was the flies more than anything else in Volgograd. That was something else. The heat didn't bother me and didn't hear any of the boys saying anything about it. ""The other night was a good test for us heat-wise."" This video can not be played World Cup Catch-Up: Everyone's buzzing for England Gareth Southgate was captured on camera leaping high into the air when Harry Kane scored England's winner against Tunisia. He will have to be more restrained, on the outside at least, should England score against Panama, having to protect that dislocated shoulder. Surely he will be able to follow doctors' orders if it means England secure a second Group G World Cup win.

"Xhaka and Shaqiri both used the Albanian nationalist gesture Serbia has hit out at a ""provocative"" double eagle celebration by two ethnic Albanian goalscorers in the World Cup. Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri scored for Switzerland who beat Serbia 2-1. Their gesture is a nationalist symbol representing the double headed eagle on Albania's national flag. Critics say it could inflame tensions among Serbian nationalists and ethnic Albanians. Albanian leaders applauded the pair. A pro-government Serbian newspaper said they had ""humiliated"" Switzerland. The celebration has brought political tensions in the Balkans on to the World Cup stage. Shaqiri scores 90th-minute winner for Swiss BBC Monitoring reports that in Serbia, pro-government newspaper Informer used a derogatory term for Albanians, saying ""the Albanian clan within 'clockmakers' team was sending poisoned arrows weeks before, so the match couldn't pass without a provocation"". Some Swiss papers also called the gesture a provocation betraying a lack of political sensitivity. Both players had earlier been booed by Serbian fans during the match. Allow Twitter content?

Shaqiri later sought to downplay his celebration, saying: ""It's just emotion. I'm very happy to score this goal. It's not more. I think we don't have to speak about this now."" Xhaka and Shaqiri's families are from Kosovo, where a violent Serbian crackdown on the Albanian population only ended with Nato military intervention in 1999. Kosovo turns 10 - but what does it still need to do? Xhaka's father spent three-and-a-half years as a political prisoner in Yugoslavia for his support for Kosovan independence. Shaqiri was born in Kosovo and his family fled to Switzerland as refugees. Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority declared independence in 2008 but Serbia, its ally Russia and most ethnic Serbs inside Kosovo do not recognise it. There had already been some tension between the Serbian and ethnic Albanian Swiss players before the game. Ethnic Albanians celebrate Shaqiri's winner in the Kosovan capital Pristina Shaqiri wears boots displaying the Swiss flag on one heel and the Kosovan flag on the other - but Serbian striker Aleksandar Mitrovic asked: ""If he loves Kosovo so much and decides to flaunt the flag, why did he refuse a chance to play for their team?""

Most Serbian media said the goal celebration was a provocation, but not all took a tone of outrage. Popular news portal B92 said the match had been made ""politically tense"" Widely read Blic said of Shaqiri: ""He first made us mourn and then explained after the match in Serbian language why he provoked"" Srbin.info said: ""Brutal provocation: Xhaka displays the Albanian eagle after scoring and infuriates all Serbs"" However Vecernje Novosti, Politika and state broadcaster RTS focused instead on a complaint by the Serbian football association over the referee's failure to award a penalty when Mitrovic was apparently wrestled to the ground by two Swiss players. The Serbian football association is also complaining about Shaqiri's boots, the goal celebrations and Albanian flags in the stands, they reported. It is not the first time that football has provided a flashpoint for the long and bitter rivalry between Serbia and Albania. In 2014a match between the Balkan nations was abandoned after a drone carrying an Albanian flag sparked a brawl. Ordinary Albanian fans had been banned from attending the game.

"This video can not be played (June 2018) Saudi women hit the road Saudi women are officially allowed to get behind the wheel, after a decades-old driving ban was lifted. The change was announced last September and Saudi Arabia issued the first licences to women earlier this month. It was the only country left in the world where women could not drive and families had to hire private chauffeurs for female relatives. However, the move comes amid an intensified crackdown on activists who campaigned for the right to drive. At least eight women's rights activists are being detained and could face trial in a counter-terrorism court and long prison sentences for their activism, human rights group Amnesty says. They include Loujain al-Hathloul, a well-known figure in the campaign for women's driving rights. Amnesty has also called for wider reforms in Saudi Arabia, where women remain subject to male guardianship laws. ""I was so excited that I couldn't sleep"" Five thing Saudi women still can't do In pictures: Saudi women get driving lessons Saudi women troll 'You won't drive' trend Watch: Saudi women prepare to hit the road Human rights groups in the kingdom have campaigned for years to allow women to drive. Dozens of women were arrested for driving in Riyadh in 1990 and some Saudi women began posting videos of themselves at the wheel in 2008, and between 2011 and 2014. Thousands of women could soon take to the roads. ""It is a historic moment for every Saudi woman,"" Saudi television presenter Sabika al-Dosari told the AFP news agency She said she was behind the wheel minutes after the end of the driving ban at midnight local time (21:00 GMT Saturday). Hannan Iskandar is kissed by her parents after driving legally for the first time in Al Khobar ""Those days of waiting long hours for a driver are over,"" said pharmacy student Hatoun bin Dakhil, 21. ""We no longer need a man."" By the BBC's Orla Guerin in Riyadh At the stroke of midnight local time, they were off. We were taken for a spin by one of the first women to get a driving licence here. She said she was honoured and happy to drive on home soil and hadn't slept for days with excitement. Along the way there were cheers from women and children and thumbs up from male drivers. As some Saudi women were driving into the history books, others were in prison. Several leading activists who had challenged the driving ban were arrested last month. They have been accused of treason. Women here may now be able to drive, but they still are not free to travel, marry, divorce or even leave prison without the permission of a male relative. Critics say that whatever the optics, the changes taking place here still amount to baby steps. On 5 June, 10 women became the first female licence-holders after swapping their foreign licences for Saudi ones in cities across the country. The Saudi authorities previously said they expected about 2,000 women to have received licences by the time the ban was lifted.

Saudi Arabia hosts its first ever women's cycle race End of ban reflects deep changes The lifting of the driving ban is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's programme to modernise some aspects of Saudi society.

"Boat skipper Jonathan Evans caught the incident on camera People have been warned to keep their distance from wild dolphins after a woman was photographed swimming with a cow and its calf. Boat skipper Jonathan Evans witnessed the incident at Ynys Lochtyn off the coast of Cardigan Bay in Ceredigion last month. He described the woman's behaviour as ""selfish"" and ""unsympathetic"". Ceredigion council said people should enjoy coastal activities but not disturb special wildlife and habitats. Mr Evans, from Dolphin Spotting Boat Trips, took photographs of the incident before intervening. He said: ""It was a family with two  kayaks - a mum, dad, little boy and little girl... they were within feet of the dolphins. ""The mum was in the water and was pursuing the dolphin repeatedly."" Conservationists say approaching dolphins can alter their behaviour and expose both humans and dolphins to disease and injury He was concerned the young girl was also going to enter the water so shouted over to the kayakers. ""We needed to explain they were in a conservation area and it was against the law to swim with dolphins,"" he said. He later reported the incident to the marine protected area officer.

The man risking his life to save pink dolphins Rare attacks by dolphins on porpoises photographed ""I have sympathy for the need for people feel to get close to these animals,"" he said. ""I'm not the person to be lecturing about visiting dolphins when we run a boat trip business but they probably don't know the rules and it's worth going over to them and explaining the rules.

A spokeswoman for Sea Watch Foundation urged people not to closely approach bottlenose dolphin. The incident was reported to the marine protected area officer She said: ""While dolphins are charismatic animals, they are also large and powerful predators that have the potential to seriously injure a person. ""Persistent pursuit of dolphins can also lead to long term behavioural changes that can affect the survival of the population as a whole."" Ceredigion council's cabinet member responsible for economy and regeneration Rhodri Evans said: ""Cardigan Bay's wildlife is a great asset to the economy of our coastal communities and is also important in its own right. ""It is because of this that we ask residents and visitors to enjoy dolphin and other wildlife sightings at a safe distance.

"The girls were stuck at Birmingham Airport for nearly 24 hours A group of dancers delayed for almost 24 hours have made it to the second part of the ""biggest competition of their lives"". The girls, aged between 10 and 13, missed the first part of the Dance World Cup event in Barcelona. But the team, who are from a Cardiff club and representing Wales, made it to the display on Saturday evening. Airline Vueling blamed technical issues with an aircraft and an air traffic control strike in France for the delay. The Planet Gymnastics acro dance team's 13:30 BST flight on Friday was cancelled but, after a day at Birmingham Airport, they took off at about 14:00 BST on Saturday afternoon. The dancers have accused the Spanish budget airline of ""not keeping them in the loop"" although Vueling did put them up in a hotel at Birmingham Airport overnight. The girls missed Friday's World Cup opening ceremony and their first event on Saturday morning. The club made it to Barcelona in time to perform Team organiser Eirian Thomas admitted there had been ""some tears"". ""It's so disappointing for the girls, they've been gearing up for this for more than six months,"" said Ms Thomas, whose daughter Mairwen, 10, is in the group. The club have raised more than Â£3,000 to help to pay for the trip to compete against 50 nations and 5,000 other competitors. ""This is all their world has been about for months,"" Ms Thomas added. ""The girls were disappointed to miss the opening ceremony as we were meant to take part,"" added Ms Thomas. ""So we sang the Welsh anthem in the departure lounge and the girls did some moves."" A spokeswoman for Vueling confirmed there had been ""technical issues"" with the plane meaning it could not fly. She added that sending another plane would have taken longer and the company understood it had been a ""painful situation for the clients"".

"Claire Matthews said the charity needed urgent donations of non-perishable goods A food bank in Bournemouth is appealing for emergency donations after burglars stole a month's worth of goods intended for families in need. Volunteers at Hope For Food said the site was trashed, causing Â£3,000 of damage, and 90% of food, clothes, toiletries and toys were taken. More than 400 families will be affected following the burglary on Friday. Founder Claire Matthews said: ""We've got beans and soup but the rest of it has gone. It beggars belief."" Burglars caused damage totalling Â£3,000 She added: ""It's going to have a huge impact on our families. One family we needed to get food to yesterday, but we didn't have any. ""A van was supposed to go out tomorrow but there's nothing to go into the van. They've [the burglars] taken a good month's worth of food. ""Families are going to get a meagre offering of the basics instead of the normal hamper we give out."" The organisation, based on the West Howe Industrial Estate, has appealed for urgent donations of non-perishable goods such as tins of food, pasta, biscuits, sauces in jars and squash. Thieves stole nearly all the toiletries stored on shelves Toiletries needed include nappies, toothpaste and shampoo. Dorset police officers were at the scene investigating the burglary and the vandalism, which includes smashed windows and fridges left open, with ready meals thrown on the floor.

"This video can not be played The BBC's team at the rally captured the confused aftermath of the explosion Ethiopian officials say two people have died and dozens more are injured, after an explosion at a huge political rally for the new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Mr Abiy described it as an ""unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united"". He was whisked away immediately after the blast, thought to be from a grenade thrown amid thousands of people in Addis Ababa's Meskel Square. The capital's deputy chief of police is in custody over security lapses. A further eight policemen have been detained and are under investigation for failing to secure the site. Ethiopia'shealth minister tweeted that two people had died,external. He said 44 people remained in hospital, five of them in a critical condition. Mr Abiy only became prime minister after his predecessor Hailemariam Desalegn unexpectedly resigned in February. Why Ethiopia could be on the verge of a new dawn Is this the man to change Ethiopia? He is also the country's first leader from the ethnic Oromo group, which has been at the centre of nearly three years of anti-government protests that have left hundreds of people dead. Since taking office he has begun passing a series of reforms, including unblocking hundreds of websites and TV channels. The blast happened moments after Mr Abiy had finished a speech in the capital He has also said he is ready to implement in full a peace deal with Eritrea that was signed in 2000 after a two-year war. Eritrea has condemned the attack on Mr Abiy's rally. Its ambassador to JapanEstifanos Afeworki said on Twitter the rally had been a ""demonstration for peace"",external, which he called the first of its kind ""in history of Ethiopia"". The US embassy in Addis Ababa also condemned the blast,external, tweeting: ""Violence has no place as Ethiopia pursues meaningful political and economic reforms."" On Fridayan Ethiopian rebel group suspended its armed resistanceagainst the government. Ginbot 7, based in Eritrea, said Mr Abiy's reforms had given it hope that ""genuine democracy"" may be ""a real possibility"". Thousands attended the rally in support of Mr Abiy The Ethiopian government has been accused of human rights violations including torture and extrajudicial killing of political dissidents. An ethnic Oromo, Mr Abiy is believed to have huge support among the Oromo youth as well as other ethnic groups. One of the Oromo's main complaints is that they have been politically, economically and culturally marginalised for years, despite being the country's largest group. He is leader of the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (OPDO), one of the four ethnic parties which make up the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition. The 42-year-old, who was born in the city of Agaro in Oromia and comes from a mixed Christian-Muslim family, joined the OPDO in the late 1980s. He has served in the military, founded the country's Information Network and Security Agency, which is responsible for cyber-security in a country where the government exercises tight control over the internet, and then became the minister for science and technology.

"This video can not be played BBC drone footage shows a US 'tent city' immigration centre The US Navy is reportedly planning to build sprawling immigrant detention centres on military bases, amid a Trump crackdown at the US-Mexico border. A draft memoobtained by Time magazine,externaloutlines plans to build ""austere"" tent camps to house 25,000 migrants. The memo says the camps would be built on abandoned airfields in California, Alabama, and Arizona. Another camp near San Francisco is being designed for as many as 47,000 people, the memo says. A Pentagon spokesman said the military had not been asked by the Department for Homeland Security (DHS) to draw up the specific plans, but was engaging in ""prudent planning... should the DHS ask for assistance in housing adult illegal immigrants"". The US military said on Thursday it had been asked by the government to get ready to house up to 20,000 immigrant children. The Navy memo estimates the force would spend $233 million (Â£175m) to run a facility for 25,000 people for six-months. Migrant families face chaos to reunite Migrant families separation: The big picture explained Trump hosts victims of illegal migrants A string of White House contradictions on migrants The memo gives a sense of the knock-on effect of a ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy being pursued by the Trump administration, in an effort to deter migrants from Central and South America from attempting to cross into the US. A decision by the administration to criminally prosecute every migrant crossing the US-Mexico border led to some 2,300 children being separated from their parents in May and June, and sparked a global wave of outrage. President Donald Trump eventually backed down in the face of overwhelming public pressureand signed an order to halt the family separations, but he insisted he remained committed to his ""zero tolerance"" policy. This video can not be played Audio recording: children in tears at a migrant detention centre ""We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections,"" he tweeted. The sudden surge in immigrant detentions created by Mr Trump's policy has strained various government departments, including Justice, Homeland Security, Defence and Health and Human Services. Migrant children taken from their parents are being held in facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Images from one facility in a converted Walmart sparked outrage earlier this week, when they showed children held in wire mesh cages, sleeping on mats with foil blankets. A DHS official said on Thursday that about500 children had been reunited with their familiessince separations began in May, but rights groups remain concern that there is not adequate information to return many young children to their parents. On Friday Mr Trumpbrought the parents of victims of murders by undocumented immigrants to the White House, where he signed photographs of their late children and invited them to tell their stories.

"Mr Friedland had been at the streaming company for seven years Netflix has fired its head of communications over his use of the âN-wordâ. In an internal memo, Chief Executive Reed Hastings apologised to staff for not acting sooner. He said the comments showed a âdeep lack of understandingâ. Jonathan Friedlandwrote in a tweet,external: âI feel awful about the distress this lapse caused to people at a company I love.â He had been at the video streaming firm since 2011. âLeaders have to be beyond reproach in the example we set, and unfortunately I fell short of that standard when I was insensitive in speaking to my team about words that offend in comedy,â he said. The memo from Mr Hastings wasfirst published by The Hollywood Reporter,external- its authenticity has been confirmed by the BBC. âHis descriptive use of the N-word on at least two occasions at work showed unacceptably low racial awareness and sensitivity,â the note to all staff read. Mr Hastings detailed two instances when Mr Friedland was said to have used the offensive term. The first incident was at a meeting with the public relations team to discuss sensitive words. Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings praised Mr Friedland's contribution to the company âSeveral people afterwards told him how inappropriate and hurtful his use of the N-word was, and Jonathan apologised to those that had been in the meeting,â Mr Hastings wrote. âWe hoped this was an awful anomaly never to be repeated.â However, a few days later the term was used again - this time at a meeting of black employees at the company. Kendrick Lamar stops white fan using N-word Should white people ever sing the N-word? Mr Hastings said he only recently heard about the second incident. He went on to praise Mr Friedlandâs contribution to the company, which is today worth around $180bn (Â£135bn). âJonathan has been a great contributor and he built a diverse global team creating awareness for Netflix, strengthening our reputation around the world, and helping make us into the successful company we are today. âMany of us have worked closely with Jonathan for a long time, and have mixed emotions. Unfortunately, his lack of judgment in this area was too big for him to remain.â In a tweet subsequently deleted, Mr Friedland wrote: âRise high, fall fast.

"Almost two-thirds of drivers are unaware of the punishment for using mobile phones at the wheel, more than 12 months after the introduction of tougher laws, a poll has found. The RAC found only 36% of the 2,000 UK motorists quizzed knew offenders face six penalty points and a Â£200 fine. Some 41% believed more visible law enforcement is needed, and 22% advocated stronger penalties. The punishment was doubled from three penalty points and Â£100 last year. This made it enough to ban those with less than two years' experience. To get back behind the wheel, these offenders have to retake both the theory and practical parts of the driving test. The new rules apply in England, Scotland and Wales. Hundreds of new drivers banned for phone use New drivers found texting to lose licence Some readers who contacted the BBC said there needed to be more publicity about the tougher laws, while others said they weren't enforced strongly enough. Martin Tillbrook, from Bracknell, said: ""Firstly, the penalties are not widely enough publicised. Why not put roadside signs up to remind people? ""Secondly, it just isn't enforced at all."" David Lee, from Carmarthenshire, said: ""Around here it is common to see drivers chatting on their phones as they pass - everyday I see at least one. ""People do not judge the risks of an accident, they judge the risk of being caught."" Jeff, from Nottingham, said: ""The awareness and advertising of these penalties is poor and there should be a better TV/radio advertising campaign."" 'Epidemic' of drivers using mobiles What you can and can't do when you're driving When the new penalties were introduced, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said they would ""act as a strong deterrent"" to mobile phone users. Department for Transport figures showed 780 people were injured in accidents in 2016 when a driver was distracted or impaired by their phone - up 10% on the previous year. In the poll, 18% of drivers backed the blocking of mobile signals within cars. RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said the law around hand-held phone use by drivers ""could not be clearer"". ""Yet every year there are dozens of fatal crashes caused by motorists who have allowed themselves to be distracted by their phone,"" he said. ""There remains a hard core of drivers who continue to ignore the law and all the risks associated with hand-held phone use."" Figures obtained by BBC Radio 5 Live last year revealed that290 new UK drivers were disqualifiedin the first six months since the change. In Northern Ireland, motorists caught using a hand-held phone while driving face a Â£60 fine and three penalty points. A public consultation ona government proposal to increase this penaltyclosed last month.

"Anti-Brexit campaigners are preparing to march to Parliament Square Senior Cabinet ministers have insisted the UK is prepared to walk away from Brexit talks without a deal, on the second anniversary of the referendum. Liam Fox said Theresa May was ""not bluffing"" over her threat to quit negotiations, while Boris Johnson called for a ""full British Brexit"". It comes as anti-Brexit campaigners, who want the public to have the final say on the UK's departure, prepare to march in London later. They say Brexit is ""not a done deal"". Brexit: All you need to know Reality Check: Will there be a Brexit dividend? Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? People's Vote - which wants a referendum on any exit deal - said people must make their ""voices heard"" about the ""damage"" of leaving next year without agreement. Speakers at the demo will include actor Sir Tony Robinson and campaigner Gina Miller, who fought a successful legal battle last year to ensure the UK could not trigger talks on leaving without the approval of Parliament. The UK voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.9% to 48.1% in a referendum held on 23 June 2016. This video can not be played Liam Fox says Theresa May is not bluffing over no-deal Brexit The UK is due to leave on 29 March 2019, 46 years after it first joined the European Economic Community, the forerunner to the EU. But the People's Vote campaign says this should happen only if the withdrawal deal negotiated by Mrs May and the other 27 EU members is approved in another public vote. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC it was in the interests of both sides to have a deal - but it was ""essential"" the EU understood that the UK could walk away if the terms offered were not good enough. ""The prime minister has always said no deal is better than a bad deal,"" Mr Fox said in an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, which was recorded on Wednesday - beforeFriday's warning from Airbusthat it might cease manufacturing in the UK in such a scenario. ""It is essential as we enter the next phase of the negotiations that the EU understands that and believes it... I think our negotiating partners would not be wise if they thought our PM was bluffing."" Meanwhile,Brexit Secretary David Davis told the Daily Express,externalthe prime minister was going to get a ""good deal"" from Brussels and Brexit was going to be ""fantastic"". ""The best option is leaving with a good deal but you've got to be able to walk away from the table,"" he said. Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Why is Brexit taking so long? Andwriting in the Sun, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson,externalwarned the prime minister not to allow ""bog roll Brexit"" that is ""soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long"" - calling for a ""full British Brexit"" instead. Mr Johnson said people ""just want us to get on with it"". By BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley Two years on from the referendum, there are two very different messages today. One is that Brexit is not a ""done deal"". That's the argument from the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable who will take part in a march in central London today. On the other side, there is optimism and defiance from key Brexiteers like Boris Johnson. Mr Johnson says the UK is confident and open. The government firmly opposes a vote on the final deal - Mr Johnson believes people want the government to just get on with it. Nine months before the UK is due to officially leave the EU, there are still very different visions. Labour said Mr Fox's comments about a no-deal Brexit were the ""height of irresponsibility"". ""The next time Liam Fox parrots the slogan no deal is better than a bad deal he should give some thought to the 14,000 people who work for Airbus, and the thousands of other people who have jobs dependent on trade with Europe,"" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. Both the prime minister and Labour leader have rejected calls for another public vote, saying the will of the people expressed in the 2016 ballot was clear, although many Labour MPs now want another referendum. Organisers of Saturday's demo say people ""from all walks of life"" will be present, demonstrating the ""growing popular demand"" for another vote. Beginning in Pall Mall and ending outside the Houses of Parliament, the protest is part of a ""summer of action"" by campaign groups designed to increase pressure on Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. This video can not be played Anti-Brexit campaigner Femi Oluwole wants the Labour leader to back calls for a referendum on the final deal By taking the UK out of the EU's single market and customs union, they say the Conservative government ""remains intent"" on a so-called hard Brexit that will - they say - destroy jobs and damage public services. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Vince Cable, who will be at the march, told BBC Breakfast: ""I think the public in general... do see there is a mess."" He added: ""We've only got a year to go. And I think for the big companies that employ hundreds of thousands of workers in the UK... they want some clarity about what the trading relationships will be and there is absolutely none whatever."" But Conservative MP Peter Bone - who supports Brexit - said if there were a second vote, the leave campaign would win again. ""The vast, vast majority of people, whether they are Leavers or Remainers, just want us to get on and come out this dreadful European Union super-state,"" he said. ""There were 17.4 million people that voted for leave and if there are a few thousand in London complaining about it - that doesn't seem to really make much difference."" The government is giving Parliament a vote on the final deal, if one is reached, in the autumn - but it remains unclear what will happen if they reject it.

"Vinnie Paul saw his brother and bandmate assassinated on stage Vinnie Paul, co-founder and drummer of the metal band Pantera, has died aged 54, the band announced on Facebook. ""Vincent Paul Abbott aka Vinnie Paul has passed away,"" a statement said. There was no cause of death given. Paul started Pantera in 1981 with his brother, ""Dimebag"" Darrell Abbott - the pair were sons to the country-western producer Jerry Abbott. The band had a number one album in 1994 and earned four Grammy nominations, but disbanded in 2003 amid rumours of a rift. Paul said at the time the breakup was a result of the band's singer, Phil Anselmo, wanting to move on. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

"More than 8 million people visited the Louvre in 2017. The vast majority of them would have rubbed shoulders with the same famous artworks that appeared this week in The Carters' (that's BeyoncÃ© and her husband Jay-Z) music video for the launch track from their new album, Everything is Love. I doubt many gyrated in leggings and a bra in front of Jacques-Louis David's monumental canvas The Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon (1806-7) as BeyoncÃ© does in the video, but I imagine people will now. Blame Napoleon for encouraging such behaviour. When he was presented with the canvas having insisted on several alterations, like reducing the size of Notre-Dame cathedral to make him look bigger, the delighted Emperor said: ""This is not a painting; one walks in this picture."" The Carters get up to all sorts in this personalised take on Night at the Museum, the title of which made use of asterisks when it was uploaded to YouTube last weekend given its bad language. In one scene they appear dressed in white, like marble statues, standing regally at the top of the Winged Victory of Samothrace staircase as the magnificent winged goddess Nike rises from behind their heads while their loyal subjects lie down before them. In another, they hang out with the ancient Great Sphinx of Tanis, which came from the Temple of Amun Tanis, once the pharaohs' seat of power in the dim and distant 21st and 22nd Dynasties. Jay-Z stands aside, while BeyoncÃ© dances frenetically. Like most museum visitors, they take regular breaks - chilling out on the Louvre's plush sofa-seats; Jay-Z man-spreading as BeyoncÃ© uses his shoulder as a chair back. They appear to be having a great time. Although, the longer the video goes on the more you realise there is something slightly odd about their visit. I'm pretty sure that just about every single one of the Louvre's 8 million-plus visitors takes the opportunity to have a good look at the masterpieces on show. The Carters do not. At least, not until the dying seconds of their six-minute promo, when they face each other before slowly turning towards Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. This isn't an oversight; it is a point - maybe, the point - being made. They are not in the Louvre to look reverentially at great works of European art; they are there to make their own great work of art. The museum and its contents are not the star of this show; they are there to play a part. Pop's power-couple, along with director Ricky Saiz, have produced a series of vignettes, all of which play with the same dramatic device: inserting a contemporary black artistic voice into a white, Western, male-dominated, establishment narrative. I don't know if they specifically chose The Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon to dance in front of because it was the colonising French general who repealed anti-slavery laws in 1802, but I imagine the fact hadn't escaped their notice. There is no ambiguity with the elegantly-composed image they curate in front of David's painting Portrait of Madame RÃ©camier (1800), which is heavily laden with symbolism. The two women are seen sitting in front of the Portrait of Madame RÃ©camier (1800) Two black women are sitting on the floor wearing light brown tights and body-hugging beige vests. They are in profile, facing away from each other, and positioned at either side of David's painting of the famous 19th Century French socialite. Linking the two women together is a flowing piece of white material, each end of which they wear on their heads like a turban. Above them, Madame RÃ©camier reclines on her antique sofa, dressed in a simple sleeveless white dress, her head turned towards the viewer. The design of the sofa is similar to that of a sleigh-bed, with rising wooden ends. It is these bed ends that the women on the floor echo, the variance in the darkness of their skin matching the different tones of the wood in the painting. The cloth that links them represents the dress worn by the painting's subject. The message is clear: It was on the backs of subjugated black people from the French colonies that Madame RÃ©camie was able to enjoy her life of leisure and pleasure. The Carters' Louvre takeover isn't just about protest; it is about power too. Beyonce dances to the backdrop of The Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon (1806-7) We meet them in the museum's Salle des Etats gallery, which was originally built for Napoleon III to preside over major legislative sessions in the late 1850s. Today it houses the Louvre's Venetian Renaissance paintings as well as the picture for which it is thought 80% of visitors come to see, the Mona Lisa. And that's where we find our besuited pop stars: BeyoncÃ© dressed in pink, Jay-Z in mint green. They look at us with deadpan expressions mimicking the Mona Lisa's, whose portrait hangs between them. We get what they are saying, we are not looking at one iconic face: we're looking at three. The Carters are not just giving themselves the same status as Da Vinci's masterpiece; they are transforming the world's most famous painting from a single image into a triptych. The song for which the promo has been made sets the tone. Its profane title, Apeshit, repeated in every chorus: ""Have you ever seen a crowd goin' apeshit?"" ""I can't believe we made it,"" they duet as they take ownership of Paris's temple of cultural icons, which until their residency, had barely a black face in it. ""We livin' lavish, lavish,"" BeyoncÃ© sings draped in white silk. ""I got expensive fabrics, I got expensive habits."" These are not words of apology for being overtly materialistic. She's boasting. Here she is, a successful black woman, talking about her opulent tastes while enjoying being the inheritor of Napoleon's. And in his back yard, too. The video is a smart piece of work, albeit a little rushed at times. Not every shot works, not every idea lands. But the overall point is powerfully put. The game is up for those institutions - be it Hollywood, Broadway or the Louvre - which have ignored black artists, refused them a voice, or a seat at the top table.

"Ireland lost just one of their 11 games in the 2017-18 season Third Test: Australia v Ireland Australia (9) 16 Try:KoroibeteCon:FoleyPens:Foley 3 Ireland (12) 20 Try:StanderPens:Sexton 5 Ireland resisted a sustained second-half assault to earn a first series victory in Australia for 39 years. The Six Nations Grand Slam champions needed the boot of Johnny Sexton to steer them through a scrappy but compelling contest in Sydney. CJ Stander's try at the start of the second half was cancelled out by an excellent score by Marika Koroibete. The Wallabies scented a win but the Irish defence held firm before Sexton kicked a late insurance penalty. Relive Ireland's series win over Australia The tourists found themselves under relentless pressure as Australia sought to harness the momentum of Koroibete's try. There was still time after Sexton's fifth and final penalty for the home side to stage one final, desperate attack but Bernard Foley's wayward pass missed its target and rolled out of play just as the clock turned red. Prop Tadhg Furlong was a threat in the loose for Ireland A major factor in Ireland's win in Melbourne to level the series had been their ability to negate the influence of Australia's key players. Wallabies coach Michael Cheika had clearly learnt from that defeat as number eight David Pocock and full-back Israel Folau were both to the fore in the opening quarter after their captain Michael Hooper suffered an early hamstring injury. Folau won the ball from the opening kick-off and his aerial contest with Peter O'Mahony was a feature of the game up to the 30th minute when the Ireland captain was carted off injured and the Wallabies full-back was shown a yellow card for taking the flanker out in the air. The sides were level on six points and 14 players apiece at that point after Sexton and Foley had traded penalties and Jacob Stockdale had also been sent to the sin bin for leading with his forearm. The Ireland fly-half pushed his side back ahead with a 35th minute penalty. Australia thought they had levelled before the break when Foley punished a Conor Murray offside but the hosts conceded a penalty from the restart - much to the annoyance of Chieka - and Ireland led by three at the interval. Marika Koroibete's try set up a dramatic final quarter at the Sydney Football Stadium Ireland had dominated the territory and possession stats in the opening half but, not for the first time in the series, they had struggled to convert that pressure into scores. They began the second half determined to correct their profligacy and immediately set up camp in the Australian 22 after a clever kick by Sexton. The Irish pack cranked up their line-out maul and were held up at the first attempt before Stander was at the tail of a second driving wedge that powered over the line. Sexton missed the conversion, which left Ireland with a precarious eight-point lead. Johnny Sexton kicked 15 points as Ireland clinched their first series win in Australia since 1979 In what was the final game of a gruelling 11-match season, Ireland began to tire as the final quarter approached and the Wallabies sensed their chance as Foley turned down two kickable penalty chances to kick into the corner instead. The first attack produced a chance for Folau when the full-back found some space on the blind-side but the final pass went over his head. But there was no mistake at the second time of asking as the Irish defence was sucked infield and Foley's perfectly-weighted kick bounced up into the path of Koroibete, who dragged Sexton over the line with him. The conversion meant it was just a one-point game with more than 20 minutes remaining, and Australia attacked in waves against a tiring Irish defence. Robbie Henshaw was penalised for a high tackle but Foley's penalty attempt drifted across the face of the posts and substitute scrum-half Joe Powell's pass was knocked-on by Samu Kerevi when a try seemed inevitable. Ireland countered with Sexton's penalty in the 78th minute on a rare foray into the opposition half before the Wallabies final, desperate attack fizzled out as the hooter sounded. Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt, speaking to Sky Sports:""I think a heck of a lot of it tonight was about character. Maybe we should have got a little bit more out of that first half. ""The Wallabies then came back and they came back in waves, but I think credit to Jordan Larmour, Jordi Murphy, Tadhg Beirne for coming into a real furnace and to come out on the other side. I hope that furnace helps them become the diamonds that we need. ""The provinces do a great job looking after the players and making sure they have enough juice in the tank. I don't think we could play again next week, I think all that juice is gone."" Ireland try scorer CJ Stander speaking on Sky Sports:""We knew it was going to be a cup final for us coming down here, especially as it was the last game of the season so I think we just got out there and gave it 100%. ""We knew Australia would attack us from minute one. We pride ourselves on our defence. They came at us wave after wave for the last 20 minutes and we stood up and I am immensely proud of the guys."" Australia number eight David Pocock speaking on Sky Sports:""It was a great battle. Every week you were trying to analyse their game and see what weaknesses of ours they were going to try to target. ""But credit to them, maybe their game management was a little better across the series.""

"Mr Friedland had been at the streaming company for seven years Netflix has fired its head of communications over his use of the âN-wordâ. In an internal memo, Chief Executive Reed Hastings apologised to staff for not acting sooner. He said the comments showed a âdeep lack of understandingâ. Jonathan Friedlandwrote in a tweet,external: âI feel awful about the distress this lapse caused to people at a company I love.â He had been at the video streaming firm since 2011. âLeaders have to be beyond reproach in the example we set, and unfortunately I fell short of that standard when I was insensitive in speaking to my team about words that offend in comedy,â he said. The memo from Mr Hastings wasfirst published by The Hollywood Reporter,external- its authenticity has been confirmed by the BBC. âHis descriptive use of the N-word on at least two occasions at work showed unacceptably low racial awareness and sensitivity,â the note to all staff read. Mr Hastings detailed two instances when Mr Friedland was said to have used the offensive term. The first incident was at a meeting with the public relations team to discuss sensitive words. Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings praised Mr Friedland's contribution to the company âSeveral people afterwards told him how inappropriate and hurtful his use of the N-word was, and Jonathan apologised to those that had been in the meeting,â Mr Hastings wrote. âWe hoped this was an awful anomaly never to be repeated.â However, a few days later the term was used again - this time at a meeting of black employees at the company. Kendrick Lamar stops white fan using N-word Should white people ever sing the N-word? Mr Hastings said he only recently heard about the second incident. He went on to praise Mr Friedlandâs contribution to the company, which is today worth around $180bn (Â£135bn). âJonathan has been a great contributor and he built a diverse global team creating awareness for Netflix, strengthening our reputation around the world, and helping make us into the successful company we are today. âMany of us have worked closely with Jonathan for a long time, and have mixed emotions.

"This video can not be played Liz Bonnin meets Shearwater chicks struggling for survival New footage of the devastating impact of plastic pollution on wildlife has been captured by a BBC team. Seabirds are starving to death on the remote Lord Howe Island, a crew filming for the BBC One documentary Drowning in Plastic has revealed. Their stomachs were so full of plastic there was no room for food. The documentary is part of aBBC initiative called Plastics Watch, tracking the impact of plastic on the environment. The marine biologists the team filmed are working on the island to save the birds. They captured hundreds of chicks - as they left their nests - to physically flush plastic from their stomachs and ""give them a chance to survive"". The birds nest in burrows on Lord Howe Island, which is more than 600 kilometres off the east coast of Australia. While chicks wait in the burrow, the parents head out to sea and dive for small fish and squid to feed their offspring. ""These birds are generalist predators,"" explained marine biologist Jennifer Lavers who works with the shearwater colony. ""They'll eat just about anything they're given. That's what's allowed them to thrive - a lack of pickiness. ""But when you put plastic in the ocean, it means they have no ability to detect plastic from non-plastic, so they eat it."" Parent birds unwittingly feeding plastic to their chicks means that the birds emerge from their burrows with stomachs filled with plastic, and with insufficient nutrition to enable them set out to sea and forage for themselves. The seabirds dive underwater for food, but often eat pieces of plastic But when the birds first head out of the burrow, the research team have been stepping in to help. ""If the amount of plastic is not so significant, we use a process called lavage, where we flush or wash the stomach - without harming the bird,"" explained Dr Lavers. The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Beach checks tackle plastic 'scourge' 50 nations 'curbing plastic pollution' The BBC crew filmed the team working with individual chicks - using tubes to flush their stomachs with seawater and make them regurgitate the plastic. Researchers use seawater to flush out a bird's stomach Liz Bonnin, who presents the series, said what she saw on Lord Howe Island was one of the hardest things she had witnessed in her career. ""It was shocking to see how much would come out of one chick,"" she told BBC News. ""We saw, I think 90 pieces come out of one of the chicks on the second night. ""But the scientists were telling us they sometimes pull out 200 or 250 pieces of plastic out of dead birds or from the regurgitation. ""It's obscene when you think about it."" Jennifer Lavers added that most of the plastic she and her colleagues have found in their work with the birds is ""entirely preventable"". Some parts of the ocean now contain more pieces of plastic than plankton ""We find plastic clothes pegs, plastic tooth brushes. Those could easily be swapped out for other materials - aluminium or wood. My own toothbrush is made of bamboo. ""When we look at changes like that and scale them up across the entire human population, it could really make a difference. ""I so look forward to a future where I'm not pulling clothes pegs out of the bellies of baby birds - that would be brilliant.""

Above them, Madame RÃ©camier reclines on her antique sofa, dressed in a simple sleeveless white dress, her head turned towards the viewer. The design of the sofa is similar to that of a sleigh-bed, with rising wooden ends. It is these bed ends that the women on the floor echo, the variance in the darkness of their skin matching the different tones of the wood in the painting. The cloth that links them represents the dress worn by the painting's subject. The message is clear: It was on the backs of subjugated black people from the French colonies that Madame RÃ©camie was able to enjoy her life of leisure and pleasure. The Carters' Louvre takeover isn't just about protest; it is about power too. Beyonce dances to the backdrop of The Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon (1806-7) We meet them in the museum's Salle des Etats gallery, which was originally built for Napoleon III to preside over major legislative sessions in the late 1850s. Today it houses the Louvre's Venetian Renaissance paintings as well as the picture for which it is thought 80% of visitors come to see, the Mona Lisa. And that's where we find our besuited pop stars: BeyoncÃ© dressed in pink, Jay-Z in mint green. They look at us with deadpan expressions mimicking the Mona Lisa's, whose portrait hangs between them. We get what they are saying, we are not looking at one iconic face: we're looking at three. The Carters are not just giving themselves the same status as Da Vinci's masterpiece; they are transforming the world's most famous painting from a single image into a triptych. The song for which the promo has been made sets the tone. Its profane title, Apeshit, repeated in every chorus: ""Have you ever seen a crowd goin' apeshit?"" ""I can't believe we made it,"" they duet as they take ownership of Paris's temple of cultural icons, which until their residency, had barely a black face in it. ""We livin' lavish, lavish,"" BeyoncÃ© sings draped in white silk. ""I got expensive fabrics, I got expensive habits."" These are not words of apology for being overtly materialistic. She's boasting. Here she is, a successful black woman, talking about her opulent tastes while enjoying being the inheritor of Napoleon's. And in his back yard, too. The video is a smart piece of work, albeit a little rushed at times. Not every shot works, not every idea lands. But the overall point is powerfully put. The game is up for those institutions - be it Hollywood, Broadway or the Louvre - which have ignored black artists, refused them a voice, or a seat at the top table.

"This video can not be played The BBC's team at the rally captured the confused aftermath of the explosion Ethiopian officials say two people have died and dozens more are injured, after an explosion at a huge political rally for the new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Mr Abiy described it as an ""unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united"". He was whisked away immediately after the blast, thought to be from a grenade thrown amid thousands of people in Addis Ababa's Meskel Square. The capital's deputy chief of police is in custody over security lapses. A further eight policemen have been detained and are under investigation for failing to secure the site. Ethiopia'shealth minister tweeted that two people had died,external. He said 44 people remained in hospital, five of them in a critical condition. Mr Abiy only became prime minister after his predecessor Hailemariam Desalegn unexpectedly resigned in February. Why Ethiopia could be on the verge of a new dawn Is this the man to change Ethiopia? He is also the country's first leader from the ethnic Oromo group, which has been at the centre of nearly three years of anti-government protests that have left hundreds of people dead. Since taking office he has begun passing a series of reforms, including unblocking hundreds of websites and TV channels. The blast happened moments after Mr Abiy had finished a speech in the capital He has also said he is ready to implement in full a peace deal with Eritrea that was signed in 2000 after a two-year war. Eritrea has condemned the attack on Mr Abiy's rally. Its ambassador to JapanEstifanos Afeworki said on Twitter the rally had been a ""demonstration for peace"",external, which he called the first of its kind ""in history of Ethiopia"". The US embassy in Addis Ababa also condemned the blast,external, tweeting: ""Violence has no place as Ethiopia pursues meaningful political and economic reforms."" On Fridayan Ethiopian rebel group suspended its armed resistanceagainst the government. Ginbot 7, based in Eritrea, said Mr Abiy's reforms had given it hope that ""genuine democracy"" may be ""a real possibility"". Thousands attended the rally in support of Mr Abiy The Ethiopian government has been accused of human rights violations including torture and extrajudicial killing of political dissidents. An ethnic Oromo, Mr Abiy is believed to have huge support among the Oromo youth as well as other ethnic groups. One of the Oromo's main complaints is that they have been politically, economically and culturally marginalised for years, despite being the country's largest group. He is leader of the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (OPDO), one of the four ethnic parties which make up the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition. The 42-year-old, who was born in the city of Agaro in Oromia and comes from a mixed Christian-Muslim family, joined the OPDO in the late 1980s. He has served in the military, founded the country's Information Network and Security Agency, which is responsible for cyber-security in a country where the government exercises tight control over the internet, and then became the minister for science and technology.

"More than 8 million people visited the Louvre in 2017. The vast majority of them would have rubbed shoulders with the same famous artworks that appeared this week in The Carters' (that's BeyoncÃ© and her husband Jay-Z) music video for the launch track from their new album, Everything is Love. I doubt many gyrated in leggings and a bra in front of Jacques-Louis David's monumental canvas The Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon (1806-7) as BeyoncÃ© does in the video, but I imagine people will now. Blame Napoleon for encouraging such behaviour. When he was presented with the canvas having insisted on several alterations, like reducing the size of Notre-Dame cathedral to make him look bigger, the delighted Emperor said: ""This is not a painting; one walks in this picture."" The Carters get up to all sorts in this personalised take on Night at the Museum, the title of which made use of asterisks when it was uploaded to YouTube last weekend given its bad language. In one scene they appear dressed in white, like marble statues, standing regally at the top of the Winged Victory of Samothrace staircase as the magnificent winged goddess Nike rises from behind their heads while their loyal subjects lie down before them. In another, they hang out with the ancient Great Sphinx of Tanis, which came from the Temple of Amun Tanis, once the pharaohs' seat of power in the dim and distant 21st and 22nd Dynasties. Jay-Z stands aside, while BeyoncÃ© dances frenetically. Like most museum visitors, they take regular breaks - chilling out on the Louvre's plush sofa-seats; Jay-Z man-spreading as BeyoncÃ© uses his shoulder as a chair back. They appear to be having a great time. Although, the longer the video goes on the more you realise there is something slightly odd about their visit. I'm pretty sure that just about every single one of the Louvre's 8 million-plus visitors takes the opportunity to have a good look at the masterpieces on show. The Carters do not. At least, not until the dying seconds of their six-minute promo, when they face each other before slowly turning towards Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. This isn't an oversight; it is a point - maybe, the point - being made. They are not in the Louvre to look reverentially at great works of European art; they are there to make their own great work of art. The museum and its contents are not the star of this show; they are there to play a part. Pop's power-couple, along with director Ricky Saiz, have produced a series of vignettes, all of which play with the same dramatic device: inserting a contemporary black artistic voice into a white, Western, male-dominated, establishment narrative. I don't know if they specifically chose The Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon to dance in front of because it was the colonising French general who repealed anti-slavery laws in 1802, but I imagine the fact hadn't escaped their notice. There is no ambiguity with the elegantly-composed image they curate in front of David's painting Portrait of Madame RÃ©camier (1800), which is heavily laden with symbolism. The two women are seen sitting in front of the Portrait of Madame RÃ©camier (1800) Two black women are sitting on the floor wearing light brown tights and body-hugging beige vests. They are in profile, facing away from each other, and positioned at either side of David's painting of the famous 19th Century French socialite. Linking the two women together is a flowing piece of white material, each end of which they wear on their heads like a turban. Above them, Madame RÃ©camier reclines on her antique sofa, dressed in a simple sleeveless white dress, her head turned towards the viewer. The design of the sofa is similar to that of a sleigh-bed, with rising wooden ends.

"The building on fire was the Somers Town Coffee House An investigation is under way into the cause of a fire that damaged a pub in central London. Dozens of firefighters were called on Friday evening to Chalton Street, Euston, at 20:06 BST and spent just under 90 minutes getting the blaze under control. Witnesses reported seeing flames and plumes of smoke coming from the pub called the Somers Town Coffee House. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) said there were no reported injuries. Around half of the roof and second floor of the building were damaged in the fire, according to the LFB. This video can not be played Video credit: Thomas Looney Eighteen 999 calls were made to the brigade who sent 10 fire engines and 72 firefighters to the scene. LFB's Steve Chesson said: ""The pub was open and in use at the time of the fire and a number of people left the building before the Brigade arrived."" Corin Faife said he had been in the pub watching the World Cup game between Serbia and Switzerland with his brother when he noticed a group of people outside and saw some smoke. ""Suddenly the fire alarm went off and a staff member told us to get out,"" the 32-year-old said. ""The bar staff were running around making sure everybody got out. ""It was a pretty scary situation. We grabbed all of our things and ran out."" There were 72 firefighters tackling the blaze at one stage, the London Fire Brigade said The pub was evacuated as clouds of smoke settled over the street Tim Ahmeti, who lives nearby, was also watching the football when he realised the pub was alight. ""I was sitting watching the match and I smelt smoke as soon as I opened my front door,"" he said. ""My whole front street filled with smoke and everyone was standing outside just watching the blaze."" ""The staff managed to get everyone out of the pub,"" he added.

"A future Labour government should prepare for resistance from global corporations and could face a run on the pound, Momentum's founder says. Jon Lansman, who heads the Jeremy Corbyn support movement, said global elites would resist the ""significant transformation"" planned by Labour. And he said he hoped that it would not lead to the devaluation of sterling. He was speaking to BBC Radio 4 programme Long March of Corbyn's Labour to be broadcast on Monday. Momentum chief quits Labour race ''We want to make a significant transformation. We want decisions which affect jobs and livelihoods democratised. The global corporations will resist,"" said the veteran left-wing activist. ""Other governments have faced challenges like runs on the pound. And we may face similar things. I hope we don't. ""The people who are opposed to what we want to do have one thing in their favour - money.  We have people. We need the power of people to overcome the power of money."" Andrew Gwynne: 'Some things are going to take time' Shadow chancellor John McDonnell raised a similar prospect at a fringe meeting at Labour's conference last year - but clarified that he was planning for a number of scenarios, and didn't think this would happen. In the same programme, shadow communities secretary and joint election co-ordinator Andrew Gwynne strikes a different tone. He says he has had ""sleepless nights"" worrying whether local councils will be able to deliver some of ""the big ticket"" items in Labour's manifesto - such as the pledge to deliver a million more homes over 10 years. And he warns, in an extract of the interview to be broadcast on Saturday on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, that a Labour government that disappoints its new members could ""fall at the first hurdle"". ""Some things are going to take time and we need to communicate that now in opposition. ""If we come to power on the back of massive optimism, a new way of doing things,  and we fall at the first hurdle then it will be very difficult to recover. ""We need a clear plan."" The Long March of Corbyn's Labour can be heard on Monday evening at 2000 BST on Radio 4, repeated on Wednesday, 27 June at 1100 BST.

"It's been widely reported that England's World Cup squad, with an average age of 26, is one of the youngest in Russia. What's less well known, though, is that there's a distinctly northern flavour - 13 of the 23 players grew up within 50 miles of the centre of Manchester, while two others, Jordan Henderson and Jordan Pickford, hail from Sunderland. Analysis of England's previous two World Cup squads shows that if you apply the 50-miles-from-Manchester test, in 2014 there were 10 members of the squad from this corner of England, while in 2010 there were just six. Another striking fact about the composition of England's 23-man squad is that not one player grew up in the Midlands. (While some might argue that Gary Cahill, who grew up in north-west Derbyshire, is from the East Midlands, his hometown of Dronfield is only about five miles from Sheffield - the city where the boyhood Sheffield Wednesday fan played much of his football as a youngster.) Going all the way back tothatWorld Cup in 1966, there's not been a single England squad without at least one Midlands-raised player in it - many have had several. Even if we exclude Cahill, in 2018 Sheffield alone can boast three of England's 23 players - Kyle Walker, Jamie Vardy and Harry Maguire are all from the steel city. Spreading the net a little further, fellow Yorkshiremen include Danny Rose, from Doncaster, John Stones, from Barnsley, and Fabian Delph, from Bradford. If we head westwards into red rose territory, we can visit Manchester, the childhood stamping ground of Marcus Rashford and Danny Welbeck, and Ramsbottom, the hometown of Kieran Trippier. The trio who make up what England fans will be hoping is a lucky 13 are Jesse Lingard, from Warrington, Phil Jones, from Clayton-le-Woods in Lancashire, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, from Liverpool. Wales Street in Oldham, Greater Manchester - which has been renamed England Street for the World Cup - is in the heart of England's northern stronghold The number of squad members from London and the surrounding area is similar to four years ago - although the figure is way down from 2010, when 11 of England's players came from this part of the country. Representing London this time around are Harry Kane, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Raheem Sterling, who moved to the capital from Jamaica as a young boy. There are also two players from the city's commuter belt: Dele Alli, who hails from Milton Keynes, and Ashley Young, who grew up in Stevenage in Hertfordshire. Although it's only about 25 miles due north of west London, Stevenage is officially considered to be in the East, which is the part of England where Nick Pope grew up - he's from Soham in Cambridgeshire. Completing the squad are Jack Butland, who grew up in Clevedon, near Bristol, and Eric Dier, who, while born up the M5 in Cheltenham,moved to Portugal at the age of seven. And so if England do continue to make an impression on this World Cup, we might well be crediting a core of northern defensive grit - as well as some London firepower.

"This video can not be played Why do North Koreans revere a mountain? US President Donald Trump has renewed sanctions on North Korea, citing an ""extraordinary threat"" from its nuclear weapons - just 10 days after saying there was no risk from Pyongyang. ""There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea,"" he tweeted on 13 June, a day after meeting the country's leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore. The move came as the US and South Korea cancelled two more training exercises. The Pentagon said the goal was to support diplomatic negotiations. It follows the decision earlier this week to suspend a major joint military exercise between the US and South Korea that had been planned for August. President Trump promised to end the annual ""war games"" between the allies in an unexpected concession at his summit with Mr Kim, calling them ""provocative"" and ""expensive"". Did the summit rhetoric match reality? North Korea crisis in 300 words What are the US-South Korea war games? That came as a shock to many, as the US had previously argued that the drills were purely defensive and key to its military alliance with Seoul. It does sound that way, but the US has had a ""national emergency"" in place with regard to North Korea since 2008. Since then, presidents have routinely renewed that status - and the anti-Pyongyang sanctions that go with it. President Trump extended the national emergency,externalon Friday due to ""the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea"". These ""continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States"", he said in a notice to Congress. Democrats say the latest White House language contradicts the president's earlier boasts about the success of the Singapore summit. In another tweet on 13 June, he said Americans could ""sleep well tonight!"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The report of President Trump's own administration completely undercuts his statements over the last few weeks,"" said the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer. ""We have to treat these negotiations far more seriously than just as a photo op,"" he added. ""Saying the North Korea problem is solved doesn't make it so."" At the historic meeting in Singapore, the first between a sitting US president and a leader of North Korea,Mr Trump and Mr Kim signed a statementin which the US offered ""security guarantees"" to North Korea, and the North pledged to ""work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"" - without defining what that meant. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that sanctions against North Korea will remain in place as negotiations continue over its nuclear arsenal. North Korean propaganda changes its tune What life is like for a North Korean family The Trump Kim handshake moment in pictures However North Korean state media has reported that Mr Trump agreed to ""lift sanctions"" as relations progress. This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: Win-win, or a Kim win? The Pentagon announced on Friday that US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had ""indefinitely suspended"" some joint military exercises with South Korea, following the president's commitment at the Singapore summit. The drills are held in South Korea with local forces and US soldiers stationed there. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? North Korea has furiously objected to the exercises for many years, branding them provocative and a rehearsal for invasion. China too has said they do not serve the cause of peace on the Korean Peninsula. Pentagon press secretary Dana White said the cancelled drills included Operation Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which was scheduled for August and set to involve more than 17,500 US service members, and two Korean Marine Exchange Programme training exercises scheduled for the next three months. It is not yet clear if major US drills slated for spring 2019 will also be suspended. The decision to end the military exercises has been widely criticised as a major concession to North Korea, while the joint declaration Mr Trump and Mr Kim signed at the end of the Singapore summit has been criticised as lacking in detail and concrete commitments from the North. After meeting Mr Kim in Singapore, Mr Trump told reporters: ""Under the circumstances, that we're negotiating... I think it's inappropriate to be having war games."" US and South Korean troops rehearse a beach landing in April 2017 Republican Senator John McCain has criticised the president's stance on the exercises, calling the suspensions a mistake. ""We must not impose upon ourselves the burden of providing so-called 'good faith' concessions as the price for continued dialogue,"" he said after the Singapore summit. This is not the first time that the US and South Korea have delayed joint exercises. Earlier in 2018, for example, they agreed to postpone drills during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea, amid a thaw in inter-Korean relations.

"Chef Anthony Bourdain was found dead at a French hotel on 8 June The mother of US chef and television personality Anthony Bourdain has revealed that she never liked her son's tattoos - but now plans to get one in memory of him. Bourdain, 61, was found dead on 8 June at a hotel in Kaysersberg, a small village in the Alsace region of France. Investigators said he hanged himself. A prosecutor said on Friday that his body had no traces of drugs or alcohol. Gladys Bourdain said her son had been cremated in France. She told the New York Times, where she previously worked as an editor, that Bourdain's ashes and belongings had been sent to his younger brother, Christopher,external. A private family ceremony will probably follow in due course, she added, saying: ""He would want as little fuss as possible."" The global appeal of Anthony Bourdain When Bourdain and Obama ate a $6 meal Why US suicide rate is on the rise Ms Bourdain told the paper she would visit her son's tattoo artist next week to get ""Tony"" inked on her inner wrist. The free-wheeling chef had several tattoos of his own, and got his first at the age of 44. In August 2017, he gave an interview to Maxim while getting a new inking,external- a stick-and-poke tattoo of a large chrysanthemum. He said his tattoos all ""mark a moment in time"", explaining: ""I don't overly place importance on them, but they do commemorate in a way that photographs can't. I stopped taking photographs a long time ago when I travel. ""There's this realisation that the lens is inadequate to capture the moment, so maybe I'm just looking to mark time in another way that's very personal."" Then US President Barack Obama enjoyed a Vietnamese meal with Bourdain in Hanoi in 2016, for an episode of the chef's CNN show Parts Unknown Bourdain, who helmed the CNN food and travel show Parts Unknown, said vanity was never a factor. ""Look, I'm 60 years old,"" he told Maxim. ""I well understand that any additional tattoos are not going to make me any younger, any hipper, any more relevant, or even more attractive. ""I'm driving an old car. It's filled with dents. One more dent ain't gonna make it any worse than this.""

"Average house prices are falling in Salcombe on the south coast of Devon Affording a home in one of Britain's ritziest seaside towns has long been way out of reach, even for the moderately rich. But now it seems that house prices in two of the smartest resorts have tumbled significantly in the last year. In the boating haven of Salcombe in South Devon, prices have fallen 8.2%, according to the Halifax. And in Sandbanks in Dorset, renowned for being the UK's most expensive resort, prices are down 5.6%. Scottish fishing port sees rising prices Seaside towns hit by rising tide of debt Buying a house in Salcombe has, on average, got Â£52,000 cheaper, while homes in Sandbanks cost Â£37,000 less than last year. A typical home in Sandbanks cost Â£626,553 at the start of 2018, according to the Land Registry. Sandbanks in Dorset However it is a different story in most other seaside towns. Prices are still rising in Aldeburgh, Lymington, Padstow and Lyme Regis in Dorset, for example. The Halifax said the main reason was the relatively high cost of Stamp Duty. Someone buying an average home in Sandbanks last year would have been liable for more than Â£23,000 in tax.

"The image stoked outrage over the Trump administration's policy A little girl who became the public face of US migrant family separations was not taken away from her mother at the US border, says her father. A photograph of the Honduran toddler sobbing in a pink jacket was snapped at the scene of a border detention. Time magazine has used the image for its latest cover, depicting President Donald Trump looming over the girl with the caption: ""Welcome to America"". But thousands of other child migrants have been taken from parents in the US. The chaotic process of reuniting families Migrant families separation: The big picture explained Trump hosts victims of illegal migrants The image was taken by photographer John Moore for the news agency Getty Images on 12 June at McAllen, Texas. The Pulitzer prize-winner told the BBC that the mother had been breastfeeding her child after crossing the Rio Grande in a raft in the moments before they were detained. Denis Valera (L) said his wife (R) had left him and their three other children in Honduras Mr Moore said they were taken away together by border patrol. The photo stoked outrage over the Trump administration's child migrant separations policy, rolled out in April, of removing young undocumented people from their mothers and fathers as they are detained for crossing the US-Mexico border.

She's tired and thirsty. It's 11 o'clock at night.'"" The little girl is two-year-old Yanela Denise, according to the Daily Mail newspaper. Mr Valera said Ms Sanchez and their daughter had left the Honduran city of Puerto Cortes without telling him or the couple's three other children. He said he believed she went to the US in search of better economic opportunities. Mr Valera told Reuters: ""If they are deported, that is OK as long as they do not leave the child without her mother. I am waiting to see what happens with them."" He told the Daily Mail he understands Ms Sanchez paid $6,000 to a smuggler,externalto get her across the border. According to the newspaper, the couple's three other children are aged 14, 11 and six.

"This video can not be played Liz Bonnin meets Shearwater chicks struggling for survival New footage of the devastating impact of plastic pollution on wildlife has been captured by a BBC team. Seabirds are starving to death on the remote Lord Howe Island, a crew filming for the BBC One documentary Drowning in Plastic has revealed. Their stomachs were so full of plastic there was no room for food. The documentary is part of aBBC initiative called Plastics Watch, tracking the impact of plastic on the environment. The marine biologists the team filmed are working on the island to save the birds. They captured hundreds of chicks - as they left their nests - to physically flush plastic from their stomachs and ""give them a chance to survive"". The birds nest in burrows on Lord Howe Island, which is more than 600 kilometres off the east coast of Australia. While chicks wait in the burrow, the parents head out to sea and dive for small fish and squid to feed their offspring. ""These birds are generalist predators,"" explained marine biologist Jennifer Lavers who works with the shearwater colony. ""They'll eat just about anything they're given. That's what's allowed them to thrive - a lack of pickiness. ""But when you put plastic in the ocean, it means they have no ability to detect plastic from non-plastic, so they eat it."" Parent birds unwittingly feeding plastic to their chicks means that the birds emerge from their burrows with stomachs filled with plastic, and with insufficient nutrition to enable them set out to sea and forage for themselves. The seabirds dive underwater for food, but often eat pieces of plastic But when the birds first head out of the burrow, the research team have been stepping in to help. ""If the amount of plastic is not so significant, we use a process called lavage, where we flush or wash the stomach - without harming the bird,"" explained Dr Lavers. The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Beach checks tackle plastic 'scourge' 50 nations 'curbing plastic pollution' The BBC crew filmed the team working with individual chicks - using tubes to flush their stomachs with seawater and make them regurgitate the plastic. Researchers use seawater to flush out a bird's stomach Liz Bonnin, who presents the series, said what she saw on Lord Howe Island was one of the hardest things she had witnessed in her career. ""It was shocking to see how much would come out of one chick,"" she told BBC News. ""We saw, I think 90 pieces come out of one of the chicks on the second night. ""But the scientists were telling us they sometimes pull out 200 or 250 pieces of plastic out of dead birds or from the regurgitation. ""It's obscene when you think about it."" Jennifer Lavers added that most of the plastic she and her colleagues have found in their work with the birds is ""entirely preventable"". Some parts of the ocean now contain more pieces of plastic than plankton ""We find plastic clothes pegs, plastic tooth brushes. Those could easily be swapped out for other materials - aluminium or wood. My own toothbrush is made of bamboo. ""When we look at changes like that and scale them up across the entire human population, it could really make a difference. ""I so look forward to a future where I'm not pulling clothes pegs out of the bellies of baby birds - that would be brilliant.""

He told the Daily Mail he understands Ms Sanchez paid $6,000 to a smuggler,externalto get her across the border. According to the newspaper, the couple's three other children are aged 14, 11 and six.

California congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (R) holds a photo of the little girl at an immigration protest on Capitol Hill on Tuesday Time magazine defended its cover on Friday, saying that the photograph of the girl ""became the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America for a reason"". ""Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment,"" wrote the magazine's editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal. The magazine also corrected its story, which said the girl was ""carried away screaming by US Border Patrol agents"", to instead say the mother and daughter were ""taken away together"". White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Twitter claimed that Democrats and the media ""exploited this photo of a little girl to push their agenda"". ""She was not separated from her mom. The separation here is from the facts,"" she wrote. On Friday, Mr Trump accused Democrats of playing politics with ""phony stories of sadness and grief"".

"This video can not be played Boris Becker: ""I believed the documents they were giving me must be right"" Former tennis champion Boris Becker has told the BBC he has a genuine diplomatic passport issued by the Central African Republic (CAR), despite CAR officials saying it is fake. Lawyers for Mr Becker say he is immune from bankruptcy proceedings in London because he holds diplomatic status. But the CAR's foreign minister says the passport is fake and he has asked the justice minister to investigate. Mr Becker said he was happy to go to the CAR to end the ""misunderstanding"". ""I don't know what is internally happening within the politics [of CAR] but I have received the passport from the ambassador,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""I have spoken to the president on many occasions. I believe the documents they have given me must be right."" Asked if he would be willing to go the CAR if requested, he said: ""I am very happy, any time soon, to visit Bangui, the capital, and to speak to the people personally about how we can move forward and how we can resolve this misunderstanding and this confusion."" A country with bigger problems than Boris Becker What is diplomatic protection? Should diplomats still have immunity? Mr Becker was declared bankrupt in 2017 over money owed to private bank Arbuthnot Latham and is now being pursued for ""further assets"". Lawyers for the 50-year-old three-time Wimbledon champion told a court hearing in London that he was appointed a sport and culture attache to the EU by the CAR in April. In that month he tweeted a picture of himself shaking hands with CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadera in Brussels. Boris Becker was pictured shaking hands with the president of CAR in April In a statement issued on Friday by his lawyers, Mr Becker said the furore was a ""storm in a teacup"". ""Someone seems to have got their wires crossed in the Central African Republic, but my appointment was entirely official and above board, and was made by the president. Everyone's seen the photos published when my appointment was announced. This fuss about documents is pretty irrelevant."" Earlier this week, CAR foreign ministry chief of staff Cherubin Moroubama told AFP news agency the serial number on the document matched one of a batch of ""new passports that were stolen in 2014"". He added that the diplomatic passport, dated 19 March 2018, did not bear the signature or the stamp of the foreign minister. The tennis star became the first German to win Wimbledon in 1985, aged 17. He won it again in 1986 and 1989 among the 64 ATP Tour titles he claimed during a 15-year career. After retiring as a player he became a commentator with the BBC.

"Things took an emotional turn on Paul McCartney's Carpool Karaoke A special UK edition of Carpool Karaoke took an emotional turn as Sir Paul McCartney joined James Corden on a trip to Liverpool. The Late Late Show host was joined by the singer as they drove past famous Beatles landmarks. McCartney told how a dream, in which his mother told him to ""let it be"", inspired the song of the same name. Corden said it was the ""most beautiful story"" he had ever heard, before singing a teary rendition of the song. ""Oh man, it got me emotional there,"" Corden said. ""I didn't feel it coming."" McCartney recalled how,externalhe ""had a dream in the '60s where my mum, who died, came to me in the dream and was reassuring me, saying, 'it's going to be OK. Just let it be.'"" He added: ""She gave me the positive word. So I woke up and I went: 'What was that? What'd she say? Let it be? I've never heard that. That's kind of good.'"" Sir Paul McCartney: 'Retire from what?' Sir Paul's surprise pub gig Explaining why the story made him so emotional, Corden said: ""I can remember my grandad, who was a musician, and my dad, sitting me down and saying, 'we're going to play you the best song you've ever heard'. ""And I remember them playing me that. If my grandad was here right now, he'd get an absolute kick out of this."" McCartney made it even more poignant when he told Corden: ""He is."" During the drive, Corden told McCartney: ""Your music is so full of positivity and joy and a message of love and togetherness, I feel like it's more relevant now today maybe than it's ever been."" The episode ended with a surprise gig at a Liverpool pub He agreed, saying: ""We expected it to last 10 years, but it keeps going on, and on, and on. And it keeps being relevant."" McCartney also revealed how he wrote his first song at the age of 14. As part of the video, the pair embarked on a journey around McCartney's hometown, visiting Penny Lane and his family home, which he saw for the first time in 50 years.
