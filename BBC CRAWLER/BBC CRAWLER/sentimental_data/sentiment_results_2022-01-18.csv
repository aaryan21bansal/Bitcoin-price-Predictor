"Indoor events such as concerts and nightclubs will be able to open again from next Monday Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions are to be eased, with nightclubs reopening, large indoor events resuming and social distancing rules dropped. The changes will take effect from Monday 24 January after a ""significant fall"" in new case numbers. However, people are still being asked to work from home and to take lateral flow tests before meeting with others. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that Scotland had ""turned the corner on the Omicron wave"". Guidance advising adults against meeting up with more than three households at a time will also be scrapped, along with curbs on indoor contact sports. And ministers have decided against extending the vaccine passport scheme to more hospitality settings ""at this stage"". What are the Covid rules in Scotland? What happens when Covid becomes endemic? How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Ms Sturgeon said that while Omicron is still infecting ""large numbers of people"", there had been a significant fall in the number of new infections over the past two weeks. A total of 20,268 positive cases have been reported over the past three days, compared to 36,526 over the same three days last week. The percentage of tests coming back positive has dropped from almost 30% in early January to under 20% now. It is now thought that the Omicron wave peaked in the first week of January, and the number of people being admitted to hospital with the virus is also falling. Hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants will no longer need to operate on a table service only basis Restrictions introduced over the festive period are being phased out, with limits on crowds at outdoor events such as football matches having beenlifted on Monday of this week. From next Monday, the limits on attendance at indoor public events, the requirement for 1m physical distancing and table service in hospitality venues, and the requirement for nightclubs to close will also be removed. However longer-running measures such as the use of face coverings on public transport and indoor public places will continue, while Ms Sturgeon said people were advised to continue to keep gatherings ""small"" to reduce the risk of infection. People should also continue to work from home wherever possible for now, but Ms Sturgeon said talks would be held with businesses about ""a return to a more hybrid approach from the start of February"". The first minister said that Scotland was ""once again entering a calmer phase of the pandemic"", but warned there was still ""significant pressure"" on health services. She said: ""Although we can be increasingly optimistic at this stage, we must all still play our part in helping further slow the spread of the virus."" Whisper it but this really should be the beginning of the end of lockdown-style Covid restrictions in Scotland. As the current Omicron measures are eased, the Scottish government certainly has no intention of bringing any of them back. In fact, they are working on a new strategy for living with Covid without major restrictions in future. That does not mean pretending coronavirus has gone away or abandoning all attempts to limit its spread. For instance, the first minister has already said that some continued mask wearing in public is likely. But the hope is that the continued use of vaccination and the exercise of personal responsibility can take more of the strain in future. Opposition parties are anxious for more details of this revised approach which, of course, depends on Covid not mutating into a more dangerous strain. The changes were broadly welcomed by business groups, with CBI Scotland saying the easing of rules for hospitality was ""a huge relief to firms desperate to start trading their way to recovery after a difficult festive period"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce echoed this, and welcomed the decision not to extend vaccine passports to more venues -  while calling on ministers to ""remove the shackles from offices as urgently as possible"". And the Federation of Small Businesses said withdrawing restrictions ""doesn't mean that local economies will necessarily bounce back"", calling for the government to ""work hard to build business and consumer confidence"". The Scottish Conservatives also welcomed the easing of Covid measures, with health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane saying there had been a ""sea change"" in government policy ""towards trusting the Scottish public"". However the party called for the vaccine passport scheme to be scrapped altogether, and for a ""credible plan"" to tackle waiting times in the NHS. Ms Sturgeon said the decision on vaccine passports was ""finely balanced"", but that if case numbers were to rise again then extending the scheme to all licensed hospitality venues ""may well be a more proportionate alternative to other, more restrictive measures"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the changes would ""offer hope to a lot of people who can once again look forward to getting some more normality back in their lives"". However he said businesses were ""teetering on the brink"", and called on the government to go further in getting promised financial support to firms. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister announces plans to end Plan B measures in England England's Plan B measures are to end from next Thursday, with mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports both dropped, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister also said the government would immediately drop its advice for people to work from home. The PM said England was reverting to ""Plan A"" due to boosters and how people had followed Plan B measures. He told MPs scientists believed the Omicron wave had peaked nationally. At a Downing Street press conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is a moment we can all be proud of. ""It's a reminder of what this country can accomplish when we all work together."" But, he said, this should not be seen as the ""finish line"" because the virus and future variants cannot be eradicated - instead ""we must learn to live with Covid in the same way we live with flu"". He urged people to continue taking steps to keep the virus at bay, including hand washing, ventilating rooms and self-isolating if positive - and pressed those who were unvaccinated to come forward to get their jabs. Earlier, in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, the prime minister said: Mandatory Covid passports for entering nightclubs and large events would end, though organisations could choose to use the NHS Covid pass if they wished People would no longer be advised to work from home and should discuss their return to offices with employers Face masks will no longer be mandated, though people are still advised to wear coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers From Thursday, secondary school pupils will no longer have to wear face masks in classrooms and government guidance on their use in communal areas would be removed ""shortly"" Further announcements on the easing of travel rules and restrictions on care home visits in England are expected in the coming days, Boris Johnson added. 'Plan B was a catastrophe for our coffee shop' Covid infections falling across the UK, says ONS How are Covid rules changing next week? The prime minister also said the government intended to end the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate - and replace it with advice and guidance. The current regulations around self-isolation expire on 24 March. Mr Johnson said he expected not to renew them then - and suggested that date could be brought forward if the data allows. Citing thelatest infection study by the Office for National Statistics,external, Mr Johnson said its data showed that infections levels were falling in England. He also said hospital admissions had stabilised and scientists believed ""it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally"". However, he said he did expect cases to continue rising in primary schools and pointed to significant pressures on the NHS in north-east and north-west England. Looking ahead, Mr Johnson said the government would set out its long-term strategy for living with coronavirus. He urged people to ""remain cautious"" during the last weeks of winter as there were still ""significant pressures"" on the NHS and the pandemic was ""not over"". In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would back lifting Plan B measures ""as long as the science says it is safe"" and accused the prime minister of being ""too distracted"" to have a ""robust plan to live well with Covid"". School leaders' unions said Covid remained a challenge for schools, with high numbers of staff and pupils absent. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the end of face coverings in classrooms, but warned the government risked giving the impression the crisis was over when there was still huge disruption in education. And the Royal College of Nursing said dropping Plan B would do ""nothing to ease the pressure on the NHS"". ""We can't rely on the vaccine alone when the situation is still so precariously balanced,"" its chief executive Pat Cullen said. But for the hospitality sector, which suffered as people worked from home and were cautious over Omicron, there was relief. Industry group UKHospitality said businesses could now begin their revival and recovery. The whole of Plan B is going. But is it too soon? Infections levels, while falling, are still well above what they were last winter. And hospital admissions have only just started coming down. The fact remains that England - and the rest of the UK for that matter - is one of the best protected nations when you combine the immunity built up by vaccination and previous infection. This does not mean people will not catch the virus in the future, but it does limit how many will become seriously ill. What's more, this Omicron wave appears to have peaked at just over 2,000 hospital admissions a day - very much best-case scenario territory. This has given both ministers and the scientists advising them confidence that it's at least time to ease restrictions. Others will argue this is going too far, too quickly. But in the end it comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. And certainly you have to wonder what impact the politics involved in this has had - the Tory backbenchers were unlikely to vote to keep any part of Plan B. But in the end it also comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. There is a trade-off that has to be made between the costs of such restrictions and the benefits they bring. With the worst of the Omicron wave almost certainly over, the benefits were reducing. The latest Covid restrictions were first introduced in December to try to slow the spread of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant and allow time for the booster vaccine rollout. UK daily infections remain high but are falling - on Wednesday, the UK recorded 108,069 new cases. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency's chief medical adviser, said case rates would largely decline but ""may plateau at some point"". Vaccine uptake and mask wearing around strangers would determine how quickly that happens, she added. Hospital admissions also appear to be decreasing. However, there is a lag between people catching the virus and becoming seriously ill so deaths are continuing to rise - and are up 14.7% on last week. On Wednesday, 359 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded. Nearly 37 million boosters have been given across the UK so far. RULES:What are the latest rules in the UK? MASKS:Where do I need to wear a face covering? COVID PASSPORTS:Where do I need to show one? SCHOOLS:What are the rules in schools? The UK's devolved nations set their own Covid restrictions andhave moved at different speeds in introducing and easing them throughout the pandemic. InScotland, some restrictions will be lifted from Monday, including allowing nightclubs to reopen and removing limits on indoor events. In Wales, crowds will return to sporting events from Friday and nightclubs can reopen the following week. In Northern Ireland, nightclubs remain closed and indoor standing events are not allowed.

"Microsoft says it plans to buy major games company Activision Blizzard in a deal worth $68.7bn (Â£50.57bn). It would be the biggest acquisition in the company's history and is expected to be finalised in 2023. The move means Microsoft will take ownership of gaming franchises like Call of Duty, Warcraft and Overwatch. Microsoft claims it will help them grow their gaming business across mobile, PC and consoles along with providing building blocks for the metaverse. This deal is the biggest in gaming history and comes a year after Microsoft bought another influential gaming companyBethesda for $7.5bn. Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft said: ""We're investing deeply in world-class content, community and the cloud to usher in a new era of gaming that puts players and creators first and makes gaming safe, inclusive and accessible to all."" Activision Blizzard has studios around the world with nearly 10,000 employees. It has been dealing with accusations of a toxic work-place culture andclaims of sexual harassment in recent months. Last year Phil Spencer, the boss of Xbox, said he was'deeply troubled',externalby the claims. The games Activision Blizzard make, from Call of Duty to Candy Crush, are some of the most popular in the world. The company has nearly 400 million monthly active players in 190 countries and billion-dollar franchises. Microsoft say they are working to bring Activision Blizzard games to their Game Pass subscription service. The deal has shocked the gaming industry. Allow Twitter content?

In an era of increased competition, content is king. Currently it's reported that the PlayStation 5 is outselling Microsoft's latest generation of consoles. It's argued by some that this is down to the fact that in recent years Sony's machines have had more appealing exclusive titles - games that can't be played on a variety of devices. In the battle to attract more gamers to their platforms these exclusive titles and experiences are crucial. It is not yet clear if Activision Blizzard games, which at the moment can be played on both Microsoft and Sony consoles, will become exclusive to Xbox. Bethesda is making its first new original intellectual property in 25 years, Starfield, exclusively for Microsoft However, with Xbox convinced that a Netflix-style gaming subscription could be the future of gaming,  being able to offer more content linked to these major titles on their service will be a big bonus. They are clearly excited about what the acquisition means for their Game Pass Service, with Spencer saying they ""will offer as many Activision Blizzard games as we can within Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, both new titles and games from Activision Blizzard's catalogue."" When Microsoft bought games studio Bethesda in 2021, it was thought the developer of franchises like Fallout and Skyrim would continue to make games for other platforms. Now their big upcoming release Starfield will be a Microsoft exclusive. Spencer has explained in a blog post that until the deal is finalised, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft Gaming will operate independently. Bobby Kotick will remain as the CEO of Activision. Once the deal is complete, the Activision Blizzard business will report to Microsoft.

"US mobile networks AT&T and Verizon have agreed to postpone the rollout of their new 5G service at some airports. The C-band service, which offers faster speeds and broader coverage, was due to be turned on tomorrow. But airlines in the US have pushed to delay the start, warning that the signals could interfere with aeroplane navigation systems. The telecoms firms expressed frustration as they bowed to pressure to limit their rollout. AT&T said it was ""temporarily"" deferring the rollout at a ""limited number of towers around certain airport runways"". Regulators had had ""two years"" to plan for the start of 5G service, it added. ""We are frustrated by the Federal Aviation Administration's inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner,"" AT&T said in a statement. ""We are launching our advanced 5G services everywhere else as planned with the temporary exception of this limited number of towers."" Verizon also said it had ""voluntarily decided to limit our 5G network around airports"". This third postponement came as the White House and aviation authorities rushed to work out a solution to an issue that airlines have warned could cause major disruption, forcing them to ground some of their fleets and cancel flights. In a statement, President Joe Biden thanked Verizon and AT&T for agreeing the delay, which he said would affect only about 10% of wireless tower locations. ""This agreement protects flight safety and allows aviation operations to continue without significant disruption and will bring more high-speed internet options to millions of Americans,"" he said, adding that officials would continue talks to find a ""permanent, workable solution around these key airports"". Phone companies have spent tens of billions of dollars to upgrade their networks to deploy the 5G technology, which brings much faster internet services and greater connectivity. But airlines fear C-band 5G signals will disrupt planes' navigation systems, particularly those used in bad weather. Two major plane makers, Airbus and Boeing, have also voiced concerns. In a recent letter to regulators, the 10 biggest US airlines said they wanted 5G signals to be excluded from ""the approximate two miles of airport runways at affected airports as defined by the FAA on 19 January 2022"". ""This will allow 5G to be deployed while avoiding harmful impacts on the aviation industry, travelling public, supply chain, vaccine distribution, our workforce and broader economy. ""We further ask that the FAA immediately identify those base stations closest to key airport runways that need to be addressed to ensure safety and avoid disruption,"" they added. Why your new phone could disrupt flights and ground planes Top US phone firms agree delay of 5G rollout Boeing and Airbus warn US over 5G safety concerns There have been several delays already because of the aviation concerns, with launch dates in December and earlier this month both being pushed back. Wireless industry groups say airlines are distorting the risks. Despite Tuesday's deal, some airlines including Air India and Japan's biggest airline, ANA Holdings said they had cancelled some US-bound flights because of possible 5G interference. The much-hyped expansion of 5G networks in the US has been chaotic, to say the least. The rollout has been delayed twice - and now AT&T and Verizon have bowed to intense pressure, agreeing to defer opening some parts of the network near airports. This happened because of concerns about the safety of aircraft. To mitigate those concerns, airlines would have had to operate under restrictions they clearly found intolerable. But those safety issues have been well publicised for more than a year. There was clearly time to come up with a mitigation plan - and other countries have been able to do just that. The question is, why were US regulators, telecoms operators, airlines and airports apparently unable to come up with a workable solution? In other countries, telecoms companies have been required to reduce 5G signals around airports by taking steps such as pointing antennae away from control towers. But US firms were not expecting those types of limits to be imposed when they spent billions on 5G infrastructure, said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a professor of transportation economics at George Washington University and a former deputy assistant secretary at the US Department of Transportation. ""They want to get the most out of their investment,"" she said. ""What they should have been told beforehand is that they would not have free rein to use it because it could interfere with the planes but they were not given that information in advance."" In an update on Sunday, the FAA, which oversees aviation safety across the US, said it had cleared ""an estimated 45% of the US commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at many of the airports where 5G C-band will be deployed"". The FAA added that it had approved ""two radio altimeter models that are installed in a wide variety of Boeing and Airbus planes"". ""Even with these new approvals, flights at some airports may still be affected,"" the regulator said. ""The FAA also continues to work with manufacturers to understand how radar altimeter data is used in other flight control systems. Passengers should check with their airlines if weather is forecast at a destination where 5G interference is possible.""

"Carwyn Roberts pleaded guilty to controlling and coercive behaviour at an earlier hearing A man who pretended to be a lawyer, doctor and council official to control his girlfriend's life has been given a two-year suspended prison sentence. The 29-year-old usedÂ fake email accounts to lie, including saying his partner had been drugged and abused. Carwyn Roberts, from Bangor, had previously pleaded guilty to controlling and coercive behaviour at Mold Crown Court. He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours community service. The court was told Roberts met his girlfriend on website Plenty of Fish before they moved into her flat together. Coercive control: Male victims say they aren't believed 'I went to prison three times - I'm so ashamed' The leisure centre worker told her he was getting an inheritance of Â£300,000 and suggested they begin looking at houses. But there was no inheritance. Emails she had supposedly been getting from a solicitor about the house buy were from Roberts. The 'solicitor' also asked about her sexual history, suggested there were cameras in her flat which had recorded her being unfaithful. Roberts met his girlfriend on dating website Plenty of Fish Still pretending to be a lawyer, Roberts told her there were ongoing criminal proceedings against men who had sexually abused her.Â He then convinced his girlfriend to quit her job after telling her about a position at Gwynedd Council. She then received fake local authority emails appeared to offering her employment.Â Posing as a doctor, Roberts sent missives telling his girlfriend she was pregnant. One of her relatives raised the alarm as they believed there was something not right about a scan picture they were shown. It had been found by Roberts online. In a victim impact statement the woman, who had a history of anxiety and depression, said Roberts hadÂ ""manipulated her, knowing what to say to make her feel special and safe"".Â She said she felt ashamed when she thought of him watching her packing their things to move to a new home that did not exist. He made her jobless and financially dependent on him and humiliated her, she said. ""He exploited all my insecurities,"" she said.Â Sentencing him to two years imprisonment, suspended for two years, Judge Niclas Parry said he accepted Carwyn Roberts struggled with his own ""vulnerabilities"", but said his behaviour had been ""cruel and despicable"". He said the case would be bizarre were it not so serious. ""She wanted to believe these things,"" Judge Parry said. ""The whole experience led her to anxiety and desperation."" Roberts was ordered to pay more than Â£3,000 court costs. A restraining order, banning him from contacting his victim or her daughter was made.Â In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service's Rhian Jones, dubbed the manipulation ""staggering"". She said: ""The CPS were able to build a strong case showing the number of fake accounts and emails could be traced back to him, demonstrating he had told lie after lie.""

"Ahmed Mogni (right) downed Ghana in Garoua with two second-half goals Ghana suffered a humiliating group-stage exit at the Africa Cup of Nations after the four-time champions were beaten by debutants Comoros. El Fardou Ben Nabouhane put the islanders ahead early on, and Ghana then went down to 10 men when Andre Ayew was shown a straight red card. Ahmed Mogni doubled the lead before the Black Stars fought back to make it 2-2. However, Mogni tapped in his second in the 85th minute to inflict Ghana's first group-stage exit since 2006. The result in Group C will go down as one of the biggest shocks in Nations Cup history as Comoros scored at the finals for the first time and then went on to record their maiden victory. Incredibly, the side ranked 132nd in the world now have a chance to reach the knockout stages as one of four best-ranked third-placed sides even though the Coelacanths lost their first two games in Cameroon. The tiny island nation with just under a million inhabitants - and more famous for itshistory of political coupsthan its football - had only won its first Nations Cup or World Cup qualifier in 2016 at the 20th attempt. A squad bolstered by members of the diaspora, with many plying their trade in the lower leagues in France, lost just once toachieve a maiden qualificationand Comoros have now beaten one of the continent's giants. Ghana had put in disjointed displays in their first two games, a 1-0 defeat by Morocco and a niggly 1-1 draw with Gabon, and finish bottom of the group table despite putting in a spirited display following Ayew's 25th-minute sending off. Africa Cup of Nations fixtures Africa Cup of Nations group tables Their fans in the Roumde Adjia Stadium in Garoua looked stunned at the full-time whistle, being left to contemplate a rollercoaster second half which ended their bid for a first Nations Cup title since 1982. Their exit will increase the pressure on coach Milovan Rajevac, who returned fora second spell in charge in September. The Serb led the Black Stars to the Nations Cup final in 2010 and the World Cup quarter-finals the same year, and guided the West Africans through to Africa's play-offs for this year's World Cup. However, Ghana only won their qualifying group ahead of South Africa on goals scored and are unseeded for the play-off draw - where they will face one of Senegal, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Nigeria for a place in Qatar. Comoros, meanwhile, celebrated their three points heartily and now await the final round of matches in the remaining three groups to see if their stunning victory can extend their stay at the tournament. Ghana had needed a win to have a chance of a spot in the last 16 and made the worst possible start by conceding in the fourth minute. Ibroihim Youssouf was released down the right before finding Ben Nabouhane in the middle, and the Comoros skipper sent a low left-footed shot into the bottom right-hand corner from the edge of the area. Kamaldeen Sulemana tested Comoros keeper Salim Ben Boina with two shots from outside the area, the second of which provided another turning point in the contest. Ben Boina spilled the winger's shot and Ayew went in strongly in an attempt to win the loose ball. Andre Ayew's red card left Ghana facing an uphill task The coming together injured the keeper and the Ghana captain looked surprised to be shown red following a video assistant referee review, with replays showing he went in with studs up and made contact with Ben Boina's upper arm. The Comoros keeper was injured in the clash and forced off, leading to the introduction of Ali Ahamada, who came into the tournament without a club side. The islanders made it 2-0 just after the hour mark as Mogni twisted and turned the Ghana defence on the edge of the area before sending a low shot past Jojo Wollacott and into the bottom right-hand corner. The strike sparked a group celebration down by the corner-flag involving substitutes - but Ghana immediately stirred. Richmond Boakye looped in a header from a corner and, after Ahamada had clawed away two threatening balls in from Daniel-Kofi Kyereh, Ghana levelled in the 77th minute from another set piece. Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey flicked on a corner and Alexander Djiku was on hand to convert from close range to give the Black Stars renewed hopes of going through. But those dreams were dashed five minutes from time when Bendjaloud Youssouf cut the ball back for Mogni to seal a famous win for Comoros. Ghana, who appear to lack leaders of the calibre of Asamoah Gyan, the striker who led them to the last eight at the World Cup 12 years ago, now face the challenge of regrouping before March's World Cup play-offs. Thomas Partey took over as Ghana captain following Andre Ayew's sending off, but the midfielder endured a frustrating evening Caf FA Cup: Aston Villa come back to beat West Ham in Potter's first game - reaction Moyes in talks with Everton over return to club Potter's first West Ham game ends in defeat at Villa Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

"Emma Raducanu became Britain's first female Grand Slam single's champion in 44 years when she won the US Open in September Australian Open 2022 Dates:17-30 JanuaryVenue:Melbourne Park Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries online; TV highlights from middle Saturday. Britain's Emma Raducanu showed quality and resilience to beat American Sloane Stephens in three sets for a spot in the Australian Open second round. On her senior debut in Melbourne, the US Open champion won 6-0 2-6 6-1 against Stephens, another previous winner in New York. Raducanu, seeded 17th, was sharp as she wrapped up the first set in 17 minutes before errors crept into her game. Stephens took advantage to level but Raducanu reasserted control to win. The 19-year-old will face Montenegro's Danka Kovinic in the second round on Thursday. Raducanu cupped her head and dropped the racquet in what is becoming a trademark celebration, illustrating how much it meant to win in her first Grand Slam match since Flushing Meadows. ""Both me and Sloane put everything out there and it was a very good match,"" said Raducanu, who wrapped up victory shortly before midnight and thanked an excited crowd for staying. ""We had some great rallies and I'm happy to come through against such a great champion."" Raducanu 'loving Australian Open energy' Murray wins five-set thriller on Melbourne return Watson & Evans advance but Dart & Broady beaten A zoo, a boo or Ronaldo's 'siuuu' - the incredible atmosphere of 'the people's court' Kvitova out after 'painful' first-round loss Intrigue has surrounded Raducanu going into the 2022 season as everyone wonders how she will follow her stunning ascent to the US Open title. Eyebrows were raised when her opening match of the year ended in a 6-0 6-1 defeat by Kazakhstan's Elena Rybakina in Sydney. Wins have been hard to come by since her stunning victory in New York, but she showed again in Melbourne how much she thrives on the big stage. With her pre-season preparation limited by contracting Covid-19, Raducanu lost to Rybakina in 55 minutes. Against 68th-ranked Stephens, it looked like Raducanu might be wrapped up even earlier a week on - this time for wildly different reasons. Stephens, who won the 2017 US Open, had not played for two months and only arrived in Australia recently after getting married on New Year's Day in the US. Her lack of on-court time showed as she won only four points in an error-strewn opening set. The second set completely switched. Raducanu was the one who started to make mistakes - racking up 19 unforced errors compared to only two in the first - and 28-year-old Stephens took advantage to level. Raducanu, who had never played a deciding set in a Grand Slam main-draw match, broke serve twice to race 5-0 in front in the final set. Three match points quickly arrived in the seventh game and, after a brief delay caused by an intruding moth on the baseline, Raducanu took the final match point when Stephens flicked into the net. ""It was a tough match-up for a first round,"" said Raducanu. ""I knew there would some long rallies because her athleticism is right up there. I had to work extremely hard for those points. ""Coming out for the first set, I played very good tennis, but of course there was always going to be some adversity. I'm happy to have regrouped in the third set. ""I don't think the scoreline reflected what happened in the third set."" Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Melbourne Park The Emma Raducanu of the first set looked every inch the player who had steamed through the US Open draw without dropping a set. The 19-year-old, bursting with confidence, allowed Sloane Stephens only four points. She was decisive, aggressive and utterly dominant. Back came Stephens, though, to leave Raducanu in unchartered territory - a first deciding set in a Grand Slam match. That final set was closer than the scoreline suggests, but Raducanu took all her chances and then showed great delight at the moment of victory. Grand Slam wins should always be a big deal when you are a teenager, and given the thrashing she received by Elena Rybakina in Sydney last week, this was a win full of character by the US Open champion.

"Microsoft says it plans to buy major games company Activision Blizzard in a deal worth $68.7bn (Â£50.57bn). It would be the biggest acquisition in the company's history and is expected to be finalised in 2023. The move means Microsoft will take ownership of gaming franchises like Call of Duty, Warcraft and Overwatch. Microsoft claims it will help them grow their gaming business across mobile, PC and consoles along with providing building blocks for the metaverse. This deal is the biggest in gaming history and comes a year after Microsoft bought another influential gaming companyBethesda for $7.5bn. Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft said: ""We're investing deeply in world-class content, community and the cloud to usher in a new era of gaming that puts players and creators first and makes gaming safe, inclusive and accessible to all."" Activision Blizzard has studios around the world with nearly 10,000 employees. It has been dealing with accusations of a toxic work-place culture andclaims of sexual harassment in recent months. Last year Phil Spencer, the boss of Xbox, said he was'deeply troubled',externalby the claims. The games Activision Blizzard make, from Call of Duty to Candy Crush, are some of the most popular in the world. The company has nearly 400 million monthly active players in 190 countries and billion-dollar franchises. Microsoft say they are working to bring Activision Blizzard games to their Game Pass subscription service. The deal has shocked the gaming industry. Allow Twitter content?

In an era of increased competition, content is king. Currently it's reported that the PlayStation 5 is outselling Microsoft's latest generation of consoles. It's argued by some that this is down to the fact that in recent years Sony's machines have had more appealing exclusive titles - games that can't be played on a variety of devices. In the battle to attract more gamers to their platforms these exclusive titles and experiences are crucial. It is not yet clear if Activision Blizzard games, which at the moment can be played on both Microsoft and Sony consoles, will become exclusive to Xbox. Bethesda is making its first new original intellectual property in 25 years, Starfield, exclusively for Microsoft However, with Xbox convinced that a Netflix-style gaming subscription could be the future of gaming,  being able to offer more content linked to these major titles on their service will be a big bonus. They are clearly excited about what the acquisition means for their Game Pass Service, with Spencer saying they ""will offer as many Activision Blizzard games as we can within Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, both new titles and games from Activision Blizzard's catalogue."" When Microsoft bought games studio Bethesda in 2021, it was thought the developer of franchises like Fallout and Skyrim would continue to make games for other platforms. Now their big upcoming release Starfield will be a Microsoft exclusive. Spencer has explained in a blog post that until the deal is finalised, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft Gaming will operate independently. Bobby Kotick will remain as the CEO of Activision.

"Universal Basic Income provides a set amount of money to everyone in a specified area Plans for a universal basic income pilot in Wales are too small, a cross-party report has found. UBI is where a government pays all individuals a set salary, regardless of their means. The Welsh government plans a three-year pilot this April with about 250 care leavers, but a Senedd committee said the scheme would provide only ""limited information"" on the UBI concept. The Welsh government said the scheme would provide ""valuable information"". The UBI idea, where individuals are paid a regular sum of money, has sparked debate across the world. Advocates say a basic income could help reduce poverty, and could be easier and less stressful to navigate than more complex means-tested benefits. Opponents say it would be extremely costly, and is not targeted at those who need it. What is a universal basic income? Has coronavirus changed the basic income debate? Universal basic income to be tested in Wales The Welsh proposal for a pilot, in choosing to focus on a specific group, has been criticised for not being universal. Information on how the pilot will work has so far been limited, but the Welsh Parliament's petitions committee report, which is not produced by ministers but a body of the Senedd, outlines some details. It says the project would involve 250 care leavers, planned to run for about three years, and be ""pitched at the living wage"". The committee's inquiry was prompted by a petition signed by 1,051 people, calling for a geography-based UBI. This video can not be played An experiment in Finland saw 2,000 people paid â¬560 (Â£490) a month, instead of their unemployment benefit. Members of the Seneddon the committee, which includes two from Labour, one Plaid and one Conservative, said a larger group would provide more ""robust results."" ""A basic income pilot for care leavers - as currently proposed by the Welsh government - will provide valuable feedback on the potential of such a scheme to improve the support to a group which faces significant challenges,"" the committee said. ""However, a three-year pilot of only 250 people will offer limited information. And applying a basic income only to care leavers, will tell us little about universal basic income."" It said payments should be guaranteed, unconditional and paid to the individual. Benefits are not devolved in Wales and the UK government has opposed the UBI concept. The report said the pilot will ""be richer and produce more robust evidence if all relevant agencies are engaged in the enterprise"". ""The Welsh government should make every effort to persuade UK government departments to support the widest possible pilot scheme,"" it said. The report warned the project would be undermined ""if participants lost entitlements they currently claim as a direct result of a failure to communicate"" between the UK and Welsh governments. Implementing UBI in Wales would be ""far easier"" if welfare was devolved, the committee argued. Committee chairman Jack Sargeant said: ""The Welsh government should investigate increasing the number of proposed recipients and include care leavers from as diverse as possible a range of backgrounds, locations, and circumstances to give us the evidence we need to properly evaluate this scheme. ""While not all members of the committee support UBI, we all believe that a wider pilot scheme has the potential to produce richer, more persuasive evidence for the Welsh government to consider."" He added the evidence ""may prove that UBI is an inefficient way to target those in the greatest need - or it may prove my own view that the benefits attributed to other experiments, in terms of wellbeing and economic outcomes, are achievable here in Wales"". Swansea, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Gwynedd have called for pilots to take place in their areas. Experiments have been held in Finland with 2,000 people who were paid â¬560 (Â£467). The Senedd report says recipients were found to be ""more satisfied with their lives and experience less mental strain"". A Welsh government spokesman said: ""The provision of a basic income to young people leaving our care system should help to reduce the challenges care leavers face. In addition, evaluation of the pilot scheme will provide valuable information about how a basic income could apply more widely. ""The minister will make a statement in the coming weeks to provide an update on the pilot."" What is a universal basic income?

"Wales is the only country in the UK that does not have the power to decide it's own public holidays A move to make St David's Day a ""bank holiday"" for one council's workforce has been granted. Gwynedd Council has voted to make the country's patron saint's day a public holiday within its own borders. The move was granted at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, despite the UK Government rejecting the plans for a national bank holiday. Wales is the only nation in the Union not to have the power to decide its own national holidays. Everything you need to know about St David's Day St David: Ten things about the man and myth What is devolution and how does it work across the UK? Cabinet member Nia Jeffreys said: ""It is a national disgrace that in Wales we cannot choose and identify our own significant events, be they culturally, linguistically or of importance to our heritage. ""Westminster refuses to devolve the power to the Welsh Government to decide on this fundamental right."" Both Scotland and Northern Ireland have chosen to make the days dedicated to their patron saints, St Andrew and St Patrick, bank holidays. Daffodils and leeks are national emblems of Wales Llandderfel councillor Elwyn Edwards, who brought the proposal before the council, said she was ""delighted"" that the proposal had passed. ""It gives a clear message that we are serious, here in Gwynedd, to challenge the British rule of disregarding our own identity and heritage within Wales."" However, due to the ""national terms and conditions"" of teaching contracts, deputy leader Dafydd Meurig said the council was unable to include them in the process. It will cost the council about Â£200,000 to make 1 March a bank holiday, according to the council's finance team, as casual staff would need to be employed ""to ensure service continuity during staff absences"". St David's day was previously celebrated as a holiday in Anglesey, shortly after local government reorganisation and creation of the Isle of Anglesey county council in 1996. But the council said reorganisation had led to changes in terms and conditions, which resulted in staff losing certain benefits. ""As part of a compromise deal reached, staff were offered St David's Day as a statutory/concessionary holiday,"" said a council spokesperson. ""The St David's Day holiday came to an end on Anglesey after the formal adoption of single status (job evaluation) in 2015."" In Carmarthenshire, the leader of the council has written to Welsh government to ask for an all-Wales approach on St David's Day. Powys council said a motion to make 1 March a bank holiday lost by 12 votes in 2018. No other councils revealed plans to mark St David's Day as a bank holiday when contacted by BBC Wales.

"The slate landscape of north west Wales became the UK's 33rd World Heritage Site last year The success of a slate region given Unesco heritage status must be felt in all communities, a councillor has warned. The slate landscape of north-west Walesbecame the UK's 33rd World Heritage Site last year. But there are fears some communities will get too much tourism, while others could miss out. Gwynedd council said it was developing a sustainable tourism framework with Snowdonia National Park. With overseas travel being severely disrupted during the Covid pandemic, Snowdonia National Park said it had witnessed a significant increase in tourists. Seven reasons Wales has a new World Heritage Site What is a Unesco World Heritage site? While many see the benefits of a boost in trade, there have been pressures on infrastructure such as parking issues and a lack of facilities to make such tourism work in smaller communities. ""The frustrations are that people are refusing to pay for parking"", said Llanberis councillor Kevin Morris Jones. ""They park in our streets - imagine going to the shops for five minutes and then you come back home and there's a car there for the next eight hours."" Llanberis councillor Kevin Morris Jones says more villages should benefit from the success of the heritage site With the area having welcomed more visitors since the beginning of the pandemic, there are fears that a combination of factors, including the newly-designated Unesco site, could lead to an even greater influx. There are calls for the benefits brought by the Unesco status to be shared beyond the honey pot of Llanberis, including Dyffryn Nantlle, Dyffryn Ogwen Ffestiniog and Abergynolwyn. ""They need to remember that other villages are in the project as well and we need to share these people about,"" said Mr Jones. ""Other villages could benefit a lot from this. If people only come here, the village and the community is in for some hard years."" Snowdonia has attracted more tourists since the pandemic During the pandemic there have been many issues due to a lack of infrastructure to deal with more tourists, with locals complaining of severe traffic jams and dangerous parking near Snowdon. Gwynedd Council and the Snowdonia National Park Authority are holding public consultations and developing a framework to create a sustainable tourism model that will be announced later this year. Helen Pye, head of engagement for Snowdonia National Park, said: ""When you get people around the table - the combination of the public sector, private and community voices - that's when we get innovative ideas."" Helen Pye, from Snowdonia National Park, says getting people around the table generates ideas on how tourism can be sustainable Ms Pye said Unesco heritage status could protect communities as well as offer opportunities. ""Like our national park status, the area gets a lot more support because of the status in managing visitors to the area. ""We see the Unesco status as a way to tackle those challenges and to bring forward those important elements of culture and supporting local communities."" This video can not be played The slate landscape of north-west Wales is said to have ""roofed the 19th Century world"" Ms Pye stressed she had confidence all areas within the Unesco area would benefit over the coming years. Councillor Gareth Thomas, responsible for economic development at Gwynedd council, said he hoped Unesco status would increase tourism during off-peak times and alleviate pressure. ""The benefit of Unesco is that we can move people around Gwynedd if you like so that Llanberis and places like that won't see such high numbers,"" he said.

"US mobile networks AT&T and Verizon have agreed to postpone the rollout of their new 5G service at some airports. The C-band service, which offers faster speeds and broader coverage, was due to be turned on tomorrow. But airlines in the US have pushed to delay the start, warning that the signals could interfere with aeroplane navigation systems. The telecoms firms expressed frustration as they bowed to pressure to limit their rollout. AT&T said it was ""temporarily"" deferring the rollout at a ""limited number of towers around certain airport runways"". Regulators had had ""two years"" to plan for the start of 5G service, it added. ""We are frustrated by the Federal Aviation Administration's inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner,"" AT&T said in a statement. ""We are launching our advanced 5G services everywhere else as planned with the temporary exception of this limited number of towers."" Verizon also said it had ""voluntarily decided to limit our 5G network around airports"". This third postponement came as the White House and aviation authorities rushed to work out a solution to an issue that airlines have warned could cause major disruption, forcing them to ground some of their fleets and cancel flights. In a statement, President Joe Biden thanked Verizon and AT&T for agreeing the delay, which he said would affect only about 10% of wireless tower locations. ""This agreement protects flight safety and allows aviation operations to continue without significant disruption and will bring more high-speed internet options to millions of Americans,"" he said, adding that officials would continue talks to find a ""permanent, workable solution around these key airports"". Phone companies have spent tens of billions of dollars to upgrade their networks to deploy the 5G technology, which brings much faster internet services and greater connectivity. But airlines fear C-band 5G signals will disrupt planes' navigation systems, particularly those used in bad weather. Two major plane makers, Airbus and Boeing, have also voiced concerns. In a recent letter to regulators, the 10 biggest US airlines said they wanted 5G signals to be excluded from ""the approximate two miles of airport runways at affected airports as defined by the FAA on 19 January 2022"". ""This will allow 5G to be deployed while avoiding harmful impacts on the aviation industry, travelling public, supply chain, vaccine distribution, our workforce and broader economy. ""We further ask that the FAA immediately identify those base stations closest to key airport runways that need to be addressed to ensure safety and avoid disruption,"" they added. Why your new phone could disrupt flights and ground planes Top US phone firms agree delay of 5G rollout Boeing and Airbus warn US over 5G safety concerns There have been several delays already because of the aviation concerns, with launch dates in December and earlier this month both being pushed back. Wireless industry groups say airlines are distorting the risks. Despite Tuesday's deal, some airlines including Air India and Japan's biggest airline, ANA Holdings said they had cancelled some US-bound flights because of possible 5G interference. The much-hyped expansion of 5G networks in the US has been chaotic, to say the least. The rollout has been delayed twice - and now AT&T and Verizon have bowed to intense pressure, agreeing to defer opening some parts of the network near airports. This happened because of concerns about the safety of aircraft. To mitigate those concerns, airlines would have had to operate under restrictions they clearly found intolerable. But those safety issues have been well publicised for more than a year. There was clearly time to come up with a mitigation plan - and other countries have been able to do just that. The question is, why were US regulators, telecoms operators, airlines and airports apparently unable to come up with a workable solution? In other countries, telecoms companies have been required to reduce 5G signals around airports by taking steps such as pointing antennae away from control towers. But US firms were not expecting those types of limits to be imposed when they spent billions on 5G infrastructure, said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a professor of transportation economics at George Washington University and a former deputy assistant secretary at the US Department of Transportation. ""They want to get the most out of their investment,"" she said. ""What they should have been told beforehand is that they would not have free rein to use it because it could interfere with the planes but they were not given that information in advance."" In an update on Sunday, the FAA, which oversees aviation safety across the US, said it had cleared ""an estimated 45% of the US commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at many of the airports where 5G C-band will be deployed"". The FAA added that it had approved ""two radio altimeter models that are installed in a wide variety of Boeing and Airbus planes"". ""Even with these new approvals, flights at some airports may still be affected,"" the regulator said. ""The FAA also continues to work with manufacturers to understand how radar altimeter data is used in other flight control systems. Passengers should check with their airlines if weather is forecast at a destination where 5G interference is possible.""

"Emma Raducanu became Britain's first female Grand Slam single's champion in 44 years when she won the US Open in September Australian Open 2022 Dates:17-30 JanuaryVenue:Melbourne Park Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries online; TV highlights from middle Saturday. Britain's Emma Raducanu showed quality and resilience to beat American Sloane Stephens in three sets for a spot in the Australian Open second round. On her senior debut in Melbourne, the US Open champion won 6-0 2-6 6-1 against Stephens, another previous winner in New York. Raducanu, seeded 17th, was sharp as she wrapped up the first set in 17 minutes before errors crept into her game. Stephens took advantage to level but Raducanu reasserted control to win. The 19-year-old will face Montenegro's Danka Kovinic in the second round on Thursday. Raducanu cupped her head and dropped the racquet in what is becoming a trademark celebration, illustrating how much it meant to win in her first Grand Slam match since Flushing Meadows. ""Both me and Sloane put everything out there and it was a very good match,"" said Raducanu, who wrapped up victory shortly before midnight and thanked an excited crowd for staying. ""We had some great rallies and I'm happy to come through against such a great champion."" Raducanu 'loving Australian Open energy' Murray wins five-set thriller on Melbourne return Watson & Evans advance but Dart & Broady beaten A zoo, a boo or Ronaldo's 'siuuu' - the incredible atmosphere of 'the people's court' Kvitova out after 'painful' first-round loss Intrigue has surrounded Raducanu going into the 2022 season as everyone wonders how she will follow her stunning ascent to the US Open title. Eyebrows were raised when her opening match of the year ended in a 6-0 6-1 defeat by Kazakhstan's Elena Rybakina in Sydney. Wins have been hard to come by since her stunning victory in New York, but she showed again in Melbourne how much she thrives on the big stage. With her pre-season preparation limited by contracting Covid-19, Raducanu lost to Rybakina in 55 minutes. Against 68th-ranked Stephens, it looked like Raducanu might be wrapped up even earlier a week on - this time for wildly different reasons. Stephens, who won the 2017 US Open, had not played for two months and only arrived in Australia recently after getting married on New Year's Day in the US. Her lack of on-court time showed as she won only four points in an error-strewn opening set. The second set completely switched. Raducanu was the one who started to make mistakes - racking up 19 unforced errors compared to only two in the first - and 28-year-old Stephens took advantage to level. Raducanu, who had never played a deciding set in a Grand Slam main-draw match, broke serve twice to race 5-0 in front in the final set. Three match points quickly arrived in the seventh game and, after a brief delay caused by an intruding moth on the baseline, Raducanu took the final match point when Stephens flicked into the net. ""It was a tough match-up for a first round,"" said Raducanu. ""I knew there would some long rallies because her athleticism is right up there. I had to work extremely hard for those points. ""Coming out for the first set, I played very good tennis, but of course there was always going to be some adversity. I'm happy to have regrouped in the third set. ""I don't think the scoreline reflected what happened in the third set."" Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Melbourne Park The Emma Raducanu of the first set looked every inch the player who had steamed through the US Open draw without dropping a set. The 19-year-old, bursting with confidence, allowed Sloane Stephens only four points. She was decisive, aggressive and utterly dominant. Back came Stephens, though, to leave Raducanu in unchartered territory - a first deciding set in a Grand Slam match. That final set was closer than the scoreline suggests, but Raducanu took all her chances and then showed great delight at the moment of victory.

"Microsoft says it plans to buy major games company Activision Blizzard in a deal worth $68.7bn (Â£50.57bn).

"The volcano erupted for several days. This photo was taken a day before the eruption that caused the tsunami Experts are trying to assess the impact of volcanic ash and toxic sulphuric gases in the air after a volcano erupted in Tonga on Saturday. The eruption showered the Pacific islands with ash and triggered a tsunami. People have been advised to stay away from low-lying areas and beaches. Now, the priority is to find safe shelter and clean water, and to escape the volcanic smog. The plumes of gas and debris from the volcano reached 20km (12 miles) into the sky - but the main health concerns are from ash in the air which people are breathing. A New Zealand government minister said there were ""high levels of sulphur in the air at the moment and also in the water"". They added that this was a risk to drinking water and fishing, which is vital to the Tongan people, and could lead to a rise in water temperatures. The Red Cross says polluted drinking water, caused by volcanic ash and salt water from the tsunami, could affect tens of thousands of people and increase the risk of diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea. Ash, gases and particles emitted from volcanoes can be a public health risk. They cause problems with breathing and can affect the heart and blood vessels - the cardiovascular system - too. They can also irritate the lungs, eyes and skin. Carol Stewart, associate professor of the College of Health, Massey University, said: ""Ashfall on the ground is not hazardous to breathing, but fine ash in the air can be inhaled. ""Very fine particles can travel deep into the lungs where, in the short-term, they can cause asthma symptoms to flare up. Slightly larger particles irritate the nose and throat, and cause coughs and sore throats."" Fresh ash particles typically have an acidic surface coating, and if they get in the eyes they can sting and cause scratching damage, and can irritate skin. This video can not be played Watch: Satellite images capture the eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Locals have been advised to drink bottled water and wear masks if they do go outdoors, to avoid breathing in the ash. Communication lines with the affected islands are down, and getting aid to where it is most needed is not yet possible. Other countries are trying to fly in clean drinking water and other supplies, but so far have been unable to land. While some of the islands are unscathed, surveillance flights and satellite images reveal mass destruction on others - on one, an entire village is gone. There are fears that communities may not have access to safe and clean drinking water as a result of salt-water inundation caused by the tsunami waves, and ashfall from the volcanic eruption. The Red Cross charity has some relief workers on the ground, but has not been able to make contact with them for days. Phone and internet communications are extremely limited, meaning the situation in some areas remains unknown. Satellite phones are not working because of the ash cloud, and Tonga's main undersea communications cable is broken. A spokesman for the Red Cross explained: ""The last time we spoke to colleagues was on Saturday. That is a concern. They are trained to provide help and support and will be doing that, but we don't know the extent of need for the 100,000 residents who live in Tonga."" The teams will be supporting evacuations, providing first aid and distributing relief supplies which are already on the islands. ""We have enough to support 1,200 families in Tonga, but there could be many more who need them,"" he said. The kits contain essential items such as tarpaulins, blankets, kitchen sets, sanitary products and water purification tablets. Clearing up the debris and repairing all of the damage is a priority, but will take time - and the people doing it will need protecting. Tonga's deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tu'ihalangingie, speaking to the BBC from Canberra, said: ""There will be health concerns as people are breathing it [ash], especially with a huge clean-up mission that is happening in Tonga now. ""[We have} about 200 volunteers, people coming to sweep the runway for the airport. We have to do it, but we know that there will be a long-term problem because people are breathing this ash, which is very dangerous."" While aid is urgently needed, Tonga is concerned about the risk of deliveries spreading Covid to the islands, which have avoided the pandemic virus so far. The clean-up operation will include ships from Australia and New Zealand to help with pumping out water. Stagnant pools could be a breeding ground for diseases such as cholera. Most of the people in Tonga are involved in agriculture and farming, meaning the longer-term devastation to lives and livelihoods will be huge. Are you, or a family member, in Tonga?

"Indoor events such as concerts and nightclubs will be able to open again from next Monday Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions are to be eased, with nightclubs reopening, large indoor events resuming and social distancing rules dropped. The changes will take effect from Monday 24 January after a ""significant fall"" in new case numbers. However, people are still being asked to work from home and to take lateral flow tests before meeting with others. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that Scotland had ""turned the corner on the Omicron wave"". Guidance advising adults against meeting up with more than three households at a time will also be scrapped, along with curbs on indoor contact sports. And ministers have decided against extending the vaccine passport scheme to more hospitality settings ""at this stage"". What are the Covid rules in Scotland? What happens when Covid becomes endemic? How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Ms Sturgeon said that while Omicron is still infecting ""large numbers of people"", there had been a significant fall in the number of new infections over the past two weeks. A total of 20,268 positive cases have been reported over the past three days, compared to 36,526 over the same three days last week. The percentage of tests coming back positive has dropped from almost 30% in early January to under 20% now. It is now thought that the Omicron wave peaked in the first week of January, and the number of people being admitted to hospital with the virus is also falling. Hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants will no longer need to operate on a table service only basis Restrictions introduced over the festive period are being phased out, with limits on crowds at outdoor events such as football matches having beenlifted on Monday of this week. From next Monday, the limits on attendance at indoor public events, the requirement for 1m physical distancing and table service in hospitality venues, and the requirement for nightclubs to close will also be removed. However longer-running measures such as the use of face coverings on public transport and indoor public places will continue, while Ms Sturgeon said people were advised to continue to keep gatherings ""small"" to reduce the risk of infection. People should also continue to work from home wherever possible for now, but Ms Sturgeon said talks would be held with businesses about ""a return to a more hybrid approach from the start of February"". The first minister said that Scotland was ""once again entering a calmer phase of the pandemic"", but warned there was still ""significant pressure"" on health services. She said: ""Although we can be increasingly optimistic at this stage, we must all still play our part in helping further slow the spread of the virus."" Whisper it but this really should be the beginning of the end of lockdown-style Covid restrictions in Scotland. As the current Omicron measures are eased, the Scottish government certainly has no intention of bringing any of them back. In fact, they are working on a new strategy for living with Covid without major restrictions in future. That does not mean pretending coronavirus has gone away or abandoning all attempts to limit its spread. For instance, the first minister has already said that some continued mask wearing in public is likely. But the hope is that the continued use of vaccination and the exercise of personal responsibility can take more of the strain in future. Opposition parties are anxious for more details of this revised approach which, of course, depends on Covid not mutating into a more dangerous strain. The changes were broadly welcomed by business groups, with CBI Scotland saying the easing of rules for hospitality was ""a huge relief to firms desperate to start trading their way to recovery after a difficult festive period"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce echoed this, and welcomed the decision not to extend vaccine passports to more venues -  while calling on ministers to ""remove the shackles from offices as urgently as possible"". And the Federation of Small Businesses said withdrawing restrictions ""doesn't mean that local economies will necessarily bounce back"", calling for the government to ""work hard to build business and consumer confidence"". The Scottish Conservatives also welcomed the easing of Covid measures, with health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane saying there had been a ""sea change"" in government policy ""towards trusting the Scottish public"". However the party called for the vaccine passport scheme to be scrapped altogether, and for a ""credible plan"" to tackle waiting times in the NHS. Ms Sturgeon said the decision on vaccine passports was ""finely balanced"", but that if case numbers were to rise again then extending the scheme to all licensed hospitality venues ""may well be a more proportionate alternative to other, more restrictive measures"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the changes would ""offer hope to a lot of people who can once again look forward to getting some more normality back in their lives"". However he said businesses were ""teetering on the brink"", and called on the government to go further in getting promised financial support to firms. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Erinn Patenall, Huda Albaqali and Isabel attended a vigil for murdered teacher Ashling Murphy ""It could have very much been me."" Huda Albaqali is 22 and lives and commutes alone. The international student was at Belfast City Hall on Friday to rememberprimary school teacher Ashling Murphy. The 23-year-old was attacked on the banks of the Grand Canal outside Tullamore, County Offaly, on Wednesday afternoon. Vigils have been held across the island of Ireland in her memory. The mood was sombre and near-silent at the City Hall gates, as mourners laid flowers and lit candles. Ashling ""could very much have been me"", Huda told BBC News NI. Huda Albaqali wanted to show women were ""in it together"" ""I do pretty much everything by myself. I don't have the safety choice of having people constantly around me,"" she said. ""All I can do is just stand here with other women and show that we're all in here. It is something to show that we all care."" Huda's friend Emma Murphy, also 22, said the killing evoked traumatic feelings that this could happen to anyone. ""It feels that showing our grief, our solidarity, is the most that we can doâ¦ because it feels like there are no other avenues to change it,"" Emma said. As with theabduction and murder of Sarah Everardlast year, Ashling's death has touched on the neuralgic issue of women's safety, which resonates across borders. Some reports suggest Ashling was out jogging when she was attacked at about 16:00 local time on Wednesday.

"Average pay rises are failing to keep up with the rise in the cost of living, the latest official statistics show. While wages rose in the year to November, they did not rise as fast as prices over the same period. This meant that average weekly earnings - adjusted for price rises - fell for the first time since July 2020. ""Salaries are growing reasonably strongly, but some people are saying they are not feeling much better due to rising prices,"" the ONS told the BBC. Regular pay, excluding bonuses and adjusted for inflation, fell 1% in November compared to the same month in the previous year. Â£150,000 starting salaries as firms fight for staff UK economy above pre-Covid levels in November Why is the cost of living going up? In November, the inflation rate rose to 5.1% and is expected to reach at least 6% in spring, according to the Bank of England. How have you adapted to rising prices? Are you shopping or living your life differently as a result?  Share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy The Resolution Foundation think tank said: ""Real wages officially began to fall in November, and the current period of shrinking pay packets is likely to get worse before it starts to ease in the second half of 2022."" Eleanor Deeley, joint managing director at Midlands-based construction firm Deeley Group, said: ""Rising labour costs are an issue for us, and the construction industry as a whole, where labour can be 50% of a project cost. ""In an industry where margins are already slim, we're seeing bricklayers suddenly demanding 20% [pay] increases."" Salaries, however, are still above pre-pandemic levels. Average weekly pay, excluding bonuses, rose to Â£550 in November compared with Â£510 in March 2020. Over the longer three-month period, between September and November, wages rose at an annual rate of 3.8%, the ONS said. That was slower than the 4.3% recorded in the three-month period between August and October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that wage growth was ""relatively healthy by historical standards but of course we are seeing challenges with inflation"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said UK wage growth was ""relatively healthy"" But he said: ""It is important to remember that we are not alone in that. There's a global phenomenon because the causes of inflation - whether it is supply chains or energy prices - are of course global in nature. But we are taking action to support people as best we can."" Today's figures showed that pay increases failed to match the accelerating cost of living for the first time in over a year in November. However, with the jobs market heating up, economists say that may be short-lived. The latest numbers suggest that not only have the vast majority of livelihoods survived the end of the furlough scheme, but -  with vacancies at a record high of 1.24 million - many employers are grappling with a shortage of skilled workers. That's been heightened by the departure of more than 400,000 people from the labour market since the pandemic started - typically those who have become students, taken early retirement or are long-term sick. Those factors are likely to give workers the upper hand when it comes to seeking - and getting - bigger pay rises this year. Overall, the Office for National Statistics said that the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% - close to pre-pandemic levels. But Shane O'Neill, from Validus Risk Management, said: ""This number, though positive, will be taken with a pinch of salt - it predates boththe Bank of England rate hikeand the onset of Omicron, which caused significant economic scarring."" Meanwhile, companies added 184,000 people to their payrolls between November and December, taking the total to 29.5 million. UK job vacancies soared to a record high of 1.24 million between October and December, the ONS data showed, with vacancies 462,000 higher compared with the three months before the pandemic. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said the total number of people on payrolls was ""now well above pre-pandemic levels"". He added: ""New survey figures show that in the three months to November, the unemployment rate fell back almost to where it was before Covid-19 hit."" However, he said that while job vacancies had reached a new record, ""they are now growing more slowly than they were last summer"". Also, the percentage of ""economically inactive"" people - which is those neither looking for or available for work - rose to 21.3%. Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell. said this increase ""could well be tied to the return to education for many young people looking to better their prospects and nervous of setting out on their career during such an unpredictable time"". ""Nerves may also be playing a part in the number of over 60s choosing to stay in the workplace, some deciding to take early retirement, others perhaps waiting until the spring and summer to take on additional hours."" With job vacancies rising and the number of economically inactive growing, companies such as the insurer Phoenix Group are tailoring their job adverts to attract older applicants  - by banning words such as ""energetic"" and ""enthusiastic"". Phoenix Group, which is led by Andy Briggs - who is also the government's ""business champion for older workers"", believes using  ""younger-age stereotypical words"" could deter people aged over-50 from applying for a job,according to the Daily Telegraph,external. Gary Palmer is the the local GMB Union organiser in Eastbourne As the cost of living rises, refuse workers across the South East want a pay boost. They argue that HGV drivers, who are in short supply and great demand, are better paid than the lorry drivers who work in rubbish. Refuse truck drivers in Eastbourne went on strike after the local council offered a 7% pay rise which officials described as ""very generous"". But, in what the GMB union is calling a ""massive win"", its members have now accepted an improved offer. This includes a minimum rise this year of 11% and a guarantee the pay rate will reach a minimum of Â£13.50 per hour in April 2023 - a 19% rise in total, the GMB says. Gary Palmer, an HGV driver and local GMB union organiser, says: ""It's not only the cost of living, people are understanding that the poor are going to work and in-work poverty is growing. ""All those points have come together and GMB members here have said: 'No, enough. Pay me what I'm worth and recognise my true value'."" Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Indoor events such as concerts and nightclubs will be able to open again from next Monday Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions are to be eased, with nightclubs reopening, large indoor events resuming and social distancing rules dropped. The changes will take effect from Monday 24 January after a ""significant fall"" in new case numbers. However, people are still being asked to work from home and to take lateral flow tests before meeting with others. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that Scotland had ""turned the corner on the Omicron wave"". Guidance advising adults against meeting up with more than three households at a time will also be scrapped, along with curbs on indoor contact sports. And ministers have decided against extending the vaccine passport scheme to more hospitality settings ""at this stage"". What are the Covid rules in Scotland? What happens when Covid becomes endemic? How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Ms Sturgeon said that while Omicron is still infecting ""large numbers of people"", there had been a significant fall in the number of new infections over the past two weeks. A total of 20,268 positive cases have been reported over the past three days, compared to 36,526 over the same three days last week. The percentage of tests coming back positive has dropped from almost 30% in early January to under 20% now. It is now thought that the Omicron wave peaked in the first week of January, and the number of people being admitted to hospital with the virus is also falling. Hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants will no longer need to operate on a table service only basis Restrictions introduced over the festive period are being phased out, with limits on crowds at outdoor events such as football matches having beenlifted on Monday of this week. From next Monday, the limits on attendance at indoor public events, the requirement for 1m physical distancing and table service in hospitality venues, and the requirement for nightclubs to close will also be removed. However longer-running measures such as the use of face coverings on public transport and indoor public places will continue, while Ms Sturgeon said people were advised to continue to keep gatherings ""small"" to reduce the risk of infection. People should also continue to work from home wherever possible for now, but Ms Sturgeon said talks would be held with businesses about ""a return to a more hybrid approach from the start of February"". The first minister said that Scotland was ""once again entering a calmer phase of the pandemic"", but warned there was still ""significant pressure"" on health services. She said: ""Although we can be increasingly optimistic at this stage, we must all still play our part in helping further slow the spread of the virus."" Whisper it but this really should be the beginning of the end of lockdown-style Covid restrictions in Scotland. As the current Omicron measures are eased, the Scottish government certainly has no intention of bringing any of them back. In fact, they are working on a new strategy for living with Covid without major restrictions in future. That does not mean pretending coronavirus has gone away or abandoning all attempts to limit its spread. For instance, the first minister has already said that some continued mask wearing in public is likely. But the hope is that the continued use of vaccination and the exercise of personal responsibility can take more of the strain in future. Opposition parties are anxious for more details of this revised approach which, of course, depends on Covid not mutating into a more dangerous strain. The changes were broadly welcomed by business groups, with CBI Scotland saying the easing of rules for hospitality was ""a huge relief to firms desperate to start trading their way to recovery after a difficult festive period"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce echoed this, and welcomed the decision not to extend vaccine passports to more venues -  while calling on ministers to ""remove the shackles from offices as urgently as possible"". And the Federation of Small Businesses said withdrawing restrictions ""doesn't mean that local economies will necessarily bounce back"", calling for the government to ""work hard to build business and consumer confidence"". The Scottish Conservatives also welcomed the easing of Covid measures, with health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane saying there had been a ""sea change"" in government policy ""towards trusting the Scottish public"". However the party called for the vaccine passport scheme to be scrapped altogether, and for a ""credible plan"" to tackle waiting times in the NHS. Ms Sturgeon said the decision on vaccine passports was ""finely balanced"", but that if case numbers were to rise again then extending the scheme to all licensed hospitality venues ""may well be a more proportionate alternative to other, more restrictive measures"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the changes would ""offer hope to a lot of people who can once again look forward to getting some more normality back in their lives"". However he said businesses were ""teetering on the brink"", and called on the government to go further in getting promised financial support to firms. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Emma Raducanu became Britain's first female Grand Slam single's champion in 44 years when she won the US Open in September Australian Open 2022 Dates:17-30 JanuaryVenue:Melbourne Park Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries online; TV highlights from middle Saturday. Britain's Emma Raducanu showed quality and resilience to beat American Sloane Stephens in three sets for a spot in the Australian Open second round. On her senior debut in Melbourne, the US Open champion won 6-0 2-6 6-1 against Stephens, another previous winner in New York. Raducanu, seeded 17th, was sharp as she wrapped up the first set in 17 minutes before errors crept into her game. Stephens took advantage to level but Raducanu reasserted control to win. The 19-year-old will face Montenegro's Danka Kovinic in the second round on Thursday. Raducanu cupped her head and dropped the racquet in what is becoming a trademark celebration, illustrating how much it meant to win in her first Grand Slam match since Flushing Meadows. ""Both me and Sloane put everything out there and it was a very good match,"" said Raducanu, who wrapped up victory shortly before midnight and thanked an excited crowd for staying. ""We had some great rallies and I'm happy to come through against such a great champion."" Raducanu 'loving Australian Open energy' Murray wins five-set thriller on Melbourne return Watson & Evans advance but Dart & Broady beaten A zoo, a boo or Ronaldo's 'siuuu' - the incredible atmosphere of 'the people's court' Kvitova out after 'painful' first-round loss Intrigue has surrounded Raducanu going into the 2022 season as everyone wonders how she will follow her stunning ascent to the US Open title. Eyebrows were raised when her opening match of the year ended in a 6-0 6-1 defeat by Kazakhstan's Elena Rybakina in Sydney. Wins have been hard to come by since her stunning victory in New York, but she showed again in Melbourne how much she thrives on the big stage. With her pre-season preparation limited by contracting Covid-19, Raducanu lost to Rybakina in 55 minutes. Against 68th-ranked Stephens, it looked like Raducanu might be wrapped up even earlier a week on - this time for wildly different reasons. Stephens, who won the 2017 US Open, had not played for two months and only arrived in Australia recently after getting married on New Year's Day in the US. Her lack of on-court time showed as she won only four points in an error-strewn opening set. The second set completely switched. Raducanu was the one who started to make mistakes - racking up 19 unforced errors compared to only two in the first - and 28-year-old Stephens took advantage to level. Raducanu, who had never played a deciding set in a Grand Slam main-draw match, broke serve twice to race 5-0 in front in the final set. Three match points quickly arrived in the seventh game and, after a brief delay caused by an intruding moth on the baseline, Raducanu took the final match point when Stephens flicked into the net. ""It was a tough match-up for a first round,"" said Raducanu. ""I knew there would some long rallies because her athleticism is right up there. I had to work extremely hard for those points. ""Coming out for the first set, I played very good tennis, but of course there was always going to be some adversity. I'm happy to have regrouped in the third set. ""I don't think the scoreline reflected what happened in the third set."" Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Melbourne Park The Emma Raducanu of the first set looked every inch the player who had steamed through the US Open draw without dropping a set. The 19-year-old, bursting with confidence, allowed Sloane Stephens only four points. She was decisive, aggressive and utterly dominant. Back came Stephens, though, to leave Raducanu in unchartered territory - a first deciding set in a Grand Slam match. That final set was closer than the scoreline suggests, but Raducanu took all her chances and then showed great delight at the moment of victory. Grand Slam wins should always be a big deal when you are a teenager, and given the thrashing she received by Elena Rybakina in Sydney last week, this was a win full of character by the US Open champion.

"The 10 biggest US airlines have warned that the impending switch-on of 5G mobile phone services will cause ""major disruption"" to flights. They said the start of Verizon and AT&T 5G mobile phone services, planned for Wednesday, would cause a ""completely avoidable economic calamity"". Airlines fear C-band 5G signals will disrupt planes' navigation systems, particularly those used in bad weather. The warning was issued in a letter sent to US aviation authorities. The chief executives of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were joined by others in saying: ""Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies"", including vaccine distribution. The BBC has seen the letter outlining their urgent concerns. It was sent to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, as well as the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the chair of the Federal Communications Commission and the director of the National Economic Council.

""We further ask that the FAA immediately identify those base stations closest to key airport runways that need to be addressed to ensure safety and avoid disruption,"" they added. These concerns were recently highlighted by the two big planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, in a rare joint warning. The group of airlines said: ""Airplane manufacturers have informed us that there are huge swathes of the operating fleet that may need to be indefinitely grounded. ""In addition to the chaos caused domestically, this lack of usable wide-body aircraft could potentially strand tens of thousands of Americans overseas."" In an update on Sunday, the FAA, which oversees aviation safety across the US, said it had cleared ""an estimated 45% of the US commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at many of the airports where 5G C-band will be deployed"". The FAA added that it had approved ""two radio altimeter models that are installed in a wide variety of Boeing and Airbus planes"".

""The FAA also continues to work with manufacturers to understand how radar altimeter data is used in other flight control systems.

"This video can not be played Watch: TV licence freeze ""will affect our frontline output"" BBC services and shows will have to be cut as a result of a funding gap arising from the latest licence fee deal, its director general has said. Tim Davie said the settlement, which will see the cost of a TV licence frozen for the next two years, ""will affect our frontline output"". Asked what might be cut, he said ""everything's on the agenda"". On Monday, the culture secretary said the freeze would help people who are struggling with rising household costs. Nadine Dorries told the House of Commons: ""The BBC must support people at a time when their finances are strained, make savings and efficiencies, and use the billions in public funding it receives to deliver for viewers, listeners and users."" A TV licence currently costs Â£159, with the BBC receiving Â£3.7bn a year to fund services like TV, radio, the BBC website, podcasts, iPlayer and apps. This video can not be played Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries: ""This government is committed to supporting families as much as possible"" Ms Dorries said that, after the two-year freeze, the fee will rise in line with inflation until 2027, when the broadcaster's current royal charter expires. She suggested ina tweet on Sunday,externalthat the licence fee will be abolished after that, although in the Commons on Monday, she said the future funding of the corporation was up for discussion and a review on its future would start shortly. The BBC wanted the charge to rise with inflation for the remainder of the charter. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, Mr Davie said the resulting funding gap would be Â£285m in the final year. There are also expected to be shortfalls in the years before that. ""Inevitably, if you don't have Â£285m, you will get less services and less programmes. Now, I still think the BBC can offer extraordinary value for Â£13 a month,"" he said. What is the BBC licence fee for and why is it under threat? He said the corporation, which turns 100 this year, has made ""very good progress in terms of cutting costs that don't affect the licence fee payers"" in recent years. ""We go first to those cuts where we don't affect our output... We are not at the place where you can never make cuts, but this will affect our frontline output. There's no doubt about that."" The BBC has said the corporation's income for UK services is already 30% lower in real terms than it was 10 years ago. Last year, BBC chairman Richard Sharp warned about ""super inflation"" in production because of competition from global giants, saying: ""The cost of some of our biggest series has more than doubled."" On Tuesday, Mr Davie acknowledged that ""we need to reshape ourselves for a digital age"". ""The media market is moving extremely rapidly,"" he said. ""I'm excited about re-engineering the BBC. I think we're in a good place. We had an excellent Christmas, iPlayer is doing brilliant business for us in terms of the numbers we're getting through to our digital services. ""So we're not just going to put aspic around linear services or say we're going to keep doing exactly the same thing. We need to reshape the business."" New culture secretary says BBC needs real change Lineker still BBC's top earner despite pay cut BBC 'not here to beat Netflix', boss says Mr Davie said the BBC would change radically if it became a subscription service, which is one of the suggestions to replace the licence fee system. ""Once you're trying to serve a subscription base and a commercial agenda - and, believe me, I've run commercial businesses - it is a completely different situation, because suddenly you are doing things that are there to make profit and make a return to a specific audience,"" he said. Ms Dorries said the UK needs ""a BBC that can thrive alongside Netflix and Amazon Prime and all of its other challenges which attract younger viewers"". Following the announcement of the freeze, the culture secretary said attention would turn to the BBC's long-term funding model. Former Daily Telegraph editorCharles Moore wrote,externalthat the culture secretary ""is choosing this moment because of the BBC's coverage of the revelations about Downing Street parties during Covid"". But he added: ""The problem is that the BBC has made it easy for her."" The corporation has not lived up to its obligation to be impartial, he said, and was ""not far off being a Fox News of the Left"". The Guardian said,externalthe Conservative government was using the corporation ""as a punchbag"" and that major changes ""cannot be decided by ministerial whim"". The paper suggested the BBC ""might do very well"" with a Netflix-style subscription model, but ""it would not be the BBC as it exists today"". Writing in the Telegraph,Robin Aitken, author of Can We Trust the BBC?, said,externalthe corporation needs to show ""evidence of genuine reform"" if it is to ""survive and prosper into a second century"". Former Channel 4 News bossDorothy Byrne told BBC Two's Newsnight,externalon Monday: ""By all means, discuss getting rid of the licence fee. ""But for decades, people have looked at what would be a better alternative, and they couldn't come up with one.

"The volcano erupted for several days. This photo was taken a day before the eruption that caused the tsunami Experts are trying to assess the impact of volcanic ash and toxic sulphuric gases in the air after a volcano erupted in Tonga on Saturday. The eruption showered the Pacific islands with ash and triggered a tsunami. People have been advised to stay away from low-lying areas and beaches. Now, the priority is to find safe shelter and clean water, and to escape the volcanic smog. The plumes of gas and debris from the volcano reached 20km (12 miles) into the sky - but the main health concerns are from ash in the air which people are breathing. A New Zealand government minister said there were ""high levels of sulphur in the air at the moment and also in the water"". They added that this was a risk to drinking water and fishing, which is vital to the Tongan people, and could lead to a rise in water temperatures. The Red Cross says polluted drinking water, caused by volcanic ash and salt water from the tsunami, could affect tens of thousands of people and increase the risk of diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea. Ash, gases and particles emitted from volcanoes can be a public health risk. They cause problems with breathing and can affect the heart and blood vessels - the cardiovascular system - too. They can also irritate the lungs, eyes and skin. Carol Stewart, associate professor of the College of Health, Massey University, said: ""Ashfall on the ground is not hazardous to breathing, but fine ash in the air can be inhaled. ""Very fine particles can travel deep into the lungs where, in the short-term, they can cause asthma symptoms to flare up. Slightly larger particles irritate the nose and throat, and cause coughs and sore throats."" Fresh ash particles typically have an acidic surface coating, and if they get in the eyes they can sting and cause scratching damage, and can irritate skin. This video can not be played Watch: Satellite images capture the eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Locals have been advised to drink bottled water and wear masks if they do go outdoors, to avoid breathing in the ash. Communication lines with the affected islands are down, and getting aid to where it is most needed is not yet possible. Other countries are trying to fly in clean drinking water and other supplies, but so far have been unable to land. While some of the islands are unscathed, surveillance flights and satellite images reveal mass destruction on others - on one, an entire village is gone. There are fears that communities may not have access to safe and clean drinking water as a result of salt-water inundation caused by the tsunami waves, and ashfall from the volcanic eruption. The Red Cross charity has some relief workers on the ground, but has not been able to make contact with them for days. Phone and internet communications are extremely limited, meaning the situation in some areas remains unknown. Satellite phones are not working because of the ash cloud, and Tonga's main undersea communications cable is broken. A spokesman for the Red Cross explained: ""The last time we spoke to colleagues was on Saturday. That is a concern. They are trained to provide help and support and will be doing that, but we don't know the extent of need for the 100,000 residents who live in Tonga."" The teams will be supporting evacuations, providing first aid and distributing relief supplies which are already on the islands. ""We have enough to support 1,200 families in Tonga, but there could be many more who need them,"" he said. The kits contain essential items such as tarpaulins, blankets, kitchen sets, sanitary products and water purification tablets. Clearing up the debris and repairing all of the damage is a priority, but will take time - and the people doing it will need protecting. Tonga's deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tu'ihalangingie, speaking to the BBC from Canberra, said: ""There will be health concerns as people are breathing it [ash], especially with a huge clean-up mission that is happening in Tonga now. ""[We have} about 200 volunteers, people coming to sweep the runway for the airport. We have to do it, but we know that there will be a long-term problem because people are breathing this ash, which is very dangerous."" While aid is urgently needed, Tonga is concerned about the risk of deliveries spreading Covid to the islands, which have avoided the pandemic virus so far. The clean-up operation will include ships from Australia and New Zealand to help with pumping out water. Stagnant pools could be a breeding ground for diseases such as cholera. Most of the people in Tonga are involved in agriculture and farming, meaning the longer-term devastation to lives and livelihoods will be huge. Are you, or a family member, in Tonga?

"A photo released by the New Zealand Defence Force showed a part of Tonga blanketed in ash Ash cloaking a runway has hampered relief efforts to Tonga, as the scale of the damage from a volcanic eruption and a tsunami becomes clear. New Zealand is trying to send clean drinking water and other supplies but planes cannot land at the main airport. Some of Tonga's small outlying islands have suffered substantial damage, aid agencies say. Two people have been reported dead, but with communications limited there are fears the true toll could be higher. An underwater volcano erupted on Saturday, showering Tonga with ash and triggering a tsunami. Tonga is made up of more than 170 islands scattered over an area of the South Pacific roughly the size of Japan. Just over 100,000 people live in Tonga, the bulk of them on the main island of Tongatapu. The UN reported extensive damage to property on western beaches of Tongatapu. In the capital NukuÊ»alofa, the New Zealand High Commission said aside from the waterfront, the area is largely undamaged. But there are concerns about the Ha'apai group of islands, which lies north of Tongatapu. VISUAL GUIDE:How volcano's impact spread so widely ANALYSIS:Scientists explain explosion's ferocity VIDEO:Giant eruption captured by satellites VOICES:Daughter fears for parents after Tonga tsunami Surveillance flights showed an entire village destroyed on one island and buildings flattened on another. Tonga's deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tu'ihalangingie, told Reuters the pictures were ""alarming"". ""Possibly there will be more deaths and we just pray that is not the case,"" he said. This video can not be played Pacific volcano: Overseas Tongans unable to contact loved ones On Tuesday New Zealand foreign affairs minister Nanaia Mahuta said that ""water is among the highest priorities for Tonga at this stage"". Aid agencies say it is likely that volcanic dust and the tsunami had contaminated Tonga's water supplies. But the ash, that has turned Tonga's normally lush green landscape into a muddy brown, needs to be cleared before New Zealand's planes can land. A group of Tongans have been sweeping the ash off the runway, 1News reported.,externalIt is likely to take at least until Wednesday before the runway is clear. Your device may not support this visualisation Communications with the island chain have been disrupted after the single underwater cable connecting Tonga to the rest of the world was severed in the eruption. Tongans living abroad have beenanxiously waiting for newsfrom relatives and loved ones back home. It could take up to two weeks to restore phone and internet lines. The World Health Organization said a lone official had been channelling information between UN agencies and the Tongan government using a satellite phone. The eruption was felt as far away as in the US. In Peru, two people drowned in abnormally high waves while beaches near the capital Lima were closed off following an oil spill.

"This video can not be played No individual should die like Ashling, says Bishop Tom Deenihan The family of Ashling Murphy has been robbed of their ""most precious gift"", a priest has said at her funeral. The 23-year-old teacher waskilled on the banks of the Grand Canaloutside Tullamore in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday afternoon. A ""depraved act of violence"" has united the country in grief and support, mourners were also told. Murder investigation officershave arrested a man in his 30s. It is understood the primary school teacher and musician was out exercising when she was attacked. Mourners lined the street outside St Brigid's Church, Mount Bolus, in rural County Offaly for the funeral Mass, which was attended by Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Ms Murphy's sister Amy, centre, and mother Kathleen, at her funeral Parish priest Fr Michael Meade, chief celebrant, told mourners that some symbols from Ashling's life were being presented in the church, including a musical instrument, a book to reflect her teaching career, and a GAA jersey. He told mourners that the family's ""darkness is deep"" and their ""pain raw and fierce"". ""Together we grieve, we pray, we hurt - this is the heavy price we pay for love,"" he said. He added Ms Murphy's family had been robbed ""of a gift that gave only joy and love, fun and laughter to many beyond your family"". Fr Meade called for the community not to be afraid to make ""change for what only is good"" in their lives and paid tribute to Ashling's care for her family, friends and pupils. ""That same love and joy was not kept on a shelf or wrapped up - it was freely given and shared through music, through sport, through her vocation as a teacher,"" he said. ""Today we give thanks for the privilege of sharing in this most wonderful gift of Ashling Murphy.""

""It has questioned our attitudes and, particularly, our attitudes towards women and it has questioned our values and our morality,"" he said. ""Whether those questions will be addressed or passed over remains to be seen but we cannot allow such violence and disregard for both human life and bodily integrity take root in our time and culture."" In pictures: Mourners line the streets for Ashling Murphy 'Only something powerful can come out of this' 'What happened to her could have happened to me' Violence against women had been highlighted by Pope Francis as an ""insult to God"" two weeks before Ms Murphy's murder, the bishop added.

""Ashling was so much more to me than a girlfriend. She was my soul mate. She is my soul mate. She will always be my soul mate,"" he said in his emotional tribute. ""She is the greatest love of my life. I will cherish the last five years we spent together for my entire life and hope that some day, god willing, we can be reunited once more.

"A series of controversial changes to the way protests are policed will shortly become UK law. They are part of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which includes major government proposals on crime and justice in England and Wales. The bill has passed through parliament and will receive royal assent to become law in the next few days. If the police want to restrict a protest, they generally have to show it may result in ""serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community"". They can also impose specific measures on the routes of marches. When it comes to major events,such as the COP26 protests, details around protests are typically agreed with the organisers weeks in advance. Police chiefs will be able to put more conditions on static protests, such as thoseorganised by Extinction Rebellionwhere roads and bridges are occupied. They will be able to: Impose a start and finish time Set noise limits Apply these rules to a demonstration by just one person So if a single individual was holding a placard while sharing their views via a loudspeaker, and refused to follow police directions about how they should conduct their protest, they could be fined up to Â£2,500. It will also become a crime to fail to follow restrictions the protesters ""ought"" to have known about, even if they have not received a direct order from an officer. Previously, police have needed to prove that protesters knew they had been told to move on, before they could be said to have broken the law. The new law also includes an offence of ""intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance"". This is designed to stop people occupying public spaces, hanging off bridges or employing other similar tactics. Another measure clarifies that damage to memorials could lead to up to 10 years in prison. This follows thetoppling of the statue of slave trader Edward Colstonin Bristol. The four people who were accused of illegally removing the statuewere cleared of criminal damage at Bristol Crown Court. Colston's statue was thrown into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest in June 2020 The right to protest and express yourself is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. The police have to show they have taken this into account. But that right is not absolute. Protests can be limited by police if they believe they have good reason to impose restrictions on an event to ensure public safety, or to prevent crime. The Home Office has insisted that the bill respects human rights. But the history of public protest is littered with long and complex legal battles over whether police have used their powers properly. One of the most important cases - about the police's power to contain a crowd for an indefinite period -took 11 years of courtroom argumentsbefore concluding that the tactic was lawful. This video can not be played Several hundred people marched in London chanting ""kill the Bill"" After the bill passed through parliament, theCEO of Amnesty International UK Sacha Deshmukh,externalsaid: ""The Policing Bill is part of a hugely worrying and widespread attack on human rights from across Government which will not only see basic rights reduced across the board, but will also strip people of the means to challenge or contest their treatment."" Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper described the legislation as ""rushed"" and will create ""incredibly widely-drawn"" powers, which will allow the police to ""stop and search anyone in the vicinity of a protest, including passers-by, people on the way to work and peaceful protesters"". Inits reports on the bill,external, Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights said the proposals are ""oppressive and wrong"". It accuses the government of trying to create ""new powers in areas where the police already have access to powers and offences which are perfectly adequate"". The campaign group Rights of Women has also criticised for the billfor failing to introduce long-called-for measures,externalthat it says would reduce violence against women and girls. MPs had previously voted toscrap a proposal by the Lordsto make misogyny a hate crime as part of the legislation. However, the government argues that other parts of the legislation toughen sentencing for serious violent and sexual offences and introduce new police bail rules for suspects under investigation. Higher maximum penalties will be introduced for child cruelty offences Domestic abuse victims will be given more time to report incidents of common assault or battery Mandatory life sentences for anyone convicted of killing an emergency worker whilst committing a crime On terrorism, the bill will create powers to more closely monitor offenders released from prison Community sentences for less serious crime will address underlying problems in offenders' lives Changes to sexual offences law will tackle abusive adults in positions of trust, such as sports coaches and religious figures Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"The killing of Sarah Everard has sparked fresh debate on how to protect women from violence After the killing of Sarah Everard, the issue of violence against women and girls is at the forefront of many minds in Westminster. Figures from across the political spectrum are putting forward proposals of how to tackle the ongoing blight on our society, but one proposal in particular has re-emerged in light of the tragic events. How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching How many attacks on women are there? Women 'should be protected' under hate crime laws The idea is to make misogyny - prejudice against women - a hate crime. But what would that mean in practice? And why hasn't it already been introduced? When a crime is carried out against someone - such as assault, harassment or criminal damage - if it is proven that it was because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity, it is considered a hate crime. There is no specific hate crime offence in England and Wales, but when a crime falls into one of the above categories, judges have enhanced sentencing powers and can increase the punishment as a result. Campaigners say sex and gender should be added to this list, arguing misogyny is one of the ""root causes"" of violence against women. Citizens UK and a coalition of campaigners - including Refuge and Women's Aid - also believe the approach ""would provide critical data on the link between hostility to women and the abuse and harassment women experience"". Labour MP Stella Creasy has long campaigned on the issue, and presented amendments to the government's Domestic Abuse Bill to make it law - with the House of Lords set to discuss the issue this week. She said it would compel police forces to record when a crime was motivated by hatred of someone's sex or gender, saying it would help ""form a pattern and identify the trends and issues about where these are taking place"". Some police forces have already taken this on board, with seven forces in England and Wales independently introducing their own misogyny hate crime policy. Ms Creasy told BBC News there was an ""epidemic"" of violence against women, adding: ""You will have heard over the last four or five days an outpouring of stories from women about the abuse, harassment and violence they face. Most of it doesn't get reported as they don't believe it is going to be taken seriously. ""In the police forces where they are already doing this, not only has it helped with detecting crime, it has also helped with confidence in police and changing the culture in the police about how the deal with violence against women."" This video can not be played ""Law would help women know they will be believed"" Nottinghamshire Police was the first to introduce the policy in 2016, and university researchers pointed to ""shifting attitudes"" as a result. The Misogyny Hate Crime Evaluation report, put together jointly by the University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent University, recommended rolling the policy out nationally to increase publicity and the reporting of incidents. Dr Loretta Trickett said: ""Much of this behaviour on this spectrum is criminal behaviour, there's no doubt about that. People could have gone to the police about it before. ""But because of the culture we have, it's just acceptable to intimidate women on the street, to go up to a woman and touch her backside, or to comment on her body and put her in fear of an assault."" A further roll-out - or legislation to force it - has not yet come to fruition, with some still having concerns about the policy. Speaking in a debate on the issue in 2018, then Equalities Minister Victoria Atkins said Parliament ""must be careful about creating laws that would inadvertently conflict with principles of equality"". She said equality of protection was ""a crucial element of ensuring public support for hate crime legislation"", adding: ""In other words, if we were to have hate crime in relation to gender, we would have to think carefully about whether that would apply to the entire population or just to half of it. ""Women are not a minority, and I would be hesitant to put us forward as one."" Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins has voiced concerns over the proposal John Szepietowski from Audley Chaucer Solicitors told the BBC that some critics also feared it would become ""too broad"" a category. He said any attack on a woman would be at risk of being classed as a hate crime - especially if the motivations of the perpetrator were unclear or if the prosecution were particularly keen to secure a harsher sentence. ""Instead of misogyny being an aggravating factor, it becomes part of the standard charging procedure,"" he added. ""This diminishes the very reason for defining some offences as 'hate crime' and reduces the stigma associated with the offence. Some perpetrators may even see it as a badge of honour."" There is also the question of resources. A former chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Sara Thornton, argued police forces were too ""stretched"" as it was, telling a conference in 2018: ""We just do not have the resources to do everything that is desirable and deserving."" Instead, she said they needed to make a return to ""core policing"", adding: ""I want us to solve more burglaries and bear down on violence before we make more records of incidents that are not crimes."" TheScottish government has passed a hate crime lawwhich extends protection for vulnerable groups, but an amendment that would have included women as a protected group was defeated. The government in Edinburgh has instead set up a working group to look at whether misogynistic abuse should be a separate crime. But what about in Downing Street? Speaking to BBC Breakfast from his party conference, Boris Johnson appeared to not support making misogyny a hate crime. The prime minister said there was ""abundant statute"" to tackle violence against women, and claimed by ""widening the scope of what you ask the police to do, you will just increase the problem"". Instead, he called for police forces to ""focus on the very real crimes"" and ""the very real feeling of injustice and betrayal that many people feel"". This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""There is abundant statute that is not being properly enforced"" Meanwhile, the Law Commission is carrying out a ""wide-ranging review into hate crime to explore how to make current legislation more effective, and if there should be additional protective characteristics"". The Commission - which is an independent body that advises government - has already released its initial conclusions, saying that sex or gender based hostilityshould be added to the existing five characteristics protected in hate crime laws. But it has not yet made its official recommendations and they are not expected to be published until the autumn.

"Magistrates in England and Wales will have greater sentencing powers to enable them to take on more cases, under plans to clear court backlogs. The government plans to let magistrates sentence cases where the maximum sentence is a year, rather than the current maximum of six months. It would allow magistrates to hear cases often held in Crown Court. But criminal lawyers warn the plan may backfire, and defendants would still have the right to go before a jury. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said he hoped the move would reduce the pressure on Crown Courts and lead to quicker justice for victims. The move would allow magistrates - who are volunteers with no legal experience necessary - to sentence more serious cases, such as for fraud, theft and assault. At present, crimes eligible for a jail term of more than six months have to be sent to a Crown Court for sentencing. The Ministry of Justice thinks that by doubling magistrates' sentencing powers to a year, it could stop about 500 cases going to Crown Court - giving judges around 2,000 extra days to handle more serious crimes. The courts system is facing unprecedented delays - and as of June last year there was a record high of more than 60,000 Crown Court trials waiting to be heard. Many serious cases are being pushed back until late 2023 - withalleged victims saying they are struggling to copeas they wait for their cases to be heard. The changes will only apply to so-called either-way offences - cases that can be dealt with either by magistrates or by judges at a Crown Court. A defendant charged with an either-way offence can insist on the case being heard by a jury in a Crown Court if they wish. The prime minister said it would ""help tackle the backlog of cases in the Crown Courts - speeding up justice for victims, punishing those guilty of serious crimes and building back stronger and safer from the pandemic"". He said increasing magistrates' sentencing powers would mean that cases came to court quicker meaning ""greater justice for victims"" and ""more criminals seeing justice quicker"". Mr Raab said the move would help provide additional capacity to drive down the backlog of cases, alongside measures such as the temporary Nightingale courts. Like Nightingale hospitals, these courts are temporary courtrooms -such as in hotels- that have been set up across England and Wales to try to deal with more cases. The announcement comes as the trial of Wales manager Ryan Giggswas delayed until August due to a lack of court space. The former Manchester United player, 48, was due to go on trial at Manchester Crown Court on Monday accused of coercive behaviour and assault against his ex-girlfriend and her sister. However, a hearing was told there was nowhere available in the building. Judge Hilary Manley said: ""Due to the large backlog of court cases, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and the need for social distancing, this is a situation which is a daily reality for the criminal courts."" Mr Giggs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. This change in sentencing powers for the lowest criminal courts was put into law almost 20 years ago but never used at the time. The government is clear it's pulling the lever now because it reckons it will create some breathing space for the Crown Courts. Barristers say it will make little difference and the real solution can only be found in urgently needed cash to reverse years of cuts. They say that while the Crown Court backlogs are at record levels, that's not because there's more crime, but a lack of resources in the system to deliver justice efficiently. Criminal barristers are actively talking about staging some form of strike or work-to-rule if the government does not act swiftly on recommendations last year for asignificant increase in legal aid funding. If that materialises in the coming months the Crown Courts could grind to a halt. Ministers plan to monitor how the extra powers for magistrates are used - but many lawyers predict it will backfire. They say more defendants may appeal against sentences given by magistrates, many of whom have no legal qualifications - or there could be a spike in the prison population, further stretching the government's budget. The Bar Council, representing all barristers in England and Wales, also warned that more defendants may exercise their right to go before a jury - adding to the already enormous pressures in the system. And the chairman of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), Jo Sidhu, said ""fiddling with magistrates' sentencing powers is a betrayal of victims of crime"". Kirsty Brimelow, vice-chair of the CBA, told Radio 4's Today that the increase of sentencing powers for magistrates would cause more defendants to choose to go to the Crown Court as the lower sentence was one of the attractions of staying in the lower court. ""Sadly the stats do show that you are more likely to get imprisonment within the magistrates' court than you are in the Crown Court,"" she said. Ms Brimelow said increasing magistrates' powers could lead to more appeals which would take up magistrates' time. ""The issue of the backlog, which was there before the pandemic, is not really about sentencing powers, that is just rearranging the deck chairs, it is about lack of investment,"" she said. She said there was a ""huge attrition"" of barristers leaving the profession and warned that 96.5% of the CBA's members were willing to take action if there was not a substantial increase in fees into legal aid. Mr Raab said that the one thing that would hold back the court system's recovery from the pandemic would be if the CBA went on strike, which he said he did not think other parts of the justice system or the public would support. Stuart Matthews, partner at criminal defence firm Reeds Solicitors, also warned people to ""be afraid"" - describing magistrates as largely ""untrained volunteers, many of whom do not understand even the most basic of legal principles"". This video can not be played WATCH: Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession Labour's shadow courts and sentencing minister Alex Cunningham also criticised the move, calling it ""another sticking plaster"" solution. ""Ministers must give assurances that greater powers for magistrates won't inflict even more burden on Crown Courts - with increased numbers of appeals overloading a diminishing number of criminal advocates left in the system."" Magistrates are volunteers who hear cases in criminal and family courts, aided by a legal adviser To become a magistrate you do not need qualifications but must be aged between 18 and 65 and of good character - among other qualities Around 21 hours of training is required to become a magistrate and you must be able to sit in court for at least 13 days a year They are unpaid but some employers allow their employees time off paid and you can claim an allowance if you miss out on pay Source:UK Government,external But magistrates say they are delighted. The Magistrates' Association - which had campaigned for sentencing powers to be extended - said magistrates would take up the new responsibility with pride and professionalism, and would ""strive to deliver the highest quality of justice"". The changes are expected to be brought in in the coming months. The government said training would be provided by the Judicial College to make sure the powers are used ""consistently and appropriately"" - and the government will have powers to reverse the change if needed. Last year, the spending watchdog the National Audit Officesaid the Crown Court backlogcould remain a problem for years - and there could still be significant delays in 2024. And in October, Mr Raabtold the BBC he did not knowwhen the backlog would drop below pre-pandemic levels.

"This video can not be played No individual should die like Ashling, says Bishop Tom Deenihan The family of Ashling Murphy has been robbed of their ""most precious gift"", a priest has said at her funeral. The 23-year-old teacher waskilled on the banks of the Grand Canaloutside Tullamore in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday afternoon. A ""depraved act of violence"" has united the country in grief and support, mourners were also told. Murder investigation officershave arrested a man in his 30s. It is understood the primary school teacher and musician was out exercising when she was attacked. Mourners lined the street outside St Brigid's Church, Mount Bolus, in rural County Offaly for the funeral Mass, which was attended by Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Ms Murphy's sister Amy, centre, and mother Kathleen, at her funeral Parish priest Fr Michael Meade, chief celebrant, told mourners that some symbols from Ashling's life were being presented in the church, including a musical instrument, a book to reflect her teaching career, and a GAA jersey. He told mourners that the family's ""darkness is deep"" and their ""pain raw and fierce"". ""Together we grieve, we pray, we hurt - this is the heavy price we pay for love,"" he said. He added Ms Murphy's family had been robbed ""of a gift that gave only joy and love, fun and laughter to many beyond your family"". Fr Meade called for the community not to be afraid to make ""change for what only is good"" in their lives and paid tribute to Ashling's care for her family, friends and pupils. ""That same love and joy was not kept on a shelf or wrapped up - it was freely given and shared through music, through sport, through her vocation as a teacher,"" he said. ""Today we give thanks for the privilege of sharing in this most wonderful gift of Ashling Murphy."" This video can not be played The killing of Ashling Murphy had united the country in grief, says Bishop Tom Deenihan of Meath Bishop of Meath Tom Deenihan said the crime had also questions of ""ourselves and of society"". ""It has questioned our attitudes and, particularly, our attitudes towards women and it has questioned our values and our morality,"" he said. ""Whether those questions will be addressed or passed over remains to be seen but we cannot allow such violence and disregard for both human life and bodily integrity take root in our time and culture."" In pictures: Mourners line the streets for Ashling Murphy 'Only something powerful can come out of this' 'What happened to her could have happened to me' Violence against women had been highlighted by Pope Francis as an ""insult to God"" two weeks before Ms Murphy's murder, the bishop added. The hearse carrying Ms Murphy's coffin moves past mourners Ms Murphy's 23-year-old boyfriend, Ryan Casey, spoke publicly for the first time since her death. ""Ashling was so much more to me than a girlfriend. She was my soul mate. She is my soul mate. She will always be my soul mate,"" he said in his emotional tribute. ""She is the greatest love of my life. I will cherish the last five years we spent together for my entire life and hope that some day, god willing, we can be reunited once more. ""Goodbye for now and love forever darling."" Ashling's cousin Rachel O'Shea read a prayer asking ""that the many vigils that took place in memory of Ashling, mark the beginning of an end to violence against women"". A talented musician, Ms Murphy was a former pupil of Sacred Heart School in Tullamore and she taught in the nearby Durrow National School. By Jessica Black, BBC News NI reporter Musicians performed at Ms Murphy's funeral The media came early and trained their cameras on the church, then the Irish traditional musicians, the families and neighbours, and young women of Ashling's age. The farmer opened his fields to mourners in cars and buses, and gardaÃ­ (Irish police) marshalled them in. His fields have held the overflow from funerals before, but never for a funeral like this. There are hundreds here at the junction at St Brigid's. There are Ashling's pupils, in school uniform, small and serious. Young GAA players form a guard of honour for Ms Murphy There are pupils from her old school in maroon cardigans, and there is her GAA club in yellow, green and blue. And the media, behind a cordon, looking on. Ms Murphy's killing has sparked calls for more to be done to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence towards women. Ireland's National Women's Council has said this must be a ""watershed moment in ending men's violence against women"".

"Supermarket Morrisons has confirmed it has cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid. It follows similar moves from big retailers includingIkea,Next and Ocadoas staff absences rise. Unjabbed Morrisons workers who are told to isolate but test negative now get statutory sick pay of Â£96.35 a week. Covid-positive staff get full sick pay regardless of vaccination status. The firm pays staff at least Â£10 per hour. Its chief executive Dave Potts first mentioned the policy in a conference call with investors in September,the Guardian reported,external, as part of a plan to tackle the ""biblical costs"" of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. The move was intended to encourage workers to get jabbed, the newspaper said. Under Morrisons' policy, if NHS Test and Trace informs an unvaccinated worker that they have been exposed to Covid-19, they will only get statutory sick pay - the legal minimum - when they isolate. In England,unvaccinated people must isolate for 10 days if they are a close contact of someone with Covid, even if they do not test positive themselves. Ocado and Next cut sick pay for unvaccinated staff Ikea cuts sick pay for some unvaccinated staff How can I get my booster jab? However, any Morrisons employee who tests positive is paid full sick pay while they isolate, regardless of vaccination status. Morrisons said its policy only applies to workers who are unvaccinated by choice, and each individual is treated on a case-by-case basis. Workers who cannot receive Covid vaccines for medical reasons are not obliged to isolate in England. The requirement for fully-vaccinated workers to isolate when exposed to Covid was dropped in England in August. This resulted in unvaccinated workers being more likely to take time off than their vaccinated colleagues, even when not infected with coronavirus. Companies now appear to be tightening their sick pay rules as they face mass absences due to the more infectious Omicron variant. In the last few weeks it has emerged that Ikea, Next and Ocado have changed their policy on unvaccinated staff who have been exposed to coronavirus. Collectively they employ nearly 60,000 workers. Sick pay cuts will also be implemented at Wessex Water and in the US, several major companies have started penalising unjabbed workers. However, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Asda pay unvaccinated workers full company sick pay when they are isolating. Statutory sick pay (SSP) is the minimum amount employers must pay, but some employers offer more than SSP - this is normally known as company or contractual sick pay. Beth Hale, partner at employment law firm C M Murray, said claims of direct discrimination due to this kind of sick pay policy were unlikely to succeed as being opposed to vaccination was ""unlikely to be a protected belief for the purposes of the Equality Act."" ""While the policy may have a disproportionate impact on those from certain ethnic or religious groups (which could give rise to a claim for indirect discrimination), an employer may well be able to justify the policy on the basis of their legitimate business needs,"" she added. She said where employers are struggling with significant staff absences because of the large case numbers, it ""seemed reasonable"" that they may want to take steps to encourage vaccination amongst their workforce in this way. But she added that employers need to be ""careful that policies are communicated carefully and sensitively"" to avoid employee relations issues.

"Average pay rises are failing to keep up with the rise in the cost of living, the latest official statistics show. While wages rose in the year to November, they did not rise as fast as prices over the same period. This meant that average weekly earnings - adjusted for price rises - fell for the first time since July 2020. ""Salaries are growing reasonably strongly, but some people are saying they are not feeling much better due to rising prices,"" the ONS told the BBC. Regular pay, excluding bonuses and adjusted for inflation, fell 1% in November compared to the same month in the previous year. Â£150,000 starting salaries as firms fight for staff UK economy above pre-Covid levels in November Why is the cost of living going up? In November, the inflation rate rose to 5.1% and is expected to reach at least 6% in spring, according to the Bank of England. How have you adapted to rising prices?

Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy The Resolution Foundation think tank said: ""Real wages officially began to fall in November, and the current period of shrinking pay packets is likely to get worse before it starts to ease in the second half of 2022."" Eleanor Deeley, joint managing director at Midlands-based construction firm Deeley Group, said: ""Rising labour costs are an issue for us, and the construction industry as a whole, where labour can be 50% of a project cost. ""In an industry where margins are already slim, we're seeing bricklayers suddenly demanding 20% [pay] increases."" Salaries, however, are still above pre-pandemic levels. Average weekly pay, excluding bonuses, rose to Â£550 in November compared with Â£510 in March 2020. Over the longer three-month period, between September and November, wages rose at an annual rate of 3.8%, the ONS said. That was slower than the 4.3% recorded in the three-month period between August and October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that wage growth was ""relatively healthy by historical standards but of course we are seeing challenges with inflation"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said UK wage growth was ""relatively healthy"" But he said: ""It is important to remember that we are not alone in that. There's a global phenomenon because the causes of inflation - whether it is supply chains or energy prices - are of course global in nature. But we are taking action to support people as best we can."" Today's figures showed that pay increases failed to match the accelerating cost of living for the first time in over a year in November. However, with the jobs market heating up, economists say that may be short-lived. The latest numbers suggest that not only have the vast majority of livelihoods survived the end of the furlough scheme, but -  with vacancies at a record high of 1.24 million - many employers are grappling with a shortage of skilled workers. That's been heightened by the departure of more than 400,000 people from the labour market since the pandemic started - typically those who have become students, taken early retirement or are long-term sick. Those factors are likely to give workers the upper hand when it comes to seeking - and getting - bigger pay rises this year. Overall, the Office for National Statistics said that the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% - close to pre-pandemic levels. But Shane O'Neill, from Validus Risk Management, said: ""This number, though positive, will be taken with a pinch of salt - it predates boththe Bank of England rate hikeand the onset of Omicron, which caused significant economic scarring."" Meanwhile, companies added 184,000 people to their payrolls between November and December, taking the total to 29.5 million. UK job vacancies soared to a record high of 1.24 million between October and December, the ONS data showed, with vacancies 462,000 higher compared with the three months before the pandemic. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said the total number of people on payrolls was ""now well above pre-pandemic levels"". He added: ""New survey figures show that in the three months to November, the unemployment rate fell back almost to where it was before Covid-19 hit."" However, he said that while job vacancies had reached a new record, ""they are now growing more slowly than they were last summer"". Also, the percentage of ""economically inactive"" people - which is those neither looking for or available for work - rose to 21.3%. Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell. said this increase ""could well be tied to the return to education for many young people looking to better their prospects and nervous of setting out on their career during such an unpredictable time"". ""Nerves may also be playing a part in the number of over 60s choosing to stay in the workplace, some deciding to take early retirement, others perhaps waiting until the spring and summer to take on additional hours."" With job vacancies rising and the number of economically inactive growing, companies such as the insurer Phoenix Group are tailoring their job adverts to attract older applicants  - by banning words such as ""energetic"" and ""enthusiastic"". Phoenix Group, which is led by Andy Briggs - who is also the government's ""business champion for older workers"", believes using  ""younger-age stereotypical words"" could deter people aged over-50 from applying for a job,according to the Daily Telegraph,external. Gary Palmer is the the local GMB Union organiser in Eastbourne As the cost of living rises, refuse workers across the South East want a pay boost. They argue that HGV drivers, who are in short supply and great demand, are better paid than the lorry drivers who work in rubbish. Refuse truck drivers in Eastbourne went on strike after the local council offered a 7% pay rise which officials described as ""very generous"". But, in what the GMB union is calling a ""massive win"", its members have now accepted an improved offer. This includes a minimum rise this year of 11% and a guarantee the pay rate will reach a minimum of Â£13.50 per hour in April 2023 - a 19% rise in total, the GMB says. Gary Palmer, an HGV driver and local GMB union organiser, says: ""It's not only the cost of living, people are understanding that the poor are going to work and in-work poverty is growing.

"Magistrates in England and Wales will have greater sentencing powers to enable them to take on more cases, under plans to clear court backlogs. The government plans to let magistrates sentence cases where the maximum sentence is a year, rather than the current maximum of six months. It would allow magistrates to hear cases often held in Crown Court. But criminal lawyers warn the plan may backfire, and defendants would still have the right to go before a jury. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said he hoped the move would reduce the pressure on Crown Courts and lead to quicker justice for victims. The move would allow magistrates - who are volunteers with no legal experience necessary - to sentence more serious cases, such as for fraud, theft and assault. At present, crimes eligible for a jail term of more than six months have to be sent to a Crown Court for sentencing. The Ministry of Justice thinks that by doubling magistrates' sentencing powers to a year, it could stop about 500 cases going to Crown Court - giving judges around 2,000 extra days to handle more serious crimes. The courts system is facing unprecedented delays - and as of June last year there was a record high of more than 60,000 Crown Court trials waiting to be heard. Many serious cases are being pushed back until late 2023 - withalleged victims saying they are struggling to copeas they wait for their cases to be heard. The changes will only apply to so-called either-way offences - cases that can be dealt with either by magistrates or by judges at a Crown Court. A defendant charged with an either-way offence can insist on the case being heard by a jury in a Crown Court if they wish. The prime minister said it would ""help tackle the backlog of cases in the Crown Courts - speeding up justice for victims, punishing those guilty of serious crimes and building back stronger and safer from the pandemic"". He said increasing magistrates' sentencing powers would mean that cases came to court quicker meaning ""greater justice for victims"" and ""more criminals seeing justice quicker"". Mr Raab said the move would help provide additional capacity to drive down the backlog of cases, alongside measures such as the temporary Nightingale courts. Like Nightingale hospitals, these courts are temporary courtrooms -such as in hotels- that have been set up across England and Wales to try to deal with more cases. The announcement comes as the trial of Wales manager Ryan Giggswas delayed until August due to a lack of court space. The former Manchester United player, 48, was due to go on trial at Manchester Crown Court on Monday accused of coercive behaviour and assault against his ex-girlfriend and her sister. However, a hearing was told there was nowhere available in the building. Judge Hilary Manley said: ""Due to the large backlog of court cases, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and the need for social distancing, this is a situation which is a daily reality for the criminal courts."" Mr Giggs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. This change in sentencing powers for the lowest criminal courts was put into law almost 20 years ago but never used at the time. The government is clear it's pulling the lever now because it reckons it will create some breathing space for the Crown Courts. Barristers say it will make little difference and the real solution can only be found in urgently needed cash to reverse years of cuts. They say that while the Crown Court backlogs are at record levels, that's not because there's more crime, but a lack of resources in the system to deliver justice efficiently. Criminal barristers are actively talking about staging some form of strike or work-to-rule if the government does not act swiftly on recommendations last year for asignificant increase in legal aid funding. If that materialises in the coming months the Crown Courts could grind to a halt. Ministers plan to monitor how the extra powers for magistrates are used - but many lawyers predict it will backfire. They say more defendants may appeal against sentences given by magistrates, many of whom have no legal qualifications - or there could be a spike in the prison population, further stretching the government's budget. The Bar Council, representing all barristers in England and Wales, also warned that more defendants may exercise their right to go before a jury - adding to the already enormous pressures in the system. And the chairman of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), Jo Sidhu, said ""fiddling with magistrates' sentencing powers is a betrayal of victims of crime"". Kirsty Brimelow, vice-chair of the CBA, told Radio 4's Today that the increase of sentencing powers for magistrates would cause more defendants to choose to go to the Crown Court as the lower sentence was one of the attractions of staying in the lower court. ""Sadly the stats do show that you are more likely to get imprisonment within the magistrates' court than you are in the Crown Court,"" she said. Ms Brimelow said increasing magistrates' powers could lead to more appeals which would take up magistrates' time. ""The issue of the backlog, which was there before the pandemic, is not really about sentencing powers, that is just rearranging the deck chairs, it is about lack of investment,"" she said. She said there was a ""huge attrition"" of barristers leaving the profession and warned that 96.5% of the CBA's members were willing to take action if there was not a substantial increase in fees into legal aid. Mr Raab said that the one thing that would hold back the court system's recovery from the pandemic would be if the CBA went on strike, which he said he did not think other parts of the justice system or the public would support. Stuart Matthews, partner at criminal defence firm Reeds Solicitors, also warned people to ""be afraid"" - describing magistrates as largely ""untrained volunteers, many of whom do not understand even the most basic of legal principles"". This video can not be played WATCH: Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession Labour's shadow courts and sentencing minister Alex Cunningham also criticised the move, calling it ""another sticking plaster"" solution. ""Ministers must give assurances that greater powers for magistrates won't inflict even more burden on Crown Courts - with increased numbers of appeals overloading a diminishing number of criminal advocates left in the system."" Magistrates are volunteers who hear cases in criminal and family courts, aided by a legal adviser To become a magistrate you do not need qualifications but must be aged between 18 and 65 and of good character - among other qualities Around 21 hours of training is required to become a magistrate and you must be able to sit in court for at least 13 days a year They are unpaid but some employers allow their employees time off paid and you can claim an allowance if you miss out on pay Source:UK Government,external But magistrates say they are delighted. The Magistrates' Association - which had campaigned for sentencing powers to be extended - said magistrates would take up the new responsibility with pride and professionalism, and would ""strive to deliver the highest quality of justice"". The changes are expected to be brought in in the coming months. The government said training would be provided by the Judicial College to make sure the powers are used ""consistently and appropriately"" - and the government will have powers to reverse the change if needed. Last year, the spending watchdog the National Audit Officesaid the Crown Court backlogcould remain a problem for years - and there could still be significant delays in 2024. And in October, Mr Raabtold the BBC he did not knowwhen the backlog would drop below pre-pandemic levels.

"Wales is the only country in the UK that does not have the power to decide it's own public holidays A move to make St David's Day a ""bank holiday"" for one council's workforce has been granted. Gwynedd Council has voted to make the country's patron saint's day a public holiday within its own borders. The move was granted at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, despite the UK Government rejecting the plans for a national bank holiday. Wales is the only nation in the Union not to have the power to decide its own national holidays. Everything you need to know about St David's Day St David: Ten things about the man and myth What is devolution and how does it work across the UK? Cabinet member Nia Jeffreys said: ""It is a national disgrace that in Wales we cannot choose and identify our own significant events, be they culturally, linguistically or of importance to our heritage. ""Westminster refuses to devolve the power to the Welsh Government to decide on this fundamental right."" Both Scotland and Northern Ireland have chosen to make the days dedicated to their patron saints, St Andrew and St Patrick, bank holidays. Daffodils and leeks are national emblems of Wales Llandderfel councillor Elwyn Edwards, who brought the proposal before the council, said she was ""delighted"" that the proposal had passed. ""It gives a clear message that we are serious, here in Gwynedd, to challenge the British rule of disregarding our own identity and heritage within Wales."" However, due to the ""national terms and conditions"" of teaching contracts, deputy leader Dafydd Meurig said the council was unable to include them in the process. It will cost the council about Â£200,000 to make 1 March a bank holiday, according to the council's finance team, as casual staff would need to be employed ""to ensure service continuity during staff absences"". St David's day was previously celebrated as a holiday in Anglesey, shortly after local government reorganisation and creation of the Isle of Anglesey county council in 1996. But the council said reorganisation had led to changes in terms and conditions, which resulted in staff losing certain benefits. ""As part of a compromise deal reached, staff were offered St David's Day as a statutory/concessionary holiday,"" said a council spokesperson. ""The St David's Day holiday came to an end on Anglesey after the formal adoption of single status (job evaluation) in 2015."" In Carmarthenshire, the leader of the council has written to Welsh government to ask for an all-Wales approach on St David's Day. Powys council said a motion to make 1 March a bank holiday lost by 12 votes in 2018. No other councils revealed plans to mark St David's Day as a bank holiday when contacted by BBC Wales.

"The slate landscape of north west Wales became the UK's 33rd World Heritage Site last year The success of a slate region given Unesco heritage status must be felt in all communities, a councillor has warned. The slate landscape of north-west Walesbecame the UK's 33rd World Heritage Site last year. But there are fears some communities will get too much tourism, while others could miss out. Gwynedd council said it was developing a sustainable tourism framework with Snowdonia National Park. With overseas travel being severely disrupted during the Covid pandemic, Snowdonia National Park said it had witnessed a significant increase in tourists. Seven reasons Wales has a new World Heritage Site What is a Unesco World Heritage site? While many see the benefits of a boost in trade, there have been pressures on infrastructure such as parking issues and a lack of facilities to make such tourism work in smaller communities. ""The frustrations are that people are refusing to pay for parking"", said Llanberis councillor Kevin Morris Jones. ""They park in our streets - imagine going to the shops for five minutes and then you come back home and there's a car there for the next eight hours."" Llanberis councillor Kevin Morris Jones says more villages should benefit from the success of the heritage site With the area having welcomed more visitors since the beginning of the pandemic, there are fears that a combination of factors, including the newly-designated Unesco site, could lead to an even greater influx. There are calls for the benefits brought by the Unesco status to be shared beyond the honey pot of Llanberis, including Dyffryn Nantlle, Dyffryn Ogwen Ffestiniog and Abergynolwyn. ""They need to remember that other villages are in the project as well and we need to share these people about,"" said Mr Jones. ""Other villages could benefit a lot from this. If people only come here, the village and the community is in for some hard years."" Snowdonia has attracted more tourists since the pandemic During the pandemic there have been many issues due to a lack of infrastructure to deal with more tourists, with locals complaining of severe traffic jams and dangerous parking near Snowdon. Gwynedd Council and the Snowdonia National Park Authority are holding public consultations and developing a framework to create a sustainable tourism model that will be announced later this year. Helen Pye, head of engagement for Snowdonia National Park, said: ""When you get people around the table - the combination of the public sector, private and community voices - that's when we get innovative ideas."" Helen Pye, from Snowdonia National Park, says getting people around the table generates ideas on how tourism can be sustainable Ms Pye said Unesco heritage status could protect communities as well as offer opportunities. ""Like our national park status, the area gets a lot more support because of the status in managing visitors to the area. ""We see the Unesco status as a way to tackle those challenges and to bring forward those important elements of culture and supporting local communities."" This video can not be played The slate landscape of north-west Wales is said to have ""roofed the 19th Century world"" Ms Pye stressed she had confidence all areas within the Unesco area would benefit over the coming years. Councillor Gareth Thomas, responsible for economic development at Gwynedd council, said he hoped Unesco status would increase tourism during off-peak times and alleviate pressure. ""The benefit of Unesco is that we can move people around Gwynedd if you like so that Llanberis and places like that won't see such high numbers,"" he said. ""So we're trying to promote these other areas too."" Speaking about the council's plans for a sustainable tourism model, Mr Thomas said it would be based on the principles of respect for ""culture and language"". ""What it means is that we make sure that people respect and understand our area - we must sort issues like rubbish and parking too with the national park, so there's much work happening.""

"Pollution from plastics is a global emergency in need of a robust UN treaty, according to a report. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) says there's a cascade of evidence of harm from plastics. It argues that the plastic pollution threat is almost equivalent to climate change. The air we breathe now contains plastic micro particles,thereâs plastic in Arctic snow, plastic in soils and plastic in our food. It's reported, for instance, that about 20 elephants in Thailand have died after eating plastic waste from a rubbish dump. The authors urge nations to agree a UN treaty with binding targets for reducing both plastic production and waste. ""There is a deadly ticking clock counting swiftly down,"" said the EIAâs Tom Gammage. ""If this tidal wave of pollution continues unchecked,the anticipated plastics in the seas by 2040,externalcould exceed the collective weight of all fish in the ocean."" The United Nations has identified three existential environmental threats - climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution - and concluded that they must be addressed together. Multilateral agreements on biodiversity loss and climate have existed for nearly 30 years (although they have failed to halt CO2 emissions or protect the natural world). The idea of a dedicated plastics treaty has been opposed by some nations in recent years. But more than 100 countries, including the UK, are said to favour a treaty being proposed at the next UN Environment Assembly in February and March. Sources say outright opposition is weakening, although there's a dispute as to how strict the treaty should be, and whether it should be legally binding or voluntary. US President Joe Biden has announced that the US now supports a global agreement, previously resisted by former President Donald Trump. Itâs not clear, though, whether he can win approval from Congress, as most plastics are made from oil and gas - and they're both produced in the US. Japan is said to be trying to diminish the ambition of the treaty. The Arab Gulf states and China have been silent so far. China produces most ""virgin plastic"", although the US and UK are said to be the biggest producers of waste per person. Launching the EIA report, Mr Gammage said: ""The visible nature of plastic pollution has generated huge public concern but the vast majority of plastic pollution impacts are invisible. ""The damage done by rampant overproduction of virgin plastics and their lifecycle is irreversible - this is a threat to human civilisation and the planetâs basic ability to maintain a habitable environment. Itâs becoming almost as serious as the threat from climate change."" Prof Richard Thompson from Plymouth University, an authority on plastics, told BBC News a UN treaty should focus on the full life-cycle analysis of plastics. He said: ""The underlying cause of the problem is rooted in unsustainable levels of production and consumption. ""Advocating policies that merely promote the use of plastics that are 'recyclable' wonât be effective unless thereâs a local infrastructure to collect, separate, and viably recycle those plastics. ""Polices to promote the use of 'compostable' plastics will only be effective if there is appropriate local infrastructure to handle that waste stream."" A spokesman for the British Plastics Federation told BBC News: ""Plastic is a lightweight, safe, and energy-efficient material, and simply replacing it with alternatives can often have negative environmental consequences, as well as ramifications for health and safety. ""The unfortunate scenes of plastic waste washing up in oceans around the world are a direct result of improperly managed plastic waste in many areas, and if we want to make a difference, this is where the focus should be."" Recycling can be part of the solution, but consumption is âunsustainableâ, according to one of the authors Plastics researcher Trisia Farrelly, from Massey University in New Zealand, told BBC News that oil and gas firms, which produce the feedstock for most plastics, were striving to focus attention on plastic waste, rather than the production of plastic altogether. She said: ""The question now is, what will that treaty look like? Will there be a weak form that focuses on marine litter and waste management? Or will there be a resolution that includes the full life cycle of plastics including extraction and production right through to remediation of legacy pollution?"" She agreed that more science was needed to determine the toxicity of plastics, but argued that delay was dangerous. ""The science is relatively new on a number of plastics pollution impacts and some of the science is complex,"" she said. ""But there ismore than enough evidence,externalto know that we have to act with urgency to prevent further irredeemable damage caused by plastics pollution."" Hans Peter Arp, chemistry professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, agreed there are many unknowns, but he maintained that plastic pollution was already breaching whatâs known as a planetary boundary - a threshold that should not be crossed because of the risk to humankind. He told BBC News: ""My colleagues and I have argued that plastic pollution fills the three criteria of a planetary boundary threat: 1) increasing exposure, 2) irreversible presence in the global ecosystem, 3) evidence that it is causing ecological harm, and that this harm will increase with plastic emissions. ""The rational response to the global threat posed by accumulating and poorly reversible plastic pollution is torapidly reduce consumption of virgin plastic materials,external, along with internationally coordinated strategies for waste management."" Although same large firms are resisting tough global rules, others are in support. One group, plasticpollutiontreaty.org, invites firms to sign up to strict standards to ensure a level playing field for plastic business.

"This video can not be played No individual should die like Ashling, says Bishop Tom Deenihan The family of Ashling Murphy has been robbed of their ""most precious gift"", a priest has said at her funeral. The 23-year-old teacher waskilled on the banks of the Grand Canaloutside Tullamore in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday afternoon. A ""depraved act of violence"" has united the country in grief and support, mourners were also told. Murder investigation officershave arrested a man in his 30s. It is understood the primary school teacher and musician was out exercising when she was attacked. Mourners lined the street outside St Brigid's Church, Mount Bolus, in rural County Offaly for the funeral Mass, which was attended by Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Ms Murphy's sister Amy, centre, and mother Kathleen, at her funeral Parish priest Fr Michael Meade, chief celebrant, told mourners that some symbols from Ashling's life were being presented in the church, including a musical instrument, a book to reflect her teaching career, and a GAA jersey. He told mourners that the family's ""darkness is deep"" and their ""pain raw and fierce"". ""Together we grieve, we pray, we hurt - this is the heavy price we pay for love,"" he said. He added Ms Murphy's family had been robbed ""of a gift that gave only joy and love, fun and laughter to many beyond your family"". Fr Meade called for the community not to be afraid to make ""change for what only is good"" in their lives and paid tribute to Ashling's care for her family, friends and pupils. ""That same love and joy was not kept on a shelf or wrapped up - it was freely given and shared through music, through sport, through her vocation as a teacher,"" he said. ""Today we give thanks for the privilege of sharing in this most wonderful gift of Ashling Murphy."" This video can not be played The killing of Ashling Murphy had united the country in grief, says Bishop Tom Deenihan of Meath Bishop of Meath Tom Deenihan said the crime had also questions of ""ourselves and of society"". ""It has questioned our attitudes and, particularly, our attitudes towards women and it has questioned our values and our morality,"" he said. ""Whether those questions will be addressed or passed over remains to be seen but we cannot allow such violence and disregard for both human life and bodily integrity take root in our time and culture."" In pictures: Mourners line the streets for Ashling Murphy 'Only something powerful can come out of this' 'What happened to her could have happened to me' Violence against women had been highlighted by Pope Francis as an ""insult to God"" two weeks before Ms Murphy's murder, the bishop added. The hearse carrying Ms Murphy's coffin moves past mourners Ms Murphy's 23-year-old boyfriend, Ryan Casey, spoke publicly for the first time since her death. ""Ashling was so much more to me than a girlfriend. She was my soul mate. She is my soul mate. She will always be my soul mate,"" he said in his emotional tribute. ""She is the greatest love of my life. I will cherish the last five years we spent together for my entire life and hope that some day, god willing, we can be reunited once more. ""Goodbye for now and love forever darling."" Ashling's cousin Rachel O'Shea read a prayer asking ""that the many vigils that took place in memory of Ashling, mark the beginning of an end to violence against women"". A talented musician, Ms Murphy was a former pupil of Sacred Heart School in Tullamore and she taught in the nearby Durrow National School. By Jessica Black, BBC News NI reporter Musicians performed at Ms Murphy's funeral The media came early and trained their cameras on the church, then the Irish traditional musicians, the families and neighbours, and young women of Ashling's age. The farmer opened his fields to mourners in cars and buses, and gardaÃ­ (Irish police) marshalled them in. His fields have held the overflow from funerals before, but never for a funeral like this. There are hundreds here at the junction at St Brigid's. There are Ashling's pupils, in school uniform, small and serious. Young GAA players form a guard of honour for Ms Murphy There are pupils from her old school in maroon cardigans, and there is her GAA club in yellow, green and blue. And the media, behind a cordon, looking on. Ms Murphy's killing has sparked calls for more to be done to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence towards women. Ireland's National Women's Council has said this must be a ""watershed moment in ending men's violence against women"". The Murphy family walked behind the hearse as it left St Brigid's Church Ireland's Justice Minister Helen McEntee said she intended to publish a new national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence at the start of March. Teachers' unions in the Republic of Ireland had urged schools and colleges to join in a tribute to Ms Murphy at 11:00.

"Average pay rises are failing to keep up with the rise in the cost of living, the latest official statistics show. While wages rose in the year to November, they did not rise as fast as prices over the same period. This meant that average weekly earnings - adjusted for price rises - fell for the first time since July 2020. ""Salaries are growing reasonably strongly, but some people are saying they are not feeling much better due to rising prices,"" the ONS told the BBC. Regular pay, excluding bonuses and adjusted for inflation, fell 1% in November compared to the same month in the previous year. Â£150,000 starting salaries as firms fight for staff UK economy above pre-Covid levels in November Why is the cost of living going up? In November, the inflation rate rose to 5.1% and is expected to reach at least 6% in spring, according to the Bank of England. How have you adapted to rising prices?

Eleanor Deeley, joint managing director at Midlands-based construction firm Deeley Group, said: ""Rising labour costs are an issue for us, and the construction industry as a whole, where labour can be 50% of a project cost. ""In an industry where margins are already slim, we're seeing bricklayers suddenly demanding 20% [pay] increases."" Salaries, however, are still above pre-pandemic levels. Average weekly pay, excluding bonuses, rose to Â£550 in November compared with Â£510 in March 2020. Over the longer three-month period, between September and November, wages rose at an annual rate of 3.8%, the ONS said. That was slower than the 4.3% recorded in the three-month period between August and October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that wage growth was ""relatively healthy by historical standards but of course we are seeing challenges with inflation"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said UK wage growth was ""relatively healthy"" But he said: ""It is important to remember that we are not alone in that. There's a global phenomenon because the causes of inflation - whether it is supply chains or energy prices - are of course global in nature. But we are taking action to support people as best we can."" Today's figures showed that pay increases failed to match the accelerating cost of living for the first time in over a year in November. However, with the jobs market heating up, economists say that may be short-lived. The latest numbers suggest that not only have the vast majority of livelihoods survived the end of the furlough scheme, but -  with vacancies at a record high of 1.24 million - many employers are grappling with a shortage of skilled workers. That's been heightened by the departure of more than 400,000 people from the labour market since the pandemic started - typically those who have become students, taken early retirement or are long-term sick. Those factors are likely to give workers the upper hand when it comes to seeking - and getting - bigger pay rises this year. Overall, the Office for National Statistics said that the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% - close to pre-pandemic levels. But Shane O'Neill, from Validus Risk Management, said: ""This number, though positive, will be taken with a pinch of salt - it predates boththe Bank of England rate hikeand the onset of Omicron, which caused significant economic scarring."" Meanwhile, companies added 184,000 people to their payrolls between November and December, taking the total to 29.5 million. UK job vacancies soared to a record high of 1.24 million between October and December, the ONS data showed, with vacancies 462,000 higher compared with the three months before the pandemic. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said the total number of people on payrolls was ""now well above pre-pandemic levels"". He added: ""New survey figures show that in the three months to November, the unemployment rate fell back almost to where it was before Covid-19 hit."" However, he said that while job vacancies had reached a new record, ""they are now growing more slowly than they were last summer"". Also, the percentage of ""economically inactive"" people - which is those neither looking for or available for work - rose to 21.3%. Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell. said this increase ""could well be tied to the return to education for many young people looking to better their prospects and nervous of setting out on their career during such an unpredictable time"". ""Nerves may also be playing a part in the number of over 60s choosing to stay in the workplace, some deciding to take early retirement, others perhaps waiting until the spring and summer to take on additional hours."" With job vacancies rising and the number of economically inactive growing, companies such as the insurer Phoenix Group are tailoring their job adverts to attract older applicants  - by banning words such as ""energetic"" and ""enthusiastic"". Phoenix Group, which is led by Andy Briggs - who is also the government's ""business champion for older workers"", believes using  ""younger-age stereotypical words"" could deter people aged over-50 from applying for a job,according to the Daily Telegraph,external. Gary Palmer is the the local GMB Union organiser in Eastbourne As the cost of living rises, refuse workers across the South East want a pay boost. They argue that HGV drivers, who are in short supply and great demand, are better paid than the lorry drivers who work in rubbish. Refuse truck drivers in Eastbourne went on strike after the local council offered a 7% pay rise which officials described as ""very generous"". But, in what the GMB union is calling a ""massive win"", its members have now accepted an improved offer. This includes a minimum rise this year of 11% and a guarantee the pay rate will reach a minimum of Â£13.50 per hour in April 2023 - a 19% rise in total, the GMB says. Gary Palmer, an HGV driver and local GMB union organiser, says: ""It's not only the cost of living, people are understanding that the poor are going to work and in-work poverty is growing.

Tongans living abroad have beenanxiously waiting for newsfrom relatives and loved ones back home. It could take up to two weeks to restore phone and internet lines. The World Health Organization said a lone official had been channelling information between UN agencies and the Tongan government using a satellite phone. The eruption was felt as far away as in the US. In Peru, two people drowned in abnormally high waves while beaches near the capital Lima were closed off following an oil spill.

"This video can not be played No individual should die like Ashling, says Bishop Tom Deenihan The family of Ashling Murphy has been robbed of their ""most precious gift"", a priest has said at her funeral. The 23-year-old teacher waskilled on the banks of the Grand Canaloutside Tullamore in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday afternoon. A ""depraved act of violence"" has united the country in grief and support, mourners were also told. Murder investigation officershave arrested a man in his 30s. It is understood the primary school teacher and musician was out exercising when she was attacked. Mourners lined the street outside St Brigid's Church, Mount Bolus, in rural County Offaly for the funeral Mass, which was attended by Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Ms Murphy's sister Amy, centre, and mother Kathleen, at her funeral Parish priest Fr Michael Meade, chief celebrant, told mourners that some symbols from Ashling's life were being presented in the church, including a musical instrument, a book to reflect her teaching career, and a GAA jersey. He told mourners that the family's ""darkness is deep"" and their ""pain raw and fierce"". ""Together we grieve, we pray, we hurt - this is the heavy price we pay for love,"" he said. He added Ms Murphy's family had been robbed ""of a gift that gave only joy and love, fun and laughter to many beyond your family"". Fr Meade called for the community not to be afraid to make ""change for what only is good"" in their lives and paid tribute to Ashling's care for her family, friends and pupils. ""That same love and joy was not kept on a shelf or wrapped up - it was freely given and shared through music, through sport, through her vocation as a teacher,"" he said. ""Today we give thanks for the privilege of sharing in this most wonderful gift of Ashling Murphy."" This video can not be played The killing of Ashling Murphy had united the country in grief, says Bishop Tom Deenihan of Meath Bishop of Meath Tom Deenihan said the crime had also questions of ""ourselves and of society"". ""It has questioned our attitudes and, particularly, our attitudes towards women and it has questioned our values and our morality,"" he said. ""Whether those questions will be addressed or passed over remains to be seen but we cannot allow such violence and disregard for both human life and bodily integrity take root in our time and culture."" In pictures: Mourners line the streets for Ashling Murphy 'Only something powerful can come out of this' 'What happened to her could have happened to me' Violence against women had been highlighted by Pope Francis as an ""insult to God"" two weeks before Ms Murphy's murder, the bishop added. The hearse carrying Ms Murphy's coffin moves past mourners Ms Murphy's 23-year-old boyfriend, Ryan Casey, spoke publicly for the first time since her death. ""Ashling was so much more to me than a girlfriend. She was my soul mate. She is my soul mate. She will always be my soul mate,"" he said in his emotional tribute. ""She is the greatest love of my life. I will cherish the last five years we spent together for my entire life and hope that some day, god willing, we can be reunited once more. ""Goodbye for now and love forever darling."" Ashling's cousin Rachel O'Shea read a prayer asking ""that the many vigils that took place in memory of Ashling, mark the beginning of an end to violence against women"". A talented musician, Ms Murphy was a former pupil of Sacred Heart School in Tullamore and she taught in the nearby Durrow National School. By Jessica Black, BBC News NI reporter Musicians performed at Ms Murphy's funeral The media came early and trained their cameras on the church, then the Irish traditional musicians, the families and neighbours, and young women of Ashling's age. The farmer opened his fields to mourners in cars and buses, and gardaÃ­ (Irish police) marshalled them in. His fields have held the overflow from funerals before, but never for a funeral like this. There are hundreds here at the junction at St Brigid's. There are Ashling's pupils, in school uniform, small and serious. Young GAA players form a guard of honour for Ms Murphy There are pupils from her old school in maroon cardigans, and there is her GAA club in yellow, green and blue. And the media, behind a cordon, looking on. Ms Murphy's killing has sparked calls for more to be done to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence towards women. Ireland's National Women's Council has said this must be a ""watershed moment in ending men's violence against women"". The Murphy family walked behind the hearse as it left St Brigid's Church Ireland's Justice Minister Helen McEntee said she intended to publish a new national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence at the start of March. Teachers' unions in the Republic of Ireland had urged schools and colleges to join in a tribute to Ms Murphy at 11:00.

"Universal Basic Income provides a set amount of money to everyone in a specified area Plans for a universal basic income pilot in Wales are too small, a cross-party report has found. UBI is where a government pays all individuals a set salary, regardless of their means. The Welsh government plans a three-year pilot this April with about 250 care leavers, but a Senedd committee said the scheme would provide only ""limited information"" on the UBI concept. The Welsh government said the scheme would provide ""valuable information"". The UBI idea, where individuals are paid a regular sum of money, has sparked debate across the world. Advocates say a basic income could help reduce poverty, and could be easier and less stressful to navigate than more complex means-tested benefits. Opponents say it would be extremely costly, and is not targeted at those who need it. What is a universal basic income? Has coronavirus changed the basic income debate? Universal basic income to be tested in Wales The Welsh proposal for a pilot, in choosing to focus on a specific group, has been criticised for not being universal. Information on how the pilot will work has so far been limited, but the Welsh Parliament's petitions committee report, which is not produced by ministers but a body of the Senedd, outlines some details. It says the project would involve 250 care leavers, planned to run for about three years, and be ""pitched at the living wage"". The committee's inquiry was prompted by a petition signed by 1,051 people, calling for a geography-based UBI. This video can not be played An experiment in Finland saw 2,000 people paid â¬560 (Â£490) a month, instead of their unemployment benefit. Members of the Seneddon the committee, which includes two from Labour, one Plaid and one Conservative, said a larger group would provide more ""robust results."" ""A basic income pilot for care leavers - as currently proposed by the Welsh government - will provide valuable feedback on the potential of such a scheme to improve the support to a group which faces significant challenges,"" the committee said. ""However, a three-year pilot of only 250 people will offer limited information. And applying a basic income only to care leavers, will tell us little about universal basic income."" It said payments should be guaranteed, unconditional and paid to the individual. Benefits are not devolved in Wales and the UK government has opposed the UBI concept. The report said the pilot will ""be richer and produce more robust evidence if all relevant agencies are engaged in the enterprise"". ""The Welsh government should make every effort to persuade UK government departments to support the widest possible pilot scheme,"" it said. The report warned the project would be undermined ""if participants lost entitlements they currently claim as a direct result of a failure to communicate"" between the UK and Welsh governments. Implementing UBI in Wales would be ""far easier"" if welfare was devolved, the committee argued. Committee chairman Jack Sargeant said: ""The Welsh government should investigate increasing the number of proposed recipients and include care leavers from as diverse as possible a range of backgrounds, locations, and circumstances to give us the evidence we need to properly evaluate this scheme. ""While not all members of the committee support UBI, we all believe that a wider pilot scheme has the potential to produce richer, more persuasive evidence for the Welsh government to consider."" He added the evidence ""may prove that UBI is an inefficient way to target those in the greatest need - or it may prove my own view that the benefits attributed to other experiments, in terms of wellbeing and economic outcomes, are achievable here in Wales"". Swansea, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Gwynedd have called for pilots to take place in their areas. Experiments have been held in Finland with 2,000 people who were paid â¬560 (Â£467). The Senedd report says recipients were found to be ""more satisfied with their lives and experience less mental strain"". A Welsh government spokesman said: ""The provision of a basic income to young people leaving our care system should help to reduce the challenges care leavers face. In addition, evaluation of the pilot scheme will provide valuable information about how a basic income could apply more widely. ""The minister will make a statement in the coming weeks to provide an update on the pilot."" What is a universal basic income?

"Wales is the only country in the UK that does not have the power to decide it's own public holidays A move to make St David's Day a ""bank holiday"" for one council's workforce has been granted. Gwynedd Council has voted to make the country's patron saint's day a public holiday within its own borders. The move was granted at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, despite the UK Government rejecting the plans for a national bank holiday. Wales is the only nation in the Union not to have the power to decide its own national holidays. Everything you need to know about St David's Day St David: Ten things about the man and myth What is devolution and how does it work across the UK? Cabinet member Nia Jeffreys said: ""It is a national disgrace that in Wales we cannot choose and identify our own significant events, be they culturally, linguistically or of importance to our heritage. ""Westminster refuses to devolve the power to the Welsh Government to decide on this fundamental right."" Both Scotland and Northern Ireland have chosen to make the days dedicated to their patron saints, St Andrew and St Patrick, bank holidays. Daffodils and leeks are national emblems of Wales Llandderfel councillor Elwyn Edwards, who brought the proposal before the council, said she was ""delighted"" that the proposal had passed. ""It gives a clear message that we are serious, here in Gwynedd, to challenge the British rule of disregarding our own identity and heritage within Wales."" However, due to the ""national terms and conditions"" of teaching contracts, deputy leader Dafydd Meurig said the council was unable to include them in the process. It will cost the council about Â£200,000 to make 1 March a bank holiday, according to the council's finance team, as casual staff would need to be employed ""to ensure service continuity during staff absences"". St David's day was previously celebrated as a holiday in Anglesey, shortly after local government reorganisation and creation of the Isle of Anglesey county council in 1996. But the council said reorganisation had led to changes in terms and conditions, which resulted in staff losing certain benefits. ""As part of a compromise deal reached, staff were offered St David's Day as a statutory/concessionary holiday,"" said a council spokesperson. ""The St David's Day holiday came to an end on Anglesey after the formal adoption of single status (job evaluation) in 2015."" In Carmarthenshire, the leader of the council has written to Welsh government to ask for an all-Wales approach on St David's Day. Powys council said a motion to make 1 March a bank holiday lost by 12 votes in 2018. No other councils revealed plans to mark St David's Day as a bank holiday when contacted by BBC Wales. The UK government the cost to the economy of an additional bank holiday is ""considerable"". A spokesman added: ""The UK government has no current plans to change the accepted arrangements for bank holidays in Wales.""

"Supermarket Morrisons has confirmed it has cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid. It follows similar moves from big retailers includingIkea,Next and Ocadoas staff absences rise. Unjabbed Morrisons workers who are told to isolate but test negative now get statutory sick pay of Â£96.35 a week. Covid-positive staff get full sick pay regardless of vaccination status. The firm pays staff at least Â£10 per hour. Its chief executive Dave Potts first mentioned the policy in a conference call with investors in September,the Guardian reported,external, as part of a plan to tackle the ""biblical costs"" of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. The move was intended to encourage workers to get jabbed, the newspaper said. Under Morrisons' policy, if NHS Test and Trace informs an unvaccinated worker that they have been exposed to Covid-19, they will only get statutory sick pay - the legal minimum - when they isolate. In England,unvaccinated people must isolate for 10 days if they are a close contact of someone with Covid, even if they do not test positive themselves. Ocado and Next cut sick pay for unvaccinated staff Ikea cuts sick pay for some unvaccinated staff How can I get my booster jab? However, any Morrisons employee who tests positive is paid full sick pay while they isolate, regardless of vaccination status. Morrisons said its policy only applies to workers who are unvaccinated by choice, and each individual is treated on a case-by-case basis. Workers who cannot receive Covid vaccines for medical reasons are not obliged to isolate in England. The requirement for fully-vaccinated workers to isolate when exposed to Covid was dropped in England in August. This resulted in unvaccinated workers being more likely to take time off than their vaccinated colleagues, even when not infected with coronavirus. Companies now appear to be tightening their sick pay rules as they face mass absences due to the more infectious Omicron variant. In the last few weeks it has emerged that Ikea, Next and Ocado have changed their policy on unvaccinated staff who have been exposed to coronavirus. Collectively they employ nearly 60,000 workers. Sick pay cuts will also be implemented at Wessex Water and in the US, several major companies have started penalising unjabbed workers. However, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Asda pay unvaccinated workers full company sick pay when they are isolating. Statutory sick pay (SSP) is the minimum amount employers must pay, but some employers offer more than SSP - this is normally known as company or contractual sick pay. Beth Hale, partner at employment law firm C M Murray, said claims of direct discrimination due to this kind of sick pay policy were unlikely to succeed as being opposed to vaccination was ""unlikely to be a protected belief for the purposes of the Equality Act."" ""While the policy may have a disproportionate impact on those from certain ethnic or religious groups (which could give rise to a claim for indirect discrimination), an employer may well be able to justify the policy on the basis of their legitimate business needs,"" she added. She said where employers are struggling with significant staff absences because of the large case numbers, it ""seemed reasonable"" that they may want to take steps to encourage vaccination amongst their workforce in this way. But she added that employers need to be ""careful that policies are communicated carefully and sensitively"" to avoid employee relations issues.

"Pollution from plastics is a global emergency in need of a robust UN treaty, according to a report. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) says there's a cascade of evidence of harm from plastics. It argues that the plastic pollution threat is almost equivalent to climate change. The air we breathe now contains plastic micro particles,thereâs plastic in Arctic snow, plastic in soils and plastic in our food. It's reported, for instance, that about 20 elephants in Thailand have died after eating plastic waste from a rubbish dump. The authors urge nations to agree a UN treaty with binding targets for reducing both plastic production and waste. ""There is a deadly ticking clock counting swiftly down,"" said the EIAâs Tom Gammage. ""If this tidal wave of pollution continues unchecked,the anticipated plastics in the seas by 2040,externalcould exceed the collective weight of all fish in the ocean."" The United Nations has identified three existential environmental threats - climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution - and concluded that they must be addressed together. Multilateral agreements on biodiversity loss and climate have existed for nearly 30 years (although they have failed to halt CO2 emissions or protect the natural world). The idea of a dedicated plastics treaty has been opposed by some nations in recent years. But more than 100 countries, including the UK, are said to favour a treaty being proposed at the next UN Environment Assembly in February and March. Sources say outright opposition is weakening, although there's a dispute as to how strict the treaty should be, and whether it should be legally binding or voluntary. US President Joe Biden has announced that the US now supports a global agreement, previously resisted by former President Donald Trump. Itâs not clear, though, whether he can win approval from Congress, as most plastics are made from oil and gas - and they're both produced in the US. Japan is said to be trying to diminish the ambition of the treaty. The Arab Gulf states and China have been silent so far. China produces most ""virgin plastic"", although the US and UK are said to be the biggest producers of waste per person. Launching the EIA report, Mr Gammage said: ""The visible nature of plastic pollution has generated huge public concern but the vast majority of plastic pollution impacts are invisible. ""The damage done by rampant overproduction of virgin plastics and their lifecycle is irreversible - this is a threat to human civilisation and the planetâs basic ability to maintain a habitable environment. Itâs becoming almost as serious as the threat from climate change."" Prof Richard Thompson from Plymouth University, an authority on plastics, told BBC News a UN treaty should focus on the full life-cycle analysis of plastics. He said: ""The underlying cause of the problem is rooted in unsustainable levels of production and consumption. ""Advocating policies that merely promote the use of plastics that are 'recyclable' wonât be effective unless thereâs a local infrastructure to collect, separate, and viably recycle those plastics. ""Polices to promote the use of 'compostable' plastics will only be effective if there is appropriate local infrastructure to handle that waste stream."" A spokesman for the British Plastics Federation told BBC News: ""Plastic is a lightweight, safe, and energy-efficient material, and simply replacing it with alternatives can often have negative environmental consequences, as well as ramifications for health and safety. ""The unfortunate scenes of plastic waste washing up in oceans around the world are a direct result of improperly managed plastic waste in many areas, and if we want to make a difference, this is where the focus should be."" Recycling can be part of the solution, but consumption is âunsustainableâ, according to one of the authors Plastics researcher Trisia Farrelly, from Massey University in New Zealand, told BBC News that oil and gas firms, which produce the feedstock for most plastics, were striving to focus attention on plastic waste, rather than the production of plastic altogether. She said: ""The question now is, what will that treaty look like? Will there be a weak form that focuses on marine litter and waste management? Or will there be a resolution that includes the full life cycle of plastics including extraction and production right through to remediation of legacy pollution?"" She agreed that more science was needed to determine the toxicity of plastics, but argued that delay was dangerous. ""The science is relatively new on a number of plastics pollution impacts and some of the science is complex,"" she said. ""But there ismore than enough evidence,externalto know that we have to act with urgency to prevent further irredeemable damage caused by plastics pollution."" Hans Peter Arp, chemistry professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, agreed there are many unknowns, but he maintained that plastic pollution was already breaching whatâs known as a planetary boundary - a threshold that should not be crossed because of the risk to humankind. He told BBC News: ""My colleagues and I have argued that plastic pollution fills the three criteria of a planetary boundary threat: 1) increasing exposure, 2) irreversible presence in the global ecosystem, 3) evidence that it is causing ecological harm, and that this harm will increase with plastic emissions. ""The rational response to the global threat posed by accumulating and poorly reversible plastic pollution is torapidly reduce consumption of virgin plastic materials,external, along with internationally coordinated strategies for waste management."" Although same large firms are resisting tough global rules, others are in support. One group, plasticpollutiontreaty.org, invites firms to sign up to strict standards to ensure a level playing field for plastic business.
