"This video can not be played Watch: British trawler Cornelis Gert Jan is held in Le Havre The UK has condemned ""unjustified"" threats from France and summoned the country's ambassador in an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is calling for talks later, asking Catherine Colonna to explain ""disappointing and disproportionate threats"". A British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday. French authorities said the detained vessel did not have a licence. However, Environment Secretary George Eustice has insisted the European Union did grant a licence to the trawler and said it was ""unclear"" why, according to reports, it was subsequently withdrawn from the list given to the EU. Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? What happens when an ambassador is summoned? France was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing licences to dozens of French boats, and argued that this breached the Brexit deal. The country has warned it would block British boats from some ports next week and tighten checks on UK boats and trucks if the dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November. In issuing its ultimatum, it said it would begin to impose ""targeted measures"" from next Tuesday, including preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports and more checks on UK goods. France has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as itpreviously threatened in May. The country's Europe minister Clement Beaune told French TV news channel CNews: ""We need to speak the language of force because, unfortunately, that seems to be the only thing this British government understands."" On Thursday evening, Ms Truss said in a tweet that she had asked Europe Minister Wendy Morton to summon the French ambassador for talks on Friday. A government spokesman said: ""The proposed French actions are unjustified and do not appear to be compatible on the EU's part with the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) or wider international law. ""We regret the confrontational language that has been consistently used by the French government on this issue, which makes this situation no easier to resolve."" This video can not be played George Eustice says France's response has been ""disappointing and disproportionate"" The detained vessel is the Cornelis Gert Jan and its owner, Macduff Shellfish of Scotland, said the vessel was fishing legally in French waters. The firm's Andrew Brown said it appeared the Cornelis, based at Shoreham, in West Sussex, had been ""caught up"" in the ongoing UK-France post-Brexit fishing row. He warned that without ""a speedy resolution"" the vessel's catch could be confiscated by the French authorities, and called on the UK government to ""defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet"". French maritime minister Annick Girardinsaid on Twitter,externalthe trawler was found to be fishing in the Bay of Seine without the proper licences. The minister said checks on the British vessels were standard during the scallop fishing season. But she added they had also been undertaken against ""the backdrop of the tightening of controls in the Channel, in the context of discussions on licences with the United Kingdom and the European Commission"". The UK maintains the rejected applications that sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show the boats had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters. A meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licencesto fish in Jersey's waters from Friday. The government of Jersey said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protestedoutside the port of St Helier on the island.

"President Joe Biden speaks with House Leader Nancy Pelosi ahead of his spending plan announcement US President Joe Biden unveiled a revamped $1.75tn (Â£1.27tn) spending plan on Thursday, calling it a historic investment in the country's future. ""No-one got everything they wanted, including me,"" he said, acknowledging the struggle within his party to reach consensus on a pair of landmark bills. Narrow margins in Congress require nearly unanimous support from the Democrats for the bills to pass. They include major investments in infrastructure, climate and childcare. The White House has said the plan has the support of all 50 Democrats in the evenly divided Senate and expressed confidence that it could also pass the House. But it remains to be seen whether Mr Biden has actually achieved the level of cooperation needed from within his party to move the spending plan forward. The administration was hoping to have a deal in place before Mr Biden flew off to Europe on Thursday. He is heading for Rome, the Vatican and later to Glasgow, Scotland, for the United Nations climate conference, COP26. This new proposal is a stripped-down version of the roughly $3.5tn social spending plan Mr Biden unveiled earlier this year. The Democratic president was expected to use his Thursday morning meeting with House Democrats to convince progressives in the party that this new version is close enough to the original bill, and to persuade progressives in the House of Representative to pass a separate, $1tn infrastructure bill that has already passed in the Senate. It's a delicate balance for Mr Biden, as he tries to appeal to his party's progressives - who say they need action on the social spending bill before passing infrastructure - and some moderates, for whom the infrastructure bill is priority. Others had concerns over the price tag of the original social spending bill. $555bn aimed at fighting climate change, mainly through tax-incentives for renewable and low-emission sources of energy $400bn for free and universal preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds $150bn to build one million affordable housing units Speaking on Thursday, Mr Biden said the US was at risk of ""losing our edge as a nation"". ""Somewhere along the way we stopped investing in ourselves, and investing in our people,"" he said. ""We can't be competitive in the 21st Century global economy if we continue this slide."" Head of the Democrats' Progressive Caucus Pramila Jayapal said Thursday she was ""impressed"" with Mr Biden's speech The scaled-back spending plan announced by Mr Biden on Thursday is missing several big promises from the original bill. Paid family leave was removed entirely - a blow to progressives and American voters who hoped the US would join the majority of other countries in providing paid time off for new parents. The US is one of just eight countries without national paid maternity leave. A plan to lower prescription drug prices has also been slashed. The AARP, the nation's largest interest group focused on elderly Americans, released a statement after Mr Biden's announcement saying it was ""outraged"" that the new framework does not lower drug prices. The president on Thursday made the case that his spending plan was ""fiscally responsible and fully paid for"" and that it will not add to the deficit. Here is what's proposed: The plan promises to offset its $1.75tn cost with an estimated $2tn in revenue increases, according to the White House A 15% minimum tax on the reported profits of large firms An additional 5% tax on incomes of more than $10m annually and another 3% tax on incomes above $25m Increased enforcement to cut down on tax evasion by large corporations and the wealthy A 50-50 seat split in the Senate - and Republican resistance - means Mr Biden must bring his entire party on board if he hopes to pass the spending bill. In the coming days, Mr Biden will know if he has those numbers. Two moderate Democrats, Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, appeared to signal some support for the bill in separate statements on Thursday. ""After months of productive, good-faith negotiations with President Biden and the White House, we have made significant progress,"" Ms Sinema said. ""I look forward to getting this done."" Both Ms Sinema and Mr Manchin are widely seen to have tanked the original bill by refusing to vote for it. This video can not be played All the times the US spent big on infrastructure Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is expected to hold a vote on the infrastructure bill - already passed in the Senate - as early as Thursday. To get there, she'll need progressives to agree to it. The head of the House Progressive Caucus, Washington State Representative Pramila Jayapal, said the president made a ""compelling speech"" but said she'd have to wait and see where the progressives stood. Ms Jayapal has repeatedly insisted that the infrastructure bill and the social spending bill be passed in tandem. For Mr Biden a lot is riding on the fate of these two bills: his presidential legacy. ""I don't think it's hyperbole to say that the House and Senate majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens in the next week,"" he told Democrats on Thursday morning, according to US media.

"David Henderson was found guilty of endangering the safety of an aircraft in which a footballer and pilot died The organiser of the flight in which footballer Emiliano Sala died has been found guilty of endangering the safety of an aircraft. Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, died in the crash in the English Channel in January 2019. David Henderson, 67, of Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, was found guilty after atrialat Cardiff Crown Court. He had also previouslyadmitted trying to arrange a flightfor a passenger without permission or authorisation. It took the jury seven-and-a-half hours to convict Henderson by a majority verdict. He will be sentenced on 12 November. Lawyers speaking on behalf of Sala's family said Henderson's convictions were welcomed but his actions were only ""one piece of the puzzle"" of how the plane came to crash. Search for answers over Sala death continues Emiliano Sala's body was recovered, but David Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, has never been found Argentine striker Sala and Mr Ibbotson died after their single-engine Piper Malibu plunged into the English Channel on a flight between Cardiff and Nantes in January 2019, set up by Henderson withfootball agent William ""Willie"" McKay. The footballer was involved in a Â£15m transfer to Cardiff City from Nantes and was travelling between the two cities at the time of his death. The court heard how Ibbotson, who regularly flew for Henderson, did not hold a commercial pilot's licence, a qualification to fly at night, and his rating to fly the single-engine Piper Malibu had expired. Sala's dad dies three months after son Emiliano Sala: Numerous errors led to fatal plane crash Henderson had asked Mr Ibbotson to fly the plane as he was away on holiday with his wife in Paris. Just moments after finding out the plane had gone down, Henderson texted a number of people telling them to stay silent, warning it would ""open a can of worms"", the jury was told. The father-of-three and former RAF officer admitted in court he had feared an investigation into his business dealings. Emiliano Sala was on board a plane bound for Cardiff from Nantes when it disappeared from radar Prosecutor Martin Goudie QC said Henderson had been ""reckless or negligent"" in the way he operated the plane, by putting his business above the safety of passengers. Mr Goudie said Henderson had created a culture of breaching the air navigation regulations among the pilots he hired. Fay Keely, who owned the plane, had told Henderson not to allow Mr Ibbotson to pilot the plane again after being contacted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) about two airspace infringements he had committed. Despite this, Henderson allowed Mr Ibbotson to continue flying, and his message to the pilot read: ""We both have an opportunity to make money out of the business model but not if we upset clients or draw the attention of the CAA."" Henderson did not have the permit needed to fly passengers in the American plane, or an Air Operator Certificate (AOC), which was also required. Mr Goudie accused Henderson of lying in his statements to investigators, and of running a ""cowboy outfit"" after questioning him over failings to keep basic information on his pilots. In his closing speech, he claimed Henderson ran an ""incompetent, undocumented and dishonest organisation"". However Stephen Spence QC, defending, had said his client's actions were ""purely a paperwork issue"" and had not led to a likelihood of danger. He said his client knew Mr Ibbotson, who had been flying for decades, was an experienced pilot. Mr Spence told the court the only difference between a commercial licence and the private licence held by Mr Ibbotson was whether you could carry passengers for money or not, rather than ability. Henderson also argued on the stand that he had phoned Ms Keely after she forbade Mr Ibbotson from flying and convinced her to let him pilot again. Ms Keely said she does not remember such a call. The Sala family say they want full disclosure, so ""no family goes through a similar preventable death"" BBC Wales understands that Cardiff City FC welcomes the verdict and hopes that the outcome will provide a sense of justice and closure to the families. Daniel Machover, of Hickman & Rose solicitors, representing the Sala family, said in a statement after the verdict: ""Mr Henderson's convictions are welcome and we hope the CAA will ensure that illegal flights of this kind are stopped. ""The actions of David Henderson are only one piece in the puzzle of how the plane David Ibbotson was illegally flying came to crash into the sea on 21 January 2019. ""We still do not know the key information about the maintenance history of the aircraft and all the factors behind the carbon monoxide poisoning revealed in August 2019 by AAIB. ""The answers to these questions can only be properly established at Emiliano's inquest, which is due to start in February next year."" The statement added that the Sala family ""fervently hope"" all involved in the inquest, including Piper Aircraft Inc and the AAIB, would provide full disclosure of material. ""Only if that happens will Emiliano's family finally know the truth about this tragedy enabling all the lessons to be learned, so that no family goes through a similar preventable death,"" it said. This video can not be played Football writer Ian Herbert says the trial showed ""the rather sordid way that people were creaming off money"" from Sala's transfer Kate Staples, the UK CAA's general counsel, extended sympathies to families and friends affected by the fatal crash. ""Aviation safety relies upon the integrity of everyone involved in the industry,"" she said. ""Unlawful and unsafe activity such as Mr Henderson's is unacceptable and the UK Civil Aviation Authority will always look to prosecute illegal activity."" Kevin Ducksbury, the chairman of the Air Charter Association (ACA), said the trade body was ""deeply dismayed"" that ""so many fundamental safety rules, and basic rules of airmanship were disregarded and broken"" in this case. ""The ruling confirms that Mr Henderson arranged and coordinated this flight illegally, in which footballer Emiliano Sala tragically lost his life. ""The association is profoundly disturbed that this flight was allowed to happen but welcomes the UK CAA's representation in this case,"" he said. Mr Ducksbury added that the ACA would continue its work to educate the public and wider aviation community, with it's primary cause to stamp out illegal transport.

"Mark Zuckerberg has been a leading voice on the metaverse Facebook has changed its corporate name to Meta as part of a major rebrand. The company said it would better ""encompass"" what it does, as it broadens its reach beyond social media into areas like virtual reality (VR). The change does not apply to its individual platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, only the parent company that owns them. The move follows a series of negative stories about Facebook, based on documents leaked by an ex-employee. Frances Haugen has accused the company of putting ""profits over safety"". In 2015, Google restructured its company calling its parent firm Alphabet, however, the name has not caught on. What is a metaverse? Facebook to hire 10,000 in EU to work on metaverse Facebook is making hate worse, whistleblower says Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg announced the new name as he unveiled plans to build a ""metaverse"" - an online world where people can game, work and communicate in a virtual environment, often using VR headsets. He said the existing brand could not ""possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future"", and needed to change. This video can not be played Watch: The moment Facebook became Meta ""Over time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company and I want to anchor our work and our identity on what we're building towards,"" he told a virtual conference. ""We're now looking at and reporting on our business as two different segments, one for our family of apps, and one for our work on future platforms. ""And as part of this, it is time for us to adopt a new company brand to encompass everything that we do, to reflect who we are and what we hope to build."" The company also unveiled a new sign at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on Thursday, replacing its thumbs-up ""Like"" logo with a blue infinity shape. Mr Zuckerberg said the new name reflects that over time, users will not need to use Facebook to use the company's other services. The word ""meta"" comes from the Greek word meaning ""beyond"". To an outsider, a metaverse may look like a version of VR, but some people believe it could be the future of the internet. Instead of being on a computer, people in a metaverse might use a headset to enter a virtual world connecting all sorts of digital environments. It is hoped the virtual world could be used for practically anything from work, play and concerts, to socialising with friends and family. Facebook said it intends to start trading its shares under the new stock ticker MVRS from 1 December. The company has had multiple hits to its reputation, with The Washington Post today reporting thatFacebook withheld important information about vaccine misinformation,externalfrom policymakers during the pandemic. It was the latest in a series of stories based on internal documents leaked by ex-employee Ms Haugen to the media. Among other things, the reports have claimed Facebook sat on research that showed Instagram harmed teenage mental health, and struggled to remove hate speech from its platforms outside the US. Mr Zuckerberg has described the reports as a ""coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company"". Trying to name a company is difficult. Zuckerberg says he's chosen Meta, because of its meaning in Greek - ""beyond"". It also alludes to the ""Metaverse"", an online virtual oasis that he wants to build. Here's why Facebook, might have a problem with getting everyone to call them Meta. Firstly, the move looks like Facebook is trying to divert attention away from the trove of negative stories hanging around the company. Critics believe Facebook has done this because the brand has become toxic. We've already seen Senators ignore the name change, with one describing the move as ""cosmetic"". Secondly, the ""Metaverse"" doesn't yet exist. Zuckerberg was keen to stress it was a long-term product. So having a name totally unrelated to your main offering is perhaps a littleâ¦strange. Almost all of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising from Facebook and Instagram. And thirdly, we know that other Big Tech rebrands have failed. Almost no one refers to Google as ""Alphabet"", the name it rebranded itself to in 2015. What is clear is that running Instagram and Facebook is no longer Mr Zuckerberg's passion. He is interested in creating virtual worlds, that he thinks will transform the human experience. The constant criticism of how he runs his social media companies must be draining. This restructure may give him the ability to focus more on the segments of the company that excite him. The division makes sense in that respect. However, we'll have to wait and see whether people will go along with it. Facebook to hire 10,000 in EU to work on metaverse Apparently, it's the next big thing. What is the metaverse?

"Professor Kathleen Stock has been at the centre of a row over transphobia A professor accused of transphobia for her views on gender identity is quitting her post at the University of Sussex. Philosophy professor Kathleen Stock, who rejects the claim, said she would be leaving after ""a horrible time"" and ""difficult few years"". Earlier this month an anonymous group launched a campaign to get her sacked. The university had defended Prof Stock, saying its staffhave the right ""to say and believe what they think"". The academic said on Twitter: ""This has been an absolutely horrible time for me and my family. I'm putting it behind me now."" She also said she was glad to see the university upholding that bullying and harassment in the workplace was unacceptable. Prof Stock, who recently published a book questioning the idea that gender identity is more ""socially significant"" than biological sex, rejects the claim that she or her work is transphobic. Posters calling for her to be fired were reportedly put up near the campus, and an image emerged on social media of a campaigner holding a banner saying ""Stock Out"". In January, hundreds of academics criticised the decision to make Prof Stock an OBE for services to higher education in the New Year Honours. In the open letter, the philosophers condemned academics who use their status to ""further gender oppression"" and said they denounced ""transphobia in all its forms"". In an email to staff on Thursday, vice-chancellor of the university - Professor Adam Tickell - said: ""We had hoped that Professor Stock would feel able to return to work, and we would have supported her to do so. ""She has decided that recent events have meant that this will not be possible, and we respect and understand that decision."" Higher and further education minister Michelle Donelan said: ""It is absolutely appalling that the toxic environment at the University of Sussex has made it untenable for Professor Kathleen Stock to continue in her position there. No academic should ever have to fear for their personal safety. ""The sustained campaign of harassment and intimidation she has faced is deplorable and the situation should never have got this far.""

"About 1,400 miners were arrested and more than 500 were convicted during the strike A new bill to pardon miners convicted of offences relating to the strike action in the 1980s has been published by the Scottish government. Justice Secretary Keith Brown said the legislation would go ""some way"" to aid reconciliation and to help heal wounds in mining communities.Â About 1,400 miners were arrested and more than 500 were convicted during the national dispute. The pardon will also apply to miners who have died since the 1984-85 strike. The Miners' Strike (Pardons) (Scotland) Bill follows an independent review into the impact of policing on Scottish communities during the strike. The review, led by human rights lawyer John Scott QC, recommended that the Scottish government introduced legislation to pardon miners convicted of certain offences, such as breach of the peace. The decades-old feud that still divides communities Mr Brown said the miners' strike had been one of the ""most bitter and divisive industrial disputes in living memory"". ""This new draft legislation will go some way to aid reconciliation - and to help heal wounds within Scotland's mining communities,"" he said. ""A collective pardon will restore dignity to those convicted, provide comfort to their families and, I hope, will bring closure to the sense of injustice members of mining communities may feel. ""I am determined to make swift progress on this matter, given the passage of time since 1984-85, which is why we have acted quickly to bring forward and publish this landmark new bill."" However, former miner George Purcell, who was arrested at Bilston Glen Colliery in Midlothian during the strike, said the new legislation was a ""token gesture"". ""It [the pardon] maybe resolves one of the injustices that were laid against the miners, but it doesn't involve the financial loss - the major injustice that was put against miners that weren't reinstated,"" he said. Mr Purcell was dismissed from his job after being convicted of breach of the peace and toldBBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programmehe had missed out on five years' of work and compensation when the colliery finally closed. ""We were involved in an industrial dispute to try and protect our communities and save jobs. We didn't think that the whole of the state machinery would be put against us,"" he said. ""When you think of a minor offence like breach of the peace over 37 years ago. Fined Â£400 and barred from going near the colliery... that was excessive and extreme."" George Purcell, pictured at Bilston Colliery in 1972, said the pardon amounted to a ""token gesture"" from the Scottish government The bill will not cast doubt on decisions made by courts at the time and does not quash convictions. Millions of people protested against pit closures during the industrial dispute with Margaret Thatcher's government. Throughout the summer of 1984 there were violent clashes between striking miners and police, whose numbers often ran into several hundred at each confrontation. Violence led to widespread use of the breach of the peace charge. The review found that most of the miners' actions would be unlikely to result in prosecution today.

"This video can not be played River levels rise in Hawick after heavy downpours hit the Scottish Borders Two bridges have been ""washed away"" and a number of homes have been flooded in Dumfries and Galloway. Several properties in Dalbeattie were inundated while two footbridges in Annan collapsed as waters rose on Thursday evening. The rail line between Carlisle and Dumfries has been closed while Network Rail carries out safety checks on the Annan viaduct. Police said it was the worst flooding in the region for a number of years. Earlier a major incident was declared in Hawick amid fears that up to 500 properties could be affected by flooding in the Borders town. But the council confirmed the alert was over as river levels, which peaked at 2.9m, started to fall after 19:30. Residents who had been evacuated were told it was safe to return to their homes. The conditions also led to the closure of schools and travel disruption in the south and west of Scotland. Water levels were high in Hawick Schools closed early in Peebles following flooding NHS Borders earlier closed Teviot Health Centre in Hawick and all services that operate within the building.Â Meanwhile, the council reopened the rest centre at Teviotdale Leisure Centre on Thursday afternoon to provide assistance to those displaced by the risk of flooding. The flooding situation in Peebles was also very serious and all schools in the area closed early.

"UK government plans to reform alcohol taxation might not apply in Northern Ireland due to the protocol. The new system, due to start in 2023,will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has pointed out that EU rules on alcohol duty continue to apply in Northern Ireland. IFS associate director David Phillips said the structure of alcohol taxes in NI must still conform to EU rules. The protocolkeeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goodsand as part of that EU excise duty rules continue to apply. The EU sets a minimum rate of tax for alcoholic drinks but it is open to member states to apply tax at a rate higher than the minimum. More relevant to Chancellor Rishi Sunak's proposed reforms is the structure of EU alcohol duties. In simple terms, it means that wine or cider cannot be taxed in proportion to their alcohol content but beers and spirits can be. Prosecco and pint taxes to fall, red wine to rise Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem The chancellor is proposing to change to a system which would mean higher taxes on fortified wines, like Buckfast, and lower taxes on lighter wines, like rose. Mr Phillips suggested the government could apply some of the reforms in Northern Ireland or separate the Northern Ireland and Great Britain alcohol tax regimes. But he added that could ""further entrench the checks and complexity for trade in alcohol products"". The protocol does make a provision that the EU and UK may review the application of excise duty rules to take into account ""Northern Ireland's integral place in the UK's internal market"". That implies that some sort of special arrangement could be negotiated. The treasury consultation document on the reform says: ""Government is aware that under Article 8 of the Northern Ireland Protocol this directive and other EU legislation continue to apply in Northern Ireland. ""Accordingly, the government has announced in its command paper of 21 July 2021 that it is seeking a more flexible settlement regarding excise laws applicable in Northern Ireland. ""The government will continue to discuss the application of these reforms to Northern Ireland with the EU during the consultation period of the review.""

"This video can not be played With 76 turbines in operation, Wales' largest onshore wind farm needs constant upkeep. Buying fruit and vegetables out of season should be seen as a luxury in future, Wales' climate change minister has said. It comes as part of a major new strategy to tackle Wales' carbon footprint and encourage people live more environmentally-friendly lives. People are being asked to cut energy use, drive less and buy local food. The Welsh government said a ""decade of action"" was required to meet climate change targets. It comes as ministers prepare to travel to Glasgow for the COP26 summit. They said their new plan was the start of a ""journey"" towards a net zero economy by the middle of the century. But it focuses specifically on the period between 2021 and 2025, when a 37% reduction in planet-warming gases is required to meet the Welsh government's second carbon budget. The measures will cost an estimated Â£4.2bn to implement over five years. How are we doing with cutting emissions? Should I buy an electric vehicle? What can you do to reduce your carbon footprint? Wales' Climate Change Minister Julie James toldRadio Wales Breakfast: ""If you're buying oranges out of season, they should be a luxury treat, not something you take for granted. ""With our global supply chains, we've lost track of that. ""It keeps our local farmers happy, local industries working well and makes our world a more sustainable place for our children and our grandchildren."" Every citizen, community, group and business in Wales is being asked ""to embed the climate emergency in the way they think, work, play and travel"". But what does the plan say? We can help reduce emissions by changing how we use gas and electricity at home Greenhouse gas emissions from power stations will be ""virtually"" eliminated by 2035, the Welsh government claims. New fossil fuel plants have been banned, and gas generation will be phased out. Only stations that have managed to install carbon capture technology will be able to continue to operate after 2035. The vision is for a ""high renewables system"" - so more wind farms, solar power and tidal schemes. New targets for green energy are to be set out - but are not in this plan. Households are encouraged to do the basics to save power like switching off lights, taking up the offer of a smart meter and choosing the most energy-efficient appliances. Taking public transport instead of driving a car is one way of reducing your carbon footprint Wales has struggled to make a dent in its emissions from transport - with just a 6% fall since 1990. Ministers want 35% of trips to be taken by walking, cycling or public transport by 2025, and 39% by 2030. They are also targeting a 10% cut in the number of car miles travelled per person by the end of the decade. ""Major investment"" to make public transport more attractive is promised. By 2025 all new-build affordable homes in Wales will be fitted with green technologies so they do not produce emissions. The government expects private developers to adopt its net zero standards too. But decarbonising Wales' 1.43 million existing homes is the real challenge - the government says about 148,000 will have received retrofit measures to make them more energy efficient by 2025. Michael Leach says he is proud to be part of a greener future The 2020s will be spent working with industry, ""developing and scaling up"" options such as carbon-capture and storage technology and hydrogen fuel. Ministers said this would help them understand how feasible these were - and that it was important to focus on behavioural changes in the meantime. High above the Rhondda at Pen y Cymoedd - the largest onshore windfarm in Wales - they've been eagerly awaiting the plan's details. ""We are running out of time to really take action on climate change,"" said Berry Jordan, of Vattenfall UK. ""We need to work out what the activities are that help us meet net zero and decarbonise our lives and work - from powering our cars, to heating our houses - all of that needs to move to other systems and so we've all got to embrace change."" Turbine technician Michael Leach said he was pleased to be employed in a job that was ""part of the green future that we have to come to accept"". ""It's great to know that we've got job security here - it's a good job to have, especially in south Wales,"" he added. There are 9.5 million sheep and lambs in Wales and 1.1 million cattle and calves, which add to greenhouse gas emissions Over the next 20 years the ambition is to get people eating more healthily and sustainably. This means ""a substantial increase in fruit and vegetables and a decrease in red and processed meats and dairy products"" the plan says. The government says changes in behaviour by consumers and farmers could release some land from agriculture. It wants 10% of farming land to be ""shared"" by 2050 - so new trees and hedgerows can be planted. 43,000 hectares (106,255 acres) of new woodland is to be planted by 2030, and 180,000 hectares (444,789 acres) by 2050. People should buy oranges out of season ""as a luxury treat"" and not take them for granted, says minister Councils, health boards and other government-backed bodies will be expected to publish plans by 2023 that could see them reach net zero by 2030. There are plans to force businesses to recycle more to help Wales getfrom thirdto the top of global leader boards on tackling waste. A wide range of single-use plastics are to be banned. While the scale of the challenge ""cannot be under-estimated"", it will lead to highly skilled and well-paid jobs and opportunities to redeploy employees from traditional industries, the government said. The plan pulls together 123 policies and proposals, though very few are new announcements. Throughout the document, ministers call on the UK government to take action to ""to unlock a green future in Wales"". Government advisers have said that by 2050, around 60% of the changes needed in Wales are in areas under the UK government's control - from subsidies to encourage the take up of electric vehicles, to upgrading the National Grid. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""While the UK cannot reach its targets without Welsh action, we cannot reach our ambition without the UK government playing its fair part. ""We believe that by working together and taking collective action we can deliver a stronger, fairer and greener Wales for future generations.""

"Top oil executives are testifying before Congress amid accusations their companies misled the public about climate change Democrat lawmakers say the industry spent decades denying its products' role in global warming ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell bosses all deny approving any climate disinformation campaigns The hearings open a year of investigations into energy giants, Democrats say They also come days before world leaders gather in Glasgow for the UN's COP26 climate conference World leaders will be pressed in Glasgow on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce warming Edited by Vicky Baker We're now closing our live coverage - thanks for staying with us! Just to recap - here are some key points:  Our live coverage was brought to you by BBC teams in Washington DC and London: Deirdre Finnerty, Vicky Baker, Max Matza, Yaroslav Lukov, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Sam Cabral and Jack Hunter.  Chairwoman Maloney concludes her remarks by saying subpoenas - forcing the companies to turn over internal documents - will be issued against them. Six weeks ago, the committee requested documents from the energy companies testifying today, says Maloney. But instead of submitting the documents, the companies ""produced reams of other documents, many of which are publicly available"". One company, she says, sent 1,500 pages of documents from their own website. ""Nearly all the companies failed to turn over board materials the committee needs to determine corporate strategies on climate change,"" she says. But so far they have ""not produced any internal documents or internal communications"" from the highest ranking executives. Instead, the companies employed their familiar tactic of ""delay and obstruction,"" she says, adding: ""Well, that ends today."" ""I intend to issues subpoenas to the fossil fuel industry representatives here today,"" says Maloney. ""I do not take this step lightly, she says, adding that her action is to ""rescue this planet and save it for our children"". The panel's top Democrat Carolyn Maloney is giving her closing remarks now. She says the meeting was productive, because the world's top oil executives now ""finally admit that climate change is real, that burning fossil fuels is causing it, and that we must act urgently to fix it"". ""But I was disappointed that we also heard much of the denial and deflection that we've heard before,"" she continues. ""Today's witnesses refused to take responsibility for a decades long misinformation campaign."" She goes on to attack the companies for not backing electric vehicles, and for continuing to work with the American Petroleum Institute lobbying firm. ""So I see no choice but to continue our committee's investigation until we see the truth,"" she adds. As the committee hearing closes, Kentucky's James Cormer - the top Republican on the panel - reminds Americans that ""Republicans care about climate too"". ""We care about the climate. But we also wanna work with the private sector to reduce emissions and continue to create good paying jobs,"" he says. Comer also says the most predictable thing about the hearing was seeing Democrats attacking energy firms for making a profit. Ilhan Omar Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar begins by making a claim we've heard several times today - that energy companies paid front companies to push for policies friendly to fossil fuels. She continues by reading from an ExxonMobil ""action plan"" from the early 1990s, which says that ""victory will be achieved"", when the public is confused about the causes of climate change. She says the goal of this project was to ""inject doubt and uncertainty into the climate debate"". ""The fossil fuel industry worked collectively to prevent action on climate change. They co-ordinated their campaigns with outside groups,"" says Omar, accusing lobbying organisations of participating in a conspiracy. She adds that in 2020, energy companies donated $139m to lawmakers. She notes that around 85% were Republicans, ""and mostly climate deniers"", and calls for energy companies to keep their money out of politics. ""It seems you all have achieved that victory of leading the public with disinformation,"" she says, sarcastically congratulating them. ""I hope you are ashamed of the future you have contributed for your children and ours, and I ask you all to resign,"" she ends. Advocates of the climate package protest in London last month The Green New Deal keeps coming up today. First introduced in 2019, the bill is modelled after the vast investment projects of the New Deal that helped lift America out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. It has the backing of a number of notable progressive Democrats, but has not attracted mainstream support within the party. Republicans are uniformly opposed to it. The New Green Deal proposes a number of radical steps, most notably the 10-year decarbonisation of the US economy. lt calls for all existing and new buildings to be upgraded to achieve maximum energy efficiency, and for transportation methods and infrastructure to be overhauled. However, it goes well beyond questions of climate change, also calling for employment protections for family and medical leave, and more. Many observers believe that the programme is high on ambition but is not a practical plan to tackle climate change. Missouri Democrat Cori Bush accuses the companies of racism, asking whether their facilities are primarily built in black communities. ""I wouldn't know how to answer that,"" begins Shell Oil Company CEO Gretchen Watkins. ""They are,"" interrupts Bush. She goes on to ask how many energy executive are black. One CEO says he assumes that few are, which Bush agrees with. She also accuses Shell of writing a report saying that ""low-lying areas such as Bangladesh may need to be abandoned"" due to climate change, and ends her remarks by calling on the witnesses to all resign in disgrace. Neal Crabtree, a welder who was put out of work after his pipeline project was cancelled by President Biden, is asked to characterise the Democrats' position on energy production. Crabtree was invited by Republicans as a witness. ""I'm gonna support whichever party puts me to work,"" says Crabtree, adding: ""This president has put me out of work."" The witness goes on to say that he wishes Donald Trump was still president. The Republican ranking committee member, Kentucky Congressman James Cormer, says he completely agrees. Massachusetts Democrat Ayanna Pressley - a member of the so-called ""Squad"" of young female representatives - is now asking questions. She says the energy companies, if left unchecked, ""will sink entire communities"" in the Boston area that she represents. ""My constituents are living in regions that would be completely underwater"", if zero-emissions plans are not enacted, she says. She then asks each CEO what percentage of their funds are being used to retrain their employees for green projects. When each CEO begin to answer, without providing the actual percentages, Pressley cuts them off. The divide between Democrats and Republicans continues to show, as Representative Jake LaTurner - from Kansas - takes the floor to defend the American oil sector. He says the concern of the committee hearing today constitutes ""climate misinformation"" on the part of Democrats. He speaks of an ""energy crisis"" and accuses the Biden administration of undermining the country's ""energy independence"" with its policies. ""Dependence on Russia and China to fuel our country's baseload and power our electric grid is a national security threat and does nothing to mitigate carbon emissions globally,"" he says, describing the oil and gas produced in America as ""among the cleanest and safest in the world"". He says ""the data proves the private sector is tackling climate change"" and urges congress to allow them to do so without ""burdensome federal regulation"". Florida Democrat Debbie Wasserman Shultz starts her questioning by referring to her state as ""ground zero"" for climate change. ""It's not a someday thing, it's a right now thing,"" she says. She goes on to grill the CEOs and lobbyists about how much they have spent to defeat President Biden's proposed Build Back Better Act. When the CEOs say they don't have the information on hand, she accuses them of being bad at their jobs. The proposed legislation is currently weighing whether to include a penalty for energy producers that leak methane into the atmosphere. ""You're either lying about your support for reducing methane emissions or you are working against yourself, which makes no sense,"" Wasserman Shultz adds. When oil lobbyist Mike Sommers tries to correct her, she interrupts him, saying ""the time is mine"". Democrats are continuing to rail against energy companies for not moving quickly enough to wean the US economy off fossil fuels. Republicans, meanwhile, are focusing their comments on Democrats - who they say are trying to sabotage the American energy sector. Arizona Republican Andy Biggs, who asked no questions during his allotted five minutes, told the CEOs: ""You've been brought here so they can beat the crap out of you. ""And they've done it for political reasons. That's the shame of it all."" He goes on to say the Democrats ""would regulate you right out of business if they could."" ""That's the purpose of this hearing today,"" he adds. ""To lay the foundation to get rid of you."" Oil lobbyist Mike Sommers American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers is asked about the energy crisis affecting Europe right now. He calls what's happening there a ""flashing warning sign"" for the US and other countries. Sommers calls the issue ""mainly a consequence of a lack of supply."" ""They are going to continue to need more energy as their economy grows,"" he says of European countries. Sommers goes on to blame the lack of supply on Russia, for deciding not export its own fossil fuels. He calls the situation ""a warning for the world that if you don't create your own supply at home, you are dependent on supplies from regimes that don't necessarily have your interests at heart."" It comes after a Republican on the panel of accused Democrats of seeking to sabotage American energy independence, and instead rely on oil from ""Venezuela and Iran"". Florida Republican Andrew Clyde ended his question with a warning that Russia is ""willing to use energy as a weapon"". Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - known in the US by her initials AOC - is now speaking. She is a key backer of the so-called Green New Deal to overhaul how Americans consume energy. She begins by taking issue with a recent statement made by American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers in a news interview, in which he said they are ""making every effort"" to lobby for oil production. AOC says $56m has been spent by the group just this year on their lobbying efforts. Sommers takes issue with her characterisation of his remarks, saying the group advocates for American energy workers. She then turns to ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, taking issue with his involvement in congressional infrastructure negotiations. She says that Americans are now forced to ""live with the future that you all are setting on fire for us"". The congresswoman used rice and candy to illustrate her point California Democrat Katie Porter starts by showing Shell's 2020 annual spending report, which she represents with a jar of candy. The report shows that Shell plans to spend between $19-22bn in the near term. Each M&M candy, she says, represents $50m. Porter's point is that Shell plans to spend about six times more on future fossil fuel production, rather than green energy. Gretchen Watkins, the Shell CEO, is asked to confirm the company's future spending plans. Watkins responds: ""What I can tell you is that there needs to be both a demand and a supply of clean energy."" She says Shell is ""working closely with customers to increase that demand over time."" Later, Porter uses sacks of rice, seen on the video feed in the boot of her car, to illustrate the acres of land held by energy companies. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check There have been some uncomfortable moments for the oil executives during this hearing, but what has been most notable â and unsurprising â has been the extent of the political divide. Democrats have been criticising the fossil fuel industry for misleading the American public, and asking for pledges which the executives have been unwilling to make. Republicans have been defending the industry, and asking why the United States should be acting to limit the use of fossil fuels when some other countries are increasing it. There have been flashes of real anger on both sides. But it feels like another political skirmish in what will be a long battle about the pace of the energy transition in the United States. A car mechanic shop in Baton Rouge, Louisiana ""It's insane what my colleagues across the aisle are putting these good American men and women through,"" says Louisiana Congressman Clay Higgins. He accuses the Democrat-led committee of ""attacking American workers as our country dissolves around us."" ""Do you pledge to endeavour to continue leading the world in emissions reductions and providing abundant affordable energy through innovations?"" he asks the CEOs. Each CEO answers that they will, with many adding that they are already working on green energy solutions. Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, says ""I'm even going to bother to ask"" about the shell groups that the energy companies work with to lobby for their products. She says that the adverts for oil companies seen on Facebook don't bear the names of Chevron, BP, etc. The adverts are ""lies plain and simple"", she says accusing the company of making millions last year ""poisoning the planet"". ""Congresswoman, I am not exactly following,"" says CEO Michael Wirth. Tlaib tells him to submit his response for the record in writing later after he says ""you've been provided with some inaccurate information"". Tlaib goes on to say the company owes over $50bn in 31 countries for environmental damage. ""There are more of us than there are of you,"" says Tlaib. ""You can poison the planet to make money. But we will defend the planet so we can live."" Much of the information Congress is relying on to make these
allegations is already in the public domain. For years, researchers and
lawyers have been sifting through the now publicly available internal memos of
oil companies to build a picture of who knew what about climate change and
when. They say the picture that emerges is clear. As far back as 1981, Exxon
employees were making projections for how warm the earth would become if we
continued to burn fossil fuels. Yet instead of making this research public, the ""Exxon Position"" was to ""emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions"" regarding climate change, according to a 1988 internal memo. Researchers say oil companies spread doubt about
climate change by creating think tanks or groups that appeared to be made up of
independent scientists, but were really designed and funded by oil. One such
group in 1991 planned to ""Reposition global warming as theory (not
fact)"". When the hearing is finished, you can read Phoebe Keane's deep-dive on ""How the oil industry made us doubt climate change"" andlisten to the podcast series Democrat John Sarbanes turns to the Chevron CEO Michael Wirth, saying that he ""touted"" his support for the Paris climate agreement in his opening statement. But, he adds, ""we know what it looks like when you company really cares about a federal initiative and wants it to succeed"". Sarbanes says that lobbying financial disclosures show that Chevron spent zero dollars on lobbying in favour of the climate agreement. The company, he says, filed 144 disclosure forms showing lobbying for corporate tax breaks. ""Chevron has spent more 54m on lobbying on a lot of other things since 2015,"" says Sarbanes. ""So clearly when your company cares about an issue you lobby on it."" Asked about the financial disclosures, Mr Wirth says he is not familiar with the exact numbers. The CEO's have so far barely been able to get in any answers, as many Democrats focus on getting out as many questions as possible during their five minutes of questioning. Republicans have used much of their time to slam the Democrats for their efforts to boost the green energy sector, at the expense of the fossil fuel industry.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Top oil executives are testifying before Congress amid accusations their companies misled the public about climate change Democrat lawmakers say the industry spent decades denying its products' role in global warming ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell bosses all deny approving any climate disinformation campaigns The hearings open a year of investigations into energy giants, Democrats say They also come days before world leaders gather in Glasgow for the UN's COP26 climate conference World leaders will be pressed in Glasgow on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce warming Edited by Vicky Baker We're now closing our live coverage - thanks for staying with us! Just to recap - here are some key points:  Our live coverage was brought to you by BBC teams in Washington DC and London: Deirdre Finnerty, Vicky Baker, Max Matza, Yaroslav Lukov, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Sam Cabral and Jack Hunter.  Chairwoman Maloney concludes her remarks by saying subpoenas - forcing the companies to turn over internal documents - will be issued against them. Six weeks ago, the committee requested documents from the energy companies testifying today, says Maloney. But instead of submitting the documents, the companies ""produced reams of other documents, many of which are publicly available"". One company, she says, sent 1,500 pages of documents from their own website. ""Nearly all the companies failed to turn over board materials the committee needs to determine corporate strategies on climate change,"" she says. But so far they have ""not produced any internal documents or internal communications"" from the highest ranking executives. Instead, the companies employed their familiar tactic of ""delay and obstruction,"" she says, adding: ""Well, that ends today."" ""I intend to issues subpoenas to the fossil fuel industry representatives here today,"" says Maloney. ""I do not take this step lightly, she says, adding that her action is to ""rescue this planet and save it for our children"". The panel's top Democrat Carolyn Maloney is giving her closing remarks now. She says the meeting was productive, because the world's top oil executives now ""finally admit that climate change is real, that burning fossil fuels is causing it, and that we must act urgently to fix it"". ""But I was disappointed that we also heard much of the denial and deflection that we've heard before,"" she continues. ""Today's witnesses refused to take responsibility for a decades long misinformation campaign."" She goes on to attack the companies for not backing electric vehicles, and for continuing to work with the American Petroleum Institute lobbying firm. ""So I see no choice but to continue our committee's investigation until we see the truth,"" she adds. As the committee hearing closes, Kentucky's James Cormer - the top Republican on the panel - reminds Americans that ""Republicans care about climate too"". ""We care about the climate. But we also wanna work with the private sector to reduce emissions and continue to create good paying jobs,"" he says. Comer also says the most predictable thing about the hearing was seeing Democrats attacking energy firms for making a profit. Ilhan Omar Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar begins by making a claim we've heard several times today - that energy companies paid front companies to push for policies friendly to fossil fuels. She continues by reading from an ExxonMobil ""action plan"" from the early 1990s, which says that ""victory will be achieved"", when the public is confused about the causes of climate change. She says the goal of this project was to ""inject doubt and uncertainty into the climate debate"". ""The fossil fuel industry worked collectively to prevent action on climate change. They co-ordinated their campaigns with outside groups,"" says Omar, accusing lobbying organisations of participating in a conspiracy. She adds that in 2020, energy companies donated $139m to lawmakers. She notes that around 85% were Republicans, ""and mostly climate deniers"", and calls for energy companies to keep their money out of politics. ""It seems you all have achieved that victory of leading the public with disinformation,"" she says, sarcastically congratulating them. ""I hope you are ashamed of the future you have contributed for your children and ours, and I ask you all to resign,"" she ends. Advocates of the climate package protest in London last month The Green New Deal keeps coming up today. First introduced in 2019, the bill is modelled after the vast investment projects of the New Deal that helped lift America out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. It has the backing of a number of notable progressive Democrats, but has not attracted mainstream support within the party. Republicans are uniformly opposed to it. The New Green Deal proposes a number of radical steps, most notably the 10-year decarbonisation of the US economy. lt calls for all existing and new buildings to be upgraded to achieve maximum energy efficiency, and for transportation methods and infrastructure to be overhauled. However, it goes well beyond questions of climate change, also calling for employment protections for family and medical leave, and more. Many observers believe that the programme is high on ambition but is not a practical plan to tackle climate change. Missouri Democrat Cori Bush accuses the companies of racism, asking whether their facilities are primarily built in black communities. ""I wouldn't know how to answer that,"" begins Shell Oil Company CEO Gretchen Watkins. ""They are,"" interrupts Bush. She goes on to ask how many energy executive are black. One CEO says he assumes that few are, which Bush agrees with. She also accuses Shell of writing a report saying that ""low-lying areas such as Bangladesh may need to be abandoned"" due to climate change, and ends her remarks by calling on the witnesses to all resign in disgrace. Neal Crabtree, a welder who was put out of work after his pipeline project was cancelled by President Biden, is asked to characterise the Democrats' position on energy production. Crabtree was invited by Republicans as a witness. ""I'm gonna support whichever party puts me to work,"" says Crabtree, adding: ""This president has put me out of work."" The witness goes on to say that he wishes Donald Trump was still president. The Republican ranking committee member, Kentucky Congressman James Cormer, says he completely agrees. Massachusetts Democrat Ayanna Pressley - a member of the so-called ""Squad"" of young female representatives - is now asking questions. She says the energy companies, if left unchecked, ""will sink entire communities"" in the Boston area that she represents. ""My constituents are living in regions that would be completely underwater"", if zero-emissions plans are not enacted, she says. She then asks each CEO what percentage of their funds are being used to retrain their employees for green projects. When each CEO begin to answer, without providing the actual percentages, Pressley cuts them off. The divide between Democrats and Republicans continues to show, as Representative Jake LaTurner - from Kansas - takes the floor to defend the American oil sector. He says the concern of the committee hearing today constitutes ""climate misinformation"" on the part of Democrats. He speaks of an ""energy crisis"" and accuses the Biden administration of undermining the country's ""energy independence"" with its policies. ""Dependence on Russia and China to fuel our country's baseload and power our electric grid is a national security threat and does nothing to mitigate carbon emissions globally,"" he says, describing the oil and gas produced in America as ""among the cleanest and safest in the world"". He says ""the data proves the private sector is tackling climate change"" and urges congress to allow them to do so without ""burdensome federal regulation"". Florida Democrat Debbie Wasserman Shultz starts her questioning by referring to her state as ""ground zero"" for climate change. ""It's not a someday thing, it's a right now thing,"" she says. She goes on to grill the CEOs and lobbyists about how much they have spent to defeat President Biden's proposed Build Back Better Act. When the CEOs say they don't have the information on hand, she accuses them of being bad at their jobs. The proposed legislation is currently weighing whether to include a penalty for energy producers that leak methane into the atmosphere. ""You're either lying about your support for reducing methane emissions or you are working against yourself, which makes no sense,"" Wasserman Shultz adds. When oil lobbyist Mike Sommers tries to correct her, she interrupts him, saying ""the time is mine"". Democrats are continuing to rail against energy companies for not moving quickly enough to wean the US economy off fossil fuels. Republicans, meanwhile, are focusing their comments on Democrats - who they say are trying to sabotage the American energy sector. Arizona Republican Andy Biggs, who asked no questions during his allotted five minutes, told the CEOs: ""You've been brought here so they can beat the crap out of you. ""And they've done it for political reasons. That's the shame of it all."" He goes on to say the Democrats ""would regulate you right out of business if they could."" ""That's the purpose of this hearing today,"" he adds. ""To lay the foundation to get rid of you."" Oil lobbyist Mike Sommers American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers is asked about the energy crisis affecting Europe right now. He calls what's happening there a ""flashing warning sign"" for the US and other countries. Sommers calls the issue ""mainly a consequence of a lack of supply."" ""They are going to continue to need more energy as their economy grows,"" he says of European countries. Sommers goes on to blame the lack of supply on Russia, for deciding not export its own fossil fuels. He calls the situation ""a warning for the world that if you don't create your own supply at home, you are dependent on supplies from regimes that don't necessarily have your interests at heart."" It comes after a Republican on the panel of accused Democrats of seeking to sabotage American energy independence, and instead rely on oil from ""Venezuela and Iran"". Florida Republican Andrew Clyde ended his question with a warning that Russia is ""willing to use energy as a weapon"". Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - known in the US by her initials AOC - is now speaking. She is a key backer of the so-called Green New Deal to overhaul how Americans consume energy. She begins by taking issue with a recent statement made by American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers in a news interview, in which he said they are ""making every effort"" to lobby for oil production. AOC says $56m has been spent by the group just this year on their lobbying efforts. Sommers takes issue with her characterisation of his remarks, saying the group advocates for American energy workers. She then turns to ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, taking issue with his involvement in congressional infrastructure negotiations. She says that Americans are now forced to ""live with the future that you all are setting on fire for us"". The congresswoman used rice and candy to illustrate her point California Democrat Katie Porter starts by showing Shell's 2020 annual spending report, which she represents with a jar of candy. The report shows that Shell plans to spend between $19-22bn in the near term. Each M&M candy, she says, represents $50m. Porter's point is that Shell plans to spend about six times more on future fossil fuel production, rather than green energy. Gretchen Watkins, the Shell CEO, is asked to confirm the company's future spending plans. Watkins responds: ""What I can tell you is that there needs to be both a demand and a supply of clean energy."" She says Shell is ""working closely with customers to increase that demand over time."" Later, Porter uses sacks of rice, seen on the video feed in the boot of her car, to illustrate the acres of land held by energy companies. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check There have been some uncomfortable moments for the oil executives during this hearing, but what has been most notable â and unsurprising â has been the extent of the political divide. Democrats have been criticising the fossil fuel industry for misleading the American public, and asking for pledges which the executives have been unwilling to make. Republicans have been defending the industry, and asking why the United States should be acting to limit the use of fossil fuels when some other countries are increasing it. There have been flashes of real anger on both sides. But it feels like another political skirmish in what will be a long battle about the pace of the energy transition in the United States. A car mechanic shop in Baton Rouge, Louisiana ""It's insane what my colleagues across the aisle are putting these good American men and women through,"" says Louisiana Congressman Clay Higgins. He accuses the Democrat-led committee of ""attacking American workers as our country dissolves around us."" ""Do you pledge to endeavour to continue leading the world in emissions reductions and providing abundant affordable energy through innovations?"" he asks the CEOs. Each CEO answers that they will, with many adding that they are already working on green energy solutions. Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, says ""I'm even going to bother to ask"" about the shell groups that the energy companies work with to lobby for their products. She says that the adverts for oil companies seen on Facebook don't bear the names of Chevron, BP, etc. The adverts are ""lies plain and simple"", she says accusing the company of making millions last year ""poisoning the planet"". ""Congresswoman, I am not exactly following,"" says CEO Michael Wirth. Tlaib tells him to submit his response for the record in writing later after he says ""you've been provided with some inaccurate information"". Tlaib goes on to say the company owes over $50bn in 31 countries for environmental damage. ""There are more of us than there are of you,"" says Tlaib. ""You can poison the planet to make money. But we will defend the planet so we can live."" Much of the information Congress is relying on to make these
allegations is already in the public domain. For years, researchers and
lawyers have been sifting through the now publicly available internal memos of
oil companies to build a picture of who knew what about climate change and
when. They say the picture that emerges is clear. As far back as 1981, Exxon
employees were making projections for how warm the earth would become if we
continued to burn fossil fuels. Yet instead of making this research public, the ""Exxon Position"" was to ""emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions"" regarding climate change, according to a 1988 internal memo. Researchers say oil companies spread doubt about
climate change by creating think tanks or groups that appeared to be made up of
independent scientists, but were really designed and funded by oil. One such
group in 1991 planned to ""Reposition global warming as theory (not
fact)"". When the hearing is finished, you can read Phoebe Keane's deep-dive on ""How the oil industry made us doubt climate change"" andlisten to the podcast series Democrat John Sarbanes turns to the Chevron CEO Michael Wirth, saying that he ""touted"" his support for the Paris climate agreement in his opening statement. But, he adds, ""we know what it looks like when you company really cares about a federal initiative and wants it to succeed"". Sarbanes says that lobbying financial disclosures show that Chevron spent zero dollars on lobbying in favour of the climate agreement. The company, he says, filed 144 disclosure forms showing lobbying for corporate tax breaks. ""Chevron has spent more 54m on lobbying on a lot of other things since 2015,"" says Sarbanes. ""So clearly when your company cares about an issue you lobby on it."" Asked about the financial disclosures, Mr Wirth says he is not familiar with the exact numbers.

"Professor Kathleen Stock has been at the centre of a row over transphobia A professor accused of transphobia for her views on gender identity is quitting her post at the University of Sussex. Philosophy professor Kathleen Stock, who rejects the claim, said she would be leaving after ""a horrible time"" and ""difficult few years"". Earlier this month an anonymous group launched a campaign to get her sacked. The university had defended Prof Stock, saying its staffhave the right ""to say and believe what they think"". The academic said on Twitter: ""This has been an absolutely horrible time for me and my family. I'm putting it behind me now."" She also said she was glad to see the university upholding that bullying and harassment in the workplace was unacceptable. Prof Stock, who recently published a book questioning the idea that gender identity is more ""socially significant"" than biological sex, rejects the claim that she or her work is transphobic. Posters calling for her to be fired were reportedly put up near the campus, and an image emerged on social media of a campaigner holding a banner saying ""Stock Out"". In January, hundreds of academics criticised the decision to make Prof Stock an OBE for services to higher education in the New Year Honours. In the open letter, the philosophers condemned academics who use their status to ""further gender oppression"" and said they denounced ""transphobia in all its forms"". In an email to staff on Thursday, vice-chancellor of the university - Professor Adam Tickell - said: ""We had hoped that Professor Stock would feel able to return to work, and we would have supported her to do so. ""She has decided that recent events have meant that this will not be possible, and we respect and understand that decision."" Higher and further education minister Michelle Donelan said: ""It is absolutely appalling that the toxic environment at the University of Sussex has made it untenable for Professor Kathleen Stock to continue in her position there. No academic should ever have to fear for their personal safety. ""The sustained campaign of harassment and intimidation she has faced is deplorable and the situation should never have got this far.""

Several properties in Dalbeattie were inundated while two footbridges in Annan collapsed as waters rose on Thursday evening. The rail line between Carlisle and Dumfries has been closed while Network Rail carries out safety checks on the Annan viaduct. Police said it was the worst flooding in the region for a number of years. Earlier a major incident was declared in Hawick amid fears that up to 500 properties could be affected by flooding in the Borders town. But the council confirmed the alert was over as river levels, which peaked at 2.9m, started to fall after 19:30. Residents who had been evacuated were told it was safe to return to their homes. The conditions also led to the closure of schools and travel disruption in the south and west of Scotland. Water levels were high in Hawick Schools closed early in Peebles following flooding NHS Borders earlier closed Teviot Health Centre in Hawick and all services that operate within the building.Â Meanwhile, the council reopened the rest centre at Teviotdale Leisure Centre on Thursday afternoon to provide assistance to those displaced by the risk of flooding.

"Millions of people are set to be worse off next year amid spiralling costs and tax rises, says an economic think tank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that inflation and higher taxes on incomes would negate small wage increases for middle earners. Low-income households will also feel ""real pain"" as the cost of living is set to increase faster than benefit payments, it said. The chancellor acknowledged in his Budget that families are under strain. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said that ""millions will be worse off in the short term"" as a result of soaring costs. On Wednesday, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years. Its latest forecast predicted that inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. The chancellor said it was because of increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories recover from coronavirus curbs. But the OBR pointed that supply constraints had been exacerbated by Brexit. It added that once rising prices and rising taxes are taken into account, average household incomes are set to fall next year and won't recover before 2023. In its analysis of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's second Budget of 2021, the IFS described the chancellor's delivery as ""upbeat"". But Mr Johnson added: ""Unfortunately for him, and for us, the outlook for living standards does not match this upbeat tone."" Over the next few years, increases to income tax and national insurance, paired with rising household bills, ""will mean very slow growth in living standards"", he said. Price rises could hit highest rate in 30 years Did you get what you wanted from the Budget? Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Do you earn around Â£25,000 a year? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. New IFS analysis suggests,externalthat over the next year, middle earners on about Â£25,000 will find their pre-tax pay just about outpaces price rises. But once extra income taxes are due, their take-home pay will fall by about 1%, or Â£180 per year, after accounting for inflation. That comes after an already tough decade for households, the IFS said. Had average earnings kept pace with trends seen before the financial crisis in 2008, they would have been 40% higher, its research found. Mr Sunak defended his Budget, telling BBC Breakfast that it had ""cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid"". On Wednesday, the chancellor announced that the universal credit ""taper"" rate would be cut by 8% no later than 1 December, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every Â£1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says universal credit is a ""hidden tax on work"" and the rate would fall by 1 December The National Living Wage will also increase next year by 6.6%, to Â£9.50 an hour. Mr Sunak added that it was his job to be concerned about inflation and his new fiscal rules were ""how we build up resilience"". But Paul Johnson said that price rises meant that ""real pain"" would now be felt, as low-income households, which it describes as those working full-time and earning the National Living Wage, wait for their incomes to catch up. ""For some in work, that may never happen,"" he said. After the political theatre of Budget Day, experts spend the following night and day backstage working out the impact on your household finances. The answer to that question, as always, depends on your stage and circumstances in life. If you are low-paid and in work, then the Budget had some comforting news for you - such as the minimum wage rises and universal credit changes - although that won't happen immediately. In contrast, middle-earners and those out of work are facing a more worrying squeeze. Pensioners, concerned about hefty rises in bills to heat their homes, are feeling a bit forgotten. For everyone, the next act is all about the cost of living. If prices rise at the top end of forecasts, then millions of people's financial situation could become quite a drama. Setting out his Budget on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said it marked a ""new age of optimism"", announcing across-the-board spending increases for government departments. But the fiscal event has also taken the UK's current tax burden to the highest level seen since the 1950s. Mr Sunak described ""corrective action"" as necessary in order to pay back huge sums of money, borrowed during the pandemic to fund support programmes such as the furlough scheme. But Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What he's done is use the pandemic as cover for what I think was probably necessary - a big increase in NHS spending, being funded by this increase in National Insurance contributions, and undoing some of the very big cuts we've seen to the justice, further education and school system over the last decade."" He pointed to the fact that the OBR has also reduced its estimate of the long-term ""scarring"" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%. He suggested that the chancellor might hope to undo some tax rises in the future. Mr Johnson also described the stagnation in living standards as ""a very important political point"" in a later interview with the BBC. ""If we're not getting better off over time, we're not going to feel so happy with the status quo,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Treasury said that the government is ""taking targeted action worth more than Â£4.2 billion a year to help families with the cost of living"". They described the decision to raise taxes as ""difficult"", but said that households would benefit from further investment in public services. They said government decisions such as freezes to alcohol and fuel duty and the warm home discount ""have been worth nearly Â£500 per year extra to households on average, and more than Â£1,000 for the poorest households"".

"The Cornelis Gert Jan, which is owned by MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, was detained when fishing in French waters A British trawler has been seized by France and another has been fined, amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. French maritime minister Annick Girardin said the ships were cautioned during checks off Le Havre overnight. She said the first did not comply right away and the second was not allowed to fish in French waters so was detained. No 10 said it was watching events closely and wanted France and EU talks but was ready to respond appropriately. Earlier, the environment secretary said he was ""urgently"" investigating the situation in relation to the detained vessel - which has been named as the Cornelis Gert Jan. Responding to an Urgent Commons Question from the SNP, George Eustice said the boat was on a list provided by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) initially provided to the European Union. He insisted the European Union did grant a licence to the vessel but it was ""unclear"" why, according to reports, it was subsequently withdrawn from the list. Mr Eustice said he was awaiting further details from Marine Scotland and was expecting a response in the ""next hour or so"". Deidre Brock, the SNP's environment spokesperson, said it was not good enough that the environment secretary had so little information. Jersey offers 162 fishing licences after ultimatum Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, which owns the Cornelis, said the crew of its vessel were ""in good spirits"" after it was ""ordered into a French port while legally fishing for scallop in French waters"". The captain was questioned after leaving the boat with French authorities and being given legal representation by the company. MacDuff Shellfish confirmed the captain had been released and returned to the ship, but the Cornelius was ""not at liberty to leave"" the port while the investigation was ongoing. The firm's Andrew Brown said the crew would remain on board until its release. He said Macduff's ""fishing activity [was] entirely legal"" and it appeared the Cornelis, based at Shoreham, in West Sussex, had been ""caught up"" in the ongoing UK-France post-Brexit fishing row. This video can not be played Watch: British trawler Cornelis Gert Jan is held in Le Havre. Mr Brown warned that without ""a speedy resolution"", the vessel's catch could be confiscated by the French authorities, and called on the UK government to ""defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet"". The firm would ""vigorously defend"" itself against any claims, but its ""priority concern"" was for the welfare of the vessel's crew, he said. Ms Girardin hadsaid on Twitter,externalthe trawler was found to be fishing in the Bay of Seine without the proper licences. The minister said checks on the British vessels were standard during the scallop fishing season. But she added they had also been undertaken against ""the backdrop of the tightening of controls in the Channel, in the context of discussions on licenses with the United Kingdom and the European Commission"". In naval parlance, this is called a shot across the bows. Technically, the French checks on UK trawlers in the Channel overnight do not form part of the raft of retaliatory measures announced in the fishing row. But there should be no doubt they are intended as a message about what is to come. From Tuesday, British and Channel Islands fishing boats will not be allowed to offload their catch at French ports. But that is the least of it.  Only 5% of UK seafood exports to France arrive in this way. The rest comes by freight. Potentially far more disruptive will be intensified controls at Calais and other entry points for UK trade by ferry and tunnel. The French authorities will be conducting what they call a ""grÃ¨ve de zÃ¨le"" - in other words becoming suddenly punctilious, thorough and on the look out for infractions. And it is not just fish imports which will be checked, but everything. The aim will be to create long tail-backs which will play on the news channels - reminding UK viewers of the costs of go-it-alone. France had warned it would block British boats from some ports next week - as well as tightening checks on UK boats and trucks - if a post-Brexit dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November. On Wednesday evening, it issued its ultimatum, saying it would begin to impose ""targeted measures"" from next Tuesday, including preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports and more checks on UK goods. France has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as itpreviously threatened in May. Mr Eustice said threats of sanctions made by France were ""disappointing and disproportionate"" and appeared to breach the post-Brexit deal and international law. He appealed to MPs to ""remain calm"", saying the UK would not get into a ""retaliatory tit-for-tat"" but warned of a possible ""appropriate and calibrated response"" if France carried out its threats. This video can not be played George Eustice says France's response has been ""disappointing and disproportionate"" Mr Eustice rejected French claims that the process for applying for fishing licences had been slow and difficult, saying officials had granted 98% of post-Brexit licence applications from European boats to fish in UK waters. He said more were expected to be granted following ""constructive"" talks with the European Commission and that he had told the French and the Commission that the UK's ""door remains ever open"". French politician and member of President Macron's En Marche party, Bruno Bonnell, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that French fishermen were ""losing 25% of their business because of regulation"". He said ""in the Brexit treaty we were not supposed to reach this point of tension"" and disagreed with the licensing figures quoted by Mr Eustice, saying 200 licences had been granted. Mr Bonnell argued French authorities ""have ways to retaliate if you push too hard"" and he ""would not be surprised if by next week we see significant advances"" in discussions. The UK maintains the rejected applications which sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show they had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters. A meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licencesto fish in Jersey's waters from Friday. The government of Jersey said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protestedoutside the port of St Helier on the island. Labour's shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said the tensions were a result of the government losing control of negotiations and there was real concern ""the botched Brexit deal"" was going to lead to more clashes.

"Top oil executives are testifying before Congress amid accusations their companies misled the public about climate change Democrat lawmakers say the industry spent decades denying its products' role in global warming ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell bosses all deny approving any climate disinformation campaigns The hearings open a year of investigations into energy giants, Democrats say They also come days before world leaders gather in Glasgow for the UN's COP26 climate conference World leaders will be pressed in Glasgow on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce warming Edited by Vicky Baker We're now closing our live coverage - thanks for staying with us! Just to recap - here are some key points:  Our live coverage was brought to you by BBC teams in Washington DC and London: Deirdre Finnerty, Vicky Baker, Max Matza, Yaroslav Lukov, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Sam Cabral and Jack Hunter.  Chairwoman Maloney concludes her remarks by saying subpoenas - forcing the companies to turn over internal documents - will be issued against them. Six weeks ago, the committee requested documents from the energy companies testifying today, says Maloney. But instead of submitting the documents, the companies ""produced reams of other documents, many of which are publicly available"". One company, she says, sent 1,500 pages of documents from their own website. ""Nearly all the companies failed to turn over board materials the committee needs to determine corporate strategies on climate change,"" she says. But so far they have ""not produced any internal documents or internal communications"" from the highest ranking executives. Instead, the companies employed their familiar tactic of ""delay and obstruction,"" she says, adding: ""Well, that ends today."" ""I intend to issues subpoenas to the fossil fuel industry representatives here today,"" says Maloney. ""I do not take this step lightly, she says, adding that her action is to ""rescue this planet and save it for our children"". The panel's top Democrat Carolyn Maloney is giving her closing remarks now. She says the meeting was productive, because the world's top oil executives now ""finally admit that climate change is real, that burning fossil fuels is causing it, and that we must act urgently to fix it"". ""But I was disappointed that we also heard much of the denial and deflection that we've heard before,"" she continues. ""Today's witnesses refused to take responsibility for a decades long misinformation campaign."" She goes on to attack the companies for not backing electric vehicles, and for continuing to work with the American Petroleum Institute lobbying firm. ""So I see no choice but to continue our committee's investigation until we see the truth,"" she adds. As the committee hearing closes, Kentucky's James Cormer - the top Republican on the panel - reminds Americans that ""Republicans care about climate too"". ""We care about the climate. But we also wanna work with the private sector to reduce emissions and continue to create good paying jobs,"" he says. Comer also says the most predictable thing about the hearing was seeing Democrats attacking energy firms for making a profit. Ilhan Omar Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar begins by making a claim we've heard several times today - that energy companies paid front companies to push for policies friendly to fossil fuels. She continues by reading from an ExxonMobil ""action plan"" from the early 1990s, which says that ""victory will be achieved"", when the public is confused about the causes of climate change. She says the goal of this project was to ""inject doubt and uncertainty into the climate debate"". ""The fossil fuel industry worked collectively to prevent action on climate change. They co-ordinated their campaigns with outside groups,"" says Omar, accusing lobbying organisations of participating in a conspiracy. She adds that in 2020, energy companies donated $139m to lawmakers. She notes that around 85% were Republicans, ""and mostly climate deniers"", and calls for energy companies to keep their money out of politics. ""It seems you all have achieved that victory of leading the public with disinformation,"" she says, sarcastically congratulating them. ""I hope you are ashamed of the future you have contributed for your children and ours, and I ask you all to resign,"" she ends. Advocates of the climate package protest in London last month The Green New Deal keeps coming up today. First introduced in 2019, the bill is modelled after the vast investment projects of the New Deal that helped lift America out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. It has the backing of a number of notable progressive Democrats, but has not attracted mainstream support within the party. Republicans are uniformly opposed to it. The New Green Deal proposes a number of radical steps, most notably the 10-year decarbonisation of the US economy. lt calls for all existing and new buildings to be upgraded to achieve maximum energy efficiency, and for transportation methods and infrastructure to be overhauled. However, it goes well beyond questions of climate change, also calling for employment protections for family and medical leave, and more. Many observers believe that the programme is high on ambition but is not a practical plan to tackle climate change. Missouri Democrat Cori Bush accuses the companies of racism, asking whether their facilities are primarily built in black communities. ""I wouldn't know how to answer that,"" begins Shell Oil Company CEO Gretchen Watkins. ""They are,"" interrupts Bush. She goes on to ask how many energy executive are black. One CEO says he assumes that few are, which Bush agrees with. She also accuses Shell of writing a report saying that ""low-lying areas such as Bangladesh may need to be abandoned"" due to climate change, and ends her remarks by calling on the witnesses to all resign in disgrace. Neal Crabtree, a welder who was put out of work after his pipeline project was cancelled by President Biden, is asked to characterise the Democrats' position on energy production. Crabtree was invited by Republicans as a witness. ""I'm gonna support whichever party puts me to work,"" says Crabtree, adding: ""This president has put me out of work."" The witness goes on to say that he wishes Donald Trump was still president. The Republican ranking committee member, Kentucky Congressman James Cormer, says he completely agrees. Massachusetts Democrat Ayanna Pressley - a member of the so-called ""Squad"" of young female representatives - is now asking questions. She says the energy companies, if left unchecked, ""will sink entire communities"" in the Boston area that she represents. ""My constituents are living in regions that would be completely underwater"", if zero-emissions plans are not enacted, she says. She then asks each CEO what percentage of their funds are being used to retrain their employees for green projects. When each CEO begin to answer, without providing the actual percentages, Pressley cuts them off. The divide between Democrats and Republicans continues to show, as Representative Jake LaTurner - from Kansas - takes the floor to defend the American oil sector. He says the concern of the committee hearing today constitutes ""climate misinformation"" on the part of Democrats. He speaks of an ""energy crisis"" and accuses the Biden administration of undermining the country's ""energy independence"" with its policies. ""Dependence on Russia and China to fuel our country's baseload and power our electric grid is a national security threat and does nothing to mitigate carbon emissions globally,"" he says, describing the oil and gas produced in America as ""among the cleanest and safest in the world"". He says ""the data proves the private sector is tackling climate change"" and urges congress to allow them to do so without ""burdensome federal regulation"". Florida Democrat Debbie Wasserman Shultz starts her questioning by referring to her state as ""ground zero"" for climate change. ""It's not a someday thing, it's a right now thing,"" she says. She goes on to grill the CEOs and lobbyists about how much they have spent to defeat President Biden's proposed Build Back Better Act. When the CEOs say they don't have the information on hand, she accuses them of being bad at their jobs. The proposed legislation is currently weighing whether to include a penalty for energy producers that leak methane into the atmosphere. ""You're either lying about your support for reducing methane emissions or you are working against yourself, which makes no sense,"" Wasserman Shultz adds. When oil lobbyist Mike Sommers tries to correct her, she interrupts him, saying ""the time is mine"". Democrats are continuing to rail against energy companies for not moving quickly enough to wean the US economy off fossil fuels. Republicans, meanwhile, are focusing their comments on Democrats - who they say are trying to sabotage the American energy sector. Arizona Republican Andy Biggs, who asked no questions during his allotted five minutes, told the CEOs: ""You've been brought here so they can beat the crap out of you. ""And they've done it for political reasons. That's the shame of it all."" He goes on to say the Democrats ""would regulate you right out of business if they could."" ""That's the purpose of this hearing today,"" he adds. ""To lay the foundation to get rid of you."" Oil lobbyist Mike Sommers American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers is asked about the energy crisis affecting Europe right now. He calls what's happening there a ""flashing warning sign"" for the US and other countries. Sommers calls the issue ""mainly a consequence of a lack of supply."" ""They are going to continue to need more energy as their economy grows,"" he says of European countries. Sommers goes on to blame the lack of supply on Russia, for deciding not export its own fossil fuels. He calls the situation ""a warning for the world that if you don't create your own supply at home, you are dependent on supplies from regimes that don't necessarily have your interests at heart."" It comes after a Republican on the panel of accused Democrats of seeking to sabotage American energy independence, and instead rely on oil from ""Venezuela and Iran"". Florida Republican Andrew Clyde ended his question with a warning that Russia is ""willing to use energy as a weapon"". Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - known in the US by her initials AOC - is now speaking. She is a key backer of the so-called Green New Deal to overhaul how Americans consume energy. She begins by taking issue with a recent statement made by American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers in a news interview, in which he said they are ""making every effort"" to lobby for oil production. AOC says $56m has been spent by the group just this year on their lobbying efforts. Sommers takes issue with her characterisation of his remarks, saying the group advocates for American energy workers. She then turns to ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, taking issue with his involvement in congressional infrastructure negotiations. She says that Americans are now forced to ""live with the future that you all are setting on fire for us"". The congresswoman used rice and candy to illustrate her point California Democrat Katie Porter starts by showing Shell's 2020 annual spending report, which she represents with a jar of candy. The report shows that Shell plans to spend between $19-22bn in the near term. Each M&M candy, she says, represents $50m. Porter's point is that Shell plans to spend about six times more on future fossil fuel production, rather than green energy. Gretchen Watkins, the Shell CEO, is asked to confirm the company's future spending plans. Watkins responds: ""What I can tell you is that there needs to be both a demand and a supply of clean energy."" She says Shell is ""working closely with customers to increase that demand over time."" Later, Porter uses sacks of rice, seen on the video feed in the boot of her car, to illustrate the acres of land held by energy companies. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check There have been some uncomfortable moments for the oil executives during this hearing, but what has been most notable â and unsurprising â has been the extent of the political divide. Democrats have been criticising the fossil fuel industry for misleading the American public, and asking for pledges which the executives have been unwilling to make. Republicans have been defending the industry, and asking why the United States should be acting to limit the use of fossil fuels when some other countries are increasing it. There have been flashes of real anger on both sides. But it feels like another political skirmish in what will be a long battle about the pace of the energy transition in the United States. A car mechanic shop in Baton Rouge, Louisiana ""It's insane what my colleagues across the aisle are putting these good American men and women through,"" says Louisiana Congressman Clay Higgins. He accuses the Democrat-led committee of ""attacking American workers as our country dissolves around us."" ""Do you pledge to endeavour to continue leading the world in emissions reductions and providing abundant affordable energy through innovations?"" he asks the CEOs. Each CEO answers that they will, with many adding that they are already working on green energy solutions. Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, says ""I'm even going to bother to ask"" about the shell groups that the energy companies work with to lobby for their products. She says that the adverts for oil companies seen on Facebook don't bear the names of Chevron, BP, etc. The adverts are ""lies plain and simple"", she says accusing the company of making millions last year ""poisoning the planet"". ""Congresswoman, I am not exactly following,"" says CEO Michael Wirth. Tlaib tells him to submit his response for the record in writing later after he says ""you've been provided with some inaccurate information"". Tlaib goes on to say the company owes over $50bn in 31 countries for environmental damage. ""There are more of us than there are of you,"" says Tlaib. ""You can poison the planet to make money. But we will defend the planet so we can live."" Much of the information Congress is relying on to make these
allegations is already in the public domain. For years, researchers and
lawyers have been sifting through the now publicly available internal memos of
oil companies to build a picture of who knew what about climate change and
when. They say the picture that emerges is clear. As far back as 1981, Exxon
employees were making projections for how warm the earth would become if we
continued to burn fossil fuels. Yet instead of making this research public, the ""Exxon Position"" was to ""emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions"" regarding climate change, according to a 1988 internal memo. Researchers say oil companies spread doubt about
climate change by creating think tanks or groups that appeared to be made up of
independent scientists, but were really designed and funded by oil. One such
group in 1991 planned to ""Reposition global warming as theory (not
fact)"". When the hearing is finished, you can read Phoebe Keane's deep-dive on ""How the oil industry made us doubt climate change"" andlisten to the podcast series Democrat John Sarbanes turns to the Chevron CEO Michael Wirth, saying that he ""touted"" his support for the Paris climate agreement in his opening statement. But, he adds, ""we know what it looks like when you company really cares about a federal initiative and wants it to succeed"". Sarbanes says that lobbying financial disclosures show that Chevron spent zero dollars on lobbying in favour of the climate agreement. The company, he says, filed 144 disclosure forms showing lobbying for corporate tax breaks. ""Chevron has spent more 54m on lobbying on a lot of other things since 2015,"" says Sarbanes. ""So clearly when your company cares about an issue you lobby on it."" Asked about the financial disclosures, Mr Wirth says he is not familiar with the exact numbers. The CEO's have so far barely been able to get in any answers, as many Democrats focus on getting out as many questions as possible during their five minutes of questioning. Republicans have used much of their time to slam the Democrats for their efforts to boost the green energy sector, at the expense of the fossil fuel industry.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"The river was level with the pedestrian bridge in Cockermouth Rain has continued to fall overnight in Cumbria after about 40 properties were flooded and road and rail travel were hit on Thursday. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning, meaning some disruption is possible, and the Environment Agency has nine flood warnings in place. On Thursday Honister Pass saw over 30cm (12in) of rain in a 24-hour period. Motorists are warned that some roads are only passable with extreme care, and asked only to travel if necessary. Train operators are asking people to avoid travelling on the West Coast Main Line and Cumbria Coastal routes, and there is no service between Barrow and Carlisle until the line has been inspected. The flooding hit Waterhead at Ambleside On Thursday a number of roads, including the A591 between Rydal and Grasmere and the A592 Patterdale Road, were flooded. Karl Melville, the senior manager at the county council's highways team, said work had been going on all night to try to re-open as many roads as possible. He said: ""We have made some good progress [and] a lot of the roads that were closed are now passable with care. ""But obviously this does not take away the very clear advice of if you don't need to travel then don't travel."" The A592 was blocked by a number of vehicles at Windermere School on Thursday The Environment Agency said 1,200 properties had been protected from flooding by its officers shutting flood gates and removing debris and blockages from grilles and watercourses. But flood duty manager Ben Lukey urged people ""to remain vigilant"". ""Surface water and river flooding could still bring disruption to further communities,"" he warned. Mountain rescue volunteers brought two holidaymakers and their dog to safety Two holiday makers and their dog had to be rescued from their accommodation at Southwaite Mill by the Cockermouth Mountain Rescue Team. With water chest high in places, volunteers brought them to safety in a raft. Some streets in Cockermouth flooded Cockermouth and District Chamber of Trade chairman Andrew Marshall said huge insurance policy excesses introduced after the floods of 2009 and 2015 meant 90% of businesses would have to pay for any repairs themselves. ""Ever since then it's been nigh on impossible to get insurance,"" he said. ""If we get flooded this time we've got to pay for the rebuild and everything, which goes into hundreds of thousands."" Insurers have imposed excesses of up to Â£50,000 for business flooding claims in the area, Mr Marshall said. After previous floods caused widespread damage to properties the governmentintroduced a scheme,externalto help residents get insurance ""but it wasn't extended to business"", he said. Coniston Boating Centre is normally not in the lake Gillian Jackson owns holiday lets in Cockermouth, some of which have flooded. ""We've been through this before so it's just get up, get on with it,"" she said. ""Yes, it's upsetting but we've kind of got a bit hardened to it, got used to it, and we've just got to crack on and sort it out."" On Thursday afternoon, staff at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant were advised to speak to their bosses about returning home if possible, after checking road conditions. In a message to employees, the company warned detours would be needed around road closures on the A595 at Duddon Bridge, Santon Bridge and Holmrook and that Millom was reported to be unreachable by road. ""Shift co-ordinators will maintain minimum safety manning levels in plants but others should head home once clarified with their line managers,"" it said. The pitch at Keswick Rugby Club was swamped There was also flood damage to the clubhouse Nine flood warnings,external(where flooding is expected) and 15 flood alerts (where it is possible) were in place on Friday morning. In the 24 hours to 03:00 on Thursday Honister Pass saw 307.4mm (1ft) of rain, according to the Environment Agency. The River Rothay was among those that burst their banks. Allow Twitter content?

"Cafes have now shut for 11 days in Moscow Shops, restaurants and schools have shut in Moscow in a partial lockdown, as Russia battles record Covid deaths and infections. Only essential shops like supermarkets and pharmacies are allowed to open in the capital, while food outlets are only providing takeaways. Authorities have also given workers across Russia nine days off from Saturday in a bid to curb infections. Russia has reported a record 1,159 deaths from Covid in the past 24 hours. The official data also reveals 40,096 new infections in 85 regions of Russia - another record. Russia's last major lockdown was in May-June 2020. Russia's overall Covid death toll in the pandemic is officially more than 230,000, the highest in Europe and one of the highest in the world. Last October however the state statistics agency Rosstat calculated the Russian Covid death toll to be above 400,000 - far higher than the government figures. The proportion of Russia's population fully vaccinated remains low - on 23 October it was 32.8%, Our World in Data reports. Most European countries have much higher rates. Richard Galpin, BBC News, Moscow On a grey, damp day here it seems little has changed as a result of the partial lockdown. The streets may be a little quieter than normal but there are still plenty of cars, including taxis, on the roads. The extensive metro system has also been quite busy, as have the bicycle couriers who deliver takeaway food. Construction work on a major shopping development continues, albeit at a slow pace. But even if this is not turning out to be the lockdown it was supposed to be, Muscovites must be wondering what might happen next. Could there be a full lockdown in the coming days or weeks, if it becomes clear the current restrictions are not sufficient to tackle this latest wave of coronavirus? Despite an intensive state vaccination drive, many Russians remain suspicious of the Sputnik V vaccine, which is internationally recognised as an effective shield against Covid. Vaccine rejection drives Russia's Covid nightmare How Russia glosses over its Covid death toll Faced with this partial lockdown between 30 October and 9 November, many Russians have decided to go on holiday. Resort hotels in Egypt - a popular destination for Russians - are reported to be fully booked, and Russian flights to Egypt are sold out. The Russian news service Vesti reports some panic-buying because of the new restrictions. There has been a rush on meat and fish at the central market in Orenburg, a city in the Urals east of Moscow.

"The Cornelis Gert Jan, which is owned by MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, was detained when fishing in French waters A British trawler has been seized by France and another has been fined, amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. French maritime minister Annick Girardin said the ships were cautioned during checks off Le Havre overnight. She said the first did not comply right away and the second was not allowed to fish in French waters so was detained. No 10 said it was watching events closely and wanted France and EU talks but was ready to respond appropriately. Earlier, the environment secretary said he was ""urgently"" investigating the situation in relation to the detained vessel - which has been named as the Cornelis Gert Jan. Responding to an Urgent Commons Question from the SNP, George Eustice said the boat was on a list provided by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) initially provided to the European Union. He insisted the European Union did grant a licence to the vessel but it was ""unclear"" why, according to reports, it was subsequently withdrawn from the list. Mr Eustice said he was awaiting further details from Marine Scotland and was expecting a response in the ""next hour or so"". Deidre Brock, the SNP's environment spokesperson, said it was not good enough that the environment secretary had so little information. Jersey offers 162 fishing licences after ultimatum Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, which owns the Cornelis, said the crew of its vessel were ""in good spirits"" after it was ""ordered into a French port while legally fishing for scallop in French waters"". The captain was questioned after leaving the boat with French authorities and being given legal representation by the company. MacDuff Shellfish confirmed the captain had been released and returned to the ship, but the Cornelius was ""not at liberty to leave"" the port while the investigation was ongoing. The firm's Andrew Brown said the crew would remain on board until its release. He said Macduff's ""fishing activity [was] entirely legal"" and it appeared the Cornelis, based at Shoreham, in West Sussex, had been ""caught up"" in the ongoing UK-France post-Brexit fishing row. This video can not be played Watch: British trawler Cornelis Gert Jan is held in Le Havre. Mr Brown warned that without ""a speedy resolution"", the vessel's catch could be confiscated by the French authorities, and called on the UK government to ""defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet"". The firm would ""vigorously defend"" itself against any claims, but its ""priority concern"" was for the welfare of the vessel's crew, he said. Ms Girardin hadsaid on Twitter,externalthe trawler was found to be fishing in the Bay of Seine without the proper licences. The minister said checks on the British vessels were standard during the scallop fishing season. But she added they had also been undertaken against ""the backdrop of the tightening of controls in the Channel, in the context of discussions on licenses with the United Kingdom and the European Commission"". In naval parlance, this is called a shot across the bows. Technically, the French checks on UK trawlers in the Channel overnight do not form part of the raft of retaliatory measures announced in the fishing row. But there should be no doubt they are intended as a message about what is to come. From Tuesday, British and Channel Islands fishing boats will not be allowed to offload their catch at French ports. But that is the least of it.  Only 5% of UK seafood exports to France arrive in this way. The rest comes by freight. Potentially far more disruptive will be intensified controls at Calais and other entry points for UK trade by ferry and tunnel. The French authorities will be conducting what they call a ""grÃ¨ve de zÃ¨le"" - in other words becoming suddenly punctilious, thorough and on the look out for infractions. And it is not just fish imports which will be checked, but everything. The aim will be to create long tail-backs which will play on the news channels - reminding UK viewers of the costs of go-it-alone. France had warned it would block British boats from some ports next week - as well as tightening checks on UK boats and trucks - if a post-Brexit dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November. On Wednesday evening, it issued its ultimatum, saying it would begin to impose ""targeted measures"" from next Tuesday, including preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports and more checks on UK goods. France has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as itpreviously threatened in May. Mr Eustice said threats of sanctions made by France were ""disappointing and disproportionate"" and appeared to breach the post-Brexit deal and international law. He appealed to MPs to ""remain calm"", saying the UK would not get into a ""retaliatory tit-for-tat"" but warned of a possible ""appropriate and calibrated response"" if France carried out its threats. This video can not be played George Eustice says France's response has been ""disappointing and disproportionate"" Mr Eustice rejected French claims that the process for applying for fishing licences had been slow and difficult, saying officials had granted 98% of post-Brexit licence applications from European boats to fish in UK waters. He said more were expected to be granted following ""constructive"" talks with the European Commission and that he had told the French and the Commission that the UK's ""door remains ever open"". French politician and member of President Macron's En Marche party, Bruno Bonnell, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that French fishermen were ""losing 25% of their business because of regulation"". He said ""in the Brexit treaty we were not supposed to reach this point of tension"" and disagreed with the licensing figures quoted by Mr Eustice, saying 200 licences had been granted. Mr Bonnell argued French authorities ""have ways to retaliate if you push too hard"" and he ""would not be surprised if by next week we see significant advances"" in discussions. The UK maintains the rejected applications which sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show they had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters. A meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licencesto fish in Jersey's waters from Friday. The government of Jersey said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protestedoutside the port of St Helier on the island. Labour's shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said the tensions were a result of the government losing control of negotiations and there was real concern ""the botched Brexit deal"" was going to lead to more clashes.

"Top oil executives are testifying before Congress amid accusations their companies misled the public about climate change Democrat lawmakers say the industry spent decades denying its products' role in global warming ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell bosses all deny approving any climate disinformation campaigns The hearings open a year of investigations into energy giants, Democrats say They also come days before world leaders gather in Glasgow for the UN's COP26 climate conference World leaders will be pressed in Glasgow on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce warming Edited by Vicky Baker We're now closing our live coverage - thanks for staying with us! Just to recap - here are some key points:  Our live coverage was brought to you by BBC teams in Washington DC and London: Deirdre Finnerty, Vicky Baker, Max Matza, Yaroslav Lukov, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Sam Cabral and Jack Hunter.  Chairwoman Maloney concludes her remarks by saying subpoenas - forcing the companies to turn over internal documents - will be issued against them. Six weeks ago, the committee requested documents from the energy companies testifying today, says Maloney. But instead of submitting the documents, the companies ""produced reams of other documents, many of which are publicly available"". One company, she says, sent 1,500 pages of documents from their own website. ""Nearly all the companies failed to turn over board materials the committee needs to determine corporate strategies on climate change,"" she says. But so far they have ""not produced any internal documents or internal communications"" from the highest ranking executives. Instead, the companies employed their familiar tactic of ""delay and obstruction,"" she says, adding: ""Well, that ends today."" ""I intend to issues subpoenas to the fossil fuel industry representatives here today,"" says Maloney. ""I do not take this step lightly, she says, adding that her action is to ""rescue this planet and save it for our children"". The panel's top Democrat Carolyn Maloney is giving her closing remarks now. She says the meeting was productive, because the world's top oil executives now ""finally admit that climate change is real, that burning fossil fuels is causing it, and that we must act urgently to fix it"". ""But I was disappointed that we also heard much of the denial and deflection that we've heard before,"" she continues. ""Today's witnesses refused to take responsibility for a decades long misinformation campaign."" She goes on to attack the companies for not backing electric vehicles, and for continuing to work with the American Petroleum Institute lobbying firm. ""So I see no choice but to continue our committee's investigation until we see the truth,"" she adds. As the committee hearing closes, Kentucky's James Cormer - the top Republican on the panel - reminds Americans that ""Republicans care about climate too"". ""We care about the climate. But we also wanna work with the private sector to reduce emissions and continue to create good paying jobs,"" he says. Comer also says the most predictable thing about the hearing was seeing Democrats attacking energy firms for making a profit. Ilhan Omar Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar begins by making a claim we've heard several times today - that energy companies paid front companies to push for policies friendly to fossil fuels. She continues by reading from an ExxonMobil ""action plan"" from the early 1990s, which says that ""victory will be achieved"", when the public is confused about the causes of climate change. She says the goal of this project was to ""inject doubt and uncertainty into the climate debate"". ""The fossil fuel industry worked collectively to prevent action on climate change. They co-ordinated their campaigns with outside groups,"" says Omar, accusing lobbying organisations of participating in a conspiracy. She adds that in 2020, energy companies donated $139m to lawmakers. She notes that around 85% were Republicans, ""and mostly climate deniers"", and calls for energy companies to keep their money out of politics. ""It seems you all have achieved that victory of leading the public with disinformation,"" she says, sarcastically congratulating them. ""I hope you are ashamed of the future you have contributed for your children and ours, and I ask you all to resign,"" she ends. Advocates of the climate package protest in London last month The Green New Deal keeps coming up today. First introduced in 2019, the bill is modelled after the vast investment projects of the New Deal that helped lift America out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. It has the backing of a number of notable progressive Democrats, but has not attracted mainstream support within the party. Republicans are uniformly opposed to it. The New Green Deal proposes a number of radical steps, most notably the 10-year decarbonisation of the US economy. lt calls for all existing and new buildings to be upgraded to achieve maximum energy efficiency, and for transportation methods and infrastructure to be overhauled. However, it goes well beyond questions of climate change, also calling for employment protections for family and medical leave, and more. Many observers believe that the programme is high on ambition but is not a practical plan to tackle climate change. Missouri Democrat Cori Bush accuses the companies of racism, asking whether their facilities are primarily built in black communities. ""I wouldn't know how to answer that,"" begins Shell Oil Company CEO Gretchen Watkins. ""They are,"" interrupts Bush. She goes on to ask how many energy executive are black. One CEO says he assumes that few are, which Bush agrees with. She also accuses Shell of writing a report saying that ""low-lying areas such as Bangladesh may need to be abandoned"" due to climate change, and ends her remarks by calling on the witnesses to all resign in disgrace. Neal Crabtree, a welder who was put out of work after his pipeline project was cancelled by President Biden, is asked to characterise the Democrats' position on energy production. Crabtree was invited by Republicans as a witness. ""I'm gonna support whichever party puts me to work,"" says Crabtree, adding: ""This president has put me out of work."" The witness goes on to say that he wishes Donald Trump was still president. The Republican ranking committee member, Kentucky Congressman James Cormer, says he completely agrees. Massachusetts Democrat Ayanna Pressley - a member of the so-called ""Squad"" of young female representatives - is now asking questions. She says the energy companies, if left unchecked, ""will sink entire communities"" in the Boston area that she represents. ""My constituents are living in regions that would be completely underwater"", if zero-emissions plans are not enacted, she says. She then asks each CEO what percentage of their funds are being used to retrain their employees for green projects. When each CEO begin to answer, without providing the actual percentages, Pressley cuts them off. The divide between Democrats and Republicans continues to show, as Representative Jake LaTurner - from Kansas - takes the floor to defend the American oil sector. He says the concern of the committee hearing today constitutes ""climate misinformation"" on the part of Democrats. He speaks of an ""energy crisis"" and accuses the Biden administration of undermining the country's ""energy independence"" with its policies. ""Dependence on Russia and China to fuel our country's baseload and power our electric grid is a national security threat and does nothing to mitigate carbon emissions globally,"" he says, describing the oil and gas produced in America as ""among the cleanest and safest in the world"". He says ""the data proves the private sector is tackling climate change"" and urges congress to allow them to do so without ""burdensome federal regulation"". Florida Democrat Debbie Wasserman Shultz starts her questioning by referring to her state as ""ground zero"" for climate change. ""It's not a someday thing, it's a right now thing,"" she says. She goes on to grill the CEOs and lobbyists about how much they have spent to defeat President Biden's proposed Build Back Better Act. When the CEOs say they don't have the information on hand, she accuses them of being bad at their jobs. The proposed legislation is currently weighing whether to include a penalty for energy producers that leak methane into the atmosphere. ""You're either lying about your support for reducing methane emissions or you are working against yourself, which makes no sense,"" Wasserman Shultz adds. When oil lobbyist Mike Sommers tries to correct her, she interrupts him, saying ""the time is mine"". Democrats are continuing to rail against energy companies for not moving quickly enough to wean the US economy off fossil fuels. Republicans, meanwhile, are focusing their comments on Democrats - who they say are trying to sabotage the American energy sector. Arizona Republican Andy Biggs, who asked no questions during his allotted five minutes, told the CEOs: ""You've been brought here so they can beat the crap out of you. ""And they've done it for political reasons. That's the shame of it all."" He goes on to say the Democrats ""would regulate you right out of business if they could."" ""That's the purpose of this hearing today,"" he adds. ""To lay the foundation to get rid of you."" Oil lobbyist Mike Sommers American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers is asked about the energy crisis affecting Europe right now. He calls what's happening there a ""flashing warning sign"" for the US and other countries. Sommers calls the issue ""mainly a consequence of a lack of supply."" ""They are going to continue to need more energy as their economy grows,"" he says of European countries. Sommers goes on to blame the lack of supply on Russia, for deciding not export its own fossil fuels. He calls the situation ""a warning for the world that if you don't create your own supply at home, you are dependent on supplies from regimes that don't necessarily have your interests at heart."" It comes after a Republican on the panel of accused Democrats of seeking to sabotage American energy independence, and instead rely on oil from ""Venezuela and Iran"". Florida Republican Andrew Clyde ended his question with a warning that Russia is ""willing to use energy as a weapon"". Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - known in the US by her initials AOC - is now speaking. She is a key backer of the so-called Green New Deal to overhaul how Americans consume energy. She begins by taking issue with a recent statement made by American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers in a news interview, in which he said they are ""making every effort"" to lobby for oil production. AOC says $56m has been spent by the group just this year on their lobbying efforts. Sommers takes issue with her characterisation of his remarks, saying the group advocates for American energy workers. She then turns to ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, taking issue with his involvement in congressional infrastructure negotiations. She says that Americans are now forced to ""live with the future that you all are setting on fire for us"". The congresswoman used rice and candy to illustrate her point California Democrat Katie Porter starts by showing Shell's 2020 annual spending report, which she represents with a jar of candy. The report shows that Shell plans to spend between $19-22bn in the near term. Each M&M candy, she says, represents $50m. Porter's point is that Shell plans to spend about six times more on future fossil fuel production, rather than green energy. Gretchen Watkins, the Shell CEO, is asked to confirm the company's future spending plans. Watkins responds: ""What I can tell you is that there needs to be both a demand and a supply of clean energy."" She says Shell is ""working closely with customers to increase that demand over time."" Later, Porter uses sacks of rice, seen on the video feed in the boot of her car, to illustrate the acres of land held by energy companies. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check There have been some uncomfortable moments for the oil executives during this hearing, but what has been most notable â and unsurprising â has been the extent of the political divide. Democrats have been criticising the fossil fuel industry for misleading the American public, and asking for pledges which the executives have been unwilling to make. Republicans have been defending the industry, and asking why the United States should be acting to limit the use of fossil fuels when some other countries are increasing it. There have been flashes of real anger on both sides. But it feels like another political skirmish in what will be a long battle about the pace of the energy transition in the United States. A car mechanic shop in Baton Rouge, Louisiana ""It's insane what my colleagues across the aisle are putting these good American men and women through,"" says Louisiana Congressman Clay Higgins. He accuses the Democrat-led committee of ""attacking American workers as our country dissolves around us."" ""Do you pledge to endeavour to continue leading the world in emissions reductions and providing abundant affordable energy through innovations?"" he asks the CEOs. Each CEO answers that they will, with many adding that they are already working on green energy solutions. Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, says ""I'm even going to bother to ask"" about the shell groups that the energy companies work with to lobby for their products. She says that the adverts for oil companies seen on Facebook don't bear the names of Chevron, BP, etc. The adverts are ""lies plain and simple"", she says accusing the company of making millions last year ""poisoning the planet"". ""Congresswoman, I am not exactly following,"" says CEO Michael Wirth. Tlaib tells him to submit his response for the record in writing later after he says ""you've been provided with some inaccurate information"". Tlaib goes on to say the company owes over $50bn in 31 countries for environmental damage. ""There are more of us than there are of you,"" says Tlaib. ""You can poison the planet to make money. But we will defend the planet so we can live."" Much of the information Congress is relying on to make these
allegations is already in the public domain. For years, researchers and
lawyers have been sifting through the now publicly available internal memos of
oil companies to build a picture of who knew what about climate change and
when. They say the picture that emerges is clear. As far back as 1981, Exxon
employees were making projections for how warm the earth would become if we
continued to burn fossil fuels. Yet instead of making this research public, the ""Exxon Position"" was to ""emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions"" regarding climate change, according to a 1988 internal memo. Researchers say oil companies spread doubt about
climate change by creating think tanks or groups that appeared to be made up of
independent scientists, but were really designed and funded by oil. One such
group in 1991 planned to ""Reposition global warming as theory (not
fact)"". When the hearing is finished, you can read Phoebe Keane's deep-dive on ""How the oil industry made us doubt climate change"" andlisten to the podcast series Democrat John Sarbanes turns to the Chevron CEO Michael Wirth, saying that he ""touted"" his support for the Paris climate agreement in his opening statement. But, he adds, ""we know what it looks like when you company really cares about a federal initiative and wants it to succeed"". Sarbanes says that lobbying financial disclosures show that Chevron spent zero dollars on lobbying in favour of the climate agreement. The company, he says, filed 144 disclosure forms showing lobbying for corporate tax breaks. ""Chevron has spent more 54m on lobbying on a lot of other things since 2015,"" says Sarbanes. ""So clearly when your company cares about an issue you lobby on it."" Asked about the financial disclosures, Mr Wirth says he is not familiar with the exact numbers. The CEO's have so far barely been able to get in any answers, as many Democrats focus on getting out as many questions as possible during their five minutes of questioning. Republicans have used much of their time to slam the Democrats for their efforts to boost the green energy sector, at the expense of the fossil fuel industry.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"David Henderson was found guilty of endangering the safety of an aircraft in which a footballer and pilot died The organiser of the flight in which footballer Emiliano Sala died has been found guilty of endangering the safety of an aircraft. Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, died in the crash in the English Channel in January 2019. David Henderson, 67, of Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, was found guilty after atrialat Cardiff Crown Court. He had also previouslyadmitted trying to arrange a flightfor a passenger without permission or authorisation. It took the jury seven-and-a-half hours to convict Henderson by a majority verdict. He will be sentenced on 12 November. Lawyers speaking on behalf of Sala's family said Henderson's convictions were welcomed but his actions were only ""one piece of the puzzle"" of how the plane came to crash. Search for answers over Sala death continues Emiliano Sala's body was recovered, but David Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, has never been found Argentine striker Sala and Mr Ibbotson died after their single-engine Piper Malibu plunged into the English Channel on a flight between Cardiff and Nantes in January 2019, set up by Henderson withfootball agent William ""Willie"" McKay. The footballer was involved in a Â£15m transfer to Cardiff City from Nantes and was travelling between the two cities at the time of his death. The court heard how Ibbotson, who regularly flew for Henderson, did not hold a commercial pilot's licence, a qualification to fly at night, and his rating to fly the single-engine Piper Malibu had expired. Sala's dad dies three months after son Emiliano Sala: Numerous errors led to fatal plane crash Henderson had asked Mr Ibbotson to fly the plane as he was away on holiday with his wife in Paris. Just moments after finding out the plane had gone down, Henderson texted a number of people telling them to stay silent, warning it would ""open a can of worms"", the jury was told. The father-of-three and former RAF officer admitted in court he had feared an investigation into his business dealings. Emiliano Sala was on board a plane bound for Cardiff from Nantes when it disappeared from radar Prosecutor Martin Goudie QC said Henderson had been ""reckless or negligent"" in the way he operated the plane, by putting his business above the safety of passengers. Mr Goudie said Henderson had created a culture of breaching the air navigation regulations among the pilots he hired. Fay Keely, who owned the plane, had told Henderson not to allow Mr Ibbotson to pilot the plane again after being contacted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) about two airspace infringements he had committed. Despite this, Henderson allowed Mr Ibbotson to continue flying, and his message to the pilot read: ""We both have an opportunity to make money out of the business model but not if we upset clients or draw the attention of the CAA."" Henderson did not have the permit needed to fly passengers in the American plane, or an Air Operator Certificate (AOC), which was also required. Mr Goudie accused Henderson of lying in his statements to investigators, and of running a ""cowboy outfit"" after questioning him over failings to keep basic information on his pilots. In his closing speech, he claimed Henderson ran an ""incompetent, undocumented and dishonest organisation"". However Stephen Spence QC, defending, had said his client's actions were ""purely a paperwork issue"" and had not led to a likelihood of danger. He said his client knew Mr Ibbotson, who had been flying for decades, was an experienced pilot. Mr Spence told the court the only difference between a commercial licence and the private licence held by Mr Ibbotson was whether you could carry passengers for money or not, rather than ability. Henderson also argued on the stand that he had phoned Ms Keely after she forbade Mr Ibbotson from flying and convinced her to let him pilot again. Ms Keely said she does not remember such a call. The Sala family say they want full disclosure, so ""no family goes through a similar preventable death"" BBC Wales understands that Cardiff City FC welcomes the verdict and hopes that the outcome will provide a sense of justice and closure to the families. Daniel Machover, of Hickman & Rose solicitors, representing the Sala family, said in a statement after the verdict: ""Mr Henderson's convictions are welcome and we hope the CAA will ensure that illegal flights of this kind are stopped. ""The actions of David Henderson are only one piece in the puzzle of how the plane David Ibbotson was illegally flying came to crash into the sea on 21 January 2019. ""We still do not know the key information about the maintenance history of the aircraft and all the factors behind the carbon monoxide poisoning revealed in August 2019 by AAIB. ""The answers to these questions can only be properly established at Emiliano's inquest, which is due to start in February next year."" The statement added that the Sala family ""fervently hope"" all involved in the inquest, including Piper Aircraft Inc and the AAIB, would provide full disclosure of material. ""Only if that happens will Emiliano's family finally know the truth about this tragedy enabling all the lessons to be learned, so that no family goes through a similar preventable death,"" it said. This video can not be played Football writer Ian Herbert says the trial showed ""the rather sordid way that people were creaming off money"" from Sala's transfer Kate Staples, the UK CAA's general counsel, extended sympathies to families and friends affected by the fatal crash. ""Aviation safety relies upon the integrity of everyone involved in the industry,"" she said. ""Unlawful and unsafe activity such as Mr Henderson's is unacceptable and the UK Civil Aviation Authority will always look to prosecute illegal activity."" Kevin Ducksbury, the chairman of the Air Charter Association (ACA), said the trade body was ""deeply dismayed"" that ""so many fundamental safety rules, and basic rules of airmanship were disregarded and broken"" in this case. ""The ruling confirms that Mr Henderson arranged and coordinated this flight illegally, in which footballer Emiliano Sala tragically lost his life. ""The association is profoundly disturbed that this flight was allowed to happen but welcomes the UK CAA's representation in this case,"" he said. Mr Ducksbury added that the ACA would continue its work to educate the public and wider aviation community, with it's primary cause to stamp out illegal transport.

"The Cornelis Gert Jan, which is owned by MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, was detained when fishing in French waters A British trawler has been seized by France and another has been fined, amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. French maritime minister Annick Girardin said the ships were cautioned during checks off Le Havre overnight. She said the first did not comply right away and the second was not allowed to fish in French waters so was detained. No 10 said it was watching events closely and wanted France and EU talks but was ready to respond appropriately. Earlier, the environment secretary said he was ""urgently"" investigating the situation in relation to the detained vessel - which has been named as the Cornelis Gert Jan. Responding to an Urgent Commons Question from the SNP, George Eustice said the boat was on a list provided by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) initially provided to the European Union. He insisted the European Union did grant a licence to the vessel but it was ""unclear"" why, according to reports, it was subsequently withdrawn from the list. Mr Eustice said he was awaiting further details from Marine Scotland and was expecting a response in the ""next hour or so"". Deidre Brock, the SNP's environment spokesperson, said it was not good enough that the environment secretary had so little information. Jersey offers 162 fishing licences after ultimatum Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, which owns the Cornelis, said the crew of its vessel were ""in good spirits"" after it was ""ordered into a French port while legally fishing for scallop in French waters"". The captain was questioned after leaving the boat with French authorities and being given legal representation by the company. MacDuff Shellfish confirmed the captain had been released and returned to the ship, but the Cornelius was ""not at liberty to leave"" the port while the investigation was ongoing. The firm's Andrew Brown said the crew would remain on board until its release. He said Macduff's ""fishing activity [was] entirely legal"" and it appeared the Cornelis, based at Shoreham, in West Sussex, had been ""caught up"" in the ongoing UK-France post-Brexit fishing row.

Mr Brown warned that without ""a speedy resolution"", the vessel's catch could be confiscated by the French authorities, and called on the UK government to ""defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet"". The firm would ""vigorously defend"" itself against any claims, but its ""priority concern"" was for the welfare of the vessel's crew, he said. Ms Girardin hadsaid on Twitter,externalthe trawler was found to be fishing in the Bay of Seine without the proper licences. The minister said checks on the British vessels were standard during the scallop fishing season. But she added they had also been undertaken against ""the backdrop of the tightening of controls in the Channel, in the context of discussions on licenses with the United Kingdom and the European Commission"". In naval parlance, this is called a shot across the bows. Technically, the French checks on UK trawlers in the Channel overnight do not form part of the raft of retaliatory measures announced in the fishing row. But there should be no doubt they are intended as a message about what is to come. From Tuesday, British and Channel Islands fishing boats will not be allowed to offload their catch at French ports. But that is the least of it.  Only 5% of UK seafood exports to France arrive in this way. The rest comes by freight. Potentially far more disruptive will be intensified controls at Calais and other entry points for UK trade by ferry and tunnel. The French authorities will be conducting what they call a ""grÃ¨ve de zÃ¨le"" - in other words becoming suddenly punctilious, thorough and on the look out for infractions. And it is not just fish imports which will be checked, but everything. The aim will be to create long tail-backs which will play on the news channels - reminding UK viewers of the costs of go-it-alone. France had warned it would block British boats from some ports next week - as well as tightening checks on UK boats and trucks - if a post-Brexit dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November. On Wednesday evening, it issued its ultimatum, saying it would begin to impose ""targeted measures"" from next Tuesday, including preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports and more checks on UK goods. France has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as itpreviously threatened in May. Mr Eustice said threats of sanctions made by France were ""disappointing and disproportionate"" and appeared to breach the post-Brexit deal and international law. He appealed to MPs to ""remain calm"", saying the UK would not get into a ""retaliatory tit-for-tat"" but warned of a possible ""appropriate and calibrated response"" if France carried out its threats. This video can not be played George Eustice says France's response has been ""disappointing and disproportionate"" Mr Eustice rejected French claims that the process for applying for fishing licences had been slow and difficult, saying officials had granted 98% of post-Brexit licence applications from European boats to fish in UK waters. He said more were expected to be granted following ""constructive"" talks with the European Commission and that he had told the French and the Commission that the UK's ""door remains ever open"". French politician and member of President Macron's En Marche party, Bruno Bonnell, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that French fishermen were ""losing 25% of their business because of regulation"". He said ""in the Brexit treaty we were not supposed to reach this point of tension"" and disagreed with the licensing figures quoted by Mr Eustice, saying 200 licences had been granted. Mr Bonnell argued French authorities ""have ways to retaliate if you push too hard"" and he ""would not be surprised if by next week we see significant advances"" in discussions. The UK maintains the rejected applications which sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show they had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters. A meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licencesto fish in Jersey's waters from Friday. The government of Jersey said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protestedoutside the port of St Helier on the island. Labour's shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said the tensions were a result of the government losing control of negotiations and there was real concern ""the botched Brexit deal"" was going to lead to more clashes.

"The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to be dissolved next March ahead of a May election ""Severe"" time pressures could prevent some long-awaited legislation from being passed before the next Stormont election, parties have been warned. The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to be dissolved next March, ahead of an election in May. The assembly speaker has written to MLAs to say at least 30 bills have yet to pass all legislative stages. Alex Maskey said it was ""highly unlikely"" that all of them would make it into law in time. In his letter, the speaker said the Covid-19 pandemic and the fact that the power-sharing institutions had only returned in January 2020, after three years of deadlock, had created ""very specific challenges"". Speaker Alex Maskey warned it was highly unlikely that all the bills would complete their passage He said the final number of executive and private members' bills has yet to be confirmed. ""This will create severe pressure on assembly and committee time,"" he said. ""It therefore appears highly unlikely that all of the bills which are currently in front of the assembly, or might be submitted, will be able to complete their passage by the end of the mandate."" The bills from executive ministers currently making their way through assembly scrutiny include: introducing a soft opt-outorgan donation system for Northern Ireland, in line with the rest of the UK two climate change bills seeking to settargets for reducing carbon emissions legislation to make stalking aspecific criminal offence modernising Northern Ireland'sadoption laws, which are three decades old introducing paid leave forparents who lose a child, a system already in place in England and Wales Several private members' bills - from MLAs who are not part of government - have also been introduced. The speaker warned against further bills being introduced in the weeks ahead due to time pressures. ""It is the availability of time... which will be the biggest resource constraint in the months ahead,"" he said. The focus at Stormont is often drawn to the latest political row or headline but scrutiny of serious issues is an important function. Time to deal with long-awaited laws was always going to be tight after a three-year impasse. Coronavirus has complicated the chances of some bills making it into the statute books. Then, there is the added factor of the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) threat to withdraw from power-sharing hanging over the institutions, meaning a rush now to progress ministers' bills. Expect plenty of late nights as MLAs and officials work to assess and argue over how some new laws should look. Some MLAs outside the executive know their own pieces of legislation will not make the cut in time. But ahead of the election, being able to show they have championed a certain issue may not do them any harm.

"On Wednesday, the chancellor committed to spending increases worth Â£150bn over three years He pledged nearly Â£2bn to help schools in England catch up from Covid, Â£5.9bn to tackle NHS backlogs and Â£7bn for transport projects But Rishi Sunak's budget is likely to leave middle earners worse off next year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says Labour accuses the chancellor of failing to tackle the ""cost of living crisis"" and criticises a tax cut for banks Responding to concerns over price rises, he says he does not have a ""magic wand"" to make these issues disappear Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband says the Tories have presided over 11 years of wage stagnation, low growth and falling living standards Economic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023 Edited by Hamish Mackay We're ending our live coverage for today. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of the day's main reaction to Rishi Sunak's Budget:  You can read an overview of yesterday's Budgethere, analysis from our economics editorhere, and analysis from our political editorhere. Reality Check Chancellor Rishi Sunak made a number of claims both in his Budget speech and in his round of interviews afterwards. Among them were suggestions that national debt was down, he cut taxes for ""millions"" of the lowest paid, and that he took ""advantage"" of leaving the EU to reform alcohol duty. But are those claims accurate? The BBC Reality Check team hashad a look. Marilyn Taylor asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Sunak has already faced a lot of questions and criticism about the timing of his decision - and should expect more. He argues thatlowering air passenger duty on flightsbetween airports in the four UK nations is balanced by increasing the rate of tax from April 2023 on very long-haul flights (over 5,500 miles). He also says domestic flights only account for 4% of total aviation emissions. In the end, it looks like it was a balancing act for the chancellor between the government's levelling-up agenda and climate considerations. COP26 will be based at the SEC campus in the centre of Glasgow Chancellor Rishi Sunak made the ""wrong choice"" announcing a cut in charges on domestic flights days before the global COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, says Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish first minister adds there is ""much to be disappointed in"" with the package of measures in his Budget. She says the Air Passenger Duty (APD) cut is not one the Scottish government would have introduced, adding: ""But it is for them [UK government] to defend that in the months to come."" Ahead of COP26, ""all of us have an obligation to think about how we contribute to reaching net zero and saving the planet"", Sturgeon says. You can read more about the impact of the Budget on environmental issueshere. Peter Ovenstone asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The question of whether any benefit from arise in the National Living Wagewill be offset by the increase in National Insurance and changes to Universal Credit rules is a good one. But it's a tricky one to answer because people in different circumstances will be affected to a differing extent. It is the case thatthe boost of a rising minimum wageis lessened bythe tapering of universal credit,the upcoming national insurance increase, and - crucially -the forecast rise in prices. Economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies say the policies taking effect will ultimately be progressive. In other words, good for low earners. For those without a job though, the outlook is much more precarious.  Former housing secretary Robert Jenrick says the Treasury is ""simply not willing"" to do more to help leaseholders remove unsafe cladding from buildings. During the Budget, the chancellor said Â£5bn would be given to remove unsafe cladding from the highest-risk buildings. But homeowners affected were unimpressed, saying the government must be ""operating in a time warp"" to have announced the same Â£5bn funding for a fourth time. Jenrick says: ""The choice for the government is: what is the balance between the state paying, and then trying to recoup as much of that as possible from the developers through taxes, and the leaseholder."" He says while leaseholders may find the current set up ""extremely unfair"", the only other option was for taxpayer to step in ""and massively increase that Â£5bn fund"". ""At the moment - and I fought this battle for a couple of years - the Treasury, the government, is simply not willing to do that,"" he says. You can read more about claddinghere. Finance Minister Conor Murphy says NI's budget allocation is ""nowhere near"" enough Rishi Sunak claims his budget allocation represents the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998. But Northern Ireland's finance minister Conor Murphy says it will create ""significant challenges"". He disputes the chancellor's claim that the nation will get an extra Â£1.6bn per year for public services. Murphy says it will amount to Â£1.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - ""nowhere near"" what is required. Read BBC News NI economics & business editor John Campbell'sfull analysis here With so many announcements yesterday, you'd be forgiven for feeling a bit overwhelmed. But don't worry, we're on hand to help you catch up: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The UK's pandemic house price boom is forecast to come to an end, but property prices are still expected to rise in each of the next five years. Some surveys have recorded house prices rising at a rate of more than 10% a year but the government's official, independent, forecasters have said this will drop to 3.5% by 2026. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also says that mortgage rates are likely to rise from record lows. Rent for tenants will also go up. It means potential first-time buyers are facing another period of difficulty if they wish to buy a home. Read more here. While many of the decisions about tax and spending in Scotland are made in Edinburgh, the UK Budget still has a big impact - well beyond the simple question of how much cash goes into Holyrood's coffers. Sunak has opted to turn on the spending taps across every government department, and this means Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will have more cash to allocate when she sets out her own draft budget in December. This is because many of the eye-catching announcements in the UK budget relate to matters which are devolved to Holyrood - for example the Â£24bn earmarked for housing or the Â£21bn for roads. Read more herefrom BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim on what the Autumn Budget means for Scotland. The SNP's economy spokeswoman Alison Thewliss says she's concerned the Budget doesn't go far enough to support the hospitality sector. Thewliss says a few pence off a pint ""does nothing"" to support the sector hard hit by the pandemic. She says it ""baffles"" her why the chancellor has ignored calls to keep the reduced 12.5% for VAT for hospitality. The MP for Glasgow Central also says all eyes are on her constituency due to upcoming climate summit COP26, which begins in the Scottish city on Sunday. But she says the Budget and Spending Review ""falls awfully short of the ambition required to tackle this global climate challenge"". Paul Amphlett asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Indeed a lot can change by then, butlong-term policy announcementsin a Budget are nothing new. The shake-up of alcohol duty, for example, is quite complex and will need to go through a consultation and scrutiny process before its planned introduction in 2023. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget has promised a cash boost for Welsh public services and more money for low-paid workers on universal credit. He also promised to increase Welsh government budgets by an average of Â£2.5bn a year. Just over Â£120m from the levelling-up fund was also earmarked for 10 Welsh projects. But the Labour-led Welsh government has accused the Treasury of leaving ""clear gaps in funding"". It says its own calls for cash to tackle coal-tips or additional funding for rail infrastructure have gone unanswered. Read BBC Wales political reporter David Deans'full analysis here Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the Budget is a ""blueprint for a stronger Britain"". Speaking in the Commons, he says: ""It's a country where if you have innovative ideas you will get the support you need to turn it from a dream into reality. ""It's a country where if your talent is nurtured and your skills are honed you will get the support and the ongoing interest and engagement - strong engagement - from the government. ""It's a country where if someone does an honest day's work they will receive a decent wage."" He says ""many of us have listened to the litany of woe and despair for too long"" and now feel optimistic, adding: ""We are very excited about the future of our country."" A strong rebound will be achieved, not by ""splashing cash indiscriminately"", he says, but by spending taxpayers' money wisely - ""to make the choice to foster an environment that encourages innovation and growth"". The government says tax hikes are needed to raise money to help the NHS and fix social care We brought you reaction earlier from theInstitute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which says the Budget will produce ""real pain""for lower income households. No 10 has responded, saying the government is taking on the long-term challenges facing the country. A spokesman for the prime minister says: ""I think this is a Budget and a settlement which is aimed to boost our economy - they are targeted interventions towards those who need it. ""We have taken the difficult decision to raise taxes on things like the [health and social care] levy in a fair and progressive way and that importantly is to raise money both to help our NHS and to finally fix the long-standing problem of social care. ""That's something that the public have been calling on successive governments to do for a number of years now - and it is this government that is taking on these challenges to get them fixed for the long term."" Rishi Sunak's Budget offers an ""age of stagnation"" rather than optimism, once the ""Instagram filter"" is removed, says Ed Miliband. Speaking in the Commons, the shadow business secretary says there has been 11 years of ""low growth, stagnant wages, falling living standards"" under the Conservatives, with the Budget failing to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. He says the Budget is ""already unravelling"" less than 24 hours since it was delivered ""because of the chasm between the claims of ministers and the reality that working people face"". ""It's clear he [Sunak] is living on a totally different planet,"" he adds. Miliband tells MPs: ""Yesterday we saw raid upon raid on the living standards of working people. Council tax hikes hidden in the Budget documents, not announced by the chancellor. ""A stealth raid on the self-employed worth Â£1.7bn over the coming five years, not announced by the chancellor. ""And of course the national insurance hike on ordinary families confirmed."" The ""most shameful"" part of the Budget, he says, was the government's ""refusal to reverse"" the cut to universal credit, which saw the removal of Â£20 weekly uplift. Downing Street reacts toanalysis by the Resolution Foundationthat suggests household tax bills will be Â£3,000 higher after the Budget compared with when Boris Johnson became prime minister, saying it is ""not a fair reflection"" of the fiscal situation. The PM's spokesman tells reporters: ""The Â£3,000 household tax figure you've quoted isn't a fair reflection of how tax is levied because it appears to include business and employer taxes - and those aren't directly applicable to households."" He says the same report also shows that government policies are ""set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution"" and that higher taxes will mostly impact the middle to higher income households. ""The decisions made by this government will give households nearly Â£500 per year extra on average, with the poorest receiving more than Â£1,000, and that's before we factor in things like wage growth,"" he adds. The director of theResolution Foundationthink tank, Torsten Bell, says themove to cut the weekly extra Â£20given to universal credit claimants during the pandemic will improve the welfare system - but warns it will help better off UC claimants, while giving nothing to compensate the poorest. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studiessaysmiddle-income families are ""likely to be worse off next year""than they are currently and says a combination of tax increases and high inflation ""over the next several years"" will mean ""very slow growth in living standards"". Shadow chancellorRachel Reevestells BBC Breakfast she welcomes the increases in spending announced by the chancellor yesterday but says it's not the Budget she would have delivered and calls the decision to cut air passenger duty the week before COP26 ""astonishing"". Also speaking to BBC Breakfast,Rishi Sunakdefends the move emphasising the importance of consistency ""with our environmental goals"" but adding: ""We're doing this to support domestic aviation, and regional airports will benefit from this."" BBC News Channel With changes to alcohol duty, business rates and wages, let's look at how the Budget will affect bars. Martin Greenhow, who owns a chain of five bars across the Midlands and north of England, says the Budget is ""a mixed bag"". ""The business rates discount for next year is obviously very welcome,"" he says. ""But ultimately we have to face the fact that it will be more than offset by the rise in the national living wage."" On alcohol duty -which will rise on stronger drinks- he says: ""I'm sure for some it will be a great help. ""For ourselves, we're a cocktail bar, so obviously we're probably at the strong end of the drinks spectrum. So we're probably going to see a bit more pain from that."" He says some in the industry think this could mean the price of a pint will rise by 20-30p, but warns that he still needs to see the details. ""We're loath to increase prices,"" he says, but adds the hospitality industry ""isn't in a position to absorb these debts"". ""That has to be passed on, because otherwise businesses fail."" Read more about the changes to alcohol dutyhere. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Climate activists have been campaigning for greener policies in the run-up to the climate summit COP26 Rishi Sunak didn't explicitly mention the climate in his Budget speech. But let's look at how his plans could impact the environment: Flying Stopping flying is one of the single best things you can do for the climate - but flying within the UK will become cheaper, thanks to a halving of air passenger duty. Sunakdefended the decision, saying he was removing an anomaly in which people were taxed more to fly in the UK than to Europe. Surveys consistently show that people want frequent fliers to be taxed extra. Home insulation The UK won't meet climate change targets with its current leaky housing stock, but campaign group Insulate Britain hasn't managed to convince the chancellor that upgrading homes is a good job-creating infrastructure investment. ""With the COP26 conference just days away, the chancellor's announcements felt like they were from a different planet and a different time,"" says Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive at the UK Green Buildings Council. Railways The government's investment in rail has been widely welcomed, along with a major input of Â£4.8bn to improve public transport within cities. The Railway Industry Association has welcomed the extra funding, but its chief executive Darren Caplan says there were missed opportunities with regards to ""electrification and fleet orders of hydrogen and battery trains"".

"David Henderson was found guilty of endangering the safety of an aircraft in which a footballer and pilot died The organiser of the flight in which footballer Emiliano Sala died has been found guilty of endangering the safety of an aircraft. Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, died in the crash in the English Channel in January 2019. David Henderson, 67, of Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, was found guilty after atrialat Cardiff Crown Court. He had also previouslyadmitted trying to arrange a flightfor a passenger without permission or authorisation. It took the jury seven-and-a-half hours to convict Henderson by a majority verdict. He will be sentenced on 12 November. Lawyers speaking on behalf of Sala's family said Henderson's convictions were welcomed but his actions were only ""one piece of the puzzle"" of how the plane came to crash. Search for answers over Sala death continues Emiliano Sala's body was recovered, but David Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, has never been found Argentine striker Sala and Mr Ibbotson died after their single-engine Piper Malibu plunged into the English Channel on a flight between Cardiff and Nantes in January 2019, set up by Henderson withfootball agent William ""Willie"" McKay. The footballer was involved in a Â£15m transfer to Cardiff City from Nantes and was travelling between the two cities at the time of his death. The court heard how Ibbotson, who regularly flew for Henderson, did not hold a commercial pilot's licence, a qualification to fly at night, and his rating to fly the single-engine Piper Malibu had expired. Sala's dad dies three months after son Emiliano Sala: Numerous errors led to fatal plane crash Henderson had asked Mr Ibbotson to fly the plane as he was away on holiday with his wife in Paris. Just moments after finding out the plane had gone down, Henderson texted a number of people telling them to stay silent, warning it would ""open a can of worms"", the jury was told. The father-of-three and former RAF officer admitted in court he had feared an investigation into his business dealings. Emiliano Sala was on board a plane bound for Cardiff from Nantes when it disappeared from radar Prosecutor Martin Goudie QC said Henderson had been ""reckless or negligent"" in the way he operated the plane, by putting his business above the safety of passengers. Mr Goudie said Henderson had created a culture of breaching the air navigation regulations among the pilots he hired. Fay Keely, who owned the plane, had told Henderson not to allow Mr Ibbotson to pilot the plane again after being contacted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) about two airspace infringements he had committed. Despite this, Henderson allowed Mr Ibbotson to continue flying, and his message to the pilot read: ""We both have an opportunity to make money out of the business model but not if we upset clients or draw the attention of the CAA."" Henderson did not have the permit needed to fly passengers in the American plane, or an Air Operator Certificate (AOC), which was also required. Mr Goudie accused Henderson of lying in his statements to investigators, and of running a ""cowboy outfit"" after questioning him over failings to keep basic information on his pilots. In his closing speech, he claimed Henderson ran an ""incompetent, undocumented and dishonest organisation"". However Stephen Spence QC, defending, had said his client's actions were ""purely a paperwork issue"" and had not led to a likelihood of danger. He said his client knew Mr Ibbotson, who had been flying for decades, was an experienced pilot. Mr Spence told the court the only difference between a commercial licence and the private licence held by Mr Ibbotson was whether you could carry passengers for money or not, rather than ability. Henderson also argued on the stand that he had phoned Ms Keely after she forbade Mr Ibbotson from flying and convinced her to let him pilot again. Ms Keely said she does not remember such a call. The Sala family say they want full disclosure, so ""no family goes through a similar preventable death"" BBC Wales understands that Cardiff City FC welcomes the verdict and hopes that the outcome will provide a sense of justice and closure to the families. Daniel Machover, of Hickman & Rose solicitors, representing the Sala family, said in a statement after the verdict: ""Mr Henderson's convictions are welcome and we hope the CAA will ensure that illegal flights of this kind are stopped. ""The actions of David Henderson are only one piece in the puzzle of how the plane David Ibbotson was illegally flying came to crash into the sea on 21 January 2019. ""We still do not know the key information about the maintenance history of the aircraft and all the factors behind the carbon monoxide poisoning revealed in August 2019 by AAIB. ""The answers to these questions can only be properly established at Emiliano's inquest, which is due to start in February next year."" The statement added that the Sala family ""fervently hope"" all involved in the inquest, including Piper Aircraft Inc and the AAIB, would provide full disclosure of material. ""Only if that happens will Emiliano's family finally know the truth about this tragedy enabling all the lessons to be learned, so that no family goes through a similar preventable death,"" it said. This video can not be played Football writer Ian Herbert says the trial showed ""the rather sordid way that people were creaming off money"" from Sala's transfer Kate Staples, the UK CAA's general counsel, extended sympathies to families and friends affected by the fatal crash. ""Aviation safety relies upon the integrity of everyone involved in the industry,"" she said. ""Unlawful and unsafe activity such as Mr Henderson's is unacceptable and the UK Civil Aviation Authority will always look to prosecute illegal activity."" Kevin Ducksbury, the chairman of the Air Charter Association (ACA), said the trade body was ""deeply dismayed"" that ""so many fundamental safety rules, and basic rules of airmanship were disregarded and broken"" in this case. ""The ruling confirms that Mr Henderson arranged and coordinated this flight illegally, in which footballer Emiliano Sala tragically lost his life. ""The association is profoundly disturbed that this flight was allowed to happen but welcomes the UK CAA's representation in this case,"" he said. Mr Ducksbury added that the ACA would continue its work to educate the public and wider aviation community, with it's primary cause to stamp out illegal transport.

But are those claims accurate? The BBC Reality Check team hashad a look. Marilyn Taylor asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Sunak has already faced a lot of questions and criticism about the timing of his decision - and should expect more. He argues thatlowering air passenger duty on flightsbetween airports in the four UK nations is balanced by increasing the rate of tax from April 2023 on very long-haul flights (over 5,500 miles). He also says domestic flights only account for 4% of total aviation emissions. In the end, it looks like it was a balancing act for the chancellor between the government's levelling-up agenda and climate considerations. COP26 will be based at the SEC campus in the centre of Glasgow Chancellor Rishi Sunak made the ""wrong choice"" announcing a cut in charges on domestic flights days before the global COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, says Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish first minister adds there is ""much to be disappointed in"" with the package of measures in his Budget. She says the Air Passenger Duty (APD) cut is not one the Scottish government would have introduced, adding: ""But it is for them [UK government] to defend that in the months to come."" Ahead of COP26, ""all of us have an obligation to think about how we contribute to reaching net zero and saving the planet"", Sturgeon says.

Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The question of whether any benefit from arise in the National Living Wagewill be offset by the increase in National Insurance and changes to Universal Credit rules is a good one. But it's a tricky one to answer because people in different circumstances will be affected to a differing extent. It is the case thatthe boost of a rising minimum wageis lessened bythe tapering of universal credit,the upcoming national insurance increase, and - crucially -the forecast rise in prices. Economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies say the policies taking effect will ultimately be progressive. In other words, good for low earners. For those without a job though, the outlook is much more precarious.  Former housing secretary Robert Jenrick says the Treasury is ""simply not willing"" to do more to help leaseholders remove unsafe cladding from buildings. During the Budget, the chancellor said Â£5bn would be given to remove unsafe cladding from the highest-risk buildings. But homeowners affected were unimpressed, saying the government must be ""operating in a time warp"" to have announced the same Â£5bn funding for a fourth time. Jenrick says: ""The choice for the government is: what is the balance between the state paying, and then trying to recoup as much of that as possible from the developers through taxes, and the leaseholder."" He says while leaseholders may find the current set up ""extremely unfair"", the only other option was for taxpayer to step in ""and massively increase that Â£5bn fund"". ""At the moment - and I fought this battle for a couple of years - the Treasury, the government, is simply not willing to do that,"" he says. You can read more about claddinghere. Finance Minister Conor Murphy says NI's budget allocation is ""nowhere near"" enough Rishi Sunak claims his budget allocation represents the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998. But Northern Ireland's finance minister Conor Murphy says it will create ""significant challenges"". He disputes the chancellor's claim that the nation will get an extra Â£1.6bn per year for public services. Murphy says it will amount to Â£1.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - ""nowhere near"" what is required. Read BBC News NI economics & business editor John Campbell'sfull analysis here With so many announcements yesterday, you'd be forgiven for feeling a bit overwhelmed. But don't worry, we're on hand to help you catch up: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The UK's pandemic house price boom is forecast to come to an end, but property prices are still expected to rise in each of the next five years. Some surveys have recorded house prices rising at a rate of more than 10% a year but the government's official, independent, forecasters have said this will drop to 3.5% by 2026. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also says that mortgage rates are likely to rise from record lows. Rent for tenants will also go up. It means potential first-time buyers are facing another period of difficulty if they wish to buy a home. Read more here. While many of the decisions about tax and spending in Scotland are made in Edinburgh, the UK Budget still has a big impact - well beyond the simple question of how much cash goes into Holyrood's coffers. Sunak has opted to turn on the spending taps across every government department, and this means Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will have more cash to allocate when she sets out her own draft budget in December. This is because many of the eye-catching announcements in the UK budget relate to matters which are devolved to Holyrood - for example the Â£24bn earmarked for housing or the Â£21bn for roads. Read more herefrom BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim on what the Autumn Budget means for Scotland. The SNP's economy spokeswoman Alison Thewliss says she's concerned the Budget doesn't go far enough to support the hospitality sector. Thewliss says a few pence off a pint ""does nothing"" to support the sector hard hit by the pandemic. She says it ""baffles"" her why the chancellor has ignored calls to keep the reduced 12.5% for VAT for hospitality. The MP for Glasgow Central also says all eyes are on her constituency due to upcoming climate summit COP26, which begins in the Scottish city on Sunday. But she says the Budget and Spending Review ""falls awfully short of the ambition required to tackle this global climate challenge"". Paul Amphlett asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Indeed a lot can change by then, butlong-term policy announcementsin a Budget are nothing new. The shake-up of alcohol duty, for example, is quite complex and will need to go through a consultation and scrutiny process before its planned introduction in 2023. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget has promised a cash boost for Welsh public services and more money for low-paid workers on universal credit. He also promised to increase Welsh government budgets by an average of Â£2.5bn a year. Just over Â£120m from the levelling-up fund was also earmarked for 10 Welsh projects. But the Labour-led Welsh government has accused the Treasury of leaving ""clear gaps in funding"". It says its own calls for cash to tackle coal-tips or additional funding for rail infrastructure have gone unanswered. Read BBC Wales political reporter David Deans'full analysis here Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the Budget is a ""blueprint for a stronger Britain"". Speaking in the Commons, he says: ""It's a country where if you have innovative ideas you will get the support you need to turn it from a dream into reality. ""It's a country where if your talent is nurtured and your skills are honed you will get the support and the ongoing interest and engagement - strong engagement - from the government. ""It's a country where if someone does an honest day's work they will receive a decent wage."" He says ""many of us have listened to the litany of woe and despair for too long"" and now feel optimistic, adding: ""We are very excited about the future of our country."" A strong rebound will be achieved, not by ""splashing cash indiscriminately"", he says, but by spending taxpayers' money wisely - ""to make the choice to foster an environment that encourages innovation and growth"". The government says tax hikes are needed to raise money to help the NHS and fix social care We brought you reaction earlier from theInstitute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which says the Budget will produce ""real pain""for lower income households. No 10 has responded, saying the government is taking on the long-term challenges facing the country. A spokesman for the prime minister says: ""I think this is a Budget and a settlement which is aimed to boost our economy - they are targeted interventions towards those who need it. ""We have taken the difficult decision to raise taxes on things like the [health and social care] levy in a fair and progressive way and that importantly is to raise money both to help our NHS and to finally fix the long-standing problem of social care. ""That's something that the public have been calling on successive governments to do for a number of years now - and it is this government that is taking on these challenges to get them fixed for the long term."" Rishi Sunak's Budget offers an ""age of stagnation"" rather than optimism, once the ""Instagram filter"" is removed, says Ed Miliband. Speaking in the Commons, the shadow business secretary says there has been 11 years of ""low growth, stagnant wages, falling living standards"" under the Conservatives, with the Budget failing to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. He says the Budget is ""already unravelling"" less than 24 hours since it was delivered ""because of the chasm between the claims of ministers and the reality that working people face"". ""It's clear he [Sunak] is living on a totally different planet,"" he adds. Miliband tells MPs: ""Yesterday we saw raid upon raid on the living standards of working people. Council tax hikes hidden in the Budget documents, not announced by the chancellor. ""A stealth raid on the self-employed worth Â£1.7bn over the coming five years, not announced by the chancellor. ""And of course the national insurance hike on ordinary families confirmed."" The ""most shameful"" part of the Budget, he says, was the government's ""refusal to reverse"" the cut to universal credit, which saw the removal of Â£20 weekly uplift. Downing Street reacts toanalysis by the Resolution Foundationthat suggests household tax bills will be Â£3,000 higher after the Budget compared with when Boris Johnson became prime minister, saying it is ""not a fair reflection"" of the fiscal situation. The PM's spokesman tells reporters: ""The Â£3,000 household tax figure you've quoted isn't a fair reflection of how tax is levied because it appears to include business and employer taxes - and those aren't directly applicable to households."" He says the same report also shows that government policies are ""set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution"" and that higher taxes will mostly impact the middle to higher income households. ""The decisions made by this government will give households nearly Â£500 per year extra on average, with the poorest receiving more than Â£1,000, and that's before we factor in things like wage growth,"" he adds. The director of theResolution Foundationthink tank, Torsten Bell, says themove to cut the weekly extra Â£20given to universal credit claimants during the pandemic will improve the welfare system - but warns it will help better off UC claimants, while giving nothing to compensate the poorest. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studiessaysmiddle-income families are ""likely to be worse off next year""than they are currently and says a combination of tax increases and high inflation ""over the next several years"" will mean ""very slow growth in living standards"". Shadow chancellorRachel Reevestells BBC Breakfast she welcomes the increases in spending announced by the chancellor yesterday but says it's not the Budget she would have delivered and calls the decision to cut air passenger duty the week before COP26 ""astonishing"". Also speaking to BBC Breakfast,Rishi Sunakdefends the move emphasising the importance of consistency ""with our environmental goals"" but adding: ""We're doing this to support domestic aviation, and regional airports will benefit from this."" BBC News Channel With changes to alcohol duty, business rates and wages, let's look at how the Budget will affect bars. Martin Greenhow, who owns a chain of five bars across the Midlands and north of England, says the Budget is ""a mixed bag"". ""The business rates discount for next year is obviously very welcome,"" he says. ""But ultimately we have to face the fact that it will be more than offset by the rise in the national living wage."" On alcohol duty -which will rise on stronger drinks- he says: ""I'm sure for some it will be a great help. ""For ourselves, we're a cocktail bar, so obviously we're probably at the strong end of the drinks spectrum. So we're probably going to see a bit more pain from that."" He says some in the industry think this could mean the price of a pint will rise by 20-30p, but warns that he still needs to see the details. ""We're loath to increase prices,"" he says, but adds the hospitality industry ""isn't in a position to absorb these debts"". ""That has to be passed on, because otherwise businesses fail."" Read more about the changes to alcohol dutyhere. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Climate activists have been campaigning for greener policies in the run-up to the climate summit COP26 Rishi Sunak didn't explicitly mention the climate in his Budget speech. But let's look at how his plans could impact the environment: Flying Stopping flying is one of the single best things you can do for the climate - but flying within the UK will become cheaper, thanks to a halving of air passenger duty. Sunakdefended the decision, saying he was removing an anomaly in which people were taxed more to fly in the UK than to Europe. Surveys consistently show that people want frequent fliers to be taxed extra. Home insulation The UK won't meet climate change targets with its current leaky housing stock, but campaign group Insulate Britain hasn't managed to convince the chancellor that upgrading homes is a good job-creating infrastructure investment. ""With the COP26 conference just days away, the chancellor's announcements felt like they were from a different planet and a different time,"" says Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive at the UK Green Buildings Council. Railways The government's investment in rail has been widely welcomed, along with a major input of Â£4.8bn to improve public transport within cities. The Railway Industry Association has welcomed the extra funding, but its chief executive Darren Caplan says there were missed opportunities with regards to ""electrification and fleet orders of hydrogen and battery trains"".

"Top oil executives are testifying before Congress amid accusations their companies misled the public about climate change Democrat lawmakers say the industry spent decades denying its products' role in global warming ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell bosses all deny approving any climate disinformation campaigns The hearings open a year of investigations into energy giants, Democrats say They also come days before world leaders gather in Glasgow for the UN's COP26 climate conference World leaders will be pressed in Glasgow on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce warming Edited by Vicky Baker We're now closing our live coverage - thanks for staying with us! Just to recap - here are some key points:  Our live coverage was brought to you by BBC teams in Washington DC and London: Deirdre Finnerty, Vicky Baker, Max Matza, Yaroslav Lukov, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Sam Cabral and Jack Hunter.  Chairwoman Maloney concludes her remarks by saying subpoenas - forcing the companies to turn over internal documents - will be issued against them. Six weeks ago, the committee requested documents from the energy companies testifying today, says Maloney. But instead of submitting the documents, the companies ""produced reams of other documents, many of which are publicly available"". One company, she says, sent 1,500 pages of documents from their own website. ""Nearly all the companies failed to turn over board materials the committee needs to determine corporate strategies on climate change,"" she says. But so far they have ""not produced any internal documents or internal communications"" from the highest ranking executives. Instead, the companies employed their familiar tactic of ""delay and obstruction,"" she says, adding: ""Well, that ends today."" ""I intend to issues subpoenas to the fossil fuel industry representatives here today,"" says Maloney. ""I do not take this step lightly, she says, adding that her action is to ""rescue this planet and save it for our children"". The panel's top Democrat Carolyn Maloney is giving her closing remarks now. She says the meeting was productive, because the world's top oil executives now ""finally admit that climate change is real, that burning fossil fuels is causing it, and that we must act urgently to fix it"". ""But I was disappointed that we also heard much of the denial and deflection that we've heard before,"" she continues. ""Today's witnesses refused to take responsibility for a decades long misinformation campaign."" She goes on to attack the companies for not backing electric vehicles, and for continuing to work with the American Petroleum Institute lobbying firm. ""So I see no choice but to continue our committee's investigation until we see the truth,"" she adds. As the committee hearing closes, Kentucky's James Cormer - the top Republican on the panel - reminds Americans that ""Republicans care about climate too"". ""We care about the climate. But we also wanna work with the private sector to reduce emissions and continue to create good paying jobs,"" he says. Comer also says the most predictable thing about the hearing was seeing Democrats attacking energy firms for making a profit. Ilhan Omar Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar begins by making a claim we've heard several times today - that energy companies paid front companies to push for policies friendly to fossil fuels. She continues by reading from an ExxonMobil ""action plan"" from the early 1990s, which says that ""victory will be achieved"", when the public is confused about the causes of climate change. She says the goal of this project was to ""inject doubt and uncertainty into the climate debate"". ""The fossil fuel industry worked collectively to prevent action on climate change. They co-ordinated their campaigns with outside groups,"" says Omar, accusing lobbying organisations of participating in a conspiracy. She adds that in 2020, energy companies donated $139m to lawmakers. She notes that around 85% were Republicans, ""and mostly climate deniers"", and calls for energy companies to keep their money out of politics. ""It seems you all have achieved that victory of leading the public with disinformation,"" she says, sarcastically congratulating them. ""I hope you are ashamed of the future you have contributed for your children and ours, and I ask you all to resign,"" she ends. Advocates of the climate package protest in London last month The Green New Deal keeps coming up today. First introduced in 2019, the bill is modelled after the vast investment projects of the New Deal that helped lift America out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. It has the backing of a number of notable progressive Democrats, but has not attracted mainstream support within the party. Republicans are uniformly opposed to it. The New Green Deal proposes a number of radical steps, most notably the 10-year decarbonisation of the US economy. lt calls for all existing and new buildings to be upgraded to achieve maximum energy efficiency, and for transportation methods and infrastructure to be overhauled. However, it goes well beyond questions of climate change, also calling for employment protections for family and medical leave, and more. Many observers believe that the programme is high on ambition but is not a practical plan to tackle climate change. Missouri Democrat Cori Bush accuses the companies of racism, asking whether their facilities are primarily built in black communities. ""I wouldn't know how to answer that,"" begins Shell Oil Company CEO Gretchen Watkins. ""They are,"" interrupts Bush. She goes on to ask how many energy executive are black. One CEO says he assumes that few are, which Bush agrees with. She also accuses Shell of writing a report saying that ""low-lying areas such as Bangladesh may need to be abandoned"" due to climate change, and ends her remarks by calling on the witnesses to all resign in disgrace. Neal Crabtree, a welder who was put out of work after his pipeline project was cancelled by President Biden, is asked to characterise the Democrats' position on energy production. Crabtree was invited by Republicans as a witness. ""I'm gonna support whichever party puts me to work,"" says Crabtree, adding: ""This president has put me out of work."" The witness goes on to say that he wishes Donald Trump was still president. The Republican ranking committee member, Kentucky Congressman James Cormer, says he completely agrees. Massachusetts Democrat Ayanna Pressley - a member of the so-called ""Squad"" of young female representatives - is now asking questions. She says the energy companies, if left unchecked, ""will sink entire communities"" in the Boston area that she represents. ""My constituents are living in regions that would be completely underwater"", if zero-emissions plans are not enacted, she says. She then asks each CEO what percentage of their funds are being used to retrain their employees for green projects. When each CEO begin to answer, without providing the actual percentages, Pressley cuts them off. The divide between Democrats and Republicans continues to show, as Representative Jake LaTurner - from Kansas - takes the floor to defend the American oil sector. He says the concern of the committee hearing today constitutes ""climate misinformation"" on the part of Democrats. He speaks of an ""energy crisis"" and accuses the Biden administration of undermining the country's ""energy independence"" with its policies. ""Dependence on Russia and China to fuel our country's baseload and power our electric grid is a national security threat and does nothing to mitigate carbon emissions globally,"" he says, describing the oil and gas produced in America as ""among the cleanest and safest in the world"". He says ""the data proves the private sector is tackling climate change"" and urges congress to allow them to do so without ""burdensome federal regulation"". Florida Democrat Debbie Wasserman Shultz starts her questioning by referring to her state as ""ground zero"" for climate change. ""It's not a someday thing, it's a right now thing,"" she says. She goes on to grill the CEOs and lobbyists about how much they have spent to defeat President Biden's proposed Build Back Better Act. When the CEOs say they don't have the information on hand, she accuses them of being bad at their jobs. The proposed legislation is currently weighing whether to include a penalty for energy producers that leak methane into the atmosphere. ""You're either lying about your support for reducing methane emissions or you are working against yourself, which makes no sense,"" Wasserman Shultz adds. When oil lobbyist Mike Sommers tries to correct her, she interrupts him, saying ""the time is mine"". Democrats are continuing to rail against energy companies for not moving quickly enough to wean the US economy off fossil fuels. Republicans, meanwhile, are focusing their comments on Democrats - who they say are trying to sabotage the American energy sector. Arizona Republican Andy Biggs, who asked no questions during his allotted five minutes, told the CEOs: ""You've been brought here so they can beat the crap out of you. ""And they've done it for political reasons. That's the shame of it all."" He goes on to say the Democrats ""would regulate you right out of business if they could."" ""That's the purpose of this hearing today,"" he adds. ""To lay the foundation to get rid of you."" Oil lobbyist Mike Sommers American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers is asked about the energy crisis affecting Europe right now. He calls what's happening there a ""flashing warning sign"" for the US and other countries. Sommers calls the issue ""mainly a consequence of a lack of supply."" ""They are going to continue to need more energy as their economy grows,"" he says of European countries. Sommers goes on to blame the lack of supply on Russia, for deciding not export its own fossil fuels. He calls the situation ""a warning for the world that if you don't create your own supply at home, you are dependent on supplies from regimes that don't necessarily have your interests at heart."" It comes after a Republican on the panel of accused Democrats of seeking to sabotage American energy independence, and instead rely on oil from ""Venezuela and Iran"". Florida Republican Andrew Clyde ended his question with a warning that Russia is ""willing to use energy as a weapon"". Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - known in the US by her initials AOC - is now speaking. She is a key backer of the so-called Green New Deal to overhaul how Americans consume energy. She begins by taking issue with a recent statement made by American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers in a news interview, in which he said they are ""making every effort"" to lobby for oil production. AOC says $56m has been spent by the group just this year on their lobbying efforts. Sommers takes issue with her characterisation of his remarks, saying the group advocates for American energy workers. She then turns to ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, taking issue with his involvement in congressional infrastructure negotiations. She says that Americans are now forced to ""live with the future that you all are setting on fire for us"". The congresswoman used rice and candy to illustrate her point California Democrat Katie Porter starts by showing Shell's 2020 annual spending report, which she represents with a jar of candy. The report shows that Shell plans to spend between $19-22bn in the near term. Each M&M candy, she says, represents $50m. Porter's point is that Shell plans to spend about six times more on future fossil fuel production, rather than green energy. Gretchen Watkins, the Shell CEO, is asked to confirm the company's future spending plans. Watkins responds: ""What I can tell you is that there needs to be both a demand and a supply of clean energy."" She says Shell is ""working closely with customers to increase that demand over time."" Later, Porter uses sacks of rice, seen on the video feed in the boot of her car, to illustrate the acres of land held by energy companies. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check There have been some uncomfortable moments for the oil executives during this hearing, but what has been most notable â and unsurprising â has been the extent of the political divide. Democrats have been criticising the fossil fuel industry for misleading the American public, and asking for pledges which the executives have been unwilling to make. Republicans have been defending the industry, and asking why the United States should be acting to limit the use of fossil fuels when some other countries are increasing it. There have been flashes of real anger on both sides. But it feels like another political skirmish in what will be a long battle about the pace of the energy transition in the United States. A car mechanic shop in Baton Rouge, Louisiana ""It's insane what my colleagues across the aisle are putting these good American men and women through,"" says Louisiana Congressman Clay Higgins. He accuses the Democrat-led committee of ""attacking American workers as our country dissolves around us."" ""Do you pledge to endeavour to continue leading the world in emissions reductions and providing abundant affordable energy through innovations?"" he asks the CEOs. Each CEO answers that they will, with many adding that they are already working on green energy solutions. Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, says ""I'm even going to bother to ask"" about the shell groups that the energy companies work with to lobby for their products. She says that the adverts for oil companies seen on Facebook don't bear the names of Chevron, BP, etc. The adverts are ""lies plain and simple"", she says accusing the company of making millions last year ""poisoning the planet"". ""Congresswoman, I am not exactly following,"" says CEO Michael Wirth. Tlaib tells him to submit his response for the record in writing later after he says ""you've been provided with some inaccurate information"". Tlaib goes on to say the company owes over $50bn in 31 countries for environmental damage. ""There are more of us than there are of you,"" says Tlaib. ""You can poison the planet to make money. But we will defend the planet so we can live."" Much of the information Congress is relying on to make these
allegations is already in the public domain. For years, researchers and
lawyers have been sifting through the now publicly available internal memos of
oil companies to build a picture of who knew what about climate change and
when. They say the picture that emerges is clear. As far back as 1981, Exxon
employees were making projections for how warm the earth would become if we
continued to burn fossil fuels. Yet instead of making this research public, the ""Exxon Position"" was to ""emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions"" regarding climate change, according to a 1988 internal memo. Researchers say oil companies spread doubt about
climate change by creating think tanks or groups that appeared to be made up of
independent scientists, but were really designed and funded by oil. One such
group in 1991 planned to ""Reposition global warming as theory (not
fact)"". When the hearing is finished, you can read Phoebe Keane's deep-dive on ""How the oil industry made us doubt climate change"" andlisten to the podcast series Democrat John Sarbanes turns to the Chevron CEO Michael Wirth, saying that he ""touted"" his support for the Paris climate agreement in his opening statement. But, he adds, ""we know what it looks like when you company really cares about a federal initiative and wants it to succeed"". Sarbanes says that lobbying financial disclosures show that Chevron spent zero dollars on lobbying in favour of the climate agreement. The company, he says, filed 144 disclosure forms showing lobbying for corporate tax breaks. ""Chevron has spent more 54m on lobbying on a lot of other things since 2015,"" says Sarbanes. ""So clearly when your company cares about an issue you lobby on it."" Asked about the financial disclosures, Mr Wirth says he is not familiar with the exact numbers. The CEO's have so far barely been able to get in any answers, as many Democrats focus on getting out as many questions as possible during their five minutes of questioning. Republicans have used much of their time to slam the Democrats for their efforts to boost the green energy sector, at the expense of the fossil fuel industry.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Olympians Laura Baldwin and Etienne Stott took part in the protest Activists, including two British Olympians, have staged a climate change protest blocking the entrance to the UK's largest oil refinery. About 15 Extinction Rebellion (XR) demonstrators got on to the site at Fawley, Hampshire, at about 06:30 BST. They included sailor Laura Baldwin and gold medal-winning canoeist Etienne Stott. Other XR protesters scaled two 50ft (15m) oil tanks on the site. Refinery owner ExxonMobil said the protest had no impact on its operation. The protest came as Boris Johnson prepares to welcome world leaders in Glasgow for theUN climate summit, COP26,  which starts on Sunday. XR said its activists, who have all now left the site, cut through electrified perimeter fences under the cover of darkness before spreading across the site in small groups to lock on to structures. Sailor Laura Baldwin and canoeist Etienne Stott are calling for the government to ban allÂ fossil fuels investments The blockade began at about 06:30 BST ExxonMobil said earlier the plant continued to operate and it was not experiencing any impact on production. Some of the group, which is calling on the government to ban allÂ fossil fuels investments and a halt to expansion plans at Fawley, chained themselves to a pink boat at the site's entrance. Speaking from the pink boat earlier, sailor Baldwin, who competed in the 2004 Athens Games, said: ""Exxon, which are part of the Esso group, are planning to expand their oil exploration - these companies are still putting profits ahead of people. ""The government are just not acting on it - they are just not taking it seriously it seems."" In a statement released by XR, London 2012 Olympic champion Stott said: ""We need our government to rein in these rogue companies as a matter of urgency and show to the world ahead of COP26 that the UK is prepared to take a genuine leadership position."" The plant is the largest refinery and petrochemical site in the UK and produces almost one fifth of the fuel used by UK vehicles. Some of the protestors have scaled tanks at the refinery A spokesperson for Hampshire Constabulary earlier said: ""Everyone has the right to free speech and protest. However, officers will take necessary action against the few who deliberately choose to act outside the law. ""Police will work to ensure the health and safety of people at these locations, and to minimise the impact on the local community. ""No arrests have been made at this stage and we remain at the scene."" ExxonMobil added: ''[We believe] that climate change risks warrant action and it's going to take all of us â business, governments and consumers â to make meaningful progress. ''At Fawley, we are also directly helping motorists and farmers to reduce their emissions through the manufacturing of lower carbon fuels... The group got on to the site at Fawley shortly after 06:30 BST ''We respect the right to peaceful protest, but our priority is the safety of our people, our neighbours and our operations and we are working with Hampshire police to ensure this is maintained."" Last year, Stottwas found guilty of a public order offenceafter he was arrested on Waterloo Bridge in London when he refused to comply with police orders to leave during an XR protest. It has also been confirmedSky Rebellion protesters carried out a demonstration at London Southend Airport,externallast week. Members of the group - dressed as Microsoft executives - carried barrels of oil through the check-in area to highlight what they claim is the ""excessive level of corporate flights"" used by the firm. The airport said: ""...a group gathered at the airport to protest Microsoft staff travelling on business flights, despite London Southend Airport not being used by Microsoft employees for business flights.

"This video can not be played Olympians Laura Baldwin and Etienne Stott took part in the protest Activists, including two British Olympians, have staged a climate change protest blocking the entrance to the UK's largest oil refinery. About 15 Extinction Rebellion (XR) demonstrators got on to the site at Fawley, Hampshire, at about 06:30 BST. They included sailor Laura Baldwin and gold medal-winning canoeist Etienne Stott. Other XR protesters scaled two 50ft (15m) oil tanks on the site. Refinery owner ExxonMobil said the protest had no impact on its operation. The protest came as Boris Johnson prepares to welcome world leaders in Glasgow for theUN climate summit, COP26,  which starts on Sunday. XR said its activists, who have all now left the site, cut through electrified perimeter fences under the cover of darkness before spreading across the site in small groups to lock on to structures. Sailor Laura Baldwin and canoeist Etienne Stott are calling for the government to ban allÂ fossil fuels investments The blockade began at about 06:30 BST ExxonMobil said earlier the plant continued to operate and it was not experiencing any impact on production. Some of the group, which is calling on the government to ban allÂ fossil fuels investments and a halt to expansion plans at Fawley, chained themselves to a pink boat at the site's entrance. Speaking from the pink boat earlier, sailor Baldwin, who competed in the 2004 Athens Games, said: ""Exxon, which are part of the Esso group, are planning to expand their oil exploration - these companies are still putting profits ahead of people. ""The government are just not acting on it - they are just not taking it seriously it seems."" In a statement released by XR, London 2012 Olympic champion Stott said: ""We need our government to rein in these rogue companies as a matter of urgency and show to the world ahead of COP26 that the UK is prepared to take a genuine leadership position.""

"About 1,400 miners were arrested and more than 500 were convicted during the strike A new bill to pardon miners convicted of offences relating to the strike action in the 1980s has been published by the Scottish government. Justice Secretary Keith Brown said the legislation would go ""some way"" to aid reconciliation and to help heal wounds in mining communities.Â About 1,400 miners were arrested and more than 500 were convicted during the national dispute. The pardon will also apply to miners who have died since the 1984-85 strike. The Miners' Strike (Pardons) (Scotland) Bill follows an independent review into the impact of policing on Scottish communities during the strike. The review, led by human rights lawyer John Scott QC, recommended that the Scottish government introduced legislation to pardon miners convicted of certain offences, such as breach of the peace. The decades-old feud that still divides communities Mr Brown said the miners' strike had been one of the ""most bitter and divisive industrial disputes in living memory"". ""This new draft legislation will go some way to aid reconciliation - and to help heal wounds within Scotland's mining communities,"" he said. ""A collective pardon will restore dignity to those convicted, provide comfort to their families and, I hope, will bring closure to the sense of injustice members of mining communities may feel. ""I am determined to make swift progress on this matter, given the passage of time since 1984-85, which is why we have acted quickly to bring forward and publish this landmark new bill."" However, former miner George Purcell, who was arrested at Bilston Glen Colliery in Midlothian during the strike, said the new legislation was a ""token gesture"". ""It [the pardon] maybe resolves one of the injustices that were laid against the miners, but it doesn't involve the financial loss - the major injustice that was put against miners that weren't reinstated,"" he said. Mr Purcell was dismissed from his job after being convicted of breach of the peace and toldBBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programmehe had missed out on five years' of work and compensation when the colliery finally closed. ""We were involved in an industrial dispute to try and protect our communities and save jobs. We didn't think that the whole of the state machinery would be put against us,"" he said. ""When you think of a minor offence like breach of the peace over 37 years ago. Fined Â£400 and barred from going near the colliery... that was excessive and extreme."" George Purcell, pictured at Bilston Colliery in 1972, said the pardon amounted to a ""token gesture"" from the Scottish government The bill will not cast doubt on decisions made by courts at the time and does not quash convictions. Millions of people protested against pit closures during the industrial dispute with Margaret Thatcher's government. Throughout the summer of 1984 there were violent clashes between striking miners and police, whose numbers often ran into several hundred at each confrontation. Violence led to widespread use of the breach of the peace charge. The review found that most of the miners' actions would be unlikely to result in prosecution today.

"The river was level with the pedestrian bridge in Cockermouth Rain has continued to fall overnight in Cumbria after about 40 properties were flooded and road and rail travel were hit on Thursday. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning, meaning some disruption is possible, and the Environment Agency has nine flood warnings in place. On Thursday Honister Pass saw over 30cm (12in) of rain in a 24-hour period. Motorists are warned that some roads are only passable with extreme care, and asked only to travel if necessary. Train operators are asking people to avoid travelling on the West Coast Main Line and Cumbria Coastal routes, and there is no service between Barrow and Carlisle until the line has been inspected. The flooding hit Waterhead at Ambleside On Thursday a number of roads, including the A591 between Rydal and Grasmere and the A592 Patterdale Road, were flooded. Karl Melville, the senior manager at the county council's highways team, said work had been going on all night to try to re-open as many roads as possible. He said: ""We have made some good progress [and] a lot of the roads that were closed are now passable with care. ""But obviously this does not take away the very clear advice of if you don't need to travel then don't travel."" The A592 was blocked by a number of vehicles at Windermere School on Thursday The Environment Agency said 1,200 properties had been protected from flooding by its officers shutting flood gates and removing debris and blockages from grilles and watercourses. But flood duty manager Ben Lukey urged people ""to remain vigilant"". ""Surface water and river flooding could still bring disruption to further communities,"" he warned. Mountain rescue volunteers brought two holidaymakers and their dog to safety Two holiday makers and their dog had to be rescued from their accommodation at Southwaite Mill by the Cockermouth Mountain Rescue Team. With water chest high in places, volunteers brought them to safety in a raft. Some streets in Cockermouth flooded Cockermouth and District Chamber of Trade chairman Andrew Marshall said huge insurance policy excesses introduced after the floods of 2009 and 2015 meant 90% of businesses would have to pay for any repairs themselves. ""Ever since then it's been nigh on impossible to get insurance,"" he said. ""If we get flooded this time we've got to pay for the rebuild and everything, which goes into hundreds of thousands."" Insurers have imposed excesses of up to Â£50,000 for business flooding claims in the area, Mr Marshall said. After previous floods caused widespread damage to properties the governmentintroduced a scheme,externalto help residents get insurance ""but it wasn't extended to business"", he said. Coniston Boating Centre is normally not in the lake Gillian Jackson owns holiday lets in Cockermouth, some of which have flooded. ""We've been through this before so it's just get up, get on with it,"" she said. ""Yes, it's upsetting but we've kind of got a bit hardened to it, got used to it, and we've just got to crack on and sort it out."" On Thursday afternoon, staff at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant were advised to speak to their bosses about returning home if possible, after checking road conditions. In a message to employees, the company warned detours would be needed around road closures on the A595 at Duddon Bridge, Santon Bridge and Holmrook and that Millom was reported to be unreachable by road. ""Shift co-ordinators will maintain minimum safety manning levels in plants but others should head home once clarified with their line managers,"" it said. The pitch at Keswick Rugby Club was swamped There was also flood damage to the clubhouse Nine flood warnings,external(where flooding is expected) and 15 flood alerts (where it is possible) were in place on Friday morning. In the 24 hours to 03:00 on Thursday Honister Pass saw 307.4mm (1ft) of rain, according to the Environment Agency. The River Rothay was among those that burst their banks. Allow Twitter content?

Hope Park in Keswick was hit, leaving the statue of Max the Miracle Dog stranded Richard Warren from the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association warned people not to go fell walking during the current conditions. He said: ""It's half-term, Scafell Pike is a bit of a honey pot, there were a lot of walkers out on the road looking very, very wet, the car park had quite a few cars in, so people may have gone up Scafell Pike when the rivers were low. ""But when they come down they will find they won't be able to cross the rivers, so the message really is stay off the mountains."" Allow Twitter content?

Environment Agency teams were monitoring the effect of the rain on rivers, focusing on western and southern parts of the county, ""making sure flood defences work"", he said. Cars got stuck in floodwater near Keswick Alan Goodman, from the Met Office, said the rain was ""on the wane slowly as today unfolds"". ""There's still more steady rain to come but hopefully it will gradually fragment so the problems we have had on the roads should start to ease. ""But yes, there's been an awful lot of rain.""

"North Wales Tidal Energy has drawn up plans for a 19-mile, 2.3GW barrage, which would cost Â£7bn Supporters of tidal energy projects say they are ""deeply frustrated"" that their plans to tackle climate change are being ""ignored"" by the UK government. Tidal technology could produce between 5% and 10% of the UK's electricity needs, according to the Tidal Range Alliance (TRA). A privately-funded plan for Swansea Baywas announced this week, but the TRA wants state support for large schemes. The UK government said plans must show ""strong evidence"" of value for money. A strategy to achieve net-zero carbon, published last week,did not mention tidal range energy,external. Energy schemes in Wales which would produce more than 350MW require consent from the UK government. Welsh company leads Â£1.7bn tidal lagoon project Action on green energy needed now, says trade body Â£1.3bn tidal lagoon project thrown out North Wales Tidal Energy's Â£7bn plans for a 2.3GW barrage stretching 19 miles (31km) from Prestatyn in Denbighshire, to Llandudno in Conwy, would fall into this category. Its chairman Henry Dixon is also chairman of the TRA, which works as a UK industry body. Mr Dixon said the north Wales project had ""stalled"". Henry Dixon is calling for UK government support for large schemes ""Like many other developers of tidal range we've had absolutely no support from government and this is something we really don't understand when we have the current energy crisis,"" he said. ""In the UK, we have a unique resource - potentially 5% to 10% of the electricity in the UK could be generated from the tide - and we're ignored."" In 2017,a government-commissioned review by former energy minister Charles Hendrybacked plans for a pathfinder lagoon in Swansea Bay, saying it should be viewed as a ""no-regrets policy"". But a year later,the UK government said it was not value for money. The ill-fated Swansea tidal lagoon project was scrapped after the UK government said it was not value for money The TRA said improvements in technology meant previous assessments were ""no longer accurate"", and has called on the UK government to give Â£20m to conduct a new independent assessment. It claimed the schemes could offer the same amount of energy as nuclear, were cheaper to build and have a much longer lifespan of 120 years. In last week's strategy, the UK government announced its Â£120m Future Nuclear Enabling Fund to develop small modular reactors. ""Other industries have had significant amounts of money, or have that money,"" said Mr Dixon. ""Look at wind farm energy or nuclear energy, they're still getting grants."" Other forms of renewable energy, such as offshore wind, get more money than tidal, Henry Dixon says With COP26 approaching, an energy crisis and rising sea levels, Mr Dixon said ""the time is now"". ""All we're asking for is a small amount of funding to prove the science, prove the methodologies and show that this sort of scheme can really make a difference,"" he said. Jay Sheppard from Marine Energy Wales, which acts as a body for the marine sector, said he shared the frustration of colleagues in the sector: ""Our industry is poised to deliver reliable, clean energy power generation. ""But in order to get over the line we need that level of support and investment from the UK government and at the moment that's not forthcoming."" The Welsh government has power over energy schemes up to 350MW, and will soon launch a Tidal Lagoon Challenge to determine the appetite for developing proposals, potentially with its financial backing. A spokesman said: ""As the Hendry Review concluded, tidal lagoons have an important role to play in energy generation. ""After extensive conversations with stakeholders and testing of the existing market, the Welsh government is developing a broad, innovative and collaborative proposal which gives us the best possibility of developing and testing tidal lagoon energy generation in Welsh waters."" The UK government said: ""Our coastline and the power of the seas around us offers huge potential for clean renewable energy and the UK government remains open to considering well-developed proposals for harnessing UK tidal range energy. ""In order to compete with other low-carbon technologies, a tidal range scheme will need to demonstrate strong evidence of value for taxpayer money, economic benefits, energy saving and environmental impact mitigation.""

"Strike action which threatened to cripple rail services in Scotland during COP26 has been called off after the RMT accepted a pay deal. The union said the offer would provide them with a one year 2.5% pay rise, improved conditions and a Â£300 COP payment for all ScotRail staff. It also means an end to Sunday strikes which have been ongoing since March. ScotRail welcomed the agreement, which comes just four days before the start of the UN climate summit. The Scottish government said it was ""proud"" to have brokered and funded the deal. The announcement was made on Wednesday evening following talks between the trade union and transport bosses. RMT Scotland organiser Michael Hogg told the BBC: ""For the first time in eight and a half months, normality returns to Scotland's trains."" Speaking on theGood Morning Scotland programme, he said the new deal meant efficiency savings, which had been a sticking point, were off the agenda at least for a year. ""The [original] two-year deal included efficiency savings that were unacceptable to the RMT, so we are happy and delighted that we have been able to secure a one-year deal that allows us to actually focus on negotiations next year,"" he said. ScotRail is currently run by Abellio but it is being stripped of its contract amid concerns over its performance. The rail firm will be taken over by acompany owned and controlled by the Scottish governmentin March. Mr Hogg said the union would be able to return to the negotiating table with a new employer. ""Abellio ScotRail are not going to be there next year,"" he said. ""It is going to be the operator of last resort and I hope the main focus has to be getting our  industrial relations back on track in order to have a dialogue next year. ""We are hoping there is going to be a different approach. For the last 18 months negotiations have been protracted and industrial relations have been virtually been destroyed as a result of tactics taken by Abellio ScotRail and Transport Scotland."" Ian McConnell, ScotRail chief operating officer, said: ""We have reached a pay agreement with the RMT trade union that resolves strike action. ""We look forward to Scotland's railway playing its part in delivering a successful COP26 next week."" The union had been given until 17:00 on Wednesday to accept the same deal which had been agreed by three other unions. It then announced ScotRail had accepted a counter offer after the 17:00 deadline. The union confirmed that planned industrial action, scheduled to start on Monday, would be ""withdrawn immediately"" as members welcomed a recent agreement on a pay rise. In a letter sent to union members following talks on Wednesday evening, RMT general secretary Michael Lynch said: ""By accepting the offer all industrial action is now cancelled and I instruct you all to work normally on the days you had previously been instructed to take action on."" Mr Lynch said the union's offer was accepted ""unanimously"" by delegates. Up to 30,000 delegates are set to descend on Glasgow for COP26 Transport minister Graeme Dey said he was pleased the union reached out to restart discussions based on the offer that had been made to them on Sunday. He added: ""Now an agreement has been confirmed the strike action will thankfully come to an end. ""As well as getting the pay rise they deserve, railway workers can now go back to delivering rail services for people right across Scotland and as well as for those attending COP26."" Up to 30,000 delegates are set to descend on Glasgow for COP26, which runs from Sunday to 14 November. Another dispute could see thousands of council workers across Scotland including refuse, recycling, maintenance and school catering and janitorial stafftaking strike action during the second week of the climate talks. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"Cafes have now shut for 11 days in Moscow Shops, restaurants and schools have shut in Moscow in a partial lockdown, as Russia battles record Covid deaths and infections. Only essential shops like supermarkets and pharmacies are allowed to open in the capital, while food outlets are only providing takeaways. Authorities have also given workers across Russia nine days off from Saturday in a bid to curb infections. Russia has reported a record 1,159 deaths from Covid in the past 24 hours. The official data also reveals 40,096 new infections in 85 regions of Russia - another record. Russia's last major lockdown was in May-June 2020. Russia's overall Covid death toll in the pandemic is officially more than 230,000, the highest in Europe and one of the highest in the world. Last October however the state statistics agency Rosstat calculated the Russian Covid death toll to be above 400,000 - far higher than the government figures. The proportion of Russia's population fully vaccinated remains low - on 23 October it was 32.8%, Our World in Data reports. Most European countries have much higher rates. Richard Galpin, BBC News, Moscow On a grey, damp day here it seems little has changed as a result of the partial lockdown. The streets may be a little quieter than normal but there are still plenty of cars, including taxis, on the roads. The extensive metro system has also been quite busy, as have the bicycle couriers who deliver takeaway food. Construction work on a major shopping development continues, albeit at a slow pace. But even if this is not turning out to be the lockdown it was supposed to be, Muscovites must be wondering what might happen next. Could there be a full lockdown in the coming days or weeks, if it becomes clear the current restrictions are not sufficient to tackle this latest wave of coronavirus? Despite an intensive state vaccination drive, many Russians remain suspicious of the Sputnik V vaccine, which is internationally recognised as an effective shield against Covid. Vaccine rejection drives Russia's Covid nightmare How Russia glosses over its Covid death toll Faced with this partial lockdown between 30 October and 9 November, many Russians have decided to go on holiday. Resort hotels in Egypt - a popular destination for Russians - are reported to be fully booked, and Russian flights to Egypt are sold out. The Russian news service Vesti reports some panic-buying because of the new restrictions. There has been a rush on meat and fish at the central market in Orenburg, a city in the Urals east of Moscow.

"The river was level with the pedestrian bridge in Cockermouth Rain has continued to fall overnight in Cumbria after about 40 properties were flooded and road and rail travel were hit on Thursday. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning, meaning some disruption is possible, and the Environment Agency has nine flood warnings in place. On Thursday Honister Pass saw over 30cm (12in) of rain in a 24-hour period. Motorists are warned that some roads are only passable with extreme care, and asked only to travel if necessary. Train operators are asking people to avoid travelling on the West Coast Main Line and Cumbria Coastal routes, and there is no service between Barrow and Carlisle until the line has been inspected. The flooding hit Waterhead at Ambleside On Thursday a number of roads, including the A591 between Rydal and Grasmere and the A592 Patterdale Road, were flooded. Karl Melville, the senior manager at the county council's highways team, said work had been going on all night to try to re-open as many roads as possible. He said: ""We have made some good progress [and] a lot of the roads that were closed are now passable with care. ""But obviously this does not take away the very clear advice of if you don't need to travel then don't travel."" The A592 was blocked by a number of vehicles at Windermere School on Thursday The Environment Agency said 1,200 properties had been protected from flooding by its officers shutting flood gates and removing debris and blockages from grilles and watercourses. But flood duty manager Ben Lukey urged people ""to remain vigilant"". ""Surface water and river flooding could still bring disruption to further communities,"" he warned. Mountain rescue volunteers brought two holidaymakers and their dog to safety Two holiday makers and their dog had to be rescued from their accommodation at Southwaite Mill by the Cockermouth Mountain Rescue Team. With water chest high in places, volunteers brought them to safety in a raft. Some streets in Cockermouth flooded Cockermouth and District Chamber of Trade chairman Andrew Marshall said huge insurance policy excesses introduced after the floods of 2009 and 2015 meant 90% of businesses would have to pay for any repairs themselves. ""Ever since then it's been nigh on impossible to get insurance,"" he said. ""If we get flooded this time we've got to pay for the rebuild and everything, which goes into hundreds of thousands."" Insurers have imposed excesses of up to Â£50,000 for business flooding claims in the area, Mr Marshall said. After previous floods caused widespread damage to properties the governmentintroduced a scheme,externalto help residents get insurance ""but it wasn't extended to business"", he said. Coniston Boating Centre is normally not in the lake Gillian Jackson owns holiday lets in Cockermouth, some of which have flooded. ""We've been through this before so it's just get up, get on with it,"" she said. ""Yes, it's upsetting but we've kind of got a bit hardened to it, got used to it, and we've just got to crack on and sort it out."" On Thursday afternoon, staff at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant were advised to speak to their bosses about returning home if possible, after checking road conditions. In a message to employees, the company warned detours would be needed around road closures on the A595 at Duddon Bridge, Santon Bridge and Holmrook and that Millom was reported to be unreachable by road. ""Shift co-ordinators will maintain minimum safety manning levels in plants but others should head home once clarified with their line managers,"" it said. The pitch at Keswick Rugby Club was swamped There was also flood damage to the clubhouse Nine flood warnings,external(where flooding is expected) and 15 flood alerts (where it is possible) were in place on Friday morning. In the 24 hours to 03:00 on Thursday Honister Pass saw 307.4mm (1ft) of rain, according to the Environment Agency. The River Rothay was among those that burst their banks. Allow Twitter content?

Hope Park in Keswick was hit, leaving the statue of Max the Miracle Dog stranded Richard Warren from the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association warned people not to go fell walking during the current conditions. He said: ""It's half-term, Scafell Pike is a bit of a honey pot, there were a lot of walkers out on the road looking very, very wet, the car park had quite a few cars in, so people may have gone up Scafell Pike when the rivers were low. ""But when they come down they will find they won't be able to cross the rivers, so the message really is stay off the mountains."" Allow Twitter content?

Environment Agency teams were monitoring the effect of the rain on rivers, focusing on western and southern parts of the county, ""making sure flood defences work"", he said. Cars got stuck in floodwater near Keswick Alan Goodman, from the Met Office, said the rain was ""on the wane slowly as today unfolds"".

"On Wednesday, the chancellor committed to spending increases worth Â£150bn over three years He pledged nearly Â£2bn to help schools in England catch up from Covid, Â£5.9bn to tackle NHS backlogs and Â£7bn for transport projects But Rishi Sunak's budget is likely to leave middle earners worse off next year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says Labour accuses the chancellor of failing to tackle the ""cost of living crisis"" and criticises a tax cut for banks Responding to concerns over price rises, he says he does not have a ""magic wand"" to make these issues disappear Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband says the Tories have presided over 11 years of wage stagnation, low growth and falling living standards Economic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023 Edited by Hamish Mackay We're ending our live coverage for today. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of the day's main reaction to Rishi Sunak's Budget:  You can read an overview of yesterday's Budgethere, analysis from our economics editorhere, and analysis from our political editorhere. Reality Check Chancellor Rishi Sunak made a number of claims both in his Budget speech and in his round of interviews afterwards. Among them were suggestions that national debt was down, he cut taxes for ""millions"" of the lowest paid, and that he took ""advantage"" of leaving the EU to reform alcohol duty. But are those claims accurate? The BBC Reality Check team hashad a look. Marilyn Taylor asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Sunak has already faced a lot of questions and criticism about the timing of his decision - and should expect more. He argues thatlowering air passenger duty on flightsbetween airports in the four UK nations is balanced by increasing the rate of tax from April 2023 on very long-haul flights (over 5,500 miles). He also says domestic flights only account for 4% of total aviation emissions. In the end, it looks like it was a balancing act for the chancellor between the government's levelling-up agenda and climate considerations. COP26 will be based at the SEC campus in the centre of Glasgow Chancellor Rishi Sunak made the ""wrong choice"" announcing a cut in charges on domestic flights days before the global COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, says Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish first minister adds there is ""much to be disappointed in"" with the package of measures in his Budget. She says the Air Passenger Duty (APD) cut is not one the Scottish government would have introduced, adding: ""But it is for them [UK government] to defend that in the months to come."" Ahead of COP26, ""all of us have an obligation to think about how we contribute to reaching net zero and saving the planet"", Sturgeon says. You can read more about the impact of the Budget on environmental issueshere. Peter Ovenstone asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The question of whether any benefit from arise in the National Living Wagewill be offset by the increase in National Insurance and changes to Universal Credit rules is a good one. But it's a tricky one to answer because people in different circumstances will be affected to a differing extent. It is the case thatthe boost of a rising minimum wageis lessened bythe tapering of universal credit,the upcoming national insurance increase, and - crucially -the forecast rise in prices. Economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies say the policies taking effect will ultimately be progressive. In other words, good for low earners. For those without a job though, the outlook is much more precarious.  Former housing secretary Robert Jenrick says the Treasury is ""simply not willing"" to do more to help leaseholders remove unsafe cladding from buildings. During the Budget, the chancellor said Â£5bn would be given to remove unsafe cladding from the highest-risk buildings. But homeowners affected were unimpressed, saying the government must be ""operating in a time warp"" to have announced the same Â£5bn funding for a fourth time. Jenrick says: ""The choice for the government is: what is the balance between the state paying, and then trying to recoup as much of that as possible from the developers through taxes, and the leaseholder."" He says while leaseholders may find the current set up ""extremely unfair"", the only other option was for taxpayer to step in ""and massively increase that Â£5bn fund"". ""At the moment - and I fought this battle for a couple of years - the Treasury, the government, is simply not willing to do that,"" he says. You can read more about claddinghere. Finance Minister Conor Murphy says NI's budget allocation is ""nowhere near"" enough Rishi Sunak claims his budget allocation represents the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998. But Northern Ireland's finance minister Conor Murphy says it will create ""significant challenges"". He disputes the chancellor's claim that the nation will get an extra Â£1.6bn per year for public services. Murphy says it will amount to Â£1.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - ""nowhere near"" what is required. Read BBC News NI economics & business editor John Campbell'sfull analysis here With so many announcements yesterday, you'd be forgiven for feeling a bit overwhelmed. But don't worry, we're on hand to help you catch up: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The UK's pandemic house price boom is forecast to come to an end, but property prices are still expected to rise in each of the next five years. Some surveys have recorded house prices rising at a rate of more than 10% a year but the government's official, independent, forecasters have said this will drop to 3.5% by 2026. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also says that mortgage rates are likely to rise from record lows. Rent for tenants will also go up. It means potential first-time buyers are facing another period of difficulty if they wish to buy a home. Read more here. While many of the decisions about tax and spending in Scotland are made in Edinburgh, the UK Budget still has a big impact - well beyond the simple question of how much cash goes into Holyrood's coffers. Sunak has opted to turn on the spending taps across every government department, and this means Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will have more cash to allocate when she sets out her own draft budget in December. This is because many of the eye-catching announcements in the UK budget relate to matters which are devolved to Holyrood - for example the Â£24bn earmarked for housing or the Â£21bn for roads. Read more herefrom BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim on what the Autumn Budget means for Scotland. The SNP's economy spokeswoman Alison Thewliss says she's concerned the Budget doesn't go far enough to support the hospitality sector. Thewliss says a few pence off a pint ""does nothing"" to support the sector hard hit by the pandemic. She says it ""baffles"" her why the chancellor has ignored calls to keep the reduced 12.5% for VAT for hospitality. The MP for Glasgow Central also says all eyes are on her constituency due to upcoming climate summit COP26, which begins in the Scottish city on Sunday. But she says the Budget and Spending Review ""falls awfully short of the ambition required to tackle this global climate challenge"". Paul Amphlett asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Indeed a lot can change by then, butlong-term policy announcementsin a Budget are nothing new. The shake-up of alcohol duty, for example, is quite complex and will need to go through a consultation and scrutiny process before its planned introduction in 2023. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget has promised a cash boost for Welsh public services and more money for low-paid workers on universal credit. He also promised to increase Welsh government budgets by an average of Â£2.5bn a year. Just over Â£120m from the levelling-up fund was also earmarked for 10 Welsh projects. But the Labour-led Welsh government has accused the Treasury of leaving ""clear gaps in funding"". It says its own calls for cash to tackle coal-tips or additional funding for rail infrastructure have gone unanswered. Read BBC Wales political reporter David Deans'full analysis here Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the Budget is a ""blueprint for a stronger Britain"". Speaking in the Commons, he says: ""It's a country where if you have innovative ideas you will get the support you need to turn it from a dream into reality. ""It's a country where if your talent is nurtured and your skills are honed you will get the support and the ongoing interest and engagement - strong engagement - from the government. ""It's a country where if someone does an honest day's work they will receive a decent wage."" He says ""many of us have listened to the litany of woe and despair for too long"" and now feel optimistic, adding: ""We are very excited about the future of our country."" A strong rebound will be achieved, not by ""splashing cash indiscriminately"", he says, but by spending taxpayers' money wisely - ""to make the choice to foster an environment that encourages innovation and growth"". The government says tax hikes are needed to raise money to help the NHS and fix social care We brought you reaction earlier from theInstitute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which says the Budget will produce ""real pain""for lower income households. No 10 has responded, saying the government is taking on the long-term challenges facing the country. A spokesman for the prime minister says: ""I think this is a Budget and a settlement which is aimed to boost our economy - they are targeted interventions towards those who need it. ""We have taken the difficult decision to raise taxes on things like the [health and social care] levy in a fair and progressive way and that importantly is to raise money both to help our NHS and to finally fix the long-standing problem of social care. ""That's something that the public have been calling on successive governments to do for a number of years now - and it is this government that is taking on these challenges to get them fixed for the long term."" Rishi Sunak's Budget offers an ""age of stagnation"" rather than optimism, once the ""Instagram filter"" is removed, says Ed Miliband. Speaking in the Commons, the shadow business secretary says there has been 11 years of ""low growth, stagnant wages, falling living standards"" under the Conservatives, with the Budget failing to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. He says the Budget is ""already unravelling"" less than 24 hours since it was delivered ""because of the chasm between the claims of ministers and the reality that working people face"". ""It's clear he [Sunak] is living on a totally different planet,"" he adds. Miliband tells MPs: ""Yesterday we saw raid upon raid on the living standards of working people. Council tax hikes hidden in the Budget documents, not announced by the chancellor. ""A stealth raid on the self-employed worth Â£1.7bn over the coming five years, not announced by the chancellor. ""And of course the national insurance hike on ordinary families confirmed."" The ""most shameful"" part of the Budget, he says, was the government's ""refusal to reverse"" the cut to universal credit, which saw the removal of Â£20 weekly uplift. Downing Street reacts toanalysis by the Resolution Foundationthat suggests household tax bills will be Â£3,000 higher after the Budget compared with when Boris Johnson became prime minister, saying it is ""not a fair reflection"" of the fiscal situation. The PM's spokesman tells reporters: ""The Â£3,000 household tax figure you've quoted isn't a fair reflection of how tax is levied because it appears to include business and employer taxes - and those aren't directly applicable to households."" He says the same report also shows that government policies are ""set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution"" and that higher taxes will mostly impact the middle to higher income households. ""The decisions made by this government will give households nearly Â£500 per year extra on average, with the poorest receiving more than Â£1,000, and that's before we factor in things like wage growth,"" he adds. The director of theResolution Foundationthink tank, Torsten Bell, says themove to cut the weekly extra Â£20given to universal credit claimants during the pandemic will improve the welfare system - but warns it will help better off UC claimants, while giving nothing to compensate the poorest. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studiessaysmiddle-income families are ""likely to be worse off next year""than they are currently and says a combination of tax increases and high inflation ""over the next several years"" will mean ""very slow growth in living standards"". Shadow chancellorRachel Reevestells BBC Breakfast she welcomes the increases in spending announced by the chancellor yesterday but says it's not the Budget she would have delivered and calls the decision to cut air passenger duty the week before COP26 ""astonishing"". Also speaking to BBC Breakfast,Rishi Sunakdefends the move emphasising the importance of consistency ""with our environmental goals"" but adding: ""We're doing this to support domestic aviation, and regional airports will benefit from this."" BBC News Channel With changes to alcohol duty, business rates and wages, let's look at how the Budget will affect bars. Martin Greenhow, who owns a chain of five bars across the Midlands and north of England, says the Budget is ""a mixed bag"". ""The business rates discount for next year is obviously very welcome,"" he says. ""But ultimately we have to face the fact that it will be more than offset by the rise in the national living wage."" On alcohol duty -which will rise on stronger drinks- he says: ""I'm sure for some it will be a great help. ""For ourselves, we're a cocktail bar, so obviously we're probably at the strong end of the drinks spectrum. So we're probably going to see a bit more pain from that."" He says some in the industry think this could mean the price of a pint will rise by 20-30p, but warns that he still needs to see the details. ""We're loath to increase prices,"" he says, but adds the hospitality industry ""isn't in a position to absorb these debts"". ""That has to be passed on, because otherwise businesses fail.""

Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Climate activists have been campaigning for greener policies in the run-up to the climate summit COP26 Rishi Sunak didn't explicitly mention the climate in his Budget speech. But let's look at how his plans could impact the environment: Flying Stopping flying is one of the single best things you can do for the climate - but flying within the UK will become cheaper, thanks to a halving of air passenger duty. Sunakdefended the decision, saying he was removing an anomaly in which people were taxed more to fly in the UK than to Europe. Surveys consistently show that people want frequent fliers to be taxed extra. Home insulation The UK won't meet climate change targets with its current leaky housing stock, but campaign group Insulate Britain hasn't managed to convince the chancellor that upgrading homes is a good job-creating infrastructure investment. ""With the COP26 conference just days away, the chancellor's announcements felt like they were from a different planet and a different time,"" says Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive at the UK Green Buildings Council. Railways The government's investment in rail has been widely welcomed, along with a major input of Â£4.8bn to improve public transport within cities. The Railway Industry Association has welcomed the extra funding, but its chief executive Darren Caplan says there were missed opportunities with regards to ""electrification and fleet orders of hydrogen and battery trains"".

"Measures introduced since Boris Johnson came to power, including Wednesday's Budget, will increase the UK's tax burden by Â£3,000 a year per household. according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank found policies announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak had boosted incomes by 2.8% for the poorest fifth of households. However, households on middle incomes would take a 2% hit, it added. Mr Sunak said his Budget had ""cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid"". That claim was challenged by the Foundation's figures. It said the changes to the amount families can keep from their earnings if they are on universal credit only partially offset the effect of withdrawing the Â£20-a-week boost during the pandemic. On average, recipients would lose Â£800 a year, it calculated. The Â£3,000 figure produced by the Resolution Foundation includes business taxes, which are regularly passed on to consumers. Of the 4.4 million households on universal credit, about three-quarters (3.2 million households) will be worse off as a result of decisions to take away the Â£20-a week-uplift, despite the chancellor's new universal credit measures. But 1.2 million households would be better off by Â£900 a year than before the Budget. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Rishi Sunak: The taxman takes the strain Responding to the Foundation's calculations, a Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: ""It's misleading to imply that households will immediately face a Â£3,000 tax hit, because this figure appears to include business and employers' taxes which aren't applicable directly to households. ""The same report shows that the government's policies are set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution and that higher taxes will mostly impact middle-to-higher income households. ""This government's decisions have been worth nearly Â£500 per year extra to households on average, and more than Â£1,000 for the poorest households - and that's before factoring in wage growth, including the rise in the National Living Wage."" Talking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Sunak said pressures on the economy ""will be with us for a while"", but that the government's plan was working and ""we can face the future with a bit more confidence"". He also said that wages were rising and that he had ""cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid people"", adding that it was his job to be concerned about inflation and his new fiscal rules were ""how we build up resilience"". Government figures show that when you take account of investment in public services, the average earner has seen improvements worth Â£500 a year overall. Setting out the Budget on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said his plans were focused on the ""post-Covid"" era and would pave the way for an ""economy of higher wages, higher skills, and rising productivity"". He told MPs the higher tax burden was down to the pandemic. ""Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,"" he said in his Budget speech. He committed to spending increases of Â£150bn over three years, including nearly Â£2bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, Â£6bn to tackle NHS backlogs and Â£7bn for transport projects. He also announced that the universal credit ""taper"" rate would be cut by 8% no later than 1 December, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every Â£1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. Meanwhile, the National Living Wage will increase next year by 6.6%, to Â£9.50 an hour. Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, welcomed the increases in spending announced by Mr Sunak, but said there were areas that gave her ""cause for concern"". Highlighting the need for greater investment in education, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If we are going to grow the economy sustainably, we have got to invest in our young people. ""Unless we ensure that kids catch up from that missed-out education [during the pandemic], there will be a long-term cost to our economy."" The Foundation's overnight analysis of the Budget and Spending Review 2021 revealed a deteriorating picture on family finances, with household incomes set to stagnate as a result of rising inflation. ""Higher taxes aren't a surprise, given the UK is combining fiscal conservatism with an ageing society and a slow-growing economy. But it is the end of low-tax conservatism, with the tax take rising by Â£3,000 per household by the middle of this decade,"" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. With higher growth, inflation and public spending than previously expected, combined with tax rises already in train, the Foundation warns that the UK could be set for a flat recovery for household living standards. The combined effect of universal credit changes, alcohol and fuel duties, higher council tax, income tax and national insurance delivered a 2.8% boost to the incomes of the poorest households. But middle-income households will see incomes drop by 2% and the richest fifth of households will suffer a 3.1% hit by the middle of the decade, the Foundation warned. In the wider population, wages are set to fall next year after inflation. It means the last decade has been the weakest decade for pay growth since the 1930s. By May 2024, real wages will have grown by just 2.4% since 2008 -  compared with a 38% real wage increase between 1992 and 2008. ""The chancellor got some really good news for the public finances yesterday - lower borrowing, because the economy's doing slightly better than we all though six months ago. But good news for public finances wasn't good news for household finances,"" the Foundation's Mr Bell told BBC Breakfast. ""That's because higher inflation that actually helped the chancellor with his borrowing figures is obviously hurting household budgets, and that's why the Office for Budget Responsibility expects household incomes and wages to actually not grow at all in the next year. ""So that's going to be really bad news for everyone worrying about their own budgets."" Price rises could hit highest rate in 30 years Did you get what you wanted from the Budget?

"Wednesday's Budget - which saw tax and spending rise to record levels - represents a major shift in Tory philosophy, a minister has claimed. The party has traditionally tried to cut taxes and keep spending down. Treasury Secretary Simon Clarke said it was still committed to low taxes but made ""no apologies"" for increasing public spending. Rishi Sunak told MPs the higher tax burden is down to the ""unprecedented crisis"" of the pandemic. But the chancellor also turned on the spending taps in his Budget, after being widely expected to make cuts to in many government departments to help pay down the deficit. Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Sunak not calling time on hefty spending He committed to spending increases of Â£150bn over three years, including nearly Â£2bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, Â£6bn to tackle NHS backlogs and Â£7bn for transport projects. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said the spending plans were ""more similar"" to those of the Labour governments in the 2000s than those of George Osborne - a former Conservative chancellor. Mr Clarke told BBC Newsnight: ""The chancellor was very open about the fact that this is something of a philosophical shift. ""What we want to see is to get the economy turbocharged, unlock productivity, and to deliver growth more evenly across UK. That does require some upfront spending."" Mr Sunak has promised more money to help the NHS tackle the backlog of cases Mr Sunak has sought to calm the fears of some Conservative MPs that the party has abandoned its core economic principles. ""Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,"" he said in his Budget speech. ""But now, we have a choice,"" he said, adding ""do we want to live in a country where the response to every question is: ""what is the government going to do about it?"" ""Or do we choose to recognise that government has limits, that government should have limits."" He later insisted to ITV's Robert Peston that this was not ""empty rhetoric"", adding that both he and the prime minister wanted to deliver lower taxes by the end of the Parliament. He also told a meeting of backbench Conservative MPs on Wednesday night that ""in the future every marginal pound should be put into lowering taxes"". Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told ITV News that it was important to raise money ""but not in the way the government is doing it"". Rachel Reeves accused the chancellor and prime minister of running a ""con game"" She said the government was introducing big taxes but said ""those taxes are not falling on the banks - bankers got a tax cut"" in reference to a 5% cut in the surcharge levied on banks' profits. She added that Labour would raise taxes on ""online giants who aren't paying their fair share"". Just before the chancellor got to his feet, one former minister on the right of the party said he hoped this would be a pivot moment: back to the kind of government action, where Conservatives were seeking to shrink the state, seeking to reduce taxes, seeking to pull back from some of the very big government moves they made because of the pandemic. Rishi Sunak had a little bit of extra cash to play with, but instead of using that wriggle room he had, to signal the government was going to become smaller, in fact he staked his post out in a landscape where big government is here to stay, and eye-watering levels of tax are here to stay for the foreseeable future (although he seemed to dangle a promise of tax cuts before the next election). That has created Conservative tensions but clearly it's the political calculation of him and Boris Johnson that it's the right thing to do. Mr Sunak also used his Budget to repeat pre-announced measures, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50. According to Office for Budget Responsibility figures, household disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year. Economic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023. New Budget measures included: A real-terms rise in spending for every government department A freeze on fuel duty Funding per pupil in England's schools is to be restored to 2010 levels over the next three years A 5% cut to the extra corporation tax banks have to pay to ""maintain competitiveness"" An extra Â£2.2bn for courts, prisons and probation services, including Â£500m to reduce courts backlogs A cut in air passenger duty for internal UK flights - and a tax rise on ""ultra long haul"" flights More support for industrial research and development And the chancellor scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023. The government has faced strong criticism over its decision to reduce the universal credit benefit by Â£20-a-week. Mr Sunak did not offer to maintain the Â£20 uplift - introduced during the pandemic - but instead announced that the ""taper"" would be cut so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every Â£1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. Ms Reeves said that would not make up for the wider cuts to universal credit which affected five million families.

"The Cornelis Gert Jan, which is owned by MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, was detained when fishing in French waters A British trawler has been seized by France and another has been fined, amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. French maritime minister Annick Girardin said the ships were cautioned during checks off Le Havre overnight. She said the first did not comply right away and the second was not allowed to fish in French waters so was detained. No 10 said it was watching events closely and wanted France and EU talks but was ready to respond appropriately. Earlier, the environment secretary said he was ""urgently"" investigating the situation in relation to the detained vessel - which has been named as the Cornelis Gert Jan. Responding to an Urgent Commons Question from the SNP, George Eustice said the boat was on a list provided by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) initially provided to the European Union. He insisted the European Union did grant a licence to the vessel but it was ""unclear"" why, according to reports, it was subsequently withdrawn from the list. Mr Eustice said he was awaiting further details from Marine Scotland and was expecting a response in the ""next hour or so"". Deidre Brock, the SNP's environment spokesperson, said it was not good enough that the environment secretary had so little information. Jersey offers 162 fishing licences after ultimatum Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, which owns the Cornelis, said the crew of its vessel were ""in good spirits"" after it was ""ordered into a French port while legally fishing for scallop in French waters"". The captain was questioned after leaving the boat with French authorities and being given legal representation by the company. MacDuff Shellfish confirmed the captain had been released and returned to the ship, but the Cornelius was ""not at liberty to leave"" the port while the investigation was ongoing. The firm's Andrew Brown said the crew would remain on board until its release. He said Macduff's ""fishing activity [was] entirely legal"" and it appeared the Cornelis, based at Shoreham, in West Sussex, had been ""caught up"" in the ongoing UK-France post-Brexit fishing row. This video can not be played Watch: British trawler Cornelis Gert Jan is held in Le Havre. Mr Brown warned that without ""a speedy resolution"", the vessel's catch could be confiscated by the French authorities, and called on the UK government to ""defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet"". The firm would ""vigorously defend"" itself against any claims, but its ""priority concern"" was for the welfare of the vessel's crew, he said. Ms Girardin hadsaid on Twitter,externalthe trawler was found to be fishing in the Bay of Seine without the proper licences. The minister said checks on the British vessels were standard during the scallop fishing season. But she added they had also been undertaken against ""the backdrop of the tightening of controls in the Channel, in the context of discussions on licenses with the United Kingdom and the European Commission"". In naval parlance, this is called a shot across the bows. Technically, the French checks on UK trawlers in the Channel overnight do not form part of the raft of retaliatory measures announced in the fishing row. But there should be no doubt they are intended as a message about what is to come. From Tuesday, British and Channel Islands fishing boats will not be allowed to offload their catch at French ports. But that is the least of it.  Only 5% of UK seafood exports to France arrive in this way. The rest comes by freight. Potentially far more disruptive will be intensified controls at Calais and other entry points for UK trade by ferry and tunnel. The French authorities will be conducting what they call a ""grÃ¨ve de zÃ¨le"" - in other words becoming suddenly punctilious, thorough and on the look out for infractions. And it is not just fish imports which will be checked, but everything. The aim will be to create long tail-backs which will play on the news channels - reminding UK viewers of the costs of go-it-alone. France had warned it would block British boats from some ports next week - as well as tightening checks on UK boats and trucks - if a post-Brexit dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November. On Wednesday evening, it issued its ultimatum, saying it would begin to impose ""targeted measures"" from next Tuesday, including preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports and more checks on UK goods. France has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as itpreviously threatened in May. Mr Eustice said threats of sanctions made by France were ""disappointing and disproportionate"" and appeared to breach the post-Brexit deal and international law. He appealed to MPs to ""remain calm"", saying the UK would not get into a ""retaliatory tit-for-tat"" but warned of a possible ""appropriate and calibrated response"" if France carried out its threats. This video can not be played George Eustice says France's response has been ""disappointing and disproportionate"" Mr Eustice rejected French claims that the process for applying for fishing licences had been slow and difficult, saying officials had granted 98% of post-Brexit licence applications from European boats to fish in UK waters. He said more were expected to be granted following ""constructive"" talks with the European Commission and that he had told the French and the Commission that the UK's ""door remains ever open"". French politician and member of President Macron's En Marche party, Bruno Bonnell, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that French fishermen were ""losing 25% of their business because of regulation"". He said ""in the Brexit treaty we were not supposed to reach this point of tension"" and disagreed with the licensing figures quoted by Mr Eustice, saying 200 licences had been granted. Mr Bonnell argued French authorities ""have ways to retaliate if you push too hard"" and he ""would not be surprised if by next week we see significant advances"" in discussions. The UK maintains the rejected applications which sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show they had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters. A meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licencesto fish in Jersey's waters from Friday. The government of Jersey said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protestedoutside the port of St Helier on the island. Labour's shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said the tensions were a result of the government losing control of negotiations and there was real concern ""the botched Brexit deal"" was going to lead to more clashes.

"This video can not be played With 76 turbines in operation, Wales' largest onshore wind farm needs constant upkeep. Buying fruit and vegetables out of season should be seen as a luxury in future, Wales' climate change minister has said. It comes as part of a major new strategy to tackle Wales' carbon footprint and encourage people live more environmentally-friendly lives. People are being asked to cut energy use, drive less and buy local food. The Welsh government said a ""decade of action"" was required to meet climate change targets. It comes as ministers prepare to travel to Glasgow for the COP26 summit. They said their new plan was the start of a ""journey"" towards a net zero economy by the middle of the century. But it focuses specifically on the period between 2021 and 2025, when a 37% reduction in planet-warming gases is required to meet the Welsh government's second carbon budget. The measures will cost an estimated Â£4.2bn to implement over five years. How are we doing with cutting emissions? Should I buy an electric vehicle? What can you do to reduce your carbon footprint? Wales' Climate Change Minister Julie James toldRadio Wales Breakfast: ""If you're buying oranges out of season, they should be a luxury treat, not something you take for granted. ""With our global supply chains, we've lost track of that. ""It keeps our local farmers happy, local industries working well and makes our world a more sustainable place for our children and our grandchildren."" Every citizen, community, group and business in Wales is being asked ""to embed the climate emergency in the way they think, work, play and travel"". But what does the plan say? We can help reduce emissions by changing how we use gas and electricity at home Greenhouse gas emissions from power stations will be ""virtually"" eliminated by 2035, the Welsh government claims. New fossil fuel plants have been banned, and gas generation will be phased out. Only stations that have managed to install carbon capture technology will be able to continue to operate after 2035. The vision is for a ""high renewables system"" - so more wind farms, solar power and tidal schemes. New targets for green energy are to be set out - but are not in this plan. Households are encouraged to do the basics to save power like switching off lights, taking up the offer of a smart meter and choosing the most energy-efficient appliances. Taking public transport instead of driving a car is one way of reducing your carbon footprint Wales has struggled to make a dent in its emissions from transport - with just a 6% fall since 1990. Ministers want 35% of trips to be taken by walking, cycling or public transport by 2025, and 39% by 2030. They are also targeting a 10% cut in the number of car miles travelled per person by the end of the decade. ""Major investment"" to make public transport more attractive is promised. By 2025 all new-build affordable homes in Wales will be fitted with green technologies so they do not produce emissions. The government expects private developers to adopt its net zero standards too. But decarbonising Wales' 1.43 million existing homes is the real challenge - the government says about 148,000 will have received retrofit measures to make them more energy efficient by 2025. Michael Leach says he is proud to be part of a greener future The 2020s will be spent working with industry, ""developing and scaling up"" options such as carbon-capture and storage technology and hydrogen fuel. Ministers said this would help them understand how feasible these were - and that it was important to focus on behavioural changes in the meantime. High above the Rhondda at Pen y Cymoedd - the largest onshore windfarm in Wales - they've been eagerly awaiting the plan's details. ""We are running out of time to really take action on climate change,"" said Berry Jordan, of Vattenfall UK. ""We need to work out what the activities are that help us meet net zero and decarbonise our lives and work - from powering our cars, to heating our houses - all of that needs to move to other systems and so we've all got to embrace change."" Turbine technician Michael Leach said he was pleased to be employed in a job that was ""part of the green future that we have to come to accept"". ""It's great to know that we've got job security here - it's a good job to have, especially in south Wales,"" he added. There are 9.5 million sheep and lambs in Wales and 1.1 million cattle and calves, which add to greenhouse gas emissions Over the next 20 years the ambition is to get people eating more healthily and sustainably. This means ""a substantial increase in fruit and vegetables and a decrease in red and processed meats and dairy products"" the plan says. The government says changes in behaviour by consumers and farmers could release some land from agriculture. It wants 10% of farming land to be ""shared"" by 2050 - so new trees and hedgerows can be planted. 43,000 hectares (106,255 acres) of new woodland is to be planted by 2030, and 180,000 hectares (444,789 acres) by 2050. People should buy oranges out of season ""as a luxury treat"" and not take them for granted, says minister Councils, health boards and other government-backed bodies will be expected to publish plans by 2023 that could see them reach net zero by 2030. There are plans to force businesses to recycle more to help Wales getfrom thirdto the top of global leader boards on tackling waste. A wide range of single-use plastics are to be banned. While the scale of the challenge ""cannot be under-estimated"", it will lead to highly skilled and well-paid jobs and opportunities to redeploy employees from traditional industries, the government said. The plan pulls together 123 policies and proposals, though very few are new announcements. Throughout the document, ministers call on the UK government to take action to ""to unlock a green future in Wales"". Government advisers have said that by 2050, around 60% of the changes needed in Wales are in areas under the UK government's control - from subsidies to encourage the take up of electric vehicles, to upgrading the National Grid. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""While the UK cannot reach its targets without Welsh action, we cannot reach our ambition without the UK government playing its fair part. ""We believe that by working together and taking collective action we can deliver a stronger, fairer and greener Wales for future generations.""

"Petrol stations in many parts of China have begun rationing diesel amid rising costs and falling supplies. Some truck drivers are having to wait entire days to refuel, according to posts on social media site Weibo. China is currently in the midst of amassive power crunch, as coal and natural gas shortages have closed factories and left homes without power. And this latest issue is only likely to contribute to an ongoing global supply chain crisis, say analysts. ""The current diesel shortages seem to be affecting long distance transportation businesses which could include goods meant for markets outside of China,"" said Mattie Bekink, China Director at the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""Depending on the duration and intensity of this crunch, we could well see this contribute to the global supply chain challenges."" The global supply chain crisis has been largely driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, with demand surging as economies re-open. The shortages hitting countries around the world Why Christmas may be stuck in a shipping container In China, trucks are only being allowed to fill up 100 litres each - about 10% of their capacity, a truck dealer from Shijiazhuang city in Hebei province told Chinese business news service Caixin. In other parts of the country, reports suggest rations are even tighter with drivers only allowed to buy up to 25 litres. Meanwhile, in the city of Fuyang, about a seven hour drive south of the key transportation hub of Shijiazhuang, Caixin reports petrol stations are limiting purchases or charging drivers surcharges of up to 300 yuan ($47, Â£34) to fill up their tanks. ""After going to a few [petrol] stations, there is no more diesel, and prices will continue to rise, and large trucks running logistics will not be able to refuel,"" one Weibo user wrote. Another also bemoaned the impact on inflation and deliveries. ""Do you get the feeling that food has become more expensive and the express delivery is slower?  It would be better to buy less on 11/11,"" referring to Alibaba's Single's Day, typically one of the biggest days of the year in China's shopping calendar. Aidan Yao, a senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers, told the BBC while the market is well aware of China's coal shortage, the ""diesel problem is new"". ""All fossil fuels have seen a price renaissance lately as the underinvestment in these fuel sources has created a shortfall of supply at a time when demand is surging,"" he said. ""Oil, gas, coal prices have all moved in tandem and are through the roof."" Oil prices have hit their highest levels since 2014 in recent weeks, causing fuel crises in places such asEuropeandthe UK. Part of this has been driven by coal and natural gas shortages in countries like China and India, which analysts predict will see users switch to oil for power generation and heating. Such demand could boost overall crude consumption by more than half a million barrels of oil a day. ""This is merely the latest manifestation of shortages impacting China,"" Jeremy Stevens, Chief China Economist at Standard Bank told the BBC from Beijing. He said companies are already turning to diesel-fuelled generators to keep their factories open during the power crunch. ""The heart of the matter is the energy crisis,"" he said. Both Mr Yao and Mr Stevens warned that these current power crises show the dangers of switching to renewables too quickly. ""The path to net zero is treacherous and the journey needs to be planned carefully,"" Mr Yao said.

"On Wednesday, the chancellor committed to spending increases worth Â£150bn over three years He pledged nearly Â£2bn to help schools in England catch up from Covid, Â£5.9bn to tackle NHS backlogs and Â£7bn for transport projects But Rishi Sunak's budget is likely to leave middle earners worse off next year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says Labour accuses the chancellor of failing to tackle the ""cost of living crisis"" and criticises a tax cut for banks Responding to concerns over price rises, he says he does not have a ""magic wand"" to make these issues disappear Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband says the Tories have presided over 11 years of wage stagnation, low growth and falling living standards Economic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023 Edited by Hamish Mackay We're ending our live coverage for today. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of the day's main reaction to Rishi Sunak's Budget:  You can read an overview of yesterday's Budgethere, analysis from our economics editorhere, and analysis from our political editorhere. Reality Check Chancellor Rishi Sunak made a number of claims both in his Budget speech and in his round of interviews afterwards. Among them were suggestions that national debt was down, he cut taxes for ""millions"" of the lowest paid, and that he took ""advantage"" of leaving the EU to reform alcohol duty. But are those claims accurate? The BBC Reality Check team hashad a look. Marilyn Taylor asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Sunak has already faced a lot of questions and criticism about the timing of his decision - and should expect more. He argues thatlowering air passenger duty on flightsbetween airports in the four UK nations is balanced by increasing the rate of tax from April 2023 on very long-haul flights (over 5,500 miles). He also says domestic flights only account for 4% of total aviation emissions. In the end, it looks like it was a balancing act for the chancellor between the government's levelling-up agenda and climate considerations. COP26 will be based at the SEC campus in the centre of Glasgow Chancellor Rishi Sunak made the ""wrong choice"" announcing a cut in charges on domestic flights days before the global COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, says Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish first minister adds there is ""much to be disappointed in"" with the package of measures in his Budget. She says the Air Passenger Duty (APD) cut is not one the Scottish government would have introduced, adding: ""But it is for them [UK government] to defend that in the months to come."" Ahead of COP26, ""all of us have an obligation to think about how we contribute to reaching net zero and saving the planet"", Sturgeon says. You can read more about the impact of the Budget on environmental issueshere. Peter Ovenstone asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The question of whether any benefit from arise in the National Living Wagewill be offset by the increase in National Insurance and changes to Universal Credit rules is a good one. But it's a tricky one to answer because people in different circumstances will be affected to a differing extent. It is the case thatthe boost of a rising minimum wageis lessened bythe tapering of universal credit,the upcoming national insurance increase, and - crucially -the forecast rise in prices. Economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies say the policies taking effect will ultimately be progressive. In other words, good for low earners. For those without a job though, the outlook is much more precarious.  Former housing secretary Robert Jenrick says the Treasury is ""simply not willing"" to do more to help leaseholders remove unsafe cladding from buildings. During the Budget, the chancellor said Â£5bn would be given to remove unsafe cladding from the highest-risk buildings. But homeowners affected were unimpressed, saying the government must be ""operating in a time warp"" to have announced the same Â£5bn funding for a fourth time. Jenrick says: ""The choice for the government is: what is the balance between the state paying, and then trying to recoup as much of that as possible from the developers through taxes, and the leaseholder."" He says while leaseholders may find the current set up ""extremely unfair"", the only other option was for taxpayer to step in ""and massively increase that Â£5bn fund"". ""At the moment - and I fought this battle for a couple of years - the Treasury, the government, is simply not willing to do that,"" he says. You can read more about claddinghere. Finance Minister Conor Murphy says NI's budget allocation is ""nowhere near"" enough Rishi Sunak claims his budget allocation represents the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998. But Northern Ireland's finance minister Conor Murphy says it will create ""significant challenges"". He disputes the chancellor's claim that the nation will get an extra Â£1.6bn per year for public services. Murphy says it will amount to Â£1.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - ""nowhere near"" what is required. Read BBC News NI economics & business editor John Campbell'sfull analysis here With so many announcements yesterday, you'd be forgiven for feeling a bit overwhelmed. But don't worry, we're on hand to help you catch up: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The UK's pandemic house price boom is forecast to come to an end, but property prices are still expected to rise in each of the next five years. Some surveys have recorded house prices rising at a rate of more than 10% a year but the government's official, independent, forecasters have said this will drop to 3.5% by 2026. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also says that mortgage rates are likely to rise from record lows. Rent for tenants will also go up. It means potential first-time buyers are facing another period of difficulty if they wish to buy a home. Read more here. While many of the decisions about tax and spending in Scotland are made in Edinburgh, the UK Budget still has a big impact - well beyond the simple question of how much cash goes into Holyrood's coffers. Sunak has opted to turn on the spending taps across every government department, and this means Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will have more cash to allocate when she sets out her own draft budget in December. This is because many of the eye-catching announcements in the UK budget relate to matters which are devolved to Holyrood - for example the Â£24bn earmarked for housing or the Â£21bn for roads. Read more herefrom BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim on what the Autumn Budget means for Scotland. The SNP's economy spokeswoman Alison Thewliss says she's concerned the Budget doesn't go far enough to support the hospitality sector. Thewliss says a few pence off a pint ""does nothing"" to support the sector hard hit by the pandemic. She says it ""baffles"" her why the chancellor has ignored calls to keep the reduced 12.5% for VAT for hospitality. The MP for Glasgow Central also says all eyes are on her constituency due to upcoming climate summit COP26, which begins in the Scottish city on Sunday. But she says the Budget and Spending Review ""falls awfully short of the ambition required to tackle this global climate challenge"". Paul Amphlett asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Indeed a lot can change by then, butlong-term policy announcementsin a Budget are nothing new. The shake-up of alcohol duty, for example, is quite complex and will need to go through a consultation and scrutiny process before its planned introduction in 2023. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget has promised a cash boost for Welsh public services and more money for low-paid workers on universal credit. He also promised to increase Welsh government budgets by an average of Â£2.5bn a year. Just over Â£120m from the levelling-up fund was also earmarked for 10 Welsh projects. But the Labour-led Welsh government has accused the Treasury of leaving ""clear gaps in funding"". It says its own calls for cash to tackle coal-tips or additional funding for rail infrastructure have gone unanswered. Read BBC Wales political reporter David Deans'full analysis here Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the Budget is a ""blueprint for a stronger Britain"". Speaking in the Commons, he says: ""It's a country where if you have innovative ideas you will get the support you need to turn it from a dream into reality. ""It's a country where if your talent is nurtured and your skills are honed you will get the support and the ongoing interest and engagement - strong engagement - from the government. ""It's a country where if someone does an honest day's work they will receive a decent wage."" He says ""many of us have listened to the litany of woe and despair for too long"" and now feel optimistic, adding: ""We are very excited about the future of our country."" A strong rebound will be achieved, not by ""splashing cash indiscriminately"", he says, but by spending taxpayers' money wisely - ""to make the choice to foster an environment that encourages innovation and growth"". The government says tax hikes are needed to raise money to help the NHS and fix social care We brought you reaction earlier from theInstitute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which says the Budget will produce ""real pain""for lower income households. No 10 has responded, saying the government is taking on the long-term challenges facing the country. A spokesman for the prime minister says: ""I think this is a Budget and a settlement which is aimed to boost our economy - they are targeted interventions towards those who need it. ""We have taken the difficult decision to raise taxes on things like the [health and social care] levy in a fair and progressive way and that importantly is to raise money both to help our NHS and to finally fix the long-standing problem of social care. ""That's something that the public have been calling on successive governments to do for a number of years now - and it is this government that is taking on these challenges to get them fixed for the long term."" Rishi Sunak's Budget offers an ""age of stagnation"" rather than optimism, once the ""Instagram filter"" is removed, says Ed Miliband. Speaking in the Commons, the shadow business secretary says there has been 11 years of ""low growth, stagnant wages, falling living standards"" under the Conservatives, with the Budget failing to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. He says the Budget is ""already unravelling"" less than 24 hours since it was delivered ""because of the chasm between the claims of ministers and the reality that working people face"". ""It's clear he [Sunak] is living on a totally different planet,"" he adds. Miliband tells MPs: ""Yesterday we saw raid upon raid on the living standards of working people. Council tax hikes hidden in the Budget documents, not announced by the chancellor. ""A stealth raid on the self-employed worth Â£1.7bn over the coming five years, not announced by the chancellor. ""And of course the national insurance hike on ordinary families confirmed."" The ""most shameful"" part of the Budget, he says, was the government's ""refusal to reverse"" the cut to universal credit, which saw the removal of Â£20 weekly uplift. Downing Street reacts toanalysis by the Resolution Foundationthat suggests household tax bills will be Â£3,000 higher after the Budget compared with when Boris Johnson became prime minister, saying it is ""not a fair reflection"" of the fiscal situation. The PM's spokesman tells reporters: ""The Â£3,000 household tax figure you've quoted isn't a fair reflection of how tax is levied because it appears to include business and employer taxes - and those aren't directly applicable to households."" He says the same report also shows that government policies are ""set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution"" and that higher taxes will mostly impact the middle to higher income households. ""The decisions made by this government will give households nearly Â£500 per year extra on average, with the poorest receiving more than Â£1,000, and that's before we factor in things like wage growth,"" he adds. The director of theResolution Foundationthink tank, Torsten Bell, says themove to cut the weekly extra Â£20given to universal credit claimants during the pandemic will improve the welfare system - but warns it will help better off UC claimants, while giving nothing to compensate the poorest. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studiessaysmiddle-income families are ""likely to be worse off next year""than they are currently and says a combination of tax increases and high inflation ""over the next several years"" will mean ""very slow growth in living standards"". Shadow chancellorRachel Reevestells BBC Breakfast she welcomes the increases in spending announced by the chancellor yesterday but says it's not the Budget she would have delivered and calls the decision to cut air passenger duty the week before COP26 ""astonishing"". Also speaking to BBC Breakfast,Rishi Sunakdefends the move emphasising the importance of consistency ""with our environmental goals"" but adding: ""We're doing this to support domestic aviation, and regional airports will benefit from this."" BBC News Channel With changes to alcohol duty, business rates and wages, let's look at how the Budget will affect bars. Martin Greenhow, who owns a chain of five bars across the Midlands and north of England, says the Budget is ""a mixed bag"". ""The business rates discount for next year is obviously very welcome,"" he says. ""But ultimately we have to face the fact that it will be more than offset by the rise in the national living wage."" On alcohol duty -which will rise on stronger drinks- he says: ""I'm sure for some it will be a great help. ""For ourselves, we're a cocktail bar, so obviously we're probably at the strong end of the drinks spectrum. So we're probably going to see a bit more pain from that."" He says some in the industry think this could mean the price of a pint will rise by 20-30p, but warns that he still needs to see the details. ""We're loath to increase prices,"" he says, but adds the hospitality industry ""isn't in a position to absorb these debts"". ""That has to be passed on, because otherwise businesses fail."" Read more about the changes to alcohol dutyhere. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Climate activists have been campaigning for greener policies in the run-up to the climate summit COP26 Rishi Sunak didn't explicitly mention the climate in his Budget speech. But let's look at how his plans could impact the environment: Flying Stopping flying is one of the single best things you can do for the climate - but flying within the UK will become cheaper, thanks to a halving of air passenger duty. Sunakdefended the decision, saying he was removing an anomaly in which people were taxed more to fly in the UK than to Europe. Surveys consistently show that people want frequent fliers to be taxed extra. Home insulation The UK won't meet climate change targets with its current leaky housing stock, but campaign group Insulate Britain hasn't managed to convince the chancellor that upgrading homes is a good job-creating infrastructure investment. ""With the COP26 conference just days away, the chancellor's announcements felt like they were from a different planet and a different time,"" says Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive at the UK Green Buildings Council. Railways The government's investment in rail has been widely welcomed, along with a major input of Â£4.8bn to improve public transport within cities. The Railway Industry Association has welcomed the extra funding, but its chief executive Darren Caplan says there were missed opportunities with regards to ""electrification and fleet orders of hydrogen and battery trains"".

"Measures introduced since Boris Johnson came to power, including Wednesday's Budget, will increase the UK's tax burden by Â£3,000 a year per household. according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank found policies announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak had boosted incomes by 2.8% for the poorest fifth of households. However, households on middle incomes would take a 2% hit, it added. Mr Sunak said his Budget had ""cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid"". That claim was challenged by the Foundation's figures. It said the changes to the amount families can keep from their earnings if they are on universal credit only partially offset the effect of withdrawing the Â£20-a-week boost during the pandemic. On average, recipients would lose Â£800 a year, it calculated. The Â£3,000 figure produced by the Resolution Foundation includes business taxes, which are regularly passed on to consumers. Of the 4.4 million households on universal credit, about three-quarters (3.2 million households) will be worse off as a result of decisions to take away the Â£20-a week-uplift, despite the chancellor's new universal credit measures. But 1.2 million households would be better off by Â£900 a year than before the Budget. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Rishi Sunak: The taxman takes the strain Responding to the Foundation's calculations, a Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: ""It's misleading to imply that households will immediately face a Â£3,000 tax hit, because this figure appears to include business and employers' taxes which aren't applicable directly to households. ""The same report shows that the government's policies are set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution and that higher taxes will mostly impact middle-to-higher income households. ""This government's decisions have been worth nearly Â£500 per year extra to households on average, and more than Â£1,000 for the poorest households - and that's before factoring in wage growth, including the rise in the National Living Wage."" Talking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Sunak said pressures on the economy ""will be with us for a while"", but that the government's plan was working and ""we can face the future with a bit more confidence"". He also said that wages were rising and that he had ""cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid people"", adding that it was his job to be concerned about inflation and his new fiscal rules were ""how we build up resilience"". Government figures show that when you take account of investment in public services, the average earner has seen improvements worth Â£500 a year overall. Setting out the Budget on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said his plans were focused on the ""post-Covid"" era and would pave the way for an ""economy of higher wages, higher skills, and rising productivity"". He told MPs the higher tax burden was down to the pandemic. ""Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,"" he said in his Budget speech. He committed to spending increases of Â£150bn over three years, including nearly Â£2bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, Â£6bn to tackle NHS backlogs and Â£7bn for transport projects. He also announced that the universal credit ""taper"" rate would be cut by 8% no later than 1 December, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every Â£1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. Meanwhile, the National Living Wage will increase next year by 6.6%, to Â£9.50 an hour. Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, welcomed the increases in spending announced by Mr Sunak, but said there were areas that gave her ""cause for concern"". Highlighting the need for greater investment in education, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If we are going to grow the economy sustainably, we have got to invest in our young people. ""Unless we ensure that kids catch up from that missed-out education [during the pandemic], there will be a long-term cost to our economy."" The Foundation's overnight analysis of the Budget and Spending Review 2021 revealed a deteriorating picture on family finances, with household incomes set to stagnate as a result of rising inflation. ""Higher taxes aren't a surprise, given the UK is combining fiscal conservatism with an ageing society and a slow-growing economy. But it is the end of low-tax conservatism, with the tax take rising by Â£3,000 per household by the middle of this decade,"" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. With higher growth, inflation and public spending than previously expected, combined with tax rises already in train, the Foundation warns that the UK could be set for a flat recovery for household living standards. The combined effect of universal credit changes, alcohol and fuel duties, higher council tax, income tax and national insurance delivered a 2.8% boost to the incomes of the poorest households. But middle-income households will see incomes drop by 2% and the richest fifth of households will suffer a 3.1% hit by the middle of the decade, the Foundation warned. In the wider population, wages are set to fall next year after inflation. It means the last decade has been the weakest decade for pay growth since the 1930s. By May 2024, real wages will have grown by just 2.4% since 2008 -  compared with a 38% real wage increase between 1992 and 2008. ""The chancellor got some really good news for the public finances yesterday - lower borrowing, because the economy's doing slightly better than we all though six months ago. But good news for public finances wasn't good news for household finances,"" the Foundation's Mr Bell told BBC Breakfast. ""That's because higher inflation that actually helped the chancellor with his borrowing figures is obviously hurting household budgets, and that's why the Office for Budget Responsibility expects household incomes and wages to actually not grow at all in the next year. ""So that's going to be really bad news for everyone worrying about their own budgets."" Price rises could hit highest rate in 30 years Did you get what you wanted from the Budget?

The Foundation's overnight analysis of the Budget and Spending Review 2021 revealed a deteriorating picture on family finances, with household incomes set to stagnate as a result of rising inflation. ""Higher taxes aren't a surprise, given the UK is combining fiscal conservatism with an ageing society and a slow-growing economy. But it is the end of low-tax conservatism, with the tax take rising by Â£3,000 per household by the middle of this decade,"" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. With higher growth, inflation and public spending than previously expected, combined with tax rises already in train, the Foundation warns that the UK could be set for a flat recovery for household living standards. The combined effect of universal credit changes, alcohol and fuel duties, higher council tax, income tax and national insurance delivered a 2.8% boost to the incomes of the poorest households. But middle-income households will see incomes drop by 2% and the richest fifth of households will suffer a 3.1% hit by the middle of the decade, the Foundation warned. In the wider population, wages are set to fall next year after inflation. It means the last decade has been the weakest decade for pay growth since the 1930s. By May 2024, real wages will have grown by just 2.4% since 2008 -  compared with a 38% real wage increase between 1992 and 2008. ""The chancellor got some really good news for the public finances yesterday - lower borrowing, because the economy's doing slightly better than we all though six months ago. But good news for public finances wasn't good news for household finances,"" the Foundation's Mr Bell told BBC Breakfast. ""That's because higher inflation that actually helped the chancellor with his borrowing figures is obviously hurting household budgets, and that's why the Office for Budget Responsibility expects household incomes and wages to actually not grow at all in the next year. ""So that's going to be really bad news for everyone worrying about their own budgets."" Price rises could hit highest rate in 30 years Did you get what you wanted from the Budget?

"The Cornelis Gert Jan, which is owned by MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, was detained when fishing in French waters A British trawler has been seized by France and another has been fined, amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. French maritime minister Annick Girardin said the ships were cautioned during checks off Le Havre overnight.

MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, which owns the Cornelis, said the crew of its vessel were ""in good spirits"" after it was ""ordered into a French port while legally fishing for scallop in French waters"". The captain was questioned after leaving the boat with French authorities and being given legal representation by the company. MacDuff Shellfish confirmed the captain had been released and returned to the ship, but the Cornelius was ""not at liberty to leave"" the port while the investigation was ongoing. The firm's Andrew Brown said the crew would remain on board until its release.

"The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to be dissolved next March ahead of a May election ""Severe"" time pressures could prevent some long-awaited legislation from being passed before the next Stormont election, parties have been warned. The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to be dissolved next March, ahead of an election in May. The assembly speaker has written to MLAs to say at least 30 bills have yet to pass all legislative stages. Alex Maskey said it was ""highly unlikely"" that all of them would make it into law in time.

Speaker Alex Maskey warned it was highly unlikely that all the bills would complete their passage He said the final number of executive and private members' bills has yet to be confirmed. ""This will create severe pressure on assembly and committee time,"" he said. ""It therefore appears highly unlikely that all of the bills which are currently in front of the assembly, or might be submitted, will be able to complete their passage by the end of the mandate.""

""It is the availability of time... which will be the biggest resource constraint in the months ahead,"" he said.

A meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licencesto fish in Jersey's waters from Friday. The government of Jersey said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protestedoutside the port of St Helier on the island. Labour's shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said the tensions were a result of the government losing control of negotiations and there was real concern ""the botched Brexit deal"" was going to lead to more clashes.

"Strike action which threatened to cripple rail services in Scotland during COP26 has been called off after the RMT accepted a pay deal. The union said the offer would provide them with a one year 2.5% pay rise, improved conditions and a Â£300 COP payment for all ScotRail staff. It also means an end to Sunday strikes which have been ongoing since March. ScotRail welcomed the agreement, which comes just four days before the start of the UN climate summit. The Scottish government said it was ""proud"" to have brokered and funded the deal. The announcement was made on Wednesday evening following talks between the trade union and transport bosses. RMT Scotland organiser Michael Hogg told the BBC: ""For the first time in eight and a half months, normality returns to Scotland's trains."" Speaking on theGood Morning Scotland programme, he said the new deal meant efficiency savings, which had been a sticking point, were off the agenda at least for a year. ""The [original] two-year deal included efficiency savings that were unacceptable to the RMT, so we are happy and delighted that we have been able to secure a one-year deal that allows us to actually focus on negotiations next year,"" he said. ScotRail is currently run by Abellio but it is being stripped of its contract amid concerns over its performance. The rail firm will be taken over by acompany owned and controlled by the Scottish governmentin March. Mr Hogg said the union would be able to return to the negotiating table with a new employer. ""Abellio ScotRail are not going to be there next year,"" he said. ""It is going to be the operator of last resort and I hope the main focus has to be getting our  industrial relations back on track in order to have a dialogue next year. ""We are hoping there is going to be a different approach. For the last 18 months negotiations have been protracted and industrial relations have been virtually been destroyed as a result of tactics taken by Abellio ScotRail and Transport Scotland."" Ian McConnell, ScotRail chief operating officer, said: ""We have reached a pay agreement with the RMT trade union that resolves strike action. ""We look forward to Scotland's railway playing its part in delivering a successful COP26 next week."" The union had been given until 17:00 on Wednesday to accept the same deal which had been agreed by three other unions. It then announced ScotRail had accepted a counter offer after the 17:00 deadline. The union confirmed that planned industrial action, scheduled to start on Monday, would be ""withdrawn immediately"" as members welcomed a recent agreement on a pay rise. In a letter sent to union members following talks on Wednesday evening, RMT general secretary Michael Lynch said: ""By accepting the offer all industrial action is now cancelled and I instruct you all to work normally on the days you had previously been instructed to take action on."" Mr Lynch said the union's offer was accepted ""unanimously"" by delegates. Up to 30,000 delegates are set to descend on Glasgow for COP26 Transport minister Graeme Dey said he was pleased the union reached out to restart discussions based on the offer that had been made to them on Sunday. He added: ""Now an agreement has been confirmed the strike action will thankfully come to an end. ""As well as getting the pay rise they deserve, railway workers can now go back to delivering rail services for people right across Scotland and as well as for those attending COP26."" Up to 30,000 delegates are set to descend on Glasgow for COP26, which runs from Sunday to 14 November. Another dispute could see thousands of council workers across Scotland including refuse, recycling, maintenance and school catering and janitorial stafftaking strike action during the second week of the climate talks. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"The Cornelis Gert Jan, which is owned by MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, was detained when fishing in French waters A British trawler has been seized by France and another has been fined, amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. French maritime minister Annick Girardin said the ships were cautioned during checks off Le Havre overnight. She said the first did not comply right away and the second was not allowed to fish in French waters so was detained. No 10 said it was watching events closely and wanted France and EU talks but was ready to respond appropriately. Earlier, the environment secretary said he was ""urgently"" investigating the situation in relation to the detained vessel - which has been named as the Cornelis Gert Jan. Responding to an Urgent Commons Question from the SNP, George Eustice said the boat was on a list provided by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) initially provided to the European Union. He insisted the European Union did grant a licence to the vessel but it was ""unclear"" why, according to reports, it was subsequently withdrawn from the list. Mr Eustice said he was awaiting further details from Marine Scotland and was expecting a response in the ""next hour or so"". Deidre Brock, the SNP's environment spokesperson, said it was not good enough that the environment secretary had so little information. Jersey offers 162 fishing licences after ultimatum Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? MacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, which owns the Cornelis, said the crew of its vessel were ""in good spirits"" after it was ""ordered into a French port while legally fishing for scallop in French waters"". The captain was questioned after leaving the boat with French authorities and being given legal representation by the company. MacDuff Shellfish confirmed the captain had been released and returned to the ship, but the Cornelius was ""not at liberty to leave"" the port while the investigation was ongoing. The firm's Andrew Brown said the crew would remain on board until its release. He said Macduff's ""fishing activity [was] entirely legal"" and it appeared the Cornelis, based at Shoreham, in West Sussex, had been ""caught up"" in the ongoing UK-France post-Brexit fishing row. This video can not be played Watch: British trawler Cornelis Gert Jan is held in Le Havre. Mr Brown warned that without ""a speedy resolution"", the vessel's catch could be confiscated by the French authorities, and called on the UK government to ""defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet"". The firm would ""vigorously defend"" itself against any claims, but its ""priority concern"" was for the welfare of the vessel's crew, he said. Ms Girardin hadsaid on Twitter,externalthe trawler was found to be fishing in the Bay of Seine without the proper licences. The minister said checks on the British vessels were standard during the scallop fishing season. But she added they had also been undertaken against ""the backdrop of the tightening of controls in the Channel, in the context of discussions on licenses with the United Kingdom and the European Commission"". In naval parlance, this is called a shot across the bows. Technically, the French checks on UK trawlers in the Channel overnight do not form part of the raft of retaliatory measures announced in the fishing row. But there should be no doubt they are intended as a message about what is to come. From Tuesday, British and Channel Islands fishing boats will not be allowed to offload their catch at French ports. But that is the least of it.  Only 5% of UK seafood exports to France arrive in this way. The rest comes by freight. Potentially far more disruptive will be intensified controls at Calais and other entry points for UK trade by ferry and tunnel. The French authorities will be conducting what they call a ""grÃ¨ve de zÃ¨le"" - in other words becoming suddenly punctilious, thorough and on the look out for infractions. And it is not just fish imports which will be checked, but everything. The aim will be to create long tail-backs which will play on the news channels - reminding UK viewers of the costs of go-it-alone. France had warned it would block British boats from some ports next week - as well as tightening checks on UK boats and trucks - if a post-Brexit dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November. On Wednesday evening, it issued its ultimatum, saying it would begin to impose ""targeted measures"" from next Tuesday, including preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports and more checks on UK goods. France has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as itpreviously threatened in May. Mr Eustice said threats of sanctions made by France were ""disappointing and disproportionate"" and appeared to breach the post-Brexit deal and international law. He appealed to MPs to ""remain calm"", saying the UK would not get into a ""retaliatory tit-for-tat"" but warned of a possible ""appropriate and calibrated response"" if France carried out its threats. This video can not be played George Eustice says France's response has been ""disappointing and disproportionate"" Mr Eustice rejected French claims that the process for applying for fishing licences had been slow and difficult, saying officials had granted 98% of post-Brexit licence applications from European boats to fish in UK waters. He said more were expected to be granted following ""constructive"" talks with the European Commission and that he had told the French and the Commission that the UK's ""door remains ever open"". French politician and member of President Macron's En Marche party, Bruno Bonnell, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that French fishermen were ""losing 25% of their business because of regulation"". He said ""in the Brexit treaty we were not supposed to reach this point of tension"" and disagreed with the licensing figures quoted by Mr Eustice, saying 200 licences had been granted. Mr Bonnell argued French authorities ""have ways to retaliate if you push too hard"" and he ""would not be surprised if by next week we see significant advances"" in discussions. The UK maintains the rejected applications which sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show they had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters.

"North Wales Tidal Energy has drawn up plans for a 19-mile, 2.3GW barrage, which would cost Â£7bn Supporters of tidal energy projects say they are ""deeply frustrated"" that their plans to tackle climate change are being ""ignored"" by the UK government. Tidal technology could produce between 5% and 10% of the UK's electricity needs, according to the Tidal Range Alliance (TRA). A privately-funded plan for Swansea Baywas announced this week, but the TRA wants state support for large schemes. The UK government said plans must show ""strong evidence"" of value for money.

Its chairman Henry Dixon is also chairman of the TRA, which works as a UK industry body. Mr Dixon said the north Wales project had ""stalled"". Henry Dixon is calling for UK government support for large schemes ""Like many other developers of tidal range we've had absolutely no support from government and this is something we really don't understand when we have the current energy crisis,"" he said. ""In the UK, we have a unique resource - potentially 5% to 10% of the electricity in the UK could be generated from the tide - and we're ignored."" In 2017,a government-commissioned review by former energy minister Charles Hendrybacked plans for a pathfinder lagoon in Swansea Bay, saying it should be viewed as a ""no-regrets policy"". But a year later,the UK government said it was not value for money. The ill-fated Swansea tidal lagoon project was scrapped after the UK government said it was not value for money The TRA said improvements in technology meant previous assessments were ""no longer accurate"", and has called on the UK government to give Â£20m to conduct a new independent assessment. It claimed the schemes could offer the same amount of energy as nuclear, were cheaper to build and have a much longer lifespan of 120 years. In last week's strategy, the UK government announced its Â£120m Future Nuclear Enabling Fund to develop small modular reactors. ""Other industries have had significant amounts of money, or have that money,"" said Mr Dixon. ""Look at wind farm energy or nuclear energy, they're still getting grants."" Other forms of renewable energy, such as offshore wind, get more money than tidal, Henry Dixon says With COP26 approaching, an energy crisis and rising sea levels, Mr Dixon said ""the time is now"". ""All we're asking for is a small amount of funding to prove the science, prove the methodologies and show that this sort of scheme can really make a difference,"" he said. Jay Sheppard from Marine Energy Wales, which acts as a body for the marine sector, said he shared the frustration of colleagues in the sector: ""Our industry is poised to deliver reliable, clean energy power generation. ""But in order to get over the line we need that level of support and investment from the UK government and at the moment that's not forthcoming."" The Welsh government has power over energy schemes up to 350MW, and will soon launch a Tidal Lagoon Challenge to determine the appetite for developing proposals, potentially with its financial backing. A spokesman said: ""As the Hendry Review concluded, tidal lagoons have an important role to play in energy generation. ""After extensive conversations with stakeholders and testing of the existing market, the Welsh government is developing a broad, innovative and collaborative proposal which gives us the best possibility of developing and testing tidal lagoon energy generation in Welsh waters."" The UK government said: ""Our coastline and the power of the seas around us offers huge potential for clean renewable energy and the UK government remains open to considering well-developed proposals for harnessing UK tidal range energy.

"On Wednesday, the chancellor committed to spending increases worth Â£150bn over three years He pledged nearly Â£2bn to help schools in England catch up from Covid, Â£5.9bn to tackle NHS backlogs and Â£7bn for transport projects But Rishi Sunak's budget is likely to leave middle earners worse off next year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says Labour accuses the chancellor of failing to tackle the ""cost of living crisis"" and criticises a tax cut for banks Responding to concerns over price rises, he says he does not have a ""magic wand"" to make these issues disappear Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband says the Tories have presided over 11 years of wage stagnation, low growth and falling living standards Economic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023 Edited by Hamish Mackay We're ending our live coverage for today. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of the day's main reaction to Rishi Sunak's Budget:  You can read an overview of yesterday's Budgethere, analysis from our economics editorhere, and analysis from our political editorhere. Reality Check Chancellor Rishi Sunak made a number of claims both in his Budget speech and in his round of interviews afterwards. Among them were suggestions that national debt was down, he cut taxes for ""millions"" of the lowest paid, and that he took ""advantage"" of leaving the EU to reform alcohol duty. But are those claims accurate? The BBC Reality Check team hashad a look. Marilyn Taylor asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Sunak has already faced a lot of questions and criticism about the timing of his decision - and should expect more. He argues thatlowering air passenger duty on flightsbetween airports in the four UK nations is balanced by increasing the rate of tax from April 2023 on very long-haul flights (over 5,500 miles). He also says domestic flights only account for 4% of total aviation emissions. In the end, it looks like it was a balancing act for the chancellor between the government's levelling-up agenda and climate considerations. COP26 will be based at the SEC campus in the centre of Glasgow Chancellor Rishi Sunak made the ""wrong choice"" announcing a cut in charges on domestic flights days before the global COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, says Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish first minister adds there is ""much to be disappointed in"" with the package of measures in his Budget. She says the Air Passenger Duty (APD) cut is not one the Scottish government would have introduced, adding: ""But it is for them [UK government] to defend that in the months to come."" Ahead of COP26, ""all of us have an obligation to think about how we contribute to reaching net zero and saving the planet"", Sturgeon says.

Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The question of whether any benefit from arise in the National Living Wagewill be offset by the increase in National Insurance and changes to Universal Credit rules is a good one. But it's a tricky one to answer because people in different circumstances will be affected to a differing extent. It is the case thatthe boost of a rising minimum wageis lessened bythe tapering of universal credit,the upcoming national insurance increase, and - crucially -the forecast rise in prices. Economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies say the policies taking effect will ultimately be progressive. In other words, good for low earners. For those without a job though, the outlook is much more precarious.  Former housing secretary Robert Jenrick says the Treasury is ""simply not willing"" to do more to help leaseholders remove unsafe cladding from buildings. During the Budget, the chancellor said Â£5bn would be given to remove unsafe cladding from the highest-risk buildings. But homeowners affected were unimpressed, saying the government must be ""operating in a time warp"" to have announced the same Â£5bn funding for a fourth time. Jenrick says: ""The choice for the government is: what is the balance between the state paying, and then trying to recoup as much of that as possible from the developers through taxes, and the leaseholder."" He says while leaseholders may find the current set up ""extremely unfair"", the only other option was for taxpayer to step in ""and massively increase that Â£5bn fund"". ""At the moment - and I fought this battle for a couple of years - the Treasury, the government, is simply not willing to do that,"" he says. You can read more about claddinghere. Finance Minister Conor Murphy says NI's budget allocation is ""nowhere near"" enough Rishi Sunak claims his budget allocation represents the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998. But Northern Ireland's finance minister Conor Murphy says it will create ""significant challenges"". He disputes the chancellor's claim that the nation will get an extra Â£1.6bn per year for public services. Murphy says it will amount to Â£1.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - ""nowhere near"" what is required.

But don't worry, we're on hand to help you catch up: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The UK's pandemic house price boom is forecast to come to an end, but property prices are still expected to rise in each of the next five years. Some surveys have recorded house prices rising at a rate of more than 10% a year but the government's official, independent, forecasters have said this will drop to 3.5% by 2026. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also says that mortgage rates are likely to rise from record lows. Rent for tenants will also go up. It means potential first-time buyers are facing another period of difficulty if they wish to buy a home. Read more here. While many of the decisions about tax and spending in Scotland are made in Edinburgh, the UK Budget still has a big impact - well beyond the simple question of how much cash goes into Holyrood's coffers. Sunak has opted to turn on the spending taps across every government department, and this means Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will have more cash to allocate when she sets out her own draft budget in December. This is because many of the eye-catching announcements in the UK budget relate to matters which are devolved to Holyrood - for example the Â£24bn earmarked for housing or the Â£21bn for roads. Read more herefrom BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim on what the Autumn Budget means for Scotland. The SNP's economy spokeswoman Alison Thewliss says she's concerned the Budget doesn't go far enough to support the hospitality sector. Thewliss says a few pence off a pint ""does nothing"" to support the sector hard hit by the pandemic. She says it ""baffles"" her why the chancellor has ignored calls to keep the reduced 12.5% for VAT for hospitality. The MP for Glasgow Central also says all eyes are on her constituency due to upcoming climate summit COP26, which begins in the Scottish city on Sunday. But she says the Budget and Spending Review ""falls awfully short of the ambition required to tackle this global climate challenge"". Paul Amphlett asks... Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Indeed a lot can change by then, butlong-term policy announcementsin a Budget are nothing new. The shake-up of alcohol duty, for example, is quite complex and will need to go through a consultation and scrutiny process before its planned introduction in 2023. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget has promised a cash boost for Welsh public services and more money for low-paid workers on universal credit. He also promised to increase Welsh government budgets by an average of Â£2.5bn a year. Just over Â£120m from the levelling-up fund was also earmarked for 10 Welsh projects. But the Labour-led Welsh government has accused the Treasury of leaving ""clear gaps in funding"". It says its own calls for cash to tackle coal-tips or additional funding for rail infrastructure have gone unanswered. Read BBC Wales political reporter David Deans'full analysis here Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the Budget is a ""blueprint for a stronger Britain"". Speaking in the Commons, he says: ""It's a country where if you have innovative ideas you will get the support you need to turn it from a dream into reality. ""It's a country where if your talent is nurtured and your skills are honed you will get the support and the ongoing interest and engagement - strong engagement - from the government. ""It's a country where if someone does an honest day's work they will receive a decent wage."" He says ""many of us have listened to the litany of woe and despair for too long"" and now feel optimistic, adding: ""We are very excited about the future of our country."" A strong rebound will be achieved, not by ""splashing cash indiscriminately"", he says, but by spending taxpayers' money wisely - ""to make the choice to foster an environment that encourages innovation and growth"". The government says tax hikes are needed to raise money to help the NHS and fix social care We brought you reaction earlier from theInstitute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which says the Budget will produce ""real pain""for lower income households. No 10 has responded, saying the government is taking on the long-term challenges facing the country. A spokesman for the prime minister says: ""I think this is a Budget and a settlement which is aimed to boost our economy - they are targeted interventions towards those who need it. ""We have taken the difficult decision to raise taxes on things like the [health and social care] levy in a fair and progressive way and that importantly is to raise money both to help our NHS and to finally fix the long-standing problem of social care. ""That's something that the public have been calling on successive governments to do for a number of years now - and it is this government that is taking on these challenges to get them fixed for the long term."" Rishi Sunak's Budget offers an ""age of stagnation"" rather than optimism, once the ""Instagram filter"" is removed, says Ed Miliband. Speaking in the Commons, the shadow business secretary says there has been 11 years of ""low growth, stagnant wages, falling living standards"" under the Conservatives, with the Budget failing to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. He says the Budget is ""already unravelling"" less than 24 hours since it was delivered ""because of the chasm between the claims of ministers and the reality that working people face"". ""It's clear he [Sunak] is living on a totally different planet,"" he adds. Miliband tells MPs: ""Yesterday we saw raid upon raid on the living standards of working people. Council tax hikes hidden in the Budget documents, not announced by the chancellor. ""A stealth raid on the self-employed worth Â£1.7bn over the coming five years, not announced by the chancellor. ""And of course the national insurance hike on ordinary families confirmed."" The ""most shameful"" part of the Budget, he says, was the government's ""refusal to reverse"" the cut to universal credit, which saw the removal of Â£20 weekly uplift. Downing Street reacts toanalysis by the Resolution Foundationthat suggests household tax bills will be Â£3,000 higher after the Budget compared with when Boris Johnson became prime minister, saying it is ""not a fair reflection"" of the fiscal situation. The PM's spokesman tells reporters: ""The Â£3,000 household tax figure you've quoted isn't a fair reflection of how tax is levied because it appears to include business and employer taxes - and those aren't directly applicable to households."" He says the same report also shows that government policies are ""set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution"" and that higher taxes will mostly impact the middle to higher income households. ""The decisions made by this government will give households nearly Â£500 per year extra on average, with the poorest receiving more than Â£1,000, and that's before we factor in things like wage growth,"" he adds. The director of theResolution Foundationthink tank, Torsten Bell, says themove to cut the weekly extra Â£20given to universal credit claimants during the pandemic will improve the welfare system - but warns it will help better off UC claimants, while giving nothing to compensate the poorest. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studiessaysmiddle-income families are ""likely to be worse off next year""than they are currently and says a combination of tax increases and high inflation ""over the next several years"" will mean ""very slow growth in living standards"". Shadow chancellorRachel Reevestells BBC Breakfast she welcomes the increases in spending announced by the chancellor yesterday but says it's not the Budget she would have delivered and calls the decision to cut air passenger duty the week before COP26 ""astonishing"". Also speaking to BBC Breakfast,Rishi Sunakdefends the move emphasising the importance of consistency ""with our environmental goals"" but adding: ""We're doing this to support domestic aviation, and regional airports will benefit from this."" BBC News Channel With changes to alcohol duty, business rates and wages, let's look at how the Budget will affect bars. Martin Greenhow, who owns a chain of five bars across the Midlands and north of England, says the Budget is ""a mixed bag"". ""The business rates discount for next year is obviously very welcome,"" he says. ""But ultimately we have to face the fact that it will be more than offset by the rise in the national living wage."" On alcohol duty -which will rise on stronger drinks- he says: ""I'm sure for some it will be a great help. ""For ourselves, we're a cocktail bar, so obviously we're probably at the strong end of the drinks spectrum. So we're probably going to see a bit more pain from that."" He says some in the industry think this could mean the price of a pint will rise by 20-30p, but warns that he still needs to see the details. ""We're loath to increase prices,"" he says, but adds the hospitality industry ""isn't in a position to absorb these debts"". ""That has to be passed on, because otherwise businesses fail."" Read more about the changes to alcohol dutyhere. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Climate activists have been campaigning for greener policies in the run-up to the climate summit COP26 Rishi Sunak didn't explicitly mention the climate in his Budget speech. But let's look at how his plans could impact the environment: Flying Stopping flying is one of the single best things you can do for the climate - but flying within the UK will become cheaper, thanks to a halving of air passenger duty. Sunakdefended the decision, saying he was removing an anomaly in which people were taxed more to fly in the UK than to Europe. Surveys consistently show that people want frequent fliers to be taxed extra. Home insulation The UK won't meet climate change targets with its current leaky housing stock, but campaign group Insulate Britain hasn't managed to convince the chancellor that upgrading homes is a good job-creating infrastructure investment. ""With the COP26 conference just days away, the chancellor's announcements felt like they were from a different planet and a different time,"" says Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive at the UK Green Buildings Council. Railways The government's investment in rail has been widely welcomed, along with a major input of Â£4.8bn to improve public transport within cities. The Railway Industry Association has welcomed the extra funding, but its chief executive Darren Caplan says there were missed opportunities with regards to ""electrification and fleet orders of hydrogen and battery trains"".

"Koeman was Barcelona's match-winner in the 1992 European Cup final but has struggled as head coach Ronald Koeman has been sacked as head coach of Barcelona after 14 months in charge at the Nou Camp. Barca have picked up just 15 points from 10 games in La Liga and have already lost twice in the group stage of this season's Champions League. They are ninth in the table, six points adrift of the joint leaders afterlosing at Rayo Vallecanoon Wednesday. The loss was Barca's third in their past four games and it followeddefeat by Real Madrid in Sunday's Clasico. In a statement, the Spanish club said: ""The president of the club, Joan Laporta, informed him [Koeman] of the decision after the defeat against Rayo Vallecano. ""Ronald Koeman will say goodbye to the squad on Thursday."" The former Netherlands, Everton and Southampton boss, 58, could only guide the five-time European champions to third place in the league last season. The Dutchman has not been helped by the club's significant financial problems, which resulted inLionel Messi's exitand subsequent move to Paris St-Germain in August. Barcelona were unable to spend any money on new signings in the summer, with Memphis Depay, Sergio Aguero and Eric Garcia arriving as free transfers and striker Luuk de Jong joining on loan from Sevilla. Speaking after Wednesday's defeat, Koeman said: ""It [Barcelona's league position] says we're not well. ""The team has lost balance in the squad, lost very effective players, which shows. In recent years other clubs have strengthened every season and we haven't, which also shows."" Club legend Xavi, the former Barca midfielder who is now manager of Qatari side Al Sadd, is one of the favourites to replace Koeman. It is the first time since September 1987 that Barca have lost three away games in a row without scoring - a run that saw English manager Terry Venables sacked. Koeman won the Copa del Rey at the end of his first season but Barca finished behind Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in La Liga with their lowest points tally since 2008. The former Netherlands centre-back played for the Spanish club between 1989 and 1995, helping them to four league titles and scoring the winning goal in the 1992 European Cup final. He was brought back to the club in August 2020 as head coach by former president Josep Maria Bartomeu. New chief Laporta, however, frequently made it clear the Dutchman was not his appointment. The duo had an uneasy relationship, and Koeman released a statement in September asking to be given time to rebuild after losing Messi and fellow forward Antoine Griezmann in the summer. Following the defeat by Madrid on Sunday, Koeman's car was surrounded by some Barcelona supporters, whom he later dismissed as ""uneducated people"". Speaking before the trip to Rayo Vallecano, he said: ""It is a social problem. Uneducated people that don't understand rules and values."" The toxic battle ripping apart a European giant This video can not be played Falcao scores and Depay misses penalty as Barcelona beaten One of Koeman's first tasks as coach was to make a40-second phone call to Luis Suarez,externalduring which he told the Uruguay striker his services were no longer required and that he was free to leave the club. The decision had been made by the board and it's now known the dire financial position forced them to get rid of a forward who scored 21 goals from 29 starts in the previous campaign. It began a weakening of the Barca squad from one that could compete with Europe's elite to one that is struggling to get into the Champions League places. Messi then handed in a transfer requestbut ended up staying for 2020-21 butSuarez joined Atletico Madridfor a nominal fee and fired them to the league title. Behind the scenes the club's costs had spiralled to an unsustainable level, creating the biggest wage bill in world football and leaving Barcelonaon the verge of bankruptcyand a stadium that requires renovation. With Messi out of contract, the Argentina superstaragreed a new deal in July of this yearuntil 2026 that included halving his wages, but La Liga stipulated Barca must reduce their wage bill further before he and any new players could be registered. They weren't able to do that, so in August the club announced thatMessi would be leaving""because of financial and structural obstacles"". He joined Paris St-Germain, then Koeman lost more talent when France forward Griezmann followed Suarez to Atletico Madrid - rejoining the club he had left in aÂ£107m dealtwo years before on a loan in a snapshot of where it has gone wrong for Barcelona. They managed to sign former Manchester United forward Depay and Aguero on free transfers but the former Manchester City striker has only just made his Barca debut after getting injured in pre-season. The transformation from a forward line of Messi, Suarez and Griezmann to Depay, De Jong and an ageing Aguero sums up the task Koeman faced and which will now greet his successor.

"Measures introduced since Boris Johnson came to power, including Wednesday's Budget, will increase the UK's tax burden by Â£3,000 a year per household. according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank found policies announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak had boosted incomes by 2.8% for the poorest fifth of households. However, households on middle incomes would take a 2% hit, it added. Mr Sunak said his Budget had ""cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid"". That claim was challenged by the Foundation's figures. It said the changes to the amount families can keep from their earnings if they are on universal credit only partially offset the effect of withdrawing the Â£20-a-week boost during the pandemic. On average, recipients would lose Â£800 a year, it calculated. The Â£3,000 figure produced by the Resolution Foundation includes business taxes, which are regularly passed on to consumers. Of the 4.4 million households on universal credit, about three-quarters (3.2 million households) will be worse off as a result of decisions to take away the Â£20-a week-uplift, despite the chancellor's new universal credit measures. But 1.2 million households would be better off by Â£900 a year than before the Budget. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Rishi Sunak: The taxman takes the strain Responding to the Foundation's calculations, a Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: ""It's misleading to imply that households will immediately face a Â£3,000 tax hit, because this figure appears to include business and employers' taxes which aren't applicable directly to households. ""The same report shows that the government's policies are set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution and that higher taxes will mostly impact middle-to-higher income households. ""This government's decisions have been worth nearly Â£500 per year extra to households on average, and more than Â£1,000 for the poorest households - and that's before factoring in wage growth, including the rise in the National Living Wage."" Talking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Sunak said pressures on the economy ""will be with us for a while"", but that the government's plan was working and ""we can face the future with a bit more confidence"". He also said that wages were rising and that he had ""cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid people"", adding that it was his job to be concerned about inflation and his new fiscal rules were ""how we build up resilience"". Government figures show that when you take account of investment in public services, the average earner has seen improvements worth Â£500 a year overall. Setting out the Budget on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said his plans were focused on the ""post-Covid"" era and would pave the way for an ""economy of higher wages, higher skills, and rising productivity"". He told MPs the higher tax burden was down to the pandemic. ""Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,"" he said in his Budget speech. He committed to spending increases of Â£150bn over three years, including nearly Â£2bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, Â£6bn to tackle NHS backlogs and Â£7bn for transport projects. He also announced that the universal credit ""taper"" rate would be cut by 8% no later than 1 December, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every Â£1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. Meanwhile, the National Living Wage will increase next year by 6.6%, to Â£9.50 an hour. Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, welcomed the increases in spending announced by Mr Sunak, but said there were areas that gave her ""cause for concern"". Highlighting the need for greater investment in education, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If we are going to grow the economy sustainably, we have got to invest in our young people. ""Unless we ensure that kids catch up from that missed-out education [during the pandemic], there will be a long-term cost to our economy."" The Foundation's overnight analysis of the Budget and Spending Review 2021 revealed a deteriorating picture on family finances, with household incomes set to stagnate as a result of rising inflation. ""Higher taxes aren't a surprise, given the UK is combining fiscal conservatism with an ageing society and a slow-growing economy. But it is the end of low-tax conservatism, with the tax take rising by Â£3,000 per household by the middle of this decade,"" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. With higher growth, inflation and public spending than previously expected, combined with tax rises already in train, the Foundation warns that the UK could be set for a flat recovery for household living standards. The combined effect of universal credit changes, alcohol and fuel duties, higher council tax, income tax and national insurance delivered a 2.8% boost to the incomes of the poorest households. But middle-income households will see incomes drop by 2% and the richest fifth of households will suffer a 3.1% hit by the middle of the decade, the Foundation warned. In the wider population, wages are set to fall next year after inflation. It means the last decade has been the weakest decade for pay growth since the 1930s. By May 2024, real wages will have grown by just 2.4% since 2008 -  compared with a 38% real wage increase between 1992 and 2008. ""The chancellor got some really good news for the public finances yesterday - lower borrowing, because the economy's doing slightly better than we all though six months ago. But good news for public finances wasn't good news for household finances,"" the Foundation's Mr Bell told BBC Breakfast. ""That's because higher inflation that actually helped the chancellor with his borrowing figures is obviously hurting household budgets, and that's why the Office for Budget Responsibility expects household incomes and wages to actually not grow at all in the next year. ""So that's going to be really bad news for everyone worrying about their own budgets."" Price rises could hit highest rate in 30 years Did you get what you wanted from the Budget?

"Petrol stations in many parts of China have begun rationing diesel amid rising costs and falling supplies. Some truck drivers are having to wait entire days to refuel, according to posts on social media site Weibo. China is currently in the midst of amassive power crunch, as coal and natural gas shortages have closed factories and left homes without power. And this latest issue is only likely to contribute to an ongoing global supply chain crisis, say analysts. ""The current diesel shortages seem to be affecting long distance transportation businesses which could include goods meant for markets outside of China,"" said Mattie Bekink, China Director at the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""Depending on the duration and intensity of this crunch, we could well see this contribute to the global supply chain challenges."" The global supply chain crisis has been largely driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, with demand surging as economies re-open. The shortages hitting countries around the world Why Christmas may be stuck in a shipping container In China, trucks are only being allowed to fill up 100 litres each - about 10% of their capacity, a truck dealer from Shijiazhuang city in Hebei province told Chinese business news service Caixin. In other parts of the country, reports suggest rations are even tighter with drivers only allowed to buy up to 25 litres. Meanwhile, in the city of Fuyang, about a seven hour drive south of the key transportation hub of Shijiazhuang, Caixin reports petrol stations are limiting purchases or charging drivers surcharges of up to 300 yuan ($47, Â£34) to fill up their tanks. ""After going to a few [petrol] stations, there is no more diesel, and prices will continue to rise, and large trucks running logistics will not be able to refuel,"" one Weibo user wrote. Another also bemoaned the impact on inflation and deliveries. ""Do you get the feeling that food has become more expensive and the express delivery is slower?  It would be better to buy less on 11/11,"" referring to Alibaba's Single's Day, typically one of the biggest days of the year in China's shopping calendar. Aidan Yao, a senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers, told the BBC while the market is well aware of China's coal shortage, the ""diesel problem is new"". ""All fossil fuels have seen a price renaissance lately as the underinvestment in these fuel sources has created a shortfall of supply at a time when demand is surging,"" he said. ""Oil, gas, coal prices have all moved in tandem and are through the roof."" Oil prices have hit their highest levels since 2014 in recent weeks, causing fuel crises in places such asEuropeandthe UK. Part of this has been driven by coal and natural gas shortages in countries like China and India, which analysts predict will see users switch to oil for power generation and heating. Such demand could boost overall crude consumption by more than half a million barrels of oil a day. ""This is merely the latest manifestation of shortages impacting China,"" Jeremy Stevens, Chief China Economist at Standard Bank told the BBC from Beijing. He said companies are already turning to diesel-fuelled generators to keep their factories open during the power crunch. ""The heart of the matter is the energy crisis,"" he said. Both Mr Yao and Mr Stevens warned that these current power crises show the dangers of switching to renewables too quickly. ""The path to net zero is treacherous and the journey needs to be planned carefully,"" Mr Yao said.

"Finance Minister Conor Murphy says the budget allocation will amount to Â£1.9bn over three years Finance minister Conor Murphy has disputed a claim by the chancellor that Northern Ireland will get an extra Â£1.6bn per year for public services. Rishi Sunak said his budget allocation represented the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998. But Mr Murphy said it would create ""significant challenges"". He said it would amount to Â£1.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - ""nowhere near"" what is required. Treasury figures show the budget allocation will mean day-to-day spending in Northern Ireland will increase by an average of 2.1% in real terms each year up to 2025. Infrastructure spending will increase by an average of 2.5% a year over the same period. The Treasury said this gave the Northern Ireland Executive ""sufficient funding certainty"" to plan in-year spending and to provide additional future investments in areas such as health, social care and education. A simple guide to Budget 2021 But Mr Murphy said when compared to the executive's 2021-22 budget, there will be an additional Â£450m, Â£670m and Â£866m over the next three years for day-to-day spending ""against growing demand for public services"". This, he added, represented a 0.9% real term increase to the executive's budget next year, turning to zero real terms change by 2024-25. ""This spending review was the opportunity to deliver a budget which would have enabled the executive to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery,"" Mr Murphy said. ""However it provides a marginal real terms increase in funding next year which will be far outweighed by increased demands on public services, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic."" Mr Murphy said a multi-year budget enables the executive to better plan and prioritise its finances. He said his priority was supporting the health service and tackling waiting lists. Separately, there is an initial budget allocation of Â£50m from the government's levelling up fund. It is for 11 projects including redeveloping the Dundonald Ice Bowl and extending cycle routes across the Belfast City Region. Mr Sunak also said he will cut Air Passenger Duty (APD) by half on internal UK flights. A cut in APD is a long standing request of Northern Ireland politicians and business leaders. It will mean a new domestic band for APD set at Â£6.50. The rate will apply to all flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (excluding private jets). The government has also announceda proposal to solve a NI Protocol related issue,externalconcerning the VAT paid on second cars coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Mr Murphy has previouslyalready played down expectations that the spending review would mean significant extra resources. Earlier this week, he said there was ""little indication"" the government would ""provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery"". However, he said the ability to produce a multi-year budget would provide an opportunity to ""better plan and prioritise finances"". Stormont has not had a multi-year budget since 2011-2015. That has made it difficult for public sector managers to plan services, particularly in health. The finance minister is trying to build consensus among his executive colleagues that the bulk of any additional funds should go to health even if other departments lose out. He aims to publish a draft budget before Christmas which would then go out to consultation before being finalised early next year. The Institute of Directors Northern Ireland said the additional money will be a ""shot in the arm for the local administration"". ""It is incumbent now on ministers to deliver on the incredible potential it presents, with a focus, through targeted investment in key services and infrastructure, on ensuring this region is fit to capitalise on the green recovery as we continue to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic,"" said national director, Kirsty McManus. Retail NI said the chancellor's 50% rates discount for retailers in England was welcome. The organisation added it was ""absolutely vital"" that Conor Murphy ensures this also applies to small traders in Northern Ireland. Matthew Hall, George Best Belfast City Airport chief executive, said the airport had for many years been lobbying government for the abolition of APD. ""A 50% reduction in APD is a half-way house in terms of solving a problem which has placed the aviation sector in Northern Ireland at a competitive disadvantage with other regions in attracting new airlines and routes,"" he said. ""Today's announcement by the chancellor will not take effect until April 2023 and does little in the short term to alleviate a sector still decimated by Covid."" SDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said the budget was a ""grim spectacle"". ""Now we have some certainty on multi-year funding the onus is on Conor Murphy to actually take responsibility and deliver a multi-year plan to tackle our waiting list crisis and present a credible plan for our economy,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken said the extra Â£1.6bn a year ""underlines the advantage of being part of the fifth largest economy in the world"". ""We still have a long way to go to emerge fully from the Covid pandemic but this budget, if properly used to support the needs of Northern Ireland, gives us a good chance,"" he said. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said the multi year budget should help devolved finance ministers plan spending better. ""The last two years have been unprecedented, and the Treasury responded in an unprecedented manner to protect jobs and safeguard employers,"" he said. The system of taxing alcohol is changing, meaning customers will pay more for products with stronger alcohol content Buckfast tonic wine faces a significant tax increaseunder government plans to reform alcohol duty. The new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said. A Treasury fact sheet suggests a 75cl bottle of Buckfast will face additional tax of 81p. The fortified wine is popular in some areas of Northern Ireland and is sometimes called Lurgan Champagne. It has been made by Benedictine monks at Buckfast Abbey in Devon for almost 100 years. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was proposing the ""most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years"". ""To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,"" he said. ""Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. 'This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength."" Mr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were ""currently overtaxed"", adding: ""Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less.""

"Marmots at Twycross Zoo - one of the winners of the Levelling Up fund A zoo in Bosworth and a pool in Halifax are among the beneficiaries of the government's levelling up fund. The Â£4.8bn pot of money was launched last year and now the Treasuryhas said which areas,externalwere successful in their bids for the first tranche of cash. Local authorities, with the support of local MPs, could apply for money for regeneration and transport projects. Newly-appointed levelling-up secretary Michael Govehas said the policy,externalwould mean people would see a visible difference in their area. However, critics of this fund have questioned whether small pots of money for local projects across the UK will transform the economy and create jobs long-term without a country-wide strategy. Addressing the Conservative conference earlier this month, Mr Gove said ""levelling up"" was also about long-term economic transformation. Successful bids for the initial Â£1.4bn pot of money include: Â£19.9m for Twycross Zoo in Bosworth Â£19.5m for Rotherham town centre Â£20m for Bolton College of Medical Science Â£12.2m for Halifax swimming pool Â£20m for Aberdeen City Centre Â£9.3m  to upgrade Whitechapel Road in East London. Aberdeen will get Â£20m to improve its city centre Analysis by political correspondent Ione Wells The government has been under pressure to define what their much-touted policy - ""levelling up"" - actually means. We know it's usually used to describe tackling regional inequality - but has at times been a catch-all phrase to promote everything from more money for tennis courts to tackling crime. The government's new levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has previously said the first part of it involves people seeing a visible difference in their areas being made more attractive - which the government hopes these pots of cash will start to do. But he's also said levelling up involves long-term economic transformation and job creation. Critics of this fund have questioned whether or not small pots for different local projects around the UK - bid for competitively by councils and local MPs - will strategically transform the economy or create jobs long-term. Though the government would argue other policies, like their cut to the universal credit taper rate and investment in transport links, are more targeting these things. The fund has also been criticised for not giving devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a role in handing out the cash, especially where bids involve funding things like infrastructure that might otherwise be a matter for governments there to make decisions on. We also don't know who the 'losers' were in this first round of bids, and which areas missed out on cash. In his Budget speech the chancellor appeared to deliberately address accusations of 'pork-barrel' politics - as bids had to be backed by local MPs and bypassed devolved governments. Pork barrel politics is term generally used to refer disapprovingly of politicians funnelling money to their own constituents, regardless of need. However, Mr Sunak specifically referred to the three successful bids in Conservative Stoke-on-Trent seats but also highlighted the successful bids in Ashton under Lyne, Doncaster, South Leicester, Sunderland and West Leeds - which include the seats of Angela Rayner, Ed Miliband, Jonathan Ashworth, Rachel Reeves and Bridget Philipson - all members of Labour's shadow cabinet. He said: ""We are so committed to levelling up that we are even levelling up the opposition front bench."" Moseley Road Baths is over 100 years old Responding to the Budget, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the chancellor ""gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other"". She accused Mr Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of operating a ""classic con game"". ""The prime minister is the front man - distracting people with his wild promises -all the while, his chancellor dips his hand in their pocket. ""It all seems like fun and games until you walk away and realise your purse has been lifted."" Analysis by Peter Barnes and Joseph Cassidy, BBC Political Research Unit The list of successful bids includes 76 in England, 11 in Northern Ireland, 10 in Wales and 8 in Scotland (105 total) with a total value of Â£1.7bn. In some instances more than one parliamentary constituency is set to benefit, and in some cases it's hard to judge how the effects will be shared between constituencies. But BBC analysis suggests the following breakdown by party: Conservative-only constituencies: Â£627m Labour-only constituencies: Â£507m SNP-only constituencies: Â£135m Other parties/local authority areas with more than one party: Â£424m Montgomery Canal will get Â£15.5m Over Twitter, Mr Sunak challenged Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, to celebrate the news that as part of the fund, Â£17.6m would go toward improving Leicester railway station. ""Let me know if you want me to retweet,"" he said. Mr Ashworth hit back tweeting: ""We're still waiting for you to properly compensate our Leicester businesses for forcing a local lockdown on us last year or reverse the increasing numbers of children in poverty across Leicester thanks to your cuts. ""Let me know when that's sorted so I can retweet,"" he replied.

"Taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine following a shake-up of alcohol duty. The new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said. The duty premium on sparkling wines will end and the duty on draught beer and cider served in pubs will be cut. Chancellor Rishi Sunak called it the ""most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years"". He also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Follow live coverage of the Budget Economy set to hit pre-Covid level at end of year ""To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,"" the chancellor said. ""Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength."" Mr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were ""currently overtaxed"", adding: ""Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less."" In relation to sparkling wines, Mr Sunak said: ""I'm going to end the irrational duty premium of 28% that they currently pay. Sparkling wines - wherever they are produced - will now pay the same duty as still wines of equivalent strength."" The cut to sparkling wine duty was welcomed by Kate Goodman, owner of Cheshire drinks importer Reserve Wines, but she was disappointed that the change was not immediate. ""Christmas is our busiest period. It would have great to introduce this before that time. We need help to get back on our feet after a pretty crippling 18 months,"" she said. Reducing duty on lower alcohol drinks will encourage people to buy English wines, said Jonathan Piggins, chief executive of English wine merchant Corkk. ""The UK's vineyards are being taken increasingly seriously by the major overseas players and reducing the tax on lower alcohol drinks, will give the country an even more prominent position on the global wine map."" The changes were less welcomed by Liam Manton, co-founder of Didsbury Gin. ""Additional tax on high ABV drinks will present a real challenge to businesses like ours,"" he said, adding that on average 70% of the price of a bottle of gin is already tax. Draught beers and ciders will attract a new lower rate of duty In a move to help struggling pubs, Mr Sunak announced a new lower rate of duty for draught drinks, which he said would cut the cost of a pint by about three pence. He said the ""draught relief will cut duty by 5%"" and ""will apply to drinks served from draught containers over 40 litres"". The chancellor said this would particularly benefit community pubs ""who do 75% of their trade on draught"". He also announced proposals for a new ""small producer relief"" to include small cidermakers and other producers making alcoholic drinks of less than 8.5% alcohol by volume (ABV). Jez Lamb, founder of Wirral-based craft beer marketplace, Beers @ No.42, said the draught relief favoured the big players in the market, not the smaller, independent breweries who need support most. ""It's brilliant to see alcohol duty cut on draught beer but that's only for ""containers"" more than 40L. That is great for the big breweries but so many smaller craft brewers only supply in 30L containers,"" he said. Creating a draught rate and simplifying the duty system is positive news, said Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, which has 2,700 pubs. ""It is a much needed vote of confidence in the great British pub as we face into an uncertain winter, labour disruption and rising costs."" William Robinson, managing director of Stockport brewery Robinsons, said the lower draught beer duty rate and the cancellation of the planned inflation-linked increase in beer duty showed that the chancellor ""recognises the contribution pubs make to the communities they support and serve.""

"Wednesday's Budget - which saw tax and spending rise to record levels - represents a major shift in Tory philosophy, a minister has claimed. The party has traditionally tried to cut taxes and keep spending down. Treasury Secretary Simon Clarke said it was still committed to low taxes but made ""no apologies"" for increasing public spending. Rishi Sunak told MPs the higher tax burden is down to the ""unprecedented crisis"" of the pandemic. But the chancellor also turned on the spending taps in his Budget, after being widely expected to make cuts to in many government departments to help pay down the deficit. Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Sunak not calling time on hefty spending He committed to spending increases of Â£150bn over three years, including nearly Â£2bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, Â£6bn to tackle NHS backlogs and Â£7bn for transport projects. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said the spending plans were ""more similar"" to those of the Labour governments in the 2000s than those of George Osborne - a former Conservative chancellor. Mr Clarke told BBC Newsnight: ""The chancellor was very open about the fact that this is something of a philosophical shift. ""What we want to see is to get the economy turbocharged, unlock productivity, and to deliver growth more evenly across UK. That does require some upfront spending."" Mr Sunak has promised more money to help the NHS tackle the backlog of cases Mr Sunak has sought to calm the fears of some Conservative MPs that the party has abandoned its core economic principles. ""Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,"" he said in his Budget speech. ""But now, we have a choice,"" he said, adding ""do we want to live in a country where the response to every question is: ""what is the government going to do about it?"" ""Or do we choose to recognise that government has limits, that government should have limits."" He later insisted to ITV's Robert Peston that this was not ""empty rhetoric"", adding that both he and the prime minister wanted to deliver lower taxes by the end of the Parliament. He also told a meeting of backbench Conservative MPs on Wednesday night that ""in the future every marginal pound should be put into lowering taxes"". Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told ITV News that it was important to raise money ""but not in the way the government is doing it"". Rachel Reeves accused the chancellor and prime minister of running a ""con game"" She said the government was introducing big taxes but said ""those taxes are not falling on the banks - bankers got a tax cut"" in reference to a 5% cut in the surcharge levied on banks' profits. She added that Labour would raise taxes on ""online giants who aren't paying their fair share"". Just before the chancellor got to his feet, one former minister on the right of the party said he hoped this would be a pivot moment: back to the kind of government action, where Conservatives were seeking to shrink the state, seeking to reduce taxes, seeking to pull back from some of the very big government moves they made because of the pandemic. Rishi Sunak had a little bit of extra cash to play with, but instead of using that wriggle room he had, to signal the government was going to become smaller, in fact he staked his post out in a landscape where big government is here to stay, and eye-watering levels of tax are here to stay for the foreseeable future (although he seemed to dangle a promise of tax cuts before the next election). That has created Conservative tensions but clearly it's the political calculation of him and Boris Johnson that it's the right thing to do. Mr Sunak also used his Budget to repeat pre-announced measures, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50. According to Office for Budget Responsibility figures, household disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year. Economic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023. New Budget measures included: A real-terms rise in spending for every government department A freeze on fuel duty Funding per pupil in England's schools is to be restored to 2010 levels over the next three years A 5% cut to the extra corporation tax banks have to pay to ""maintain competitiveness"" An extra Â£2.2bn for courts, prisons and probation services, including Â£500m to reduce courts backlogs A cut in air passenger duty for internal UK flights - and a tax rise on ""ultra long haul"" flights More support for industrial research and development And the chancellor scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023. The government has faced strong criticism over its decision to reduce the universal credit benefit by Â£20-a-week. Mr Sunak did not offer to maintain the Â£20 uplift - introduced during the pandemic - but instead announced that the ""taper"" would be cut so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every Â£1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. Ms Reeves said that would not make up for the wider cuts to universal credit which affected five million families.

"Measures introduced since Boris Johnson came to power, including Wednesday's Budget, will increase the UK's tax burden by Â£3,000 a year per household. according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank found policies announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak had boosted incomes by 2.8% for the poorest fifth of households. However, households on middle incomes would take a 2% hit, it added. Mr Sunak said his Budget had ""cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid"". That claim was challenged by the Foundation's figures. It said the changes to the amount families can keep from their earnings if they are on universal credit only partially offset the effect of withdrawing the Â£20-a-week boost during the pandemic. On average, recipients would lose Â£800 a year, it calculated. The Â£3,000 figure produced by the Resolution Foundation includes business taxes, which are regularly passed on to consumers. Of the 4.4 million households on universal credit, about three-quarters (3.2 million households) will be worse off as a result of decisions to take away the Â£20-a week-uplift, despite the chancellor's new universal credit measures. But 1.2 million households would be better off by Â£900 a year than before the Budget. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Rishi Sunak: The taxman takes the strain Responding to the Foundation's calculations, a Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: ""It's misleading to imply that households will immediately face a Â£3,000 tax hit, because this figure appears to include business and employers' taxes which aren't applicable directly to households. ""The same report shows that the government's policies are set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution and that higher taxes will mostly impact middle-to-higher income households. ""This government's decisions have been worth nearly Â£500 per year extra to households on average, and more than Â£1,000 for the poorest households - and that's before factoring in wage growth, including the rise in the National Living Wage."" Talking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Sunak said pressures on the economy ""will be with us for a while"", but that the government's plan was working and ""we can face the future with a bit more confidence"". He also said that wages were rising and that he had ""cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid people"", adding that it was his job to be concerned about inflation and his new fiscal rules were ""how we build up resilience"". Government figures show that when you take account of investment in public services, the average earner has seen improvements worth Â£500 a year overall. Setting out the Budget on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said his plans were focused on the ""post-Covid"" era and would pave the way for an ""economy of higher wages, higher skills, and rising productivity"". He told MPs the higher tax burden was down to the pandemic. ""Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,"" he said in his Budget speech. He committed to spending increases of Â£150bn over three years, including nearly Â£2bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, Â£6bn to tackle NHS backlogs and Â£7bn for transport projects. He also announced that the universal credit ""taper"" rate would be cut by 8% no later than 1 December, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every Â£1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. Meanwhile, the National Living Wage will increase next year by 6.6%, to Â£9.50 an hour. Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, welcomed the increases in spending announced by Mr Sunak, but said there were areas that gave her ""cause for concern"". Highlighting the need for greater investment in education, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If we are going to grow the economy sustainably, we have got to invest in our young people. ""Unless we ensure that kids catch up from that missed-out education [during the pandemic], there will be a long-term cost to our economy."" The Foundation's overnight analysis of the Budget and Spending Review 2021 revealed a deteriorating picture on family finances, with household incomes set to stagnate as a result of rising inflation. ""Higher taxes aren't a surprise, given the UK is combining fiscal conservatism with an ageing society and a slow-growing economy. But it is the end of low-tax conservatism, with the tax take rising by Â£3,000 per household by the middle of this decade,"" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. With higher growth, inflation and public spending than previously expected, combined with tax rises already in train, the Foundation warns that the UK could be set for a flat recovery for household living standards. The combined effect of universal credit changes, alcohol and fuel duties, higher council tax, income tax and national insurance delivered a 2.8% boost to the incomes of the poorest households. But middle-income households will see incomes drop by 2% and the richest fifth of households will suffer a 3.1% hit by the middle of the decade, the Foundation warned. In the wider population, wages are set to fall next year after inflation. It means the last decade has been the weakest decade for pay growth since the 1930s. By May 2024, real wages will have grown by just 2.4% since 2008 -  compared with a 38% real wage increase between 1992 and 2008. ""The chancellor got some really good news for the public finances yesterday - lower borrowing, because the economy's doing slightly better than we all though six months ago. But good news for public finances wasn't good news for household finances,"" the Foundation's Mr Bell told BBC Breakfast. ""That's because higher inflation that actually helped the chancellor with his borrowing figures is obviously hurting household budgets, and that's why the Office for Budget Responsibility expects household incomes and wages to actually not grow at all in the next year. ""So that's going to be really bad news for everyone worrying about their own budgets."" Price rises could hit highest rate in 30 years Did you get what you wanted from the Budget?

"The row began after the UK and Jersey rejected dozens of licences for French boats to fish in their waters The UK has said threats to block British boats from French ports in a dispute over fishing rights are a breach of international law and trade agreements. France said if there is no agreement by 2 November it will also tighten checks on UK boats and trucks, and could target Channel Island energy supplies. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the stance was ""disappointing"". He said the UK was seeking ""urgent clarification"" of France's plans. France was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing licences to dozens of French boats, and argued that it breached the Brexit deal. French anger as UK rejects most fishing permits Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? On Wednesday it issued its ultimatum, saying it would begin to impose ""targeted measures"" from Tuesday of next week, including: Preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports Increasing border and sanitary checks on UK goods Tightening security checks on British boats Increasing checks on trucks going to and from the UK France said it was also preparing further sanctions, which could include cutting electricity supplies to Jersey, as itpreviously threatened in May. ""The French state will continue to support its fisheries industry,"" the government said, adding that it expects answers from the UK ""in the next few days"". On Wednesday French maritime minister Annick Girardintweeted,externalthat two English ships had been fined during checks off Le Havre. She said the first did not comply ""spontaneously"" while the second, which did not have a licence to fish in French waters, was diverted to the quayside and ""handed over to the judicial authority"". Speaking before the news of the two vessels being stopped, Brexit minister Lord Frost said: ""It is very disappointing that France has felt it necessary to make threats late this evening against the UK fishing industry and seemingly traders more broadly. ""As we have had no formal communication from the French government on this matter we will be seeking urgent clarification of their plans. We will consider what further action is necessary in that light."" Downing Street said the ""disappointing and disproportionate"" threat of sanctions was ""not what we would expect from a close ally and partner"". ""The measures being threatened do not appear to be compatible with the Trade and Co-operation Agreement and wider international law, and, if carried through, will be met with an appropriate and calibrated response,"" a spokeswoman said. She said that the UK will raise concerns with both the EU and French government, arguing that it had granted 98% of licence applications from European boats.

They are ninth in the table, six points adrift of the joint leaders afterlosing at Rayo Vallecanoon Wednesday. The loss was Barca's third in their past four games and it followeddefeat by Real Madrid in Sunday's Clasico. In a statement, the Spanish club said: ""The president of the club, Joan Laporta, informed him [Koeman] of the decision after the defeat against Rayo Vallecano. ""Ronald Koeman will say goodbye to the squad on Thursday."" The former Netherlands, Everton and Southampton boss, 58, could only guide the five-time European champions to third place in the league last season. The Dutchman has not been helped by the club's significant financial problems, which resulted inLionel Messi's exitand subsequent move to Paris St-Germain in August. Barcelona were unable to spend any money on new signings in the summer, with Memphis Depay, Sergio Aguero and Eric Garcia arriving as free transfers and striker Luuk de Jong joining on loan from Sevilla. Speaking after Wednesday's defeat, Koeman said: ""It [Barcelona's league position] says we're not well. ""The team has lost balance in the squad, lost very effective players, which shows. In recent years other clubs have strengthened every season and we haven't, which also shows."" Club legend Xavi, the former Barca midfielder who is now manager of Qatari side Al Sadd, is one of the favourites to replace Koeman. It is the first time since September 1987 that Barca have lost three away games in a row without scoring - a run that saw English manager Terry Venables sacked. Koeman won the Copa del Rey at the end of his first season but Barca finished behind Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in La Liga with their lowest points tally since 2008. The former Netherlands centre-back played for the Spanish club between 1989 and 1995, helping them to four league titles and scoring the winning goal in the 1992 European Cup final. He was brought back to the club in August 2020 as head coach by former president Josep Maria Bartomeu. New chief Laporta, however, frequently made it clear the Dutchman was not his appointment. The duo had an uneasy relationship, and Koeman released a statement in September asking to be given time to rebuild after losing Messi and fellow forward Antoine Griezmann in the summer. Following the defeat by Madrid on Sunday, Koeman's car was surrounded by some Barcelona supporters, whom he later dismissed as ""uneducated people"". Speaking before the trip to Rayo Vallecano, he said: ""It is a social problem. Uneducated people that don't understand rules and values."" The toxic battle ripping apart a European giant This video can not be played Falcao scores and Depay misses penalty as Barcelona beaten One of Koeman's first tasks as coach was to make a40-second phone call to Luis Suarez,externalduring which he told the Uruguay striker his services were no longer required and that he was free to leave the club. The decision had been made by the board and it's now known the dire financial position forced them to get rid of a forward who scored 21 goals from 29 starts in the previous campaign. It began a weakening of the Barca squad from one that could compete with Europe's elite to one that is struggling to get into the Champions League places. Messi then handed in a transfer requestbut ended up staying for 2020-21 butSuarez joined Atletico Madridfor a nominal fee and fired them to the league title. Behind the scenes the club's costs had spiralled to an unsustainable level, creating the biggest wage bill in world football and leaving Barcelonaon the verge of bankruptcyand a stadium that requires renovation. With Messi out of contract, the Argentina superstaragreed a new deal in July of this yearuntil 2026 that included halving his wages, but La Liga stipulated Barca must reduce their wage bill further before he and any new players could be registered. They weren't able to do that, so in August the club announced thatMessi would be leaving""because of financial and structural obstacles"". He joined Paris St-Germain, then Koeman lost more talent when France forward Griezmann followed Suarez to Atletico Madrid - rejoining the club he had left in aÂ£107m dealtwo years before on a loan in a snapshot of where it has gone wrong for Barcelona. They managed to sign former Manchester United forward Depay and Aguero on free transfers but the former Manchester City striker has only just made his Barca debut after getting injured in pre-season. The transformation from a forward line of Messi, Suarez and Griezmann to Depay, De Jong and an ageing Aguero sums up the task Koeman faced and which will now greet his successor.

"The impact of Brexit on the UK economy will be worse in the long run compared to the coronavirus pandemic, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility has said. Richard Hughes said leaving the EU would reduce the UK's potential GDP by about 4% in the long term. He said forecasts showed the pandemic would reduce GDP ""by a further 2%"". ""In the long term it is the case that Brexit has a bigger impact than the pandemic"", he told the BBC. His comments come after the OBR said the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, with suggestions inflation could hit almost 5%. Speaking after Wednesday's Budget, Mr Hughes said recent data showed the impact of Brexit was ""broadly consistent"" with the OBR's assumption that the leaving the EU would ""reduce our long run GDP by around 4%"". ""We think that the effect of the pandemic will reduce that (GDP) output by a further 2%,"" he added. The Treasury has been contacted for comment. What is GDP and how is it measured? GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It is a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly higher than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc on 31 January 2020, however, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, before a new trade deal was announced and implemented on 1 January this year. Both the pandemic and Brexit have played a part in current supply chain issues across the UK, and have further exposed the scarcity of lorry drivers, which has resulted in recent shortages of products for businesses and some empty shelves for customers. However, in the OBR's latest report, the independent body said ""supply bottlenecks had been exacerbated by changes in the migration and trading regimes following Brexit"". Supply chain issues has led to the government granting short-term visas to EU workers across certain sectors, including the haulage industry. The British Poultry Council has said turkey farmers will do their best to ensure Christmas ""is as normal as it can be"", but warned shortages are likely, due to ashortage of seasonal overseas workers. The government has assured consumers that turkeys will be available for the festive season and has also deployed temporary visas in a bid to bolster worker numbers.

"Marmots at Twycross Zoo - one of the winners of the Levelling Up fund A zoo in Bosworth and a pool in Halifax are among the beneficiaries of the government's levelling up fund. The Â£4.8bn pot of money was launched last year and now the Treasuryhas said which areas,externalwere successful in their bids for the first tranche of cash. Local authorities, with the support of local MPs, could apply for money for regeneration and transport projects. Newly-appointed levelling-up secretary Michael Govehas said the policy,externalwould mean people would see a visible difference in their area. However, critics of this fund have questioned whether small pots of money for local projects across the UK will transform the economy and create jobs long-term without a country-wide strategy. Addressing the Conservative conference earlier this month, Mr Gove said ""levelling up"" was also about long-term economic transformation. Successful bids for the initial Â£1.4bn pot of money include: Â£19.9m for Twycross Zoo in Bosworth Â£19.5m for Rotherham town centre Â£20m for Bolton College of Medical Science Â£12.2m for Halifax swimming pool Â£20m for Aberdeen City Centre Â£9.3m  to upgrade Whitechapel Road in East London. Aberdeen will get Â£20m to improve its city centre Analysis by political correspondent Ione Wells The government has been under pressure to define what their much-touted policy - ""levelling up"" - actually means. We know it's usually used to describe tackling regional inequality - but has at times been a catch-all phrase to promote everything from more money for tennis courts to tackling crime. The government's new levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has previously said the first part of it involves people seeing a visible difference in their areas being made more attractive - which the government hopes these pots of cash will start to do. But he's also said levelling up involves long-term economic transformation and job creation. Critics of this fund have questioned whether or not small pots for different local projects around the UK - bid for competitively by councils and local MPs - will strategically transform the economy or create jobs long-term. Though the government would argue other policies, like their cut to the universal credit taper rate and investment in transport links, are more targeting these things. The fund has also been criticised for not giving devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a role in handing out the cash, especially where bids involve funding things like infrastructure that might otherwise be a matter for governments there to make decisions on. We also don't know who the 'losers' were in this first round of bids, and which areas missed out on cash. In his Budget speech the chancellor appeared to deliberately address accusations of 'pork-barrel' politics - as bids had to be backed by local MPs and bypassed devolved governments. Pork barrel politics is term generally used to refer disapprovingly of politicians funnelling money to their own constituents, regardless of need. However, Mr Sunak specifically referred to the three successful bids in Conservative Stoke-on-Trent seats but also highlighted the successful bids in Ashton under Lyne, Doncaster, South Leicester, Sunderland and West Leeds - which include the seats of Angela Rayner, Ed Miliband, Jonathan Ashworth, Rachel Reeves and Bridget Philipson - all members of Labour's shadow cabinet. He said: ""We are so committed to levelling up that we are even levelling up the opposition front bench."" Moseley Road Baths is over 100 years old Responding to the Budget, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the chancellor ""gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other"". She accused Mr Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of operating a ""classic con game"". ""The prime minister is the front man - distracting people with his wild promises -all the while, his chancellor dips his hand in their pocket. ""It all seems like fun and games until you walk away and realise your purse has been lifted."" Analysis by Peter Barnes and Joseph Cassidy, BBC Political Research Unit The list of successful bids includes 76 in England, 11 in Northern Ireland, 10 in Wales and 8 in Scotland (105 total) with a total value of Â£1.7bn. In some instances more than one parliamentary constituency is set to benefit, and in some cases it's hard to judge how the effects will be shared between constituencies. But BBC analysis suggests the following breakdown by party: Conservative-only constituencies: Â£627m Labour-only constituencies: Â£507m SNP-only constituencies: Â£135m Other parties/local authority areas with more than one party: Â£424m Montgomery Canal will get Â£15.5m Over Twitter, Mr Sunak challenged Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, to celebrate the news that as part of the fund, Â£17.6m would go toward improving Leicester railway station. ""Let me know if you want me to retweet,"" he said. Mr Ashworth hit back tweeting: ""We're still waiting for you to properly compensate our Leicester businesses for forcing a local lockdown on us last year or reverse the increasing numbers of children in poverty across Leicester thanks to your cuts. ""Let me know when that's sorted so I can retweet,"" he replied.

"Taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine following a shake-up of alcohol duty. The new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said. The duty premium on sparkling wines will end and the duty on draught beer and cider served in pubs will be cut. Chancellor Rishi Sunak called it the ""most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years"". He also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Follow live coverage of the Budget Economy set to hit pre-Covid level at end of year ""To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,"" the chancellor said. ""Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength."" Mr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were ""currently overtaxed"", adding: ""Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less."" In relation to sparkling wines, Mr Sunak said: ""I'm going to end the irrational duty premium of 28% that they currently pay. Sparkling wines - wherever they are produced - will now pay the same duty as still wines of equivalent strength."" The cut to sparkling wine duty was welcomed by Kate Goodman, owner of Cheshire drinks importer Reserve Wines, but she was disappointed that the change was not immediate. ""Christmas is our busiest period. It would have great to introduce this before that time. We need help to get back on our feet after a pretty crippling 18 months,"" she said. Reducing duty on lower alcohol drinks will encourage people to buy English wines, said Jonathan Piggins, chief executive of English wine merchant Corkk. ""The UK's vineyards are being taken increasingly seriously by the major overseas players and reducing the tax on lower alcohol drinks, will give the country an even more prominent position on the global wine map."" The changes were less welcomed by Liam Manton, co-founder of Didsbury Gin. ""Additional tax on high ABV drinks will present a real challenge to businesses like ours,"" he said, adding that on average 70% of the price of a bottle of gin is already tax. Draught beers and ciders will attract a new lower rate of duty In a move to help struggling pubs, Mr Sunak announced a new lower rate of duty for draught drinks, which he said would cut the cost of a pint by about three pence. He said the ""draught relief will cut duty by 5%"" and ""will apply to drinks served from draught containers over 40 litres"". The chancellor said this would particularly benefit community pubs ""who do 75% of their trade on draught"". He also announced proposals for a new ""small producer relief"" to include small cidermakers and other producers making alcoholic drinks of less than 8.5% alcohol by volume (ABV). Jez Lamb, founder of Wirral-based craft beer marketplace, Beers @ No.42, said the draught relief favoured the big players in the market, not the smaller, independent breweries who need support most. ""It's brilliant to see alcohol duty cut on draught beer but that's only for ""containers"" more than 40L. That is great for the big breweries but so many smaller craft brewers only supply in 30L containers,"" he said. Creating a draught rate and simplifying the duty system is positive news, said Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, which has 2,700 pubs. ""It is a much needed vote of confidence in the great British pub as we face into an uncertain winter, labour disruption and rising costs."" William Robinson, managing director of Stockport brewery Robinsons, said the lower draught beer duty rate and the cancellation of the planned inflation-linked increase in beer duty showed that the chancellor ""recognises the contribution pubs make to the communities they support and serve.""
