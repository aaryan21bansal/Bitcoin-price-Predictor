"Charities are calling on the chancellor to protect the jobs of workers who have been shielding during the pandemic. A total of 15 charities have warned in an open letter that workers will be forced to choose between health and their jobs, when restrictions ease. ""Some of these workers will find themselves in an impossible position,"" the letter says. A government spokesperson said that the government had ""worked tirelessly"" to support the clinically vulnerable. This video can not be played This video has been removed for editorial reasons From 1 August, extremely clinically vulnerable people who have stayed at home to protect themselves from coronavirus in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are allowed to return to work. But charities including Age UK and Macmillan Cancer Support have said that these employees could be at risk of being made redundant, or returning to the workplace when they do not feel it is safe. Chancellor 'turning his back' on people needing support 'People shielding too scared to leave home' The terror of re-joining the outside world More than two million people deemed extremely vulnerable to coronavirus are shielding in England. About 595,000 of those people usually work, according to the charities. ""Our concern is that, especially as your furlough arrangements start to unwind and the shielding scheme is paused from next week, some of these workers will find themselves in an impossible position,"" the charities write in the letter. ""This is because if their occupation is one which they cannot carry out from home, and if it is extremely difficult to make their workplace safe for them, they may be forced to choose between putting their health on the line by returning, or staying safe by giving up their job."" The charities say this is ""desperately unfair"" for those who have made ""great sacrifices"" by staying at home, and call on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to take action and protect their jobs, as well as supporting businesses. A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""We understand how challenging the outbreak pandemic has been for the clinically vulnerable and we have worked tirelessly to support them. ""Employers must ensure the safety of those with such conditions when considering working arrangements, including whether work can be completed remotely."" Some people have been shielding since March He added that the Treasury had also announced Â£750m in funding for charities to enable them to continue their important work, ensuring those on the front line are able to reach people who need help. Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK and a signatory of the letter, said: ""No-one should be faced with the impossible task of choosing between their health, by returning to work in an unsafe environment, and their financial security. ""The government must ensure that employers are supported to take all the necessary measures to keep all employees safe, if they are expected to attend work outside their home. He added that the government should introduce a new support scheme for clinically vulnerable people who are unable to return to a safe work environment. Employers have been told to make sure that people who are shielding can work from home wherever possible, including moving them to another role if required,according to government guidance.,external If bosses cannot provide a safe working environment, those who are clinically vulnerable will be able to access financial support including statutory sick pay and welfare payments, it has said. The charities' letter also suggests extending the furlough scheme for those who have been shielding or are at high-risk. Currently, the UK's coronavirus furlough scheme is set to finish at the end of October. The latest figures show that 9.5 million people are using the scheme,external, at a total cost of Â£31.7bn to the Treasury.

"Amazon's Jeff Bezos testifies to Congress by remote video The coronavirus crisis might be causing widespread economic upheaval around the world, but the world's biggest tech firms are thriving. Amazon sales soared 40% in the three months ending June, while Apple saw a surge in purchases of its iPhones and other hardware. At Facebook, the number of people on its platforms, which include WhatsApp and Instagram, jumped by 15%. The gains come as the firms face scrutiny over their size and power. At a hearing in Washington on Wednesday, lawmakers grilled the companies about whether they were abusing their dominance to quash rivals, noting the sharp contrast between their fortunes and many other firms. Their positions are likely to become even stronger, as the pandemic pushes even more activity online, said Congressman David Cicilline, the Democrat who leads the committee. Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google face claims of 'harmful' power Apple has â¬13bn Irish tax bill overturned Amazon, Google and Wish remove neo-Nazi products ""Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, these corporations already stood out as titans in our economy,""  he said. ""In the wake of COVID-19, however, they are likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before."" The gains weren't a surprise to analysts - though just how well many of the firms did, was. At Amazon, the quarterly profit of $5.2bn (Â£4bn) was the biggest since the company's start in 1994 and came despite heavy spending on protective gear and other measures due to the virus. ""This is an exceptional quarter on all fronts under extreme circumstances,"" Moody's vice president Charlie O'Shea said of Amazon's blockbuster rise. The e-commerce firm's sales surged 40% for the three months ending 30 June to $88.9bn (Â£67.9bn) - its strongest year-on-year growth in years. Profits rose to $5.2bn from 2.6bn for the same period in 2019. Amazon says it is running out of space due to a surge in online shopping orders The flood of online shopping has strained the firm's capacity. Amazon hired about 175,000 people in the quarter and is working to expand its warehouse space in anticipation of continued growth. ""We've run out of space,"" chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts about the results. Meanwhile, Apple said quarterly revenues jumped 11% year-on-year to $59.7bn. The shift to remote work and school helped drive demand for new devices, such as Macs and iPads, both of which saw double-digit gains. Profits hit $11.25bn, up from $10bn in the same period a year ago. Apple said the release of the low-cost iPhone SE in April had helped to boost sales and put the electronics giant in a better position, despite the financial impacts of the coronavirus crisis. ""The last few months have underlined the importance of users - and households alike - to own better quality devices, connections and services,"" said Paolo Pescatore, tech analyst at PP Foresight. ""Apple smashed it."" At Facebook, revenues rose 11% - slower than other quarters - but were still ahead of analysts' expectations, as small businesses continued to turn to the company to advertise. The firm's profits hit almost $5.2bn for the quarter. Could a boycott kill Facebook? Amazon v EU: Has the online giant met its match? The resilience was helped by a spike in users, which makes the firm attractive to advertisers, said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The firm said 2.4 billion people were active on its social media platforms and messaging apps on average in June, up 15% from last year. That included nearly 1.79 billion daily active users on Facebook, up 12% year-on-year. As lockdowns have eased, Facebook said it was ""seeing signs of normalisation in user growth and engagement"", warning those figures could flatten or decline in the months to come. Ms Lund-Yates said the firm also remains vulnerable to social and political pressure, which could just as quickly push users away again. ""But this isn't the first time Facebook's navigated regulatory or social speed bumps, and it has deep pockets to throw at fixing problems,"" she said. Google's offices in New York City, boarded up to prevent looting in June Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, was the weakest of the four. The search giant said revenues were $38.3bn, down 2% from a year ago, as businesses cut back on ad spending. It was the first year-on-year decline in quarterly revenue for the search giant, since Google became a publicly-listed company in 2004. Profits dropped about 30% year-on-year to roughly $7bn. But even those falls failed to faze analysts, who had expected damage. ""We expected April to be the bottom of the digital ad market, with a return to growth in May and June, and these results suggest that acceleration was stronger than expected,"" eMarketer principal analyst Nicole Perrin said.

"Groups of up to 30 people will be able to meet while social distancing outdoors in places like Cardiff Castle from Monday Up to 30 people can meet outdoors and children under 11 will not have to social distance in Wales from Monday. Swimming pools, gyms, leisure centres and indoor play areas, including soft play, will be allowed to reopen from 10 August. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the new guidance for children was because of their lower rates of transmission. Licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen from Monday, but receptions will need to be outdoors. The changes are part of the latest review to the coronavirus rules in Wales. Live: What will lockdown easing bring? Mr Drakeford admitted on Friday thatnew lockdown restrictionsin the north west of England had given him ""pause for thought"" before easing the rules further. But he said the changes bring those areas line with Wales, and declined to call for people not to travel from the places affected. Plaid Cymru has called for measures to limit non-essential travel from the affected areas. Mr Drakeford suggested Wales was near the limit of what could reopen and the ""headroom"" that was left could be needed to allow schools to reopen in September. ""I think we are now pretty close to the point where most aspects of the Welsh economy have been able to reopen,"" he said. ""There are a small number of things still on a list that can't reopen - nightclubs, casinos and so on. ""I think it'd be a while before they are able to reopen."" Research by University College London suggested 61% of adults in Wales had a ""broad understanding"" of current lockdown rules, compared with 45% in England. But of the 7,600 people from Wales who took part in the Covid-19 Social Study, only 18% reported ""complete understanding"" of guidelines as lockdown has eased. The percentage agreeing to the same question in England was 14%. The latest three week review means that from Monday up to 30 people will be able to meet outside, while social distancing, regardless of how many households they are from. This video can not be played Ian and Elizabeth were among the first to get married after rules were eased More may be able to meet indoors from 15 August but Mr Drakeford said he wanted more data on the infection rate before confirming it. ""It is the most risky thing you can do,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""People would have heard this morningfreedoms in the north of England being reversedin relation to people meeting indoors because of the evidence that the virus is being spread by households meeting indoors,"" he said. ""We hope not to be in a position of having to reverse decisions in Wales, so we will wait another couple of weeks."" Meanwhile: Indoor bowling alleys, auction houses and bingo halls will be able to resume trading on Monday, alongsideindoor pubs, restaurants and cafes- providing there is social distancing Swimming pools, spas, indoor leisure centres, gyms and children's indoor play can open on 10 August, as long as coronavirus conditions ""remain favourable"" Licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen from Monday in Wales. Receptions will need to be outdoors, but that could change from 15 August. People have already been able to get married in places of worship. Greater Manchester residents have been told they cannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens The Scottish Government haswarned people to not to travelto the areas of England affected by new local lockdown rules, and anyone planning to travel from there to Scotland to cancel their plans. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said by not limiting non-essential travel from affected parts of England, there was a risk of ""undoing all the good work to contain outbreaks in both countries"". ""Restrictions have been imposed in the north west of England to try to slow down transmission there, but with many of the four million affected people regularly travelling to the north of Wales for work or for holidays, this has a direct impact here, too,"" he said. But Mr Drakeford said ""travel restrictions in their own right"" were not being considered, and instead said visitors from elsewhere in the UK were ""welcome"". ""If you come to Wales, please help us to keep Wales safe,"" he told a press conference. What do the latest lockdown rules mean? First minister 'very keen to allow gyms to reopen' Coronavirus spike being watched 'very carefully' The first minister called for visitors to ""to maintain social distance, make sure you wash your hands,"" and ""if you're using shared facilities do so carefully and consciously"". People living in Greater Manchester and other parts of northern England have been told they cannot mix with other households in private homes or gardens. But Mr Drakeford said the measures ""by and large brings the position there into line with the position that we already have here in Wales"". Mark Drakeford warned coronavirus could thrive once autumn returns Part of the reason for relaxing lockdown restrictions in Wales is to allow people to make the most of the outdoors ""while we can,"" the first minister said. Mr Drakeford said the situation would be assessed again in the autumn ahead of a period where coronavirus could ""thrive"". ""The summer weeks are going through our fingers,"" he said. ""We still have the whole of August and with a bit of luck most of September in which people will be able to enjoy the outdoors. ""We will then have to assess in the autumn, when we know we are heading into the time of year - the cold, the dark, the damp - all those conditions that coronavirus thrives in."" The news comes as health officials deal with aspike in cases in Wrexham. Mr Drakeford also said he had discussed not relaxing rules in that part of Wales. However ""weighing it all up and knowing that the Wrexham spikes are contained to particular sites at the moment, we think it's right to allow people in Wrexham to benefit from these steps ahead as well as everybody else"", he said. ""If we need to, we've always said, we would take local action and we review that very carefully every day."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mark Drakeford spoke for the first time since 28 May on Friday. A call was held between the PM and the first ministers of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. BBC Wales was told it was held at Mr Johnson's request. Mr Drakeford said they discussed the lockdown changes in northern England. Scientific advice says coronavirus is likely to decay quickly in sunlight The Welsh Government has been slower than other parts of the UK in lifting restrictions, and Welsh Labour ministers have emphasised a cautious approach. But as coronavirus cases fell some of the most severe lockdown rules - including the travel ban and the enforced closure of non-essential shops - were removed. At the same time measures such as contact tracing have been stepped up, with the hope that more testing will allow outbreaks to be isolated and stopped in their tracks. Children under the age of 11 will not need to keep 2m apart The Welsh Conservatives' Darren Millar said earlier this week that freedoms ""have or are being safely restored in other parts of the UK and people in Wales should be able to enjoy them too"". Plaid Cymru said any easing of restrictions needed to be accompanied by a ""robust mechanism to stamp out coronavirus outbreaks"". The coronavirus lockdown in Wales is controlled by the Welsh Government, while the UK government in London has been dealing with the equivalent rules in England.

"Restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester can reopen from Monday Pubs and restaurants in Leicester are set to reopen from Monday as a number of lockdown restrictions in the city are lifted. It follows an announcement by Health Secretary Matt Hancock that conditionshad been tightened in parts of northern England. He said those restrictions on household visits would also apply in Leicester. The borough of Oadby and Wigston, on the city outskirts, will be removed from lockdown from midnight. Initially the government had said it would be Monday. People living in Leicester, Oadby and Wigstonwere told to observe strict measures from 29 Juneafter a localised spike in coronavirus cases. TheDepartment of Health and Social Care said,externalrestaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester can trade again from Monday but leisure centres, gyms and pools must remain closed. Cinemas and museums are also allowed to open and religious ceremonies can be held. Leicester and some neighbouring areas were told to observe strict measures from 29 June Ivan Browne, director of public health for Leicester, said the infection rate had fallen to around 55 per 100,000 people, which he said is ""a substantial drop"" from the beginning of the local lockdown, when the number was 135. He said health officials are looking to reduce the rate to below 50 ""because that's kind of an international figure"" with the further aim of ""20 or below"" by September. ""I think from there that would get us in the best position possible for winter that better reflects the national picture - below 10%,"" he said. ""That's what we're setting as our local target and we're pushing hard for that."" Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said there was ""a lot of frustration"" with how the city had been treated Leicester West MP Liz Kendall tweeted that she had spoken to Mr Hancock and called it ""great news"". ""This has been an unbelievably difficult period for our city but people's hard work and sacrifices have paid off,"" the Labour MP said. But she described the government's handling of the lockdown as ""totally shambolic"" and ""lessons must be learnt for the future to prevent others going through the same"". Allow Twitter content?

On Thursday, the mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, said city officials had been ""messed about"" by central government, and following the announcement called for ""clarity"" on what city residents can do. ""What we need is to understand what can open and when it can open, understand what we can do about meeting up with family and friends and where they can do that; and what is particularly unclear is what the travel restrictions are going to be,"" he told a news conference on Friday.

Rachael Bradley said the government's handling of the lockdown has been ""absolutely shambolic"" Rachael Bradley, 48, from Knighton, said: ""The way it was handled was absolutely shambolic.

"""The laminated book of dreams,"" was how comedian Bill Bailey jokingly described the plastic-coated Argos catalogue. But 48 years on from its launch, the catalogue is finally coming to an end. The encyclopedia-like catalogues, the basis of many a child's Christmas wishlist, will no longer be regularly printed by the end of January 2021. The catalogue was first launched in 1972 and at its peak was Europe's most widely-printed publication, with only the Bible in more homes across the UK. Read more:Life lessons from the Argos catalogue Comedian Alan Carr famously picked the Argos catalogue as his book choice on Radio 4's programme Desert Island Discs. ""At least there's pictures,"" he said at the time. ""I feel it would help me through."" But now Argos says that online shopping offers ""greater convenience"" than flicking through its print catalogue and no further take-home editions of the catalogue will be produced. Instead, its products will be only listed and displayed online. The catalogue was first launched in 1972 The retailer has produced more than one billion copies of its bi-annual catalogue during its 48-year run, which quickly became synonymous with the brand. During its heyday, its pages featured the likes of Emma Bunton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. In fact, some of the UK's best known celebrities once graced the laminated pages of the retail bible. Strictly Come Dancing presenter Tess Daly modelled clothes for the company before she went on to become a household name in television. This Morning host Holly Willoughby also made an appearance in the late 90s while she was still working as a lingerie model. Other stars who began their career within its pages included actress Michelle Collins, supermodel Lisa Snowdon and presenter Emma Willis. The catalogue became so popular that at one stage more than 10 million copies were printed. However, that dipped to around three million copies when the now-final version was released in January this year. As word of the catalogue's demise spread across social media there was an outpouring of grief. Many declared childhood had been ""ruined"" by the news and decrying that children will never know the joys of circling potential birthday and Christmas gifts. 'RIP Argos' wrote one person, while another said it was another ""horror"" for 2020. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mark Given, chief marketing officer at Sainsbury's - which owns Argos, said the move was in response to a shift in customers' shopping habits. ""Over the decades the Argos catalogue has charted the nation's changing tastes and trends in everything from must-have toys to the latest gadgets and devices,"" he said. ""Just as our customers' tastes have changed over the years, so have their shopping habits. We're seeing an increasing shift towards digital shopping, using our mobile app, website and in-store browsers."" Customers shopping on smartphones and tablets now account for more than 70% of all Argos online sales. The retailer said it would still produce a print version of its annual Christmas gift guide. Steve Dresser, director at Grocery Insight, told the BBC that it had only been a matter of time before the retailer made the shift to digital-only. ""Everyone uses the internet for ordering nowadays, and e-commerce is experiencing a stratospheric rise again,"" he explained. ""Post-Covid 19 there is even less of a call for a catalogue. ""The reality is the march of technology and progression doesn't spare anything, not even the beloved Argos catalogue.""

TheOffice for National Statistics says,externalthat Spain saw the highest peak in rates of death in Europe. But the UK had the longest period of above-average deaths and so overall saw higher death rates. By 29 May, the death rate in England was 7.5% higher than it has been in recent years.

The ONS analysis also looked at how individual cities were affected. Cities in Spain and Italy, like Barcelona, Milan and Madrid, were harder hit than any city in the UK.

"The pharmacy in John Wood Street is one of two businesses linked to the cluster A further two people have tested positive for Covid-19 as part of a cluster of cases in the Inverclyde area. The total number of positive cases involved is now 13, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday. Amazon has confirmed that a member of staff, based at a warehouse in Gourock, is in quarantine. An M&D Green Pharmacy in Port Glasgow is also linked. Some individuals visited a number of businesses in the Greater Glasgow area. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) said they may have been infectious at the time. Pharmacy linked to Inverclyde Covid-19 cluster Scotland's virus death 'capital' calls for support The businesses included The Botany bar and restaurant in Glasgow, and Sweeney's Cruises in West Dunbartonshire, both on Sunday. Individuals also visited The Queen of the Loch by Marston's Inn in Balloch and Lomond Woods Holiday Park on the weekend of 24 July. All the businesses linked to the outbreak are continuing to operate, and the health board has previously said the cases were only experiencing mild symptoms. In a statement on Facebook, Sweeney's Cruises said they were visited by council health officials and had been ""given the green light to carry on with our daily cruises"". Queen Of The Loch and Marston's Inn said on Facebook that it had ""enhanced cleaning procedures in place"", had undergone a ""full deep clean"" and was co-operating with the local authority. None of the cases linked to the pharmacy are currently working there and customers have been told it is safe to keep using its facilities. Dr Daniel Carter, consultant in public health medicine and chairman of the incident management team dealing with the cluster, said: ""All those who have tested positive for Covid-19 are self-isolating and we are working with a number of businesses including a local pharmacy to trace any close contacts. ""We would like to take this opportunity to remind local residents of the importance of continuing with the general measures to minimise the risk of Covid-19 to themselves and to others."" Ms Sturgeon has previously thanked the businesses concerned for ""acting swiftly, and for fully cooperating with the guidance and procedures to contain this cluster"". Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe said news of the local cluster was ""soul-destroying"" in an area which has already been one of the worst-hit by coronavirus in Scotland. ""There has been a lot of anxiety, rightly, in the community over the last few months,"" he said. ""We saw some light at the end of the tunnel with the number of deaths reducing - in the previous three weeks we didn't have any - and now this has come back. ""But there is a degree of reassurance that the effective systems are in place and hopefully we can contain the virus."" Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe said he was hopeful the virus could be contained Mr McCabe also said he hoped track and trace measures could help avoid a local lockdown. He said: ""Obviously, if the outbreak can't be contained, there are potential consequences. ""We have seen in Dumfries and Galloway and parts of England that major outbreaks do lead potentially to local lockdowns and I hope we can avoid that situation."" Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday that the pharmacy in Port Glasgow was still open but that locals should not be concerned about using services. He said: ""We've been in touch with the pharmacy and we're very, very comfortable with how the pharmacy has behaved both up to this point and yesterday. ""People should not be scared to use pharmacies in the area."" He added that the option of a local lockdown to control the Inverclyde cluster was being kept ""in reserve"" and would be used if necessary. ""If we thought this virus had gone into community transmission mode, like we saw in early and late March, then we would of course do something more dramatic,"" he said. M&D Green managing director Martin Green said ""some staff"" at its John Wood Street branch had tested positive for Covid-19. He said: ""We have been working with Health Protection Scotland and environmental health officers, who are satisfied with the infection control measures we have in place and have immediately implemented the minor additional actions recommended."" Mr Green added: ""We have been reassured by the local outbreak management team that these measures allow us to continue to provide the full range of pharmaceutical services without any risk to the public."" Amazon said a warehouse worker at its Gourock site was in quarantine In a statement, Amazon said they were supporting the individual in quarantine and were following guidelines from health officials about operations at their buildings. They added: ""We have implemented proactive measures to protect employees, including increased cleaning at all facilities and maintaining social distance."" CASES:Where are the latest cases?

"The president suggested postal voting could lead to fraud and inaccurate results Top Republicans have rejected President Donald Trump's suggestion that November's presidential election should be delayed over alleged fraud concerns. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy both dismissed the idea. Mr Trump does not have the authority to postpone the election, as any delay would have to be approved by Congress. Earlier, the president suggested that increased postal voting could lead to fraud and inaccurate results. He floated a delay until people could ""properly, securely and safely"" vote. There is little evidence to support Mr Trump's claims but he has long railed against postal voting, which he has said would be susceptible to fraud. US states want to make mail-in voting easier because of public health concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Could Donald Trump delay the presidential election? Mr Trump's intervention came as new figures showed the US economy had suffered the worst contraction since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Senator McConnell said no US presidential election had ever been delayed before. ""Never in the history of this country, through wars, depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time. We will find a way to do that again this November third,"" he told local Kentucky station WNKY. Mr McCarthy echoed him. ""Never in the history of the federal elections have we ever not held an election and we should go forward with our election,"" he said. Trump ally Senator Lindsay Graham meanwhile said a delay was ""not a good idea"". However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to be drawn on Mr Trump's suggestion. Quizzed by reporters on whether a president could delay an election, he said he would not ""enter a legal judgement on the fly"". The spokesman for Mr Trump's re-election campaign, Hogan Gidley, said Mr Trump had just been ""raising a question"". Donald Trump can't delay November's presidential election without Congress, partially controlled by the Democrats, first approving the decision. If he didn't already know this, someone has certainly told him by now. The president also must know that tweeting about a delay - even framed as an ""I'm just asking!"" question - is sure to ignite a political firestorm, particularly after he has repeatedly refused to say whether he'd accept an adverse result in the upcoming presidential election. Mr Trump appears to be doing everything in his power to undermine the credibility of November's vote, in which a record number of Americans are predicted to rely on mail-in voting to avoid the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. He's repeatedly made false and misleading claims about the reliability of the mail balloting and suggested broad conspiracy theories. Critics warn that he could be laying the groundwork for contesting the results - although the purpose may be simply to give him a scapegoat if he loses. His tweet could also be an attempt to divert attention away from the truly dismal second-quarter economic numbers just released. He's been relying on a financial turnaround to breathe life into his re-election campaign, and instead the outlook appears exceedingly gloomy. Whatever the reason, tweeting about an election delay is not the move of a candidate confident of victory - and could be a sign of more desperate moves to come. Read Anthony's full analysis At a Thursday afternoon White House news conference, Mr Trump denied he wanted to postpone the election, but argued that mass postal voting would leave the result in doubt. ""I don't want to delay, I want to have the election,"" he said. ""But I also don't want to have to wait for three months and then find out that the ballots are all missing and the election doesn't mean anything."" ""I don't want to see a crooked election,"" Mr Trump also told reporters. ""This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens."" In a series of tweets earlier, Mr Trump railed against mass postal voting and warned - without providing evidence - that it would be susceptible to foreign interference. Allow Twitter content?

In June, New York allowed voters to vote by post in the Democratic primary poll for the party's presidential candidate. But there have been long delays in counting the ballots and the results are still unknown. US media report that there are also concerns that many ballots will not be counted because they were not filled in correctly or do not have postmarks on them that show they were sent before voting officially ended. According to the Washington Post,external, US Postal Service workers say backlogs may delay delivery of ballots in time for November's election because of cost-cutting measures under the Trump administration. President Trump does not have the authority to move the date of the election, which by law is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Any change of date would need to be approved by both houses of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats control the House of Representatives and some have already said they will not support any delay to the vote. Any move by Congress to delay the election into 2021 would also require a constitutional amendment, US media quoted constitutional experts as saying. The week when everything changed for Trump Earlier this month, six US states were planning to hold ""all-mail"" ballot elections in November: California, Utah, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.Other states are considering it,external, according to a postal voting campaign group. These states will automatically send postal ballots to all registered voters, which then have to be sent back or dropped off on election day - although some in-person voting is still available in certain limited circumstances. About half of US states allow any registered voter to cast their ballot by post on request. Does US postal voting lead to fraud? Does Trump have power to delay election?

"Sarah Hassall served in the RAF and the Army A man has been sentenced to life in prison for theÂ ""inexplicable"" murder ofÂ a woman who he ""lured"" to his flat after meeting in a pub. Married mother-of-two Sarah Hassall, 38, from Chelmsford, Essex, was discovered with 22 stab wounds in Brian Manship's flat in Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, on 6 October. Manship, 37, from Llys Graig Y Wion, Pontypridd, who had pleaded guilty, was jailed at Swansea Crown Court. He will serve a minimum of 20 years. The court heard Manship met Mrs Hassall at a pub in Pontypridd a before taking her back to his flat where she was found the next morning. Sentencing Manship, Judge Keith Thomas said Mrs Hassall had ""found it difficult to adapt to civilian life after leaving the Army to concentrate on bringing up her two sons"". He added: ""Unfortunately, she turned to drink as a means of coping with her issues and her life spiralled downwards. ""She seemed to be turning her life back around until you crossed her path."" He said the night they met the pair had gone onto a bar together before leaving just before 03:00 BST and picking up a bottle of vodka before heading back to his flat. South Wales Police shared this image of Manship's arrest He said the following morning a neighbour heard noises of ""banging, crashing and screaming and a female voice, undoubtedly, Mrs Hassall, shouting 'get off me, get off me, leave me alone'"". Judge Thomas said as the neighbour left his flat he saw Mrs Hassall at a window: ""She appeared to him to be distressed, dishevelled and injured. She mouthed the words, 'Help me, help me.' ""The woman then disappeared from the window and the crashing and banging resumed."" He said the neighbour dialled 999 but later heard Mrs Hassall saying: ""I will have sex with you again, I won't tell anybody, please let me go; I'll do anything, please let me go."" The police were unable to gain entry to the flat until 08.24 BST by which time Mrs Hassall was fatally injured. Brian Manship will serve a minimum of 20 years Judge Thomas said a forensic examination of the flat showed Mrs Hassall had been subjected to a ""sustained attack"". He said the pathologist found she sustained 22 stab wounds and seven slash wounds. ""I have no doubt that you intended to kill Mrs Hassall,"" he said. Manship escaped through a first floor window but hours later was found hiding in undergrowth by firearms officers. Mrs Hassall's husband Graham said in a victim impact statement that he had no doubt his wife's last thoughts would have been of her children. He wrote the statement on the eve of their son's ninth birthday. ""Not only did you exploit a vulnerable person, you went on to kill her in the most horrible way possible, in a protracted and fear-inducing manner,"" Mr Hassall said of Manship. Speaking after sentencing, Ch Insp Mark O'Shea from South Wales Police's Major Crime Team said Mrs Hassall had been ""lured to Manship's flat and killed in the most dreadful way"". He said: ""Sarah Hassall was a young mother to two small children. ""She was a much loved wife, daughter and sister, as well as a friend to many people. ""I have spoken with those that knew her and the grief they feel is palpable and powerful. ""She was brutally murdered by him in a completely unprovoked and inexplicable attack.

"Food banks have seen a surge in demand The US economy shrank at a 32.9% annual rate between April and June as the country grappled with lockdowns and spending cutbacks during the pandemic. It was the deepest decline since the government began keeping records in 1947 and three times more severe than the prior record of 10% set in 1958. Reduced spending on services such as healthcare drove the fall. Economists have said they expected to see the sharpest drop in the second quarter, with recovery thereafter. But as virus cases in the US surge and some areas re-impose restrictions on activity, the rebound is showing signs of stalling. More than 1.4 million people filed new claims for unemployment last week, up slightly from the prior week for the second week in a row. Other data points to spending cuts and falls in confidence in July. Jerome Powell, the head of America's central bank, on Wednesday warned of renewed slowdown, describing the downturn as the ""most severe in our lifetimes"". He urged further government spending to help American households and businesses weather the crisis. That call was echoed by other business leaders on Thursday as the figures brought into focus the scale of the economic crisis facing the country. ""The staggering news of the historic decline of the gross domestic product in the second quarter should shock us all,"" said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby group. ""This jarring news should compel Congress to move swiftly."" Fed warns of continuing need to protect US economy German economy suffers sharpest decline on record The International Monetary Fund has predicted that global growth will fall by 4.9% this year. On Thursday, Germany reported a record quarterly decline of 10.1%, while Mexico's economy also reported a double digit contraction. Compared with the same quarter a year ago, the US economy contracted 9.5%. Exports and imports were both down more than 20% from a year ago, while consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - fell 10.7% year-on-year. New York City pub owner Anthony LoPorto has been serving drinks at his Bean Post venue since 1994. He's never known it so bad. After waiting months to re-open, he is now struggling to fill his tables as people worried about the virus or loss of income stay home. It is a drop-off in trade that is magnified across the US - a reason why the GDP numbers were so bad. ""This is now going on for months and we were told that there would be an opportunity for us to start getting back to some normalcy around this time - there's no signs of normalcy whatsoever,"" he says. ""I have a 'don't stop, won't stop' type of attitude... but it's getting to a point where I'm nervous and I've got to be honest - I'm nervous that even if I continue to go on, what's going to happen with the neighbourhood?"" The more offices that close or keep staff at home, the more the Bean Post's custom dwindles. ""I don't believe in a quick bounce-back at all,"" he says. ""This is a long time that people have not been making money. ""There are nights when there's just nobody around... There's just not enough money in people's pockets and not enough want in people's spirits."" The US has lost nearly 15 million jobs since February, despite strong hiring in May and June. The US census estimates more than half of American adults live in households that have seen incomes cut since the pandemic. Economists warned it will take years for the US to recover from the devastation. ""Even when the economy saw rapid bounce-back in May and June, the Covid-19 economic shock inflicted so much damage in earlier months that the net result was an economic catastrophe for the second quarter,"" wrote Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute. Congress is debating another economic relief package but it seems unlikely to reach a deal before an emergency $600 supplement to unemployment benefits expires this week, threatening another economic shock. ""The fact that initial jobless claims have risen for a second week is worrying and underscores that the nascent consumption recovery is at risk,"" said Madhavi Bokil, vice president of Moody's Investors Service.

"Donald Trump has suggested November's presidential election be postponed, saying increased postal voting could lead to fraud and inaccurate results. He floated a delay until people could ""properly, securely and safely"" vote. There is little evidence to support Mr Trump's claims but he has long railed against mail-in voting which he has said would be susceptible to fraud. US states want to make postal voting easier due to public health concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Under the US constitution, Mr Trump does not have the authority to postpone the election himself. Any delay would have to be approved by Congress. The president does not have direct power over the two houses of Congress. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump said ""universal mail-in voting"" would make November's vote the ""most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history"" and a ""great embarrassment to the USA"".

He suggested - without providing evidence - that mail-in voting, as it is known in the US, would be susceptible to foreign interference. ""The [Democrats] talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race,"" he said. Mr Trump also said postal voting was ""already proving to be a catastrophic disaster"" in areas where it was being tried out. Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Could Donald Trump delay the presidential election? In June, New York allowed voters to vote by post in the Democratic primary poll for the party's presidential candidate. But there have been long delays in counting the ballots and the results are still unknown. US media report that there are also concerns that many ballots will not be counted because they were not filled in correctly or do not have postmarks on them that show they were sent before voting officially ended. However, several other states have long conducted votes by post. Donald Trump can't delay November's presidential election without Congress, partially controlled by the Democrats, first approving the decision. If he didn't already know this, someone has certainly told him by now. The president also must know that tweeting about a delay - even framed as an ""I'm just asking!"" question - is sure to ignite a political firestorm, particularly after he has repeatedly refused to say whether he'd accept an adverse result in the upcoming presidential election. Mr Trump appears to be doing everything in his power to undermine the credibility of November's vote, in which a record number of Americans are predicted to rely on mail-in voting to avoid the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. He's repeatedly made false and misleading claims about the reliability of the mail balloting and suggested broad conspiracy theories. Critics warn that he could be laying the groundwork for contesting the results - although the purpose may be simply to give him a scapegoat if he loses. His tweet could also be an attempt to divert attention away from the truly dismal second-quarter economic numbers just released. He's been relying on a financial turnaround to breathe life into his re-election campaign, and instead the outlook appears exceedingly gloomy. Whatever the reason, tweeting about an election delay is not the move of a candidate confident of victory - and could be a sign of more desperate moves to come. Read Anthony's full analysis Quizzed by reporters on whether a president could delay the election, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he would not ""enter a legal judgement on the fly"". When pressed, he said the justice department would ""make that legal determination"", adding ""we want an election that everyone is confident in"". Ellen Weintraub, chairwoman of the US Federal Election Commission, said Mr Trump did not have the power to move the election - and added: ""Nor should it be moved."" She called for more funding for states to be able to run ""the safe and secure elections all Americans want"". Numerous Republicans - including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - also dismissed the idea. ""Never in the history of the federal elections have we ever not held an election and we should go forward with our election,"" Mr McCarthy said. Trump ally Senator Lindsay Graham meanwhile said a delay was ""not a good idea"". Democrats have also been lining up to condemn Mr Trump's suggestion. New Mexico Senator Tom Udall said there was ""no way"" the president could delay the election. ""But the fact that he is even suggesting it is a serious, chilling attack on the democratic process. All members of Congress - and the administration - should speak out,"" he said. However Chris Stewart, a Republican congressman from Utah, said that while he did not support delaying the election, Mr Trump had a legitimate point about postal voting being hard to monitor. ""Can you ensure the accuracy of mail-in voting? Now in some states you can. In my state in Utah, for example, we've been doing it for quite a while, but we're a small state with a relatively small population. It's harder to do on a national scale,"" he told the BBC. President Trump does not have the authority to move the date of the election, which is usually held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Any change of date would need to be approved by the two houses of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats control the House of Representatives and some have already said they will not support any delay to the vote. Any move by Congress to delay the election into 2021 would also require a constitutional amendment, US media quoted constitutional experts as saying. The amendment would be needed to change the dates for swearing in members of Congress and the new presidential administration, according to NPR. Finally, legal experts quoted by NBC said that even if Congress did agree to delay the election, Mr Trump's own term as president would still expire by 20 January 2021 under the constitution's 20th Amendment. Earlier this month, six US states were planning to hold ""all-mail"" ballot elections in November: California, Utah, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.Other states are considering it,external, according to a postal voting campaign group. These states will automatically send postal ballots to all registered voters, which then have to be sent back or dropped off on election day - although some in-person voting is still available in certain limited circumstances. About half of US states allow any registered voter to cast their ballot by post on request. Critics of postal voting argue that people could vote more than once via absentee ballots and in person. Mr Trump has in the past said there was a risk of ""thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place"". However, there is no evidence of widespread fraud, according to numerous nationwide and state-level studies over the years. Does US postal voting lead to fraud? Does Trump have power to delay election? 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Several flights have continued to head to Spain despite UK government travel advice changing The government has warned against non-essential travel to Spain following a rise in coronavirus cases. The announcement earlier this week that people returning to the UK from Spainwould be required to quarantine for 14 daysleft holidaymakers with a dilemma: Should they follow the safety advice and scrap the holiday they have spent months looking forward to? Or, should they go ahead and travel anyway, despite the potential health risk and the prospect of invalidating their travel insurance? At East Midlands Airport, there appeared to be plenty of people in the latter camp. Adam Spinos said he was worried about the flight but not about being in Ibiza Adam Spinos, from Long Eaton, Derbyshire, who was flying from East Midlands Airport to Ibiza, said he was more worried about being on the plane than at his destination. ""I've checked everything that's happening over there and the situation, and it's fine,"" he said. ""I just want to see how the plane goes and the precautions staff take so people don't get too drunk and behave, which will make me feel more confident."" Mr Spinos said he decided to continue his holiday as he had never been to Ibiza. ""I just want to experience it, with caution of course and the sun, the beach and just relax a little bit... and we have promised ourselves a mojito,"" he added. On Tuesday, airline Jet2 cancelled all five of its departing flights from the airport to Spanish destinations and said it was contacting customers abroad to discuss options about returning. Shona Lille said she was ""entitled to travel"" so was determined to take the flight to Spain Shona Lille, from Sheffield, said she was ""itching"" to get away to Ibiza. ""I'm excited,"" she said. ""I'm a traveller and should be in a different country every single month but I haven't been anywhere since last year. ""I will stick to the guidelines, and wear my masks where I have to wear them so I'm doing everything. I just feel that I have the entitlement to travel and I will travel."" What are the UK travel quarantine rules? PM warns of Europe 'second wave' amid Spain row UK quarantine restrictions unjust - Spain PM The travel trade association, ABTA, said FCO advice is issued ""for good reason"" and travellers need to be aware their travel insurance will be invalid. Spokesman Jonathan Smith said: ""We wouldn't advise that people go against the foreign office travel advice but flights are still operating and people that do choose to go should be aware of the risks involved. ""If they have travel insurance [which they should] then it will most likely be invalidated if anything happens to them while they are on holiday."" Kieron Brookes is travelling having fully understood the advice Kieron Brookes, from Liverpool, also taking a Ryanair flight to Ibiza, said he understood the advice but was willing to take a risk. ""We have booked it all and we have paid for the thing so we might as well go for a few days,"" he said. ""Obviously the insurance is invalid if the foreign office say you can't go, but we are only going for a few days so we are just going to hope for the best. ""It's only advice at the end of the day, so if you choose not to listen to the advice that's our decision."" Samantha Lively decided to jet off at the last minute Samantha Lively, from Birmingham, said her decision to go ahead with her trip was made at the 11th hour. She said: ""I didn't think I was going to go until about two hours ago when I thought, 'Yeah, I'm going to do it'.

"People who test positive for coronavirus or show symptoms in the UK must now self-isolate for at least 10 days, rather than seven. The change,announced by the UK's chief medical officers,external, comes as ministers try to avoid a resurgence of the virus. Until now, those showing key symptoms - a new continuous cough, a temperature or loss of taste or smell - have had to self-isolate for at least a week. The new advice is in line with World Health Organization guidance. The chief medical officers said the change is ""particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission"". Evidence shows that people with Covid-19 have ""a low but real possibility of infectiousness"" between seven and nine days after falling ill, they said. People are most contagious just before they first display symptoms and for the first few days afterwards. But scientists say evidence that they could pass it on up to nine days later has ""strengthened"". Advice on the length of isolation varies between countries. For example,the Irish Republic,externalsays those who have symptoms should isolate for 14 days, while inthe US,externalthose with symptoms are told to isolate for 10 days and can only leave isolation if they have had at least 24 hours without a fever. It comes after the prime minister warned ofsigns of a ""second wave"" of the pandemic in parts of Europe. Speaking on BBC Breakfast before the announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wanted to ""take a precautionary approach"" and ""protect people from that wave reaching our shores"". Frank Atherton, chief medical officer for Wales, said the change was ""vital"" and ""nobody should be under the illusion that coronavirus has gone away"". England death rate among worst in Europe What's the evidence Europe is having a 'second wave'? UK signs deal for 60 million virus vaccine doses The government has also confirmed that registered health and care professionals travelling to the UK from high-risk countries will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. An quarantine exemption for health professionals had been in place since June. There have also been concerns about several local outbreaks across the UK, including inOldham,WrexhamandStaffordshire. Meanwhile, the government is expected on Friday to announce a decision on whether to ease restrictions in Leicester, a month after the citywas put into extended lockdownfollowing a spike in cases. The mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, expressed frustration at the delayed decision, originally expected on Thursday. ""We haven't got a clue what's going on, we really haven't,"" he said. Two or three weeks ago the message from the prime minister was that, hopefully, we would be back to near-normality by Christmas. The direction of travel was one of lockdown easing, with pubs and restaurants reopening, as well as a feeling that we seemed to be getting through it. Now, there's a real sense of the brakes beginning to go on. We saw it with the quick quarantine measures imposed on people returning from Spain. Luxembourg may well have similar restrictions soon and they're keeping an eye on Belgium too. We had restrictions imposed in Oldham to curb the virus there and now there's been an extension of the self-isolation period. The real apprehension is that what is happening in the rest of Europe may, in time, happen here. To some extent, that has been the story of coronavirus: we have tended to follow what has emerged in mainland Europe. Official figures published on Thursday showed that 43,119 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in England had their cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace since its launch in May. The tracing system successfully contacted just over 77% of these - but just over 23% were not reached. The figures, from the Department of Health and Social Care, also showed that of 222,589 people identified as close contacts of those who tested positive, 83% had been reached and asked to self-isolate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge - that by the end of June everyone tested in person would receive results within 24 hours - is still not being met, with about three-quarters (76.4%) of people getting results on time in the week up to July 22. For those using home testing kits, 76.9% received results within 48 hours. But the government is concerned that some people are not coming forward for testing, hampering its ability to track outbreaks, because they wrongly think they have to pay for it or that they are not eligible. The UK requirement for people who test positive or show symptoms to isolate for seven days was always on the low side - plenty of other countries require 10 days or even longer. As coronavirus is new, there is still a lack of certainty over how long someone remains infectious, which is why there are a variety of approaches. UK health officials say there is enough evidence now to point to a ""low, but tangible"" risk of transmission from seven to 10 days, even for those with mild to moderate illness. This is a decision that could have been taken weeks, even months, ago in truth. But officials are describing it as a ""value judgement"" based on a variety of reasons. For one thing the easing of restrictions means we have more social contacts than we did previously - so even with the low risk of transmission post seven days, the chances of passing it on increases. The availability of widespread testing also means only those with a positively confirmed infection need to continue isolating - earlier in the pandemic the lack of testing meant a blanket approach had to be taken so anyone with symptoms was asked to isolate. But it is about sending an important signal too. Levels of infection are low, but the message is clear: we can't be complacent. The government is launching a TV and online advertising campaign on Thursday night stressing that anyone with symptoms should get tested, which is free and available to all. Only about a third of people infected are thought to come forward for tests, although some of the untested cases may be people who do not have any symptoms. Those in a household with anyone who tests positive or shows symptoms are told to self-isolate for 14 days. And people returning to the UK from certain countries are also being asked to quarantine for 14 days -a move that has sparked complaints from travel firms. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? Ministers are also looking for a way to reduce the current 14-day quarantine period for arrivals to the UK, meaning that quarantine and self-isolation time periods could be standardised at 10 days. Mr Hancock told Today that the government is looking at using testing to reduce the length of the quarantine period - but there would be no imminent changes. On Thursday evening, Luxembourg was removed from the quarantine-free list, meaning people arriving in the UK from the small land-locked country from midnight will need to self-isolate for two weeks. A senior government source told the BBC that Belgium would stay off the list - for the moment - but case numbers would continue to be monitored. Leading travel and airline industry figures called on Wednesday forcoronavirus testing at airportsin the UK but the source said that ""any new system had to be workable and at the moment it isn't"". Mr Hancock told Breakfast that the ""big scientific challenge"" with testing arrivals at the border is that people ""can incubate this disease for many days without displaying any symptoms, and that wouldn't show up in a test"". Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it. Anyone who has either tested positive for coronavirus or shown symptoms should isolate themselves for at least 10 days, and those who show symptoms should arrange to get tested. Symptoms include: a new continuous cough a high temperature a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell They should continue to self-isolate if they still feel unwell after that initial period. Other members of their household should isolate for 14 days and not leave their homes. If you test positive you will be contacted by contact tracers, who will establish who else you might have passed on the infection to. Anybody they deem to be at risk will have to isolate themselves for 14 days from the point of contact.

""I absolutely understand and share the desire to see these facilities open as quickly as possible,"" she said. Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter As we reported earlier, US President Donald Trump has suggested postponing November's presidential election.He has claimed that increased postal voting because of the coronavirus pandemic could lead to fraudand inaccurate results. There is little evidence that this would be the case - but does he have the power to delay it? The short answer is no. It would take an act of Congress - approved by majorities in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate - to change the date of the election. And the prospect of a bipartisan legislative consensus signing off on any delay is unlikely in the extreme. What's more, even if the voting day were changed, the US Constitution mandates that a presidential administration only last four years. In other words, Donald Trump's first term will expire at noon on 20 January 2021 one way or another. Read more analysis here. The leader of the UN's health body also warned young people against complacency The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the world must ""learn to live"" with the coronavirus. Speaking at a daily press briefing, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""We must all learn to live with the virus and to take the steps necessary to live our lives, while protecting ourselves and others."" He also praised the measures that were put in place forthe annual Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabiaon Wednesday. ""This is a powerful demonstration of the kinds of measures that countries can and must take to adapt to the new normal,"" he said. Dr Tedros also warned against complaceny among young people. ""We have said it before and weâll say it again: Young people are not invincible,"" he said. ""Young people can be infected; young people can die; and young people can transmit the virus to others. ""Thatâs why young people must take the same precautions to protect themselves and protect others as everyone else,"" he added. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News We could find out if the vaccine designed by the University of Oxford is effective in October. AstraZeneca, which is aiming to manufacture two billion doses by the end of next year, said the results of trials in the UK, US, Brazil and South Africa should be known by then. The company told BBC Newscast they are âhoping the immune response will last for at least 12 months, but hopefully closer to 24 or longerâ. If protection waned after a year, it would mean an annual jab would be needed like the winter flu vaccine. Early trials of the coronavirus vaccine show it can train the immune system, but it is unknown whether this is enough to offer protection. Data from those trials suggested two doses gave a stronger response than one and AstraZeneca said that looked like âthe most effective doseâ. However, there is still uncertainty about how long protection lasts and how effective it is in older age groups, who are most at risk of the disease. You can listen to Newscast here.  The government has yet to say whether it will lift or extend local lockdown restrictions in Leicester. The city's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, said he and local officials ""haven't got a clue what's going on"", complaining they have been ""messed about all day"". He claimed No 10 had indicated they were going to make the announcement ""much earlier in the day"" but now he understands ""they're not even going to discuss it until 6pm"". Sir Peter added that he was ""incredibly frustrated"" on behalf of the people of Leicester, particularly businesses who have been ""struggling"" due to an ""extra four weeks"" of lockdown. Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed that businesses in Leicester would getÂ£3m of government funding to help with the financial impact of the local lockdown. The city and some surrounding areas were put under the UK's first local lockdown on 29 June after a spike in Covid-19 cases there, though some restrictions were lifted on 24 July. The app for tracking and tracing coronavirus in Northern Ireland has been released for download from Apple's App Store and on Google Play. StopCOVID NI has several features for logging the details of those experiencing symptoms of the virus. It will supplement the phone-based contact tracing programme that is already in place, and identify those at risk of infection. Northern Ireland is thefirst part of the UK to have a contact tracing app. Within an hour of its release, hundreds of people had installed it on their mobile phones. Read more here. The app automatically contacts anyone at risk of infection The reopening of pubs, restaurants and cafes indoors in Wales has been confirmed for the start of next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford isexpected to
announce the next steps in easing the country's coronavirus restrictions on
Friday. Hospitality businesses have already been allowed to open outdoors in Wales, and indoors in other parts of the UK. They have been shut since the middle of March, just before the country went into lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon has been rebuked by the UK statistics watchdog over her repeated claim that coronavirus rates in England are five times higher than Scotland. The Office for Statistics Regulation said it had initially been ""difficult"" to identify the evidence for the Scottish first minister's claim. It said the sources later cited by the Scottish government ""do not allow for a meaningful comparison to be made"". The Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon had been caught using ""dodgy statistics"". But the first minister insisted evidence suggested ""the prevalence of the virus is significantly lower in Scotland right now than in England"" and accused the Tories of being blinded"" by ""bitter, partisan politics"".

But the BBC understands that passengers meant to be flying with the firm on Friday 31 July and Saturday 1 August are not affected - their flights are scheduled as normal. Read more here. A popular San Diego gym that was operating in violation of the countyâs public health order last week has been confirmed as an outbreak hotspot. At least three cases have now been linked to The Gym in Pacific Beach, officials say. The Gym continue to operate last week, despite being given orders to shut down, according to San Diego media. It has since closed. On Wednesday, officials reported 498 new cases in San Diego, raising the total infections there to over 28,000. There have also been 547 deaths. A member of staff wears a mask as he waits for customers at the reopening of The Old Stables Restaurant in Liverpool Roughly one in three
furloughed workers
in the UK had returned to their jobs in the first two weeks of July,
according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS survey also revealed differences between business sectors, with
more than 90% of water
treatment or IT staff working, but only
around half of employees in hotels,
restaurants and entertainment venues. However, businesses such as hotels
and restaurants, which only came out of lockdown on 4 July, have seen the
biggest increase in the proportion of staff returning to work. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The 2020 season for the Chinese
Super League, Chinaâs Premier League-equivalent, began earlier this week, on 25
July. But many sporting events are still
banning spectators, meaning that some football fans in the eastern city of
Kunshan were forced to find a creative way to watch their favourite players, without entering
the stadium. Images have gone viral showing
fans cheering and holding banners from windows at a hotel overlooking the
Kunshan Stadium, at a 27 July
match in the city between the Shanghai SIPG and Tianjin Teda teams. Many on the popular Sina Weibo
social media platform have applauded the commitment fans made, paying around
450 yuan (Â£49; $64) to see their favourite teams â technically without breaking
the rules. However, there are hints the
authorities arenât best pleased about this, and hotel staff have told Pear
Video that these âfootball viewing roomsâ may not be available in future. Herman Cain made a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 Herman Cain, the Republican former pizza chain CEO who ran for US president in 2012, has died after testing positive for Covid-19.Cain, who more recently hosted radio and TV programmes, was admitted to hospital on 1 July. âHerman Cain - our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us â has passed away,âa statement on his website,externalsaid. ""We knew when he was first hospitalised... that this was going to be a rough fight,"" it added. His social media accounts had been providing regular updates on his condition. On 7 July, a post from his Twitter account said âdoctors are trying to make sure his oxygen levels are right"". ""This is a tough virus,"" it said. ""Please continue praying."" Cain ran for office in 2012 after a stint as CEO of Godfatherâs Pizza. He is often remembered for his 9-9-9 tax reform plan. In 2019, US President Donald Trump asked him to sit on the Federal Reserve Board, but he withdrew his nomination after several Republican senators refused to back his appointment Our colleagues in Cambridge are reporting from Addenbrooke's Hospital today as it emerges from a post-coronavirus peak. They have stories from patients and staff at one of the UK's leading hospitals. Deputy matron Nicola Cundell says it's been ""pretty full on"" and staff are ""exhausted"". ""Normally patients have someone with them, a relative to sit with them and hold their hand, so we've had to be a little bit of everything,"" she said.

The US state of New Jersey, which has suffered the highest rate of Covid-19 deaths behind bars in the US, appears set to release around 20% of its prison population in an effort to reduce transmission rates among prisoners and guards. The bill that New Jersey senators are voting on today may release 3,000 inmates who are within one year of finishing their sentence. The American Civil Rights Union has called it the first of its kind legislation in the nation. The bill's authors contend that the governor has bungled the response in prison outbreaks, allowing thousands of infections and at least 50 deaths, while given early release to fewer than 300 inmates since March. In comes as other officials around the US order prisons populations reduced in an effort to halt the virus' spread. Can this California prison save itself from Covid-19? A further 12 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospitals in England, NHS England says. The patients were
aged between 40 and 96 years old and all had known underlying health conditions. Wales recorded another two deaths. There were no coronavirus deaths recorded in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Separate UK-wide figures, which include deaths in all settings, will be released later. A top US health official has said there is no evidence to suggest that wearing a mask can cause a person to catch Covid-19, after an infected lawmaker blamed his mask for his positive test. US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn's advice to wear a mask comes after a Texas congressman who tested positive yesterday suggested that his mask was to blame. Republican Louie Gohmert mused during an interview after he was barred from travelling with President Trump ""if my keeping a mask on and keeping it in place, that if I might have put some germs or some of the virus onto the mask and breathed it in"". In fact, it's the complete opposite - wearing a mask helps prevent transmission of the virus.The false notion that masks cause infections was popularised by an online video called ""Plandemic"",which is filled with medical misinformation about where the virus came from and how it is transmitted. In an interview with NBC on Thursday, Dr Hahn said there is no ""medical evidence that that's the case"". ""What our data show is that people should wear masks, particularly when they can't socially distance. And they should follow their local ordinances with respect to masks."" The US has seen increased demand for food banks The US economy has shrunk by a 32.9% annual rate in the April-to-June quarter in the wake of cutbacks in spending during the pandemic. It was the deepest decline since the government began keeping records in 1947 and three times more severe than the prior record of 10% set in 1958. Reduced spending on healthcare and consumer goods drove the fall. Also on Thursday, Germany reported a record quarterly decline of 10.1%, while Mexico's economy also reported a double digit contraction. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that global growth will fall by 4.9% this year. Read more from our business team here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned there are signs of a ""second wave"" of coronavirus cases in Europe, but what's the evidence for that? Talk of a second wave is the stuff of nightmares, conjuring up images of another deadly surge of infections. This is what happened with Spanish Flu after the First World War when a second wave proved deadlier than the first. But the truth is many experts try to avoid the phrase altogether. Margaret Harris, from the World Health Organization, has made clear that what we have seen is ""one big wave"" that is making its way across the globe. Some countries, such as South Korea and Singapore, have been better than others at flattening it from the start by stopping the virus spreading by using comprehensive testing and tracing regimes. But others - and the UK, France, Spain and Italy are examples of this - have just managed to flatten it partway through the wave by introducing lockdowns. This was because they did not have such sophisticated infectious disease systems in place to control the virus. Thanks to investment, they are in a much stronger position now and have been able to release lockdown, while still trying to suppress the virus wave through testing and tracing. But there are signs cases are picking up, especially in Spain. But rather than this being a second wave - or the start of one - perhaps we are better off thinking of these as the existing wave bursting through the defences. Prof Paul Hunter, a Covid expert at Norwich Medical School, says for it to be a second wave the virus would have to have gone away completely, so he prefers to call it a ""resurgence"". And really it should come as no surprise that this happens in highly-populated areas like Western Europe. Containing the virus relies on good systems for detecting cases and for the public to play its part by social distancing, and engaging with the test and trace systems. Clearly any weakness leaves countries susceptible, particularly to this virus which can be transmitted even if people are not displaying symptoms. However, while cases may be going up, it is worth noting they are nowhere near the levels seen during the peak of the pandemic. And bear in mind that the peaks seen in the charts above for all the countries - bar maybe Germany which had widespread testing in place quickly - are a gross underestimate of the true scale of infections. That's because there was not widespread testing available at the time. In the UK alone it is estimated that there were 100,000 cases a day at the peak - 20 times more than the testing in place at the time suggested. The greater access to testing there is, the more likely you are to pick up mild infections. If you only test patients in hospital - as was largely the case in the UK until late April - you are going to miss a lot of cases. What is also clear is that infection levels vary greatly within countries. There are areas where the virus is virtually non-existent, while in others it is lurking menacingly. In the UK there have beenflare-ups in Leicesterand - to a lesser extent -Blackburn with DarwenandOldham. A similar picture emerges when you look at the data for Spain. Even Germany is not immune to this, with local lockdowns announced in recent weeks. There are many reasons why this is happening. There are signs young people are spreading it in certain areas. Certainly, the young are less likely to get extremely sick, which could make them more relaxed about the need for social distancing. But it could also be true that the virus has always been circulating in these groups, it is just that more widespread testing is picking it up. There also seems to be a link to deprivation - where people live in close proximity the likelihood of transmission increases. This video can not be played What factors determine a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections? Whatever the reasons behind the local flare-ups, what is certain is that they will continue for the foreseeable future. Prof Keith Neal, an expert in infectious diseases from University of Nottingham, says these spikes will become a way of life, but they are in ""no way"" a second wave. He says countries across Europe are ""learning to live"" with the virus by taking precautions such as social distancing and wearing masks. He believes that if people remain vigilant, coupled with the improved treatments that are being found and greater testing, the scale of deaths seen during the peaks will hopefully not be repeated. There is a good chance, it seems, that what will be seen are the ripples from the first wave rather than a big second wave.

"The proposed Â£300m Newcastle takeover deal was 80% financed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund A Saudi Arabian-backed consortium has ended its bid to buy Newcastle United. The group, which included Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund PIF, PCP Capital Partners and Reuben Brothers, had agreed a Â£300m deal to buy the club from Mike Ashley in April. The deal was still being scrutinised under the Premier League's owners' and directors' test and it is understood PIF ran out of patience. The consortium said that it was with ""regret"" that it had pulled out. Amanda Staveley, the British businesswoman behind PCP Partners, said she was upset for the club's supporters. ""It's awful,"" she said, adding that there would have been huge investment in the area. ""We are devastated for the fans. We really thank the fans - I personally thank them for all their support."" A statement from the investor group said: ""As an autonomous and purely commercial investor, our focus was on building long-term value for the club, its fans and the community as we remained committed to collaboration, practicality and proactivity through a difficult period of global uncertainty and significant challenges for the fans and the club. ""Ultimately, during the unforeseeably prolonged process, the commercial agreement between the Investment Group and the club's owners expired and our investment thesis could not be sustained."" The consortium's withdrawal could pave the way for a takeover by American entrepreneur Henry Mauriss, who has registered his interest in Newcastle and remains extremely keen for the acquisition to happen. Asrevealed by the BBC this week,the Premier League was seeking clarification of the links between PIF and the Saudi state. PIF's chairman is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and it appears the Premier League's lawyers had been struggling to establish the precise links between the consortium and the Saudi government. The Premier League declined to comment. But its rules meant it wanted to know who would have control, where funding would come from, and who would appoint the board. It is understood that it could not be sure where responsibility would lie. Human rights groups and the fiancee of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Hatice Cengiz,had opposed the takeover. ""Let this defeat send a strong message to the leadership in Saudi Arabia that they will not be able to use their money to cover up their human rights record or protect those responsible for Jamal's murder,"" Cengiz said. ""We will not stop and we will not rest until we get justice for Jamal."" Speaking after the investor group's withdrawal, Peter Frankental, Amnesty International UK's economic affairs programme director, claimed the bid had been an attempt by the Saudi Arabia government to ""sportswash"" their human rights record. ""The fact that this sportswashing bid has failed will be seen by human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia as a sign that their suffering has not been entirely overlooked,"" he said. In June, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said hewould ""fully consider""calls for the proposed bid to be blocked. Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah tweeted:,external""I know that many constituents will be disappointed and frustrated by the withdrawal of the latest Newcastle takeover offer. ""I will be writing to the Premier League to ask why they took so long and gave so little clarity to Newcastle fans."" One of the issues raised by critics of the takeover wasSaudi Arabia's response to cases of unauthorised broadcastingof Premier League games in the country. In June, the World Trade Organization issued a report which found representatives of the Saudi state had facilitated the breach of international piracy laws via the TV network beoutQ. Saudi Arabia has always denied aiding the beoutQ operation and has insisted there is no link between its government and the alleged piracy. Mike Ashley has been owner of Newcastle since 2007 BBC sports editor Dan Roan: Arguably the most controversial takeover deal in Premier League history is finally over. Sources close to the consortium say they tried to prove to the Premier League that the Saudi government would have no say in the day-to-day running of the club. The Premier League seems to have been concerned that individuals not on the club's new board would have had influence over decision-making at St James' Park because the Saudi Crown Prince is the chairman of PIF. Ultimately this issue could not be resolved. Current owner Mike Ashley is also understood to have tried to renegotiate the deal in recent days because of the length of time that had lapsed,  and that also contributed to the decision by the group to walk away. But with so many negative headlines over Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record - plus tension with rival clubs and broadcast partner beIN Sport over television rights piracy concerns - Premier League officials may be privately relieved the consortium has taken the decision out of its hands. Many in football will now want to see its Owners and Directors' Test strengthened to ensure states like Saudi Arabia cannot buy clubs, and there is no repeat of a saga that has done little for the game's reputation. After months of uncertainty, however, Newcastle United fans desperate to see the back of Ashley will no doubt see it very differently.

"    By Alison Holt It’s the early hours of the morning and Michelle Heavens moves quickly along one of the care home’s dark corridors. She’s the senior carer on duty overnight and needs to check on 84-year-old Joan Day. Michelle pauses to put on a mask, goggles, apron and gloves before going into Joan’s room. Joan has coronavirus and is going downhill fast. “I loved her from the day she came in,” says Michelle. Joan had been physically fit, but dementia had made her life increasingly difficult. She'd moved into the specialist home at Blackley in Manchester last year and settled in quickly. “She was always singing Joan. Absolutely brilliant lady. She’d ask us if we needed help, rather than us give her any support.” Michelle checks Joan’s oxygen levels. They’re dropping rapidly. She’s having difficulty getting her breath so Michelle and two other carers reposition her to try to make her more comfortable. The nurse also gives her painkilling drugs. Joan Day  By early morning, it’s clear Joan is not improving. Normally her family would be with her, but coronavirus restrictions mean they haven’t seen her for weeks. Joan’s daughter, Yvonne Connelly, is herself shielding. Carers are her only link to what’s happening in the home. Shortly before finishing her shift, Michelle calls Yvonne. She explains that Joan’s health is deteriorating. “There’s not much else I can say, apart from she’s not coming back from it.” Yvonne wants to speak to her mother on the phone, but Joan is too ill. “When Michelle called she was lovely about it. She was upset herself,” reflects Yvonne. “She said ‘Yvonne, I don’t think she’ll be here when I come back tonight.’” Just a few hours after that call, Joan died. Yvonne was devastated she couldn’t be at her mother’s side. “It’s the worst feeling in the world.” Across the UK, more than 22,000 care home residents have died with Covid-19. Joan Day was one of nine residents to die with the virus at EachStep Blackley - one of two care homes that granted Panorama access during the pandemic.    Nurse Phil Benson had heard about a new virus emerging in China on the news, but it seemed a world away. “I was naive about it initially. It didn’t seem like it was a real thing. Nothing to worry about.” Phil’s a dementia specialist working for Community Integrated Care, the charity that runs EachStep Blackley. In the past, he’s worked in A&E and intensive care. “Social care’s probably the most challenging job I’ve ever had, but the best as well. It all starts from the heart.” Phil Benson But that “heart” was soon to be tested beyond measure, in a care sector already struggling with growing demand from an ageing population and years of underfunding. On 23 January, 11 million people were locked down in the Chinese city of Wuhan. A picture was emerging of a new illness that was particularly worrying for older people and those with underlying health conditions. As the virus started to spread globally, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - Sage - held regular meetings and fed advice to ministers. Sage brought together a wide range of experts plus food supply strategists, those with digital marketing experience and even staff from the justice system. But no-one had specific expertise in old age or social care. During February, Sage spent a lot of time planning how the NHS would cope. There were also two discussions about preventing the virus spreading in prisons. More than 400,000 people live in care homes in England, but according to official minutes, care homes didn’t appear on the agenda for the first 11 meetings. “It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected… There is no need to do anything differently in any care setting at present” was the Public Health England and government advice on 25 February. On 3 March, Phil heard about a major virus outbreak at a care home in Seattle in the US. Thirty-seven people would eventually die. “The guy speaking about Seattle said it was spreading from room to room, despite them using the best technologically available PPE [Personal Protective Equipment]. “I was thinking, oh my God, it can’t be, this is going to devastate us.” It was also the day Sage scientists discussed care homes for the first time. In a discussion about social distancing for over-65s the minutes note that: “It will be a challenge to implement this measure in communal settings, such as care homes.” At a televised briefing, England’s Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty said there would be “specific advice for care homes, but they didn’t want to do it too early”. But it already felt too late for Mark Adams, Phil’s boss and head of the charity Community Integrated Care. Mark Adams “We set up our own war room. We made our own decisions about what we could do to protect people.” Ordering PPE for many care homes was also a major problem. They claimed some of their usual supplies were being diverted to the NHS and the price of masks, aprons and gloves had skyrocketed. Community Integrated Care locked down all its homes on 13 March, including EachStep Blackley. Family and friends could no longer visit. The same day, the government withdrew advice which said the virus spread in care homes was unlikely. It said no-one with suspected Covid-19, or who was unwell, should visit care homes.

More than 200 miles away in Kent, at Pelham House in Folkestone, they were also worrying about how they would deal with the virus. A small, privately-run dementia home looking after 20 people, Pelham, like Blackley, also allowed Panorama in during the pandemic. Pelham’s owner, Roger Waluube, locked down on 16 March. “At that stage we began to get reports Covid was here on our doorstep,” says Roger. “We had to keep the wolf at bay.”  Roger Waluube That evening, at the first 5pm Downing Street daily briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said no-one should make “unnecessary” visits to care homes - but he stopped short of saying people must not visit relatives under any circumstances. By mid-March, the number of people needing treatment for Covid-19 in hospitals was rising rapidly. On the 17 March, NHS England sent hospitals a letter saying all medically-fit patients should be discharged as soon as possible. There was no requirement for testing. During the next four weeks, 25,000 patients were discharged to care homes. Panorama has gathered data from 39 hospital trusts, which shows three-quarters of people discharged were untested. The social care system is run by local councils, not the NHS. In all parts of the UK it’s under pressure from an ageing population and funding cuts. James Bullion was just taking over the role as president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), representing officials who run council care services in England. When he and colleagues met the prime minister and the Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock - he says making sure the NHS could cope was the overriding message. “There was a very strong feeling that anything that got in the way of that discharge arrangement [from hospitals] needed to be got out of the way. “Social care, the NHS and government should have had the forethought to think ‘It’s not right to discharge people without a test,” he says.  NHS England says testing policy is set by ministers and it has never supported pressure being put on care homes to accept admissions. The government has also repeatedly said that hospital discharge decisions during this time were made by medical professionals on a case-by-case basis. Sage advisers have since said residents moving into and out of hospital “may have been an important source” of the introduction of Covid-19 into care homes.

James Bullion was just taking over the role as president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), representing officials who run council care services in England. When he and colleagues met the prime minister and the Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock - he says making sure the NHS could cope was the overriding message. “There was a very strong feeling that anything that got in the way of that discharge arrangement [from hospitals] needed to be got out of the way. “Social care, the NHS and government should have had the forethought to think ‘It’s not right to discharge people without a test,” he says.  NHS England says testing policy is set by ministers and it has never supported pressure being put on care homes to accept admissions. The government has also repeatedly said that hospital discharge decisions during this time were made by medical professionals on a case-by-case basis. Sage advisers have since said residents moving into and out of hospital “may have been an important source” of the introduction of Covid-19 into care homes.   On 23 March, as the national lockdown began and streets fell eerily quiet, Phil Benson was on standby for the first coronavirus outbreak at a home run by Community Integrated Care. “I remember at that time the anxiety building,” he says. That week, there would be more than 500 outbreaks of coronavirus in care homes in England. On the last day of March, Phil got the call. EachStep Blackley had an outbreak. A resident, who’d been in hospital with breathing problems, had tested positive. She was very poorly and returned to the home for her last few days. “It was scary. We didn’t know much about Covid at that point,” says Debra Fielding, one of the advanced carers. “She came in through the back way, straight into an end bedroom. No residents were near her. Only certain staff were going in, they had to wear special PPE - visors, goggles, aprons, gloves.” Debra Fielding Other Blackley residents had started showing Covid-19 symptoms before she returned, but she was the first to die with the virus. In Kent, staff at Pelham House felt they were doing well keeping the virus out. Eighty-seven-year-old Doreen is one of the residents. She moved in after being diagnosed with dementia. She misses her late husband and old home. She has some understanding of what’s going on. “Coronavirus - that’s something that if you’ve got it, you must stay isolated,” she says. “It’s a bit frightening.” Doreen Pelham House, like many homes, was struggling to get enough PPE. Even basics, like food, were problematic - with the home’s regular supplier stopping deliveries. As a small care home, we were “left alone and set adrift, if I’m honest”, says Roger Waluube.  At Blackley, they checked residents’ temperatures, oxygen levels and blood pressure four times a day. They even brought in air purifiers, but the virus was spreading. In the two weeks after their first confirmed case, five died and 14 were showing symptoms. But none of those deaths were reflected at the televised daily government briefings. For the first six weeks, graphs that ministers and scientists pointed to - showing the number of coronavirus deaths - only showed what was happening in hospitals. Care home numbers were not included. Hospital deaths linked to Covid-19 peaked in England on 8 April. The peak in care homes followed soon after. “Family and friends should be advised not to visit care homes, except next of kin in exceptional situations such as end of life” “Negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home” “Respirators, fluid-resistant surgical masks, eye protection... can be subject to single sessional use - for example, a ward round or taking observations of several patients” Behind the scenes, directors of councils care services were increasingly worried. On 11 April, they sent a strongly worded letter to the Department of Health and Social Care. Social care appeared an afterthought, it said, adding that government guidance was contradictory and PPE distribution shambolic. The letter was leaked. James Bullion, ADASS president, says they were “distressed” by their “emotive” message going public, but it was an exceptional time. “We were frustrated by the lack of grip of the PPE issue, and lack of understanding about how you get, effectively, PPE to thousands of local organisations,” he says. The government says over the course of the pandemic it has provided 156 million items of protective equipment to social care.     At Blackley, staff were particularly worried about 85-year-old Bryan McHugh. A resident for two-and-a-half years, he had a history of lung problems. His daughter, Susan Murray, smiles at photos of Bryan with his grandson. “He was just lovely. He’d do anything for anybody. Nothing was ever too much trouble.” On 15 April, the home told her father had Covid symptoms. The following day he deteriorated. It took more than two hours for an ambulance to arrive. By then, Bryan was in a lot of pain and struggling to breathe. Advanced carer, Chelsea Mills, says it was tough. “To watch someone in pain is absolutely horrendous when you feel helpless. It was extremely hard.”  Chelsea Mills    There were difficult discussions between paramedics, Blackley staff and Bryan’s family about what to do for the best. Bryan was dying and being in hospital would not save him. It was agreed he should remain in the home surrounded by people he knew. His daughter Susan had asked the carers to give him a message. “Just tell him there’s Covid outside. We’ve got to be isolated in our own homes. That’s why we can’t come. And just tell him that we love him.” On the night shift, experienced nurse Herbert Mumbamarwo gave Bryan prescribed painkilling drugs - including morphine - but they weren’t working. Herbert Mumbamarwo  “Bryan over the last 10 to 12 months has never spoken a complete sentence,” says Herbert. “But that night, he managed to say ‘I can’t breathe, I’m drowning,’ words I didn’t know he could speak. That explains the extent of the trauma he was experiencing.” In a hospital, Herbert could have turned to senior doctors for advice to make Bryan more comfortable in his final hours, but in the care home he was the only medically-trained person on duty. “I was going on YouTube, on NICE guidelines, trying to find better ways to help. It didn’t help much. After my shift, I had a feeling of… I’ve failed Bryan.” Bryan was more comfortable by morning, but died the following night. Family photo: Susan, Bryan and his wife Sheila  “I feel as though I’ve let my dad down,” says daughter Susan. “Not being able to hold his hand was just horrendous. He relied on me, he used to say he always wanted me there if he was poorly.” NHS England says care homes had medical support through the pandemic.  Herbert understands the whole system was under pressure, but believes there are still lessons to learn. “We would benefit from a team of specialists, specifically on standby to respond to extreme cases of Covid. They could give advice on what best to do. “We’re not defying death, but what we’re trying to do is our mission statement - to make it comfortable.” In the week Bryan died, care home deaths peaked. More than 3,300 residents died in England and Wales. At its worst, 540 died in a single day. It’s a situation that angers Mark Adams from Community Integrated Care - the charity that runs EachStep Blackley. “Nobody really thought about the challenge that care organisations were going to face until, if I’m being brutal, the body count became so high they couldn’t ignore it.”  At Blackley, staff were particularly worried about 85-year-old Bryan McHugh.

Previous advice had stated that: “Negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home.” There would also be testing for all care home residents and staff showing symptoms. A shortage of tests had seen NHS staff prioritised and few care workers checked. By the end of April, there was increasing evidence that one of the ways the virus was getting into homes was through staff - particularly those working in more than one care home or hospital. It was also becoming clearer many residents and staff who tested positive for the virus showed no symptoms.

Other parts of the UK: (Sources: ONS, NRS, NISRA)  By early May, in Kent, Pelham House was still free of the virus. “We were meticulous about PPE,” says Karen White, one of the home’s most experienced carers. “Temperature-taking every morning, the staff, the residents. We were bobbing along. We were so pleased with ourselves, because we hadn’t got one single case.” But that was about to change. Francis, a resident for six years, was starting to feel poorly. “He was a fit and well man at the age of 96, and had served in the war,” says owner Roger Waluube. “He wasn’t feeling well, unusual for Francis, so he went into hospital.” Francis Chapman (photo: Paul Smith) The next morning, they got a call saying Francis needed to be discharged. The hospital said there was no clinical need for him to stay. It had followed guidance and tested him, but the results were not back. The government’s Social Care Action Plan stated: “Where a test result is still awaited, the patient will be discharged and pending the result, isolated in the same way as a Covid-positive patient will be.” But staff at Pelham wanted to wait until they knew what they were dealing with. “It escalated to the consultant in A&E being on the phone and really, really requesting and stating that Francis had to come home on that day,” says Roger. Asked if they felt bullied, he says: “We did. Yes. There was no other option but to take Francis back to the care home and if we didn’t agree, he would be sent back anyway in an ambulance.”  Pelham House does not have nursing facilities and Francis was very ill. He was back at the home when staff got the call saying he’d tested positive for Covid-19. “You knew you couldn’t stop it, you were powerless,” says Roger. “It was very scary. It was inevitable, we knew people were going to go.” The Kent and Medway Clinical Commissioning Group said in a statement: “As symptoms can take up to 14 days to appear following exposure, it is likely the resident would already have been infected.” It also said the home was given advice and support around minimising the risk of Covid-19 spreading in the home. In his final hours, Francis was moved to a nearby hospice, which provided him with the end of life care he needed. Other Pelham House residents were now also falling ill with the virus.   At Blackley, Covid-19 had spread from one end of the building to the other. Staff were worried about 91-year-old Vera, normally seen making her way around the home with her walking frame. “She does look after everybody, mother everybody. And she chats non-stop, so that’s what we like,” says advanced carer, Debra Fielding. But Vera had developed a cough and her temperature was up. Vera Another resident, Michael, was taken to hospital because of his particular underlying medical condition. His daughter, Michelle Phillips, is Blackley’s manager. “He was poorly when he left. When he spotted me in reception, he waved and shouted after me that he loved me. That just made me cry.” At this point, Blackley was only able to test residents or staff with Covid-19 symptoms. To stand a chance of controlling the virus they needed to be able to identify all those who were infected but without symptoms. Phil Benson was on the phone every few days trying to get more tests. “I remember begging ‘Please can one of these people come and just test? Can we not have everyone tested? Surely there’s such a severe outbreak here, it’s in everyone’s interest to be tested?’ “And it was ‘No, the policy is clear. We only test people who’ve got symptoms.’”  Nearly two months after the country locked down, on 15 May, the Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, announced an infection control plan for care homes. It included £600-million ring-fenced to help with increased Covid-19 costs, a named clinician to provide each home with medical support and testing for all care home residents and staff. At the daily briefing, the health secretary said that: “From the start we’ve worked incredibly hard to throw that protective ring around our care homes.” “What protective ring?” asks Pelham House manager Roger Waluube. “We don’t understand what the protective ring could have been or was.”      Everyone in Pelham House could now be tested. All 20 residents and 17 staff were checked. Two days later the test results came back. “The manager was just sat there with his mouth open,” says carer Karen White. “He just pointed at the screen and it was horrific. Every resident apart from two were positive. And 80% of the staff.” Karen White It meant most of the staff had to leave immediately. “They had to down tools,” remembers Roger. “That left us in a very vulnerable position, particularly when the cook has to suddenly stop her cooking and go home. “There’s three or four of us who’ve been on the frontline as such and continually testing negative. We could keep going.” Overall, 19 Pelham House residents tested positive and nearly half those living at the home died. The home normally averages about three deaths a year, but it had nine in just 10 days. “We’re not used to death at this scale. Having to say goodbye to so many people so quickly,” says Roger. Carer Karen was hit hard after the funeral of Peter Baker, a resident with learning difficulties and no family, soon to celebrate his 76th birthday. “He just gently passed away,” she recalls tearfully. “He trusted us to look after him. And he always kept saying ‘Love you girls, I love you girls, I’m so happy here.’ We just let him die. With his learning difficulties he wouldn’t have understood.”  Pelham House was also facing another big problem. By July, it was virus free, but the deaths of half of its residents meant the home had lost 50% of its income. Pelham was rated “good” by the regulator, the Care Quality Commission. Before Covid-19, Roger Waluube had plans to develop and redecorate. Coronavirus changed all that. “We were a very healthy and viable business,” he says. “Now our future is in the balance and the outlook is not good.” Roger Waluube By late June, he estimated they had enough money to last six to eight weeks. With little prospect of new residents moving in, he turned to Kent County Council for help. Since March, the government has given councils £3.7bn to help with the additional pandemic costs. The money is for all services under pressure - including support for children, the homeless and transport services. The Local Government Association, which represents local councils, estimates about 40% of the first £3.2bn received has gone to adult social care, including care homes. So far, Pelham has received about £40,000 in council help. Roger is discussing loans, but he estimates it’ll take at least another £100,000 for the home to survive. Closure would see residents like Doreen having to find a new home. It would be difficult for them all. Residents grow to see this place as their home, says Roger. “Moving people from one care home to another never generally has great results because that adjustment can take its toll on people.”    At Blackley, there was finally some good news. Staff lined up in reception to welcome Michael back. He was in hospital with the virus for two weeks but recovered. As the ambulance crew wheeled him in, his daughter and home manager, Michelle, gave him a big hug. Michelle Phillips “I’m really happy,” she laughs. “A feeling I’ve not had for a while.” Vera also recovered and was able to celebrate her 92nd birthday. In mid-June, she saw her daughter and grandson at a distance. She sat on one of the home’s balconies while they were in the garden. Vera smiles at her daughter and grandson Over six weeks, 16 of the home’s 55 residents had Covid-19 officially - while others had symptoms. Nine died. With the outbreak under control, Phil Benson finished his work at Blackley and went on to help other homes. By early July, Pelham House was also coronavirus-free, but its future remained uncertain. Roger Waluube is crowdfunding to see if he can save the home, but he faces some hard decisions. “I will not get to the point where I’ve got two hours to go, and I’ve run out of cash or I can’t care for people any more,” he says.

The government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the social care sector was “slow, inconsistent and at times negligent” is the damning verdict of MPs on the Public Accounts Committee in theirreport of 29 July. The decision to allow hospital patients in England to be discharged to care homes without tests at the start of the pandemicwas “reckless”, they say. The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care declined to be interviewed by Panorama. In a statement, his department said:“We first published guidance for the social care sector in February and have since announced a raft of measures. Our help has meant almost 60% of England’s care homes have had no outbreak at all.” The government has also promised to bring forward plans for reforming the care system in the near future. It has started cross-party talks on what it describes as a complex issue. Mark Adams, of Community Integrated Care, says that change has to happen soon. “When we look back, we will see this as one of the most mismanaged national challenges we’ve ever faced,” he says. “You can’t have a disconnected health and social care system. It can’t be left to local authorities, whose budgets are being cut, and [who] then have to think about who gets care and who doesn’t.” No government will get everything right in the extreme situation a pandemic presents, but it will be judged on how it protects the most vulnerable.

"The app automatically contacts anyone at risk of infection Northern Ireland has become the first part of the UK to launch an app for tracking and tracing coronavirus. Named StopCOVID NI, it has several features for logging details of those experiencing symptoms of the virus. The app will run alongside a phone-based contact tracing programme already in place and will identify those at risk of infection. It has been released for download from Apple's App Store and on Google Play. StopCOVID NI will be officially launched on Friday but became available to download on Thursday afternoon. Within an hour of its release, hundreds of people had installed it on their mobile phones. Robin Swann urged people to download the app Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann said that the more people that downloaded the app, the more effective a tool it would be in the local coronavirus response. ""This could be the most important thing you do all year,"" he said. ""It could prevent you from spreading the virus to people you care about."" After a positive Covid-19 test result, a person will receive a unique code by text message. That message will invite the person to enter the code if they use the app. This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? Entering the code will trigger a ""Bluetooth handshake"", allowing the app to notify any other user who has been nearby for long enough to be at risk of infection. ""There will be some people who won't be able to or won't want to use the app, and that's okay,"" said Dan West, the chief digital information officer at the NI Department of Health. ""The more people who do use it, the more protection this will provide to the whole community. We can say that for sure."" The app is intended for over-18s initially because of a conflict between data protection laws and the need for identifiable safeguarding consent. The Health and Social Care Board is meeting the children's commissioner, the information commissioner's office and the Children's Law Centre to find a way through that. The Department of Health says the app will work better as the number of downloads increase Analysis: BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones There's been a lot of talk of the importance of getting contact tracing apps to work across borders - but between them Northern Ireland and the Republic have done it, a world first. Their apps, built by the same developer, were designed to be compatible but what was vital was an agreement to share databases of the people who test positive for the virus. What we still don't know is whether the app will work - as yet. There's not enough evidence from around the world to show that a technology-driven approach to contact tracing is effective. But the NHS in England, which abandoned its first app to switch to the decentralised model used by StopCOVID NI, will be watching closely what happens in Northern Ireland. Robin Swannpreviously said his department was working with its counterpart in the Republic of Ireland. The ambition was to have the two systems work in tandem, so information about contacts who need to be traced can be shared by both governments. Both apps have been designed by the same company, Nearform. On Thursday one more death was recorded in the Republic of Ireland, taking its death toll to 1,764. An additional 85 confirmed cases were also reported to the Republic's Department of Health. Privacy settings are laid out in the set-up menu of the app The contact tracing programme has been operational in Northern Ireland since mid-May. The great coronavirus-tracing apps mystery It involves people with a positive test result being contacted by phone. The people they have been within 2m of for 15 minutes or more are called and advised about isolating or being tested if they have symptoms.

"Donald Trump has suggested November's presidential election be postponed, saying increased postal voting could lead to fraud and inaccurate results. He floated a delay until people could ""properly, securely and safely"" vote. There is little evidence to support Mr Trump's claims but he has long railed against mail-in voting which he has said would be susceptible to fraud. US states want to make postal voting easier due to public health concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Under the US constitution, Mr Trump does not have the authority to postpone the election himself. Any delay would have to be approved by Congress. The president does not have direct power over the two houses of Congress. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump said ""universal mail-in voting"" would make November's vote the ""most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history"" and a ""great embarrassment to the USA"".

He suggested - without providing evidence - that mail-in voting, as it is known in the US, would be susceptible to foreign interference. ""The [Democrats] talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race,"" he said. Mr Trump also said postal voting was ""already proving to be a catastrophic disaster"" in areas where it was being tried out. Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Could Donald Trump delay the presidential election? In June, New York allowed voters to vote by post in the Democratic primary poll for the party's presidential candidate. But there have been long delays in counting the ballots and the results are still unknown. US media report that there are also concerns that many ballots will not be counted because they were not filled in correctly or do not have postmarks on them that show they were sent before voting officially ended. However, several other states have long conducted votes by post. Donald Trump can't delay November's presidential election without Congress, partially controlled by the Democrats, first approving the decision. If he didn't already know this, someone has certainly told him by now. The president also must know that tweeting about a delay - even framed as an ""I'm just asking!"" question - is sure to ignite a political firestorm, particularly after he has repeatedly refused to say whether he'd accept an adverse result in the upcoming presidential election. Mr Trump appears to be doing everything in his power to undermine the credibility of November's vote, in which a record number of Americans are predicted to rely on mail-in voting to avoid the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. He's repeatedly made false and misleading claims about the reliability of the mail balloting and suggested broad conspiracy theories. Critics warn that he could be laying the groundwork for contesting the results - although the purpose may be simply to give him a scapegoat if he loses. His tweet could also be an attempt to divert attention away from the truly dismal second-quarter economic numbers just released. He's been relying on a financial turnaround to breathe life into his re-election campaign, and instead the outlook appears exceedingly gloomy. Whatever the reason, tweeting about an election delay is not the move of a candidate confident of victory - and could be a sign of more desperate moves to come. Read Anthony's full analysis Quizzed by reporters on whether a president could delay the election, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he would not ""enter a legal judgement on the fly"". When pressed, he said the justice department would ""make that legal determination"", adding ""we want an election that everyone is confident in"". Ellen Weintraub, chairwoman of the US Federal Election Commission, said Mr Trump did not have the power to move the election - and added: ""Nor should it be moved."" She called for more funding for states to be able to run ""the safe and secure elections all Americans want"". Numerous Republicans - including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - also dismissed the idea. ""Never in the history of the federal elections have we ever not held an election and we should go forward with our election,"" Mr McCarthy said. Trump ally Senator Lindsay Graham meanwhile said a delay was ""not a good idea"". Democrats have also been lining up to condemn Mr Trump's suggestion. New Mexico Senator Tom Udall said there was ""no way"" the president could delay the election. ""But the fact that he is even suggesting it is a serious, chilling attack on the democratic process. All members of Congress - and the administration - should speak out,"" he said. However Chris Stewart, a Republican congressman from Utah, said that while he did not support delaying the election, Mr Trump had a legitimate point about postal voting being hard to monitor. ""Can you ensure the accuracy of mail-in voting? Now in some states you can. In my state in Utah, for example, we've been doing it for quite a while, but we're a small state with a relatively small population. It's harder to do on a national scale,"" he told the BBC. President Trump does not have the authority to move the date of the election, which is usually held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Any change of date would need to be approved by the two houses of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats control the House of Representatives and some have already said they will not support any delay to the vote. Any move by Congress to delay the election into 2021 would also require a constitutional amendment, US media quoted constitutional experts as saying. The amendment would be needed to change the dates for swearing in members of Congress and the new presidential administration, according to NPR. Finally, legal experts quoted by NBC said that even if Congress did agree to delay the election, Mr Trump's own term as president would still expire by 20 January 2021 under the constitution's 20th Amendment. Earlier this month, six US states were planning to hold ""all-mail"" ballot elections in November: California, Utah, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.Other states are considering it,external, according to a postal voting campaign group. These states will automatically send postal ballots to all registered voters, which then have to be sent back or dropped off on election day - although some in-person voting is still available in certain limited circumstances. About half of US states allow any registered voter to cast their ballot by post on request. Critics of postal voting argue that people could vote more than once via absentee ballots and in person. Mr Trump has in the past said there was a risk of ""thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place"". However, there is no evidence of widespread fraud, according to numerous nationwide and state-level studies over the years. Does US postal voting lead to fraud?

"The restrictions of lockdown have fostered a new community spirit in Britain, but there are signs feelings of solidarity and togetherness are already beginning to fragment and fray. That is the warning from a campaign called Together, which includes the NHS, charities, media groups and employers among its founders. The organisation helped organisethe birthday clap for the health service this monthand is launching a national public consultation on how to avoid new community divisions opening up. But there are expected to be challenging months ahead. PM joins nationwide clap on NHS 72nd anniversary Remembering 100 NHS workers who have died What does healing the Brexit divide mean? A poll published today suggests people feel the country has become less divided since virus restrictions were imposed. The survey of 2,000 adults by ICM, conducted during lockdown in May-June, found 45% of those questioned thought Britain had ""never been so divided"" during their lifetime. A similar poll, conducted just before lockdown in March, found 60% agreeing with the statement. Asked if the country was ""still too focused on what divides us"", the poll findings suggest a fall from 70% agreeing in March down to 61% by the end of May. A similar proportion in the later survey (62%) thought people had ""lost the ability to discuss politics without getting angry and abusive"". However, analysis of the polling and other attitudes data has led to warnings that the spirit of unity fostered by the fight against Covid-19 may be dissipating. ""There's a risk that past divides are re-emerging as society starts to re-open,"" says Jill Rutter, director of strategy at the think tank British Future and author of the Together report. ""The shared experience of lockdown made many people feel more connected to their neighbours and local community. Now that sense of togetherness is starting to fray. ""The good news is that people would rather we kept hold of it."" Prof Robert West from University College London, a member of the behavioural science group which feeds into Sage, said the level of concern people feel about the virus was easing, and was even lower among young people. He said this level of concern was the ""key thing"" which encouraged people to take the necessary action to protect their community. ""We need to ramp that back up to appropriate levels."" Prof West told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a lack of direction and communication from government meant the public may not have a clear sense of the risk and what they ought to be doing now. ""I personally am not 100% clear about what the government is asking us to do,"" he said. Prof West said the UK needs to have a strategy such as Scotland's goal of achieving ""zero Covid"" policy, ""so we know we're heading in a particular direction"". ""At the moment it feels a lot like we're just drifting,"" he said. What information do we collect from this quiz?Privacy notice. The Together campaign precedes the pandemic and had already been looking at how to heal the ""angry divides"" over Brexit and political tribalism. The revival of community spirit exemplified by the ""clap-for-carers"" during lockdown was seen as an opportunity to cement new connections at neighbourhood level. The campaign helped organise the birthday clap for the NHS on 5 July, an event today's ICM poll suggests was attended by 14 million people across Britain, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Participants were encouraged to ""raise a cuppa or glass"" with neighbours, to reflect on the connections that have been made during the lockdown and consider how to strengthen our communities for the next stage of the crisis. Boris Johnson joined the NHS anniversary clap That process now enters a new phase with the launch of ""talk/together"", a national conversation the organisers hope will be the biggest public consultation since the census. Discussion groups will be held in every region of the UK with an online survey that is expected to attract hundreds of thousands of visitors. The consultation is intended to help the country navigate a peaceful path through what is expected to be a significant recession. In the foreword to today's report, the Bishop of Leeds, Nick Baines, writes: ""We are entering a period of deep economic uncertainty, one that will heighten existing inequalities and strain our society further still. ""We must start to disagree better: Recognising and respecting our differences while remembering our common humanity and citizenship, with all the mutual obligations these demand of us.""

"Travel company Tui is set to shut 166 High Street stores in the UK and Ireland, affecting up to 900 jobs. The UK's largest tour operator said it hoped to keep on 630 workers in a mix of sales and home-working roles and in remaining stores. The decision was made after changes in customer behaviour, including a shift to online, the firm said in a statement. About 350 retail stores will remain following the closures. The outlets set to close have been chosen based on a number of factors, including local market data and ""predictions on the future of travel"", the firm said. Tui said it will not release the list of stores at risk during the consultation period, but added that none of those that have reopened since lockdown will be shut. ""We want to be in the best position to provide excellent customer service, whether it's in a High Street store, over the telephone or online, and will continue to put the customer at the heart of what we do,"" said Andrew Flintham, managing director of Tui UK and Ireland. ""It is therefore imperative that we make these difficult cost decisions, look after our colleagues during such unprecedented uncertainty and also offer a modern customer service."" Tui also told the BBC that it had closed overseas customer services centres in Mumbai and Johannesburg in a bid to protect UK jobs. The company announced in Maythat it planned to cut around 8,000 jobs globally as it sought to reduce overhead costs by 30% in a major restructuring. But as the coronavirus pandemic has drawn on, the shift to online has accelerated.

Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic ""We believe Covid-19 has only accelerated this change in purchasing habits, with people looking to buy online or wishing to speak with travel experts from the comfort of their own home. ""We have world-class travel advisers at Tui, so we hope many of them will become homeworkers and continue to offer the personalised service we know our customers value."" Derek Jones, UK managing director of travel firm Kuoni, told the BBC that he believes the next six months will be ""really tricky for the travel industry"". ""Sadly, in my own business, we're having to make redundancies... but I think travel businesses in the long-term have a bright future,"" he said.

"Joshua Wong said the decision showed a ""total disregard for the will of Hongkongers"" Hong Kong authorities have disqualified 12 pro-democracy candidates from upcoming elections, deepening political tensions in the Chinese territory. Opposition legislators had hoped to obtain a majority in the Legislative Council (LegCo) in September's poll after Beijing's imposition of a highly controversial national security law. Among those barred are high-profile activistsJoshua Wongand Lester Shum. The government said the candidates were not fit to run for office. It said they could not be considered to be abiding by the constitutional duty required of lawmakers if they: advocated for, or promoted, Hong Kong's independence solicited intervention by foreign governments in Hong Kong's affairs expressed ""an objection in principle"" to the imposition of the national security law by central authorities in Beijing expressed ""an intention to exercise the functions of a LegCo Member by indiscriminately voting down"" any legislative proposals introduced by the Hong Kong government, ""so as to force the government to accede to certain political demands"" In its statement announcing the disqualifications, the government said the decision was taken in line with Hong Kong's mini-constitution - the Basic Law. ""There is no question of any political censorship, restriction of the freedom of speech or deprivation of the right to stand for elections as alleged by some members of the community,"" it said, adding that more disqualifications could not be ruled out. Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new law First 'non-protest' arrests under new Hong Kong law UK-China relationship 'seriously poisoned' Joshua Wong, who rose to prominence as a teenage activist during protests in 2014, said the decision showed ""a total disregard for the will of Hongkongers"" and ""tramples upon the city's last pillar of vanishing autonomy"".

The new national security law has been highly controversial in Hong Kong, a former British colony which is now part of China but was given unique freedoms in an agreement before the transfer of sovereignty. The law was widely condemned by Western governments, but China says it is necessary to restore stability in the territory, which was hit by months of pro-democracy protests last year which often turned violent. This video can not be played Stephen McDonell explains what the law means, and what people in Hong Kong think The opposition candidates disqualified on Thursday include four incumbent lawmakers, four district councillors - including Mr Shum - and activists Ventus Lau Wing-hong, Gwyneth Ho Kwai-lam and Alvin Cheng Kam-mun, in addition to Mr Wong. The Civic Party, one of the city's pro-democracy parties that had members among those barred, said the disqualifications ""exploited the right of Hong Kong people to vote"", Reuters news agency reports. Its four disqualified members were Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Cheng Tat-hung. By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong The mass disqualifications of pro-democracy candidates had been widely anticipated after young candidates were barred from the previous legislative poll in 2016. They came as a heavy blow after the pro-democracy camp held primaries in which more than 600,000 voted, just a little more than two weeks ago. Many of the barred candidates are young and support more confrontational tactics to fight for their cause. But it came as a surprise that four candidates from the Civic Party, which was founded by a group of lawyers in 2006, were also banned. The party is considered a more moderate wing of the democratic movement. There has been speculation that the government is planning to postpone the Legislative Council election by one year amid a new outbreak of coronavirus. Critics say the government wants to delay the election because the pro-Beijing camp faces a stunning defeat, as they did in last year's district council elections. On the other hand, the government says candidates cannot perform the duties of lawmakers if they vote down any proposals and force the government to meet political demands after securing a majority.  Then the next question is: will any opposition candidates be allowed to run in the future? This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained At a news conference in Hong Kong, Mr Kwok, a founding member of the Civic Party, said it was clear Beijing was trying to silence opposition. ""Today we are seeing the results of the relentless oppression that this regime is starting, not only just to take away the basic fundamental rights and freedom that was once enjoyed by all Hong Kong people under the Basic Law... but they are also trying to drive fear and oppression into our hearts and [in] this we must not let them succeed."" British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the decision. ""It is clear they [the opposition candidates] have been disqualified because of their political views, undermining the integrity of 'One Country, Two Systems' and the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's Basic Law,"" he said. What is the Basic Law and how does it work? The UK's last colonial governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, said Beijing was carrying out ""an outrageous political purge"". ""The National Security law is being used to disenfranchise the majority of Hong Kong's citizens. It is obviously now illegal to believe in democracy... This is the sort of behaviour that you would expect in a police state,"" he said in a statement. The office of Beijing's top representative in Hong Kong said it firmly supported the disqualifications and that those who were disqualified wanted to paralyse the government and subvert state power, Reuters reported. Amid speculation the government could postpone the election due to coronavirus, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Wednesday Hong Kong was on the verge of a ""large-scale outbreak"" that could causehospitals to ""collapse"". The Legislative Council helps to make and amend Hong Kong's laws. It is made up of 70 seats - but only 35 are directly voted for by the public. File photo of the chamber of the Legislative Council Another 30 represent ""functional constituencies"" - these are voted for by smaller groups representing special interests, primarily businesses, banking and trade. Historically these sectors have been largely pro-Beijing. The last five are made up of district councillors who are elected by the public. This system, where only a proportion of councillors are chosen by the public, has been called undemocratic by critics, but supporters of the system say it helps avoid populism and protects Hong Kong's business interests.

"TikTok is launching a $70 million (Â£54m) fund to pay some European creators for their content. It's the first time the app's made money available to EU users. It wants to hold onto existing talent and attract new ones. The video app says it wants to ""help support ambitious creators"" and says it hopes it will allow users to ""foster a livelihood"". Previously, users only made money with livestreams or brand partnerships. A similar fund, of $200m, waslaunched for US users,externalearlier this month. But there have beencalls for the app to be bannedin America due to security concerns. ""The UK has a long history of creativity and that's why TikTok has really thrived here,""says Rich Waterworth, the UK managing director of TikTok. ""Everyone has very different circumstances so we're hoping this funding will be able to support creators in a whole variety of ways - from supplementing their income or turning into a full-time job."" To be eligible for the new EU fund, users must be 18 years or older, have a certain number of followers and be posting original content that follows TikTok rules. The company hasn't said how it will choose users, but the cash will be given to creators in regular payments over the next year. ""Before this, trying to rationalise working short form - when you can get direct ad revenue on other platforms for longer form content - was a difficult task,"" says James, who's 24 and has had more than 70 million likes on the calligraphy videos he shares on TikTok. James is an artist who shares calligraphy work on TikTok TikTok says it expects the fund will rise to around $300m (Â£231m) within three years ""giving talented individuals the opportunity to turn their creativity into a career."" But there is a question over whether the fund could change the motives of creators on the world's most downloaded app - if they're competing for cash. ""The majority of content creators are already viewing it as a career,"" says James. ""I've been creating art on various platforms for the last seven years and it's something I'll continue to do whether or not this fund happens."" ""I think it will inspire a new generation of short form content creators,"" says James For James, the fund could mean artists make the content they want, instead of taking commissions from other people. ""It's always been a case that we're using our talent to create for other people and my goal over the past few years - and for a lot of other creative people - was to create stuff that I really enjoy and that I'm really passionate about,"" he explains. The fund isn't the first time there has been investment in European talent. Back in April the UK's first TikTik house was revealed, where users live to make content. This video can not be played Life in the UK's first 'TikTok house' It has previously been estimated creators with more than two million followers in the UK may earnannual incomes upwards of Â£25,000and some can earn much more with long-term brand deals and merchandising opportunities. For James, seeing Tik Tok as a career shouldn't be a creator's sole motivation. ""Focus on the content first and focus on something that you really enjoy,"" he advises. ""If you're going into it thinking you want this to be a career then you're more likely to hit creative blocks if you're not doing something you love first."" Rivals are making moves, too.

"""The laminated book of dreams,"" was how comedian Bill Bailey jokingly described the plastic-coated Argos catalogue. But 48 years on from its launch, the catalogue is finally coming to an end. The encyclopedia-like catalogues, the basis of many a child's Christmas wishlist, will no longer be regularly printed by the end of January 2021. The catalogue was first launched in 1972 and at its peak was Europe's most widely-printed publication, with only the Bible in more homes across the UK. Read more:Life lessons from the Argos catalogue Comedian Alan Carr famously picked the Argos catalogue as his book choice on Radio 4's programme Desert Island Discs. ""At least there's pictures,"" he said at the time. ""I feel it would help me through."" But now Argos says that online shopping offers ""greater convenience"" than flicking through its print catalogue and no further take-home editions of the catalogue will be produced. Instead, its products will be only listed and displayed online. The catalogue was first launched in 1972 The retailer has produced more than one billion copies of its bi-annual catalogue during its 48-year run, which quickly became synonymous with the brand. During its heyday, its pages featured the likes of Emma Bunton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. In fact, some of the UK's best known celebrities once graced the laminated pages of the retail bible. Strictly Come Dancing presenter Tess Daly modelled clothes for the company before she went on to become a household name in television. This Morning host Holly Willoughby also made an appearance in the late 90s while she was still working as a lingerie model. Other stars who began their career within its pages included actress Michelle Collins, supermodel Lisa Snowdon and presenter Emma Willis. The catalogue became so popular that at one stage more than 10 million copies were printed. However, that dipped to around three million copies when the now-final version was released in January this year. As word of the catalogue's demise spread across social media there was an outpouring of grief. Many declared childhood had been ""ruined"" by the news and decrying that children will never know the joys of circling potential birthday and Christmas gifts. 'RIP Argos' wrote one person, while another said it was another ""horror"" for 2020. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mark Given, chief marketing officer at Sainsbury's - which owns Argos, said the move was in response to a shift in customers' shopping habits. ""Over the decades the Argos catalogue has charted the nation's changing tastes and trends in everything from must-have toys to the latest gadgets and devices,"" he said. ""Just as our customers' tastes have changed over the years, so have their shopping habits. We're seeing an increasing shift towards digital shopping, using our mobile app, website and in-store browsers."" Customers shopping on smartphones and tablets now account for more than 70% of all Argos online sales. The retailer said it would still produce a print version of its annual Christmas gift guide. Steve Dresser, director at Grocery Insight, told the BBC that it had only been a matter of time before the retailer made the shift to digital-only. ""Everyone uses the internet for ordering nowadays, and e-commerce is experiencing a stratospheric rise again,"" he explained. ""Post-Covid 19 there is even less of a call for a catalogue.

"Local high streets could be poised for a revival if the trend for home working continues, a survey suggests. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' latest commercial property survey found almost all members - 93% - saw businesses scaling back their office space in the next two years. It said a move away from urban hubs could prompt a shift to neighbourhoods. RICS found most members expect retail and office rents to fall further this year. Three-quarters of the commercial property agencies and valuation businesses it surveyed, said the market was in a downturn, with just over one in 10 predicting conditions had reached the bottom of the cycle. 'Horrible' offices look to tempt back workers Barclays: We want our people back in the office The vast majority of respondents thought rents would fall in the next three months, the most pessimistic reading since 2008. Hew Edgar, head of UK government relations for RICS, warned of a ""polo mint"" effect - a hollowing out of city centres. But he said this could bring benefits, if properly managed: ""With downturn there can be opportunity, government must also look to replace uncertainty with stability; and fill the middle of the commercial sector polo mint. ""Offices and shops in city centres need support as people stay away from their normal workplace, and although local shop hubs are benefitting the market must be addressed as a whole."" Simon Rubinsohn, RICS Chief Economist, said tenants are thinking about a shift because commercial property in central locations is more expensive, while people are wanting to work more from home and spend extra time in their neighbourhoods. ""For a lot of businesses they are thinking about that opportunity to move towards suburban locations. We're looking at a very different model going forward: there may still be a central location but it may just be a lot smaller."" He said that will free up property for housing. ""It's quite clear the pandemic is going to result in more space becoming available. One of the obvious answers to that is to begin... to think about addressing the housing crisis that we have through use of some of this space."" However, Mr Rubinsohn added building conversions must meet quality standards for housing. ""I think it's really important that standards form the backbone of this conversion process,"" he said. Mr Edgar said the government's recent proposal to loosen building development laws was flawed. ""It is possible to deliver viable office-to-residential schemes through the more stringent planning permission process,"" he said.

"Domino's Pizza has dropped a promotion offering free pizza to women named Karen after it was met with a backlash. In recent years, the name ""Karen"" has been used as an insult to describe white middle-aged women who are perceived to be obnoxious or racist. The pizza franchise's New Zealand arm initially said it wanted to give ""nice Karens"" a break from negativity. But some said it was tone-deaf, ignored more important issues, and ""rewarded privilege"". A giveaway, titled ""Calling all (nice) Karens"" was posted on the pizza chain's Australian and New Zealand pages. It asked those named Karen to tell Domino's in 250 words how they were one of the ""nice ones"". ""The name 'Karen' has become synonymous with anyone who is entitled, selfish and likes to complain,"" Domino's chief marketing officer in the region, Allan Collins, said while introducing the offer. ""What used to be a light-hearted meme has become quite the insult to anyone actually named Karen. ""Well, today we're taking the name Karen back. At Domino's, we're all about bringing people together and we want to celebrate all the great Karens out there by shouting them a free pizza!"" The offer was immediately criticised, with many arguing ""Karen negativity"" was an issue that affected mostly ""privileged white women"". ""Most of the time Karens are entitled privileged white women. If a few people actually called Karen can't handle the meme they should try handling 400 years of oppression,"" said one user on Twitter. ""When you wanna reward more privilege to the most privileged in our society,"" another said. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Some brought up recent incidents where women were accused of acting like ""Karens"". ""Please Dominos, stop. Karens ask to speak to the manager and actively try to get low wage workers fired. Karens put people at risk by refusing to wear a mask. Karens don't need your defense,"" said another Twitter user. Others asked the company to find more worthwhile causes, like giving to ""people who actually need it... like [those] who are homeless and have no food security"". Even before the offer, the term ""Karen"" has proved controversial online. Many have argued using the name as an insult is itself racist and misogynistic. Domino's New Zealand quickly apologised for the offer on Facebook. It said it merely ""wanted to bring a smile to customers who are doing the right thing - Karen the nurse, Karen the teacher, Karen the mum"". It said its post had come off ""the back of a number of situations in Victoria, Australia [where] a person who decided they didn't have to follow the mandate and wear a mask and took it out on retail workers"". Charge filed against white Central Park 911 caller Earlier this month, a woman in Melbourne threatened to sue hardware store Bunnings, after staff told her it was compulsory to wear a mask. The woman was later dubbed ""Bunnings Karen"". Domino's said that people interpreted their campaign ""in a different way than we intended"". ""Our intention was one of inclusivity only. We want you to know that we are always listening and learning and when we get it wrong, we fix it. We are sorry."" Domino's Australia, which ran the same campaign, did not withdraw the offer - although it is closing on Friday. The company said: ""Thankfully, the majority of Australians interpreted the giveaway in the light-hearted way in which it was intended and had some fun tagging their friends and family named Karen. ""Unfortunately, due to lacking important context in New Zealand, it was not received in the same way.

"Perseverance rover launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida It is Nasa's most ambitious hunt for signs of life on Mars since the 1970s The car-sized rover carries a suite of science instruments designed to detect signatures of fossilised life if it's there It will spend seven months travelling to Mars before landing in Jezero Crater near the planet's equator Billions of years ago, when Mars was wetter, Jezero held a lake that could have supported primitive microbial organisms The UAE and China have also launched Mars missions in recent weeks, taking advantage of the planet's close approach to Earth Ritu Prasad, Jonathan Amos, Helen Briggs and Paul Rincon We hope you enjoyed the live coverage of the launch of Nasa's rover Perseverance. The robot is now on its seven-month journey to the Red Planet. In February next year, it should land in Jezero Crater to begin its search for evidence of ancient Martian life. We'll continue to bring you any news about the mission. But for now, it's goodbye from Ritu Prasad, Helen Briggs, Jonathan Amos and Paul Rincon. Next step: the Moon, says Jim Bridenstine. ""We need to go to the Moon sustainably to prove we can live and work on another world for long periods of time,"" he says. ""We go to the Moon because it's always a three-day journey home and we can prove what we need to prove there so we can eventually send humans to Mars."" He says there are robotic precursor missions and human precursor missions at the Moon. ""We love Apollo. The challenge with Apollo is that it ended. And now we're going back to the Moon with commercial partners and international partners under the Artemis programme, learning how to use the resources of another world... so we can eventually apply that to our long-duration mission to Mars."" Bridenstine adds that when Congress considers Nasa's upcoming budget requests, they should think about what happened today and what will happen in February when Perseverance lands on Mars - as well as how US astronauts were launched on US rockets for the first time in nearly a decade. ""If we were to receive the budgets, I'm very confident that we could get there by the mid-2030s."" With that, the post-launch news conference ends. Matt Wallace, deputy project manager Deputy project manager Matt Wallace responds to a question from Eric Berger from news outlet Ars Technica, who asks if the spacecraft is in ""safe mode"". He said: ""When we started this discussion, we weren't really sure, but it appears as though we came off the launch vehicle in our normal cruise mode. I'm just getting some indications that we had a minor temperature ""transient"" that's recovered, that may have put us into safe mode. If so, that's perfectly fine - the spacecraft is happy there. ""So the team is working through that telemetry, they're going to look at the rest of the spacecraft health. So far, everything I've seen looks good. And so we'll know more in a little bit."" Safe mode is an operating mode for spacecraft where all non-essential systems are shut down and only essential functions such as attitude control and radio reception are active. Sometimes, it can be the response to some sort of system failure or to the detection of conditions outside the normal operating range of the spacecraft. However, we do not yet know about the circumstances in this case, if the spacecraft has indeed entered this state. Jim Bridenstine is asked about how this latest astrobiology mission to Mars could serve as a bright light in these difficult times. ""I don't even know if 10 years ago we used that word [astrobiology],"" Bridenstine says, adding that it's exciting that we've learned there are places that could be habitable in our own Solar System right now, not just in the ancient past. He says Nasa is able to put together missions that not only inspire future generations, but all people. ""These are the kinds of things Nasa can do in very difficult times and we're very excited about it."" Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine says there was ""adversity all along the way"" but that's expected with any projects like this. What was unexpected was the coronavirus pandemic. He says a large fraction of Nasa, JPL and ULA teams were working from home, while smaller parts of the organisations kept functioning with personal protective gear, social distancing and staggered shifts. ""I'm not going to lie, it's a challenge, it's very stressful, but look - the teams made it happen and I'll tell you, we could not be more proud of what this integrated team was able to pull off here so it's very, very exciting."" Glaze answers a question about what the next steps to get to human exploration might be. She says the upcoming sample return mission, which is the very next Mars mission following Perseverance, is a key step. That mission will allow scientists to demonstrate the abilities of launching from the Martian surface as well asplanning a rendezvous in spacearound another planet. ""I think with each robotic mission, we demonstrate those next capabilities that we're going to need... to human exploration,"" she says. Lori Glaze, Nasa planetary science division director When Perseverance lands, cameras placed around the rover will allow us to watch a craft landing on another planet for the first time. Nasa planetary science division director Lori Glaze says: ""This mission has more cameras on it than any mission we've sent before. I think the images and the video we're going to get back form the Perseverance rover during entry, descent and landing and on the surface as well is going to be absolutely stunning."" She says it's going to ""feel like we're actually there, riding along with Perseverance on the way down"". Jim Bridenstine, Nasa administrator Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine takes a question on how the public perceives these missions. ""Every single one of these missions gets more complex and more sophisticated and right now we have the single most sophisticated complex robot ever sent to another world, so we're all very excited about it,"" he begins. ""But I think the American people see the benefit of these activities, not just in terms of science but also in the development of technology that we all benefit from."" He says that there's a ""lot of enthusiasm"" among the public for these missions. ""And of course as far as children go, these are the kind of moments where young folks can decide 'Wow! that's something I want to do when I grow up'. I think all of America is very proud and excited about this mission."" The team is asked again about the signal issues with Perseverance. Deputy project manager Wallace says the craft is very ""inherently stable"" and there's ""plenty of time to work through the communication issues"". ""There's nothing we need to do urgently...we've got plenty of time before ew have to make our first trajectory correction manoeuvre. Normally, it's 15 days after launch but we probably have time well beyond that based on how well we did [with the launch]."" Deputy project manager Matt Wallace answers a question on how landing will work when the rover enters Mars' atmosphere on 18 February 2021. ""Basically we start prepping for it maybe eight days out or so,"" he says. As the craft approaches, more and more processes become autonomous. It will land in a similar manner to the Curiosity rover. ""We come in on the order of 12,000 miles an hour, our entry capsule will slow us down, we'll steer that entry capsule hypersonically so we aim right at our landing site and then when we're still moving at about Mach 2 we inflate our big supersonic parachute. That's an exciting moment in the mission and that'll slow us down to maybe 150 miles an hour or so."" The heatshield will then drop off and here's where things get different. Perseverance has a new capability called Terrain Relative Navigation, which has allowed it to aim for the Jezero Crater landing site with very great precision. ""We take a picture as we're coming down, and then we find ourselves in a map we've stored on board from orbital imagery and once we know where we are in that map, we essentially divert the spacecraft away from the hazards."" The American GOES-16 weather satellite sits 36,000km above Earth's equator and caught the vapour trail from Perseverance's Atlas rocket.  Allow Twitter content?

Lori Glaze, Nasa's Planetary Science Division director, shares a video of children around the world who helped with Nasa's ""countdown to Mars"" campaign. Deputy project manager Matt Wallace is next. He describes today, like Bridenstine, as a ""perfect launch"", and then explains more about the signal issues. ""The one problem we had is the terminology we use - we couldn't lock up our telemetry,"" he says. ""Basically it allows us to read the information and the data coming from the spacecraft. It turns out the Deep Space Network is really designed to talk to spacecraft that are a long, long way away...they have very sensitive receivers, very big antennas, and to configure them in fact to talk to a spacecraft that is this close to the Earth is a little out of the ordinary."" For the last hour or so, he says, engineers have been working on configuring the ground station to get this signal. He adds that he just got a text during the conference that the team would get more information soon. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine speaks first, and says everything is still going to plan. Addressing the communications issues with Perseverance, Bridenstine says: ""We do need to fine tune our receiving stations on the ground and do some things to capture that signal and lock down but I think we're in great shape."" He adds that ""it couldn't have gone any better from a launch perspective"". Nasa officials are hosting the post-launch briefing at the Kennedy Space Center. We're hearing from Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine, Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science, Lori Glaze of the planetary science division, Matt Wallace, deputy project manager at JPL, Omar Baez, launch director, and Tory Bruno, president of United Launch Alliance. Paul RinconScience editor, BBC News website Nasa's rover missions have detailed extensive evidence pointing to Mars being hospitable to life billions of years ago. But there's an intriguing phenomenon on Mars that could point to possible life today. In 2004, the European Space Agency's (Esa) Mars Express spacecraft detected methane in the atmosphere of Mars in the parts per billion range. Nasa scientist Michael Mumma also presented evidence from ground telescopes of the gas in Mars' thin air. The finding was of interest because the vast majority of methane on Earth is produced by life. But it's not the only way methane can be produced, and so the methane can't be taken as solid evidence of microbial life. There are many ways it could be produced without biology, including a series of chemical reactions called serpentinisation, which could be taking place below the Martian surface. Nasa's Curiosity rover has detected irregular ""burps"" of atmospheric methane from its landing site at Gale Crater. Esa's Trace Gas Orbiter has been gathering long-term observations of gases such as methane in the Martian atmosphere. The results could provide a better idea of what's going on. Could Martian bugs be eking out an existence deep beneath the Martian surface, producing methane as a by-product of their life cycle? It's a possibility, but not the only one. This video can not be played Life on Mars: What do we know? Artist rendition of a sky crane lowering Nasa's earlier rover Curiosity Seven months from now, as it prepares to land on Mars, Perseverance will face what Nasa engineers call the ""seven minutes of terror"". This is the period of time it takes for the craft - which will enter Mars at high speeds - to slow down and gently land, wheels-down. But since parachutes aren't fully effective in the thin Martian atmosphere, Perseverance will need to slow down with rockets and be lowered on to the surface with a ""sky crane"". In addition, the rover will need to execute these manoeuvres on its own since there'll be a more-than 10-minute delay in signals reaching Earth from Mars. Wherever you go, it's difficult. The atmosphere is thick enough to cause severe heating on your spacecraft when you enter at high speed, but not so thick that you get all the help you need to slow down. This means what they term Entry, Descent and Landing, or EDL, has bitten many of those who've tried to make the drop to the surface. The Soviet Mars-3 mission was the first to get down intact, in 1971, but died very soon after. We all remember the British-European Beagle-2 lander. Satellite images suggest that also made it to the ground intact but, again, died soon after. Only the Americans have managed long-lived surface missions, starting with the Viking probes in the mid-70s, and continuing with Pathfinder-Sojourner in 1997, Spirit and Opportunity in 2004, Phoenix in 2007, Curiosity in 2012 and Insight in 2018. Hopefully, Perseverance and the Chinese Tianwen-1 rover will get down safely next year. And then, fingers crossed, Europe's ExoMars ""Rosalind Franklin"" rover will do the same in 2023.   There seem to be some communication issues between Nasa and the spacecraft. Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine says the team is working on it and it's a scenario they've ""worked through in the past with other missions"". He says the signal from Perseverance remains strong. Perseverance's Twitter account adds: ""I am healthy and on my way to Mars, but may be too loud for the antennas on Earth while I'm so close. Ground stations are working to match my signal strength so that I can communicate clearly with my team."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The robot is carrying a meteorite that originated on the Red Planet and which, until now, has been lodged in the collection of London's Natural History Museum (NHM). The rock's known properties will act as a calibration target to benchmark the workings of a rover instrument. It will give added confidence to any discoveries the robot might make. This will be particularly important if Perseverance stumbles across something that hints at the presence of past life on the planet - one of the mission's great quests. ""This little rock's got quite a life story,"" explained Prof Caroline Smith, head of Earth sciences collections at the NHM and a member of the Perseverance science team. ""It formed about 450 million years ago, got blasted off Mars by an asteroid or comet roughly 600,000-700,000 years ago, and then landed on Earth; we don't know precisely when but perhaps 1,000 years ago.

"The restrictions of lockdown have fostered a new community spirit in Britain, but there are signs feelings of solidarity and togetherness are already beginning to fragment and fray. That is the warning from a campaign called Together, which includes the NHS, charities, media groups and employers among its founders. The organisation helped organisethe birthday clap for the health service this monthand is launching a national public consultation on how to avoid new community divisions opening up. But there are expected to be challenging months ahead. PM joins nationwide clap on NHS 72nd anniversary Remembering 100 NHS workers who have died What does healing the Brexit divide mean? A poll published today suggests people feel the country has become less divided since virus restrictions were imposed. The survey of 2,000 adults by ICM, conducted during lockdown in May-June, found 45% of those questioned thought Britain had ""never been so divided"" during their lifetime. A similar poll, conducted just before lockdown in March, found 60% agreeing with the statement. Asked if the country was ""still too focused on what divides us"", the poll findings suggest a fall from 70% agreeing in March down to 61% by the end of May. A similar proportion in the later survey (62%) thought people had ""lost the ability to discuss politics without getting angry and abusive"". However, analysis of the polling and other attitudes data has led to warnings that the spirit of unity fostered by the fight against Covid-19 may be dissipating. ""There's a risk that past divides are re-emerging as society starts to re-open,"" says Jill Rutter, director of strategy at the think tank British Future and author of the Together report. ""The shared experience of lockdown made many people feel more connected to their neighbours and local community. Now that sense of togetherness is starting to fray. ""The good news is that people would rather we kept hold of it."" Prof Robert West from University College London, a member of the behavioural science group which feeds into Sage, said the level of concern people feel about the virus was easing, and was even lower among young people. He said this level of concern was the ""key thing"" which encouraged people to take the necessary action to protect their community. ""We need to ramp that back up to appropriate levels."" Prof West told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a lack of direction and communication from government meant the public may not have a clear sense of the risk and what they ought to be doing now. ""I personally am not 100% clear about what the government is asking us to do,"" he said. Prof West said the UK needs to have a strategy such as Scotland's goal of achieving ""zero Covid"" policy, ""so we know we're heading in a particular direction"". ""At the moment it feels a lot like we're just drifting,"" he said. What information do we collect from this quiz?Privacy notice. The Together campaign precedes the pandemic and had already been looking at how to heal the ""angry divides"" over Brexit and political tribalism. The revival of community spirit exemplified by the ""clap-for-carers"" during lockdown was seen as an opportunity to cement new connections at neighbourhood level. The campaign helped organise the birthday clap for the NHS on 5 July, an event today's ICM poll suggests was attended by 14 million people across Britain, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Participants were encouraged to ""raise a cuppa or glass"" with neighbours, to reflect on the connections that have been made during the lockdown and consider how to strengthen our communities for the next stage of the crisis. Boris Johnson joined the NHS anniversary clap That process now enters a new phase with the launch of ""talk/together"", a national conversation the organisers hope will be the biggest public consultation since the census. Discussion groups will be held in every region of the UK with an online survey that is expected to attract hundreds of thousands of visitors. The consultation is intended to help the country navigate a peaceful path through what is expected to be a significant recession. In the foreword to today's report, the Bishop of Leeds, Nick Baines, writes: ""We are entering a period of deep economic uncertainty, one that will heighten existing inequalities and strain our society further still.

"    By Alison Holt It’s the early hours of the morning and Michelle Heavens moves quickly along one of the care home’s dark corridors. She’s the senior carer on duty overnight and needs to check on 84-year-old Joan Day. Michelle pauses to put on a mask, goggles, apron and gloves before going into Joan’s room. Joan has coronavirus and is going downhill fast. “I loved her from the day she came in,” says Michelle. Joan had been physically fit, but dementia had made her life increasingly difficult. She'd moved into the specialist home at Blackley in Manchester last year and settled in quickly. “She was always singing Joan. Absolutely brilliant lady. She’d ask us if we needed help, rather than us give her any support.” Michelle checks Joan’s oxygen levels. They’re dropping rapidly. She’s having difficulty getting her breath so Michelle and two other carers reposition her to try to make her more comfortable. The nurse also gives her painkilling drugs. Joan Day  By early morning, it’s clear Joan is not improving. Normally her family would be with her, but coronavirus restrictions mean they haven’t seen her for weeks. Joan’s daughter, Yvonne Connelly, is herself shielding. Carers are her only link to what’s happening in the home. Shortly before finishing her shift, Michelle calls Yvonne. She explains that Joan’s health is deteriorating. “There’s not much else I can say, apart from she’s not coming back from it.” Yvonne wants to speak to her mother on the phone, but Joan is too ill. “When Michelle called she was lovely about it. She was upset herself,” reflects Yvonne. “She said ‘Yvonne, I don’t think she’ll be here when I come back tonight.’” Just a few hours after that call, Joan died. Yvonne was devastated she couldn’t be at her mother’s side. “It’s the worst feeling in the world.” Across the UK, more than 22,000 care home residents have died with Covid-19. Joan Day was one of nine residents to die with the virus at EachStep Blackley - one of two care homes that granted Panorama access during the pandemic.    Nurse Phil Benson had heard about a new virus emerging in China on the news, but it seemed a world away. “I was naive about it initially. It didn’t seem like it was a real thing. Nothing to worry about.” Phil’s a dementia specialist working for Community Integrated Care, the charity that runs EachStep Blackley. In the past, he’s worked in A&E and intensive care. “Social care’s probably the most challenging job I’ve ever had, but the best as well. It all starts from the heart.” Phil Benson But that “heart” was soon to be tested beyond measure, in a care sector already struggling with growing demand from an ageing population and years of underfunding. On 23 January, 11 million people were locked down in the Chinese city of Wuhan. A picture was emerging of a new illness that was particularly worrying for older people and those with underlying health conditions. As the virus started to spread globally, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - Sage - held regular meetings and fed advice to ministers. Sage brought together a wide range of experts plus food supply strategists, those with digital marketing experience and even staff from the justice system. But no-one had specific expertise in old age or social care. During February, Sage spent a lot of time planning how the NHS would cope. There were also two discussions about preventing the virus spreading in prisons. More than 400,000 people live in care homes in England, but according to official minutes, care homes didn’t appear on the agenda for the first 11 meetings. “It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected… There is no need to do anything differently in any care setting at present” was the Public Health England and government advice on 25 February. On 3 March, Phil heard about a major virus outbreak at a care home in Seattle in the US. Thirty-seven people would eventually die. “The guy speaking about Seattle said it was spreading from room to room, despite them using the best technologically available PPE [Personal Protective Equipment]. “I was thinking, oh my God, it can’t be, this is going to devastate us.” It was also the day Sage scientists discussed care homes for the first time. In a discussion about social distancing for over-65s the minutes note that: “It will be a challenge to implement this measure in communal settings, such as care homes.” At a televised briefing, England’s Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty said there would be “specific advice for care homes, but they didn’t want to do it too early”. But it already felt too late for Mark Adams, Phil’s boss and head of the charity Community Integrated Care. Mark Adams “We set up our own war room. We made our own decisions about what we could do to protect people.” Ordering PPE for many care homes was also a major problem. They claimed some of their usual supplies were being diverted to the NHS and the price of masks, aprons and gloves had skyrocketed. Community Integrated Care locked down all its homes on 13 March, including EachStep Blackley. Family and friends could no longer visit. The same day, the government withdrew advice which said the virus spread in care homes was unlikely. It said no-one with suspected Covid-19, or who was unwell, should visit care homes.

More than 200 miles away in Kent, at Pelham House in Folkestone, they were also worrying about how they would deal with the virus. A small, privately-run dementia home looking after 20 people, Pelham, like Blackley, also allowed Panorama in during the pandemic. Pelham’s owner, Roger Waluube, locked down on 16 March. “At that stage we began to get reports Covid was here on our doorstep,” says Roger. “We had to keep the wolf at bay.”  Roger Waluube That evening, at the first 5pm Downing Street daily briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said no-one should make “unnecessary” visits to care homes - but he stopped short of saying people must not visit relatives under any circumstances. By mid-March, the number of people needing treatment for Covid-19 in hospitals was rising rapidly. On the 17 March, NHS England sent hospitals a letter saying all medically-fit patients should be discharged as soon as possible. There was no requirement for testing. During the next four weeks, 25,000 patients were discharged to care homes. Panorama has gathered data from 39 hospital trusts, which shows three-quarters of people discharged were untested. The social care system is run by local councils, not the NHS. In all parts of the UK it’s under pressure from an ageing population and funding cuts. James Bullion was just taking over the role as president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), representing officials who run council care services in England. When he and colleagues met the prime minister and the Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock - he says making sure the NHS could cope was the overriding message. “There was a very strong feeling that anything that got in the way of that discharge arrangement [from hospitals] needed to be got out of the way. “Social care, the NHS and government should have had the forethought to think ‘It’s not right to discharge people without a test,” he says.  NHS England says testing policy is set by ministers and it has never supported pressure being put on care homes to accept admissions. The government has also repeatedly said that hospital discharge decisions during this time were made by medical professionals on a case-by-case basis. Sage advisers have since said residents moving into and out of hospital “may have been an important source” of the introduction of Covid-19 into care homes.

On 23 March, as the national lockdown began and streets fell eerily quiet, Phil Benson was on standby for the first coronavirus outbreak at a home run by Community Integrated Care. “I remember at that time the anxiety building,” he says. That week, there would be more than 500 outbreaks of coronavirus in care homes in England. On the last day of March, Phil got the call. EachStep Blackley had an outbreak. A resident, who’d been in hospital with breathing problems, had tested positive. She was very poorly and returned to the home for her last few days. “It was scary. We didn’t know much about Covid at that point,” says Debra Fielding, one of the advanced carers. “She came in through the back way, straight into an end bedroom. No residents were near her. Only certain staff were going in, they had to wear special PPE - visors, goggles, aprons, gloves.” Debra Fielding Other Blackley residents had started showing Covid-19 symptoms before she returned, but she was the first to die with the virus. In Kent, staff at Pelham House felt they were doing well keeping the virus out. Eighty-seven-year-old Doreen is one of the residents. She moved in after being diagnosed with dementia. She misses her late husband and old home. She has some understanding of what’s going on. “Coronavirus - that’s something that if you’ve got it, you must stay isolated,” she says. “It’s a bit frightening.” Doreen Pelham House, like many homes, was struggling to get enough PPE. Even basics, like food, were problematic - with the home’s regular supplier stopping deliveries. As a small care home, we were “left alone and set adrift, if I’m honest”, says Roger Waluube.  At Blackley, they checked residents’ temperatures, oxygen levels and blood pressure four times a day. They even brought in air purifiers, but the virus was spreading. In the two weeks after their first confirmed case, five died and 14 were showing symptoms. But none of those deaths were reflected at the televised daily government briefings. For the first six weeks, graphs that ministers and scientists pointed to - showing the number of coronavirus deaths - only showed what was happening in hospitals. Care home numbers were not included. Hospital deaths linked to Covid-19 peaked in England on 8 April. The peak in care homes followed soon after. “Family and friends should be advised not to visit care homes, except next of kin in exceptional situations such as end of life” “Negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home” “Respirators, fluid-resistant surgical masks, eye protection... can be subject to single sessional use - for example, a ward round or taking observations of several patients” Behind the scenes, directors of councils care services were increasingly worried. On 11 April, they sent a strongly worded letter to the Department of Health and Social Care. Social care appeared an afterthought, it said, adding that government guidance was contradictory and PPE distribution shambolic. The letter was leaked. James Bullion, ADASS president, says they were “distressed” by their “emotive” message going public, but it was an exceptional time. “We were frustrated by the lack of grip of the PPE issue, and lack of understanding about how you get, effectively, PPE to thousands of local organisations,” he says. The government says over the course of the pandemic it has provided 156 million items of protective equipment to social care.     At Blackley, staff were particularly worried about 85-year-old Bryan McHugh. A resident for two-and-a-half years, he had a history of lung problems. His daughter, Susan Murray, smiles at photos of Bryan with his grandson. “He was just lovely. He’d do anything for anybody. Nothing was ever too much trouble.” On 15 April, the home told her father had Covid symptoms. The following day he deteriorated. It took more than two hours for an ambulance to arrive. By then, Bryan was in a lot of pain and struggling to breathe. Advanced carer, Chelsea Mills, says it was tough. “To watch someone in pain is absolutely horrendous when you feel helpless. It was extremely hard.”  Chelsea Mills    There were difficult discussions between paramedics, Blackley staff and Bryan’s family about what to do for the best. Bryan was dying and being in hospital would not save him. It was agreed he should remain in the home surrounded by people he knew. His daughter Susan had asked the carers to give him a message. “Just tell him there’s Covid outside. We’ve got to be isolated in our own homes. That’s why we can’t come. And just tell him that we love him.” On the night shift, experienced nurse Herbert Mumbamarwo gave Bryan prescribed painkilling drugs - including morphine - but they weren’t working. Herbert Mumbamarwo  “Bryan over the last 10 to 12 months has never spoken a complete sentence,” says Herbert. “But that night, he managed to say ‘I can’t breathe, I’m drowning,’ words I didn’t know he could speak. That explains the extent of the trauma he was experiencing.” In a hospital, Herbert could have turned to senior doctors for advice to make Bryan more comfortable in his final hours, but in the care home he was the only medically-trained person on duty. “I was going on YouTube, on NICE guidelines, trying to find better ways to help. It didn’t help much. After my shift, I had a feeling of… I’ve failed Bryan.” Bryan was more comfortable by morning, but died the following night. Family photo: Susan, Bryan and his wife Sheila  “I feel as though I’ve let my dad down,” says daughter Susan. “Not being able to hold his hand was just horrendous. He relied on me, he used to say he always wanted me there if he was poorly.” NHS England says care homes had medical support through the pandemic.  Herbert understands the whole system was under pressure, but believes there are still lessons to learn. “We would benefit from a team of specialists, specifically on standby to respond to extreme cases of Covid. They could give advice on what best to do. “We’re not defying death, but what we’re trying to do is our mission statement - to make it comfortable.” In the week Bryan died, care home deaths peaked. More than 3,300 residents died in England and Wales. At its worst, 540 died in a single day. It’s a situation that angers Mark Adams from Community Integrated Care - the charity that runs EachStep Blackley. “Nobody really thought about the challenge that care organisations were going to face until, if I’m being brutal, the body count became so high they couldn’t ignore it.”  At Blackley, staff were particularly worried about 85-year-old Bryan McHugh.

Previous advice had stated that: “Negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home.” There would also be testing for all care home residents and staff showing symptoms. A shortage of tests had seen NHS staff prioritised and few care workers checked. By the end of April, there was increasing evidence that one of the ways the virus was getting into homes was through staff - particularly those working in more than one care home or hospital. It was also becoming clearer many residents and staff who tested positive for the virus showed no symptoms.

Other parts of the UK: (Sources: ONS, NRS, NISRA)  By early May, in Kent, Pelham House was still free of the virus. “We were meticulous about PPE,” says Karen White, one of the home’s most experienced carers. “Temperature-taking every morning, the staff, the residents. We were bobbing along. We were so pleased with ourselves, because we hadn’t got one single case.” But that was about to change. Francis, a resident for six years, was starting to feel poorly. “He was a fit and well man at the age of 96, and had served in the war,” says owner Roger Waluube. “He wasn’t feeling well, unusual for Francis, so he went into hospital.” Francis Chapman (photo: Paul Smith) The next morning, they got a call saying Francis needed to be discharged. The hospital said there was no clinical need for him to stay. It had followed guidance and tested him, but the results were not back. The government’s Social Care Action Plan stated: “Where a test result is still awaited, the patient will be discharged and pending the result, isolated in the same way as a Covid-positive patient will be.” But staff at Pelham wanted to wait until they knew what they were dealing with. “It escalated to the consultant in A&E being on the phone and really, really requesting and stating that Francis had to come home on that day,” says Roger. Asked if they felt bullied, he says: “We did. Yes. There was no other option but to take Francis back to the care home and if we didn’t agree, he would be sent back anyway in an ambulance.”  Pelham House does not have nursing facilities and Francis was very ill. He was back at the home when staff got the call saying he’d tested positive for Covid-19. “You knew you couldn’t stop it, you were powerless,” says Roger. “It was very scary. It was inevitable, we knew people were going to go.” The Kent and Medway Clinical Commissioning Group said in a statement: “As symptoms can take up to 14 days to appear following exposure, it is likely the resident would already have been infected.” It also said the home was given advice and support around minimising the risk of Covid-19 spreading in the home. In his final hours, Francis was moved to a nearby hospice, which provided him with the end of life care he needed. Other Pelham House residents were now also falling ill with the virus.   At Blackley, Covid-19 had spread from one end of the building to the other. Staff were worried about 91-year-old Vera, normally seen making her way around the home with her walking frame. “She does look after everybody, mother everybody. And she chats non-stop, so that’s what we like,” says advanced carer, Debra Fielding. But Vera had developed a cough and her temperature was up. Vera Another resident, Michael, was taken to hospital because of his particular underlying medical condition. His daughter, Michelle Phillips, is Blackley’s manager. “He was poorly when he left. When he spotted me in reception, he waved and shouted after me that he loved me. That just made me cry.” At this point, Blackley was only able to test residents or staff with Covid-19 symptoms. To stand a chance of controlling the virus they needed to be able to identify all those who were infected but without symptoms. Phil Benson was on the phone every few days trying to get more tests. “I remember begging ‘Please can one of these people come and just test? Can we not have everyone tested? Surely there’s such a severe outbreak here, it’s in everyone’s interest to be tested?’ “And it was ‘No, the policy is clear. We only test people who’ve got symptoms.’”  Nearly two months after the country locked down, on 15 May, the Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, announced an infection control plan for care homes. It included £600-million ring-fenced to help with increased Covid-19 costs, a named clinician to provide each home with medical support and testing for all care home residents and staff. At the daily briefing, the health secretary said that: “From the start we’ve worked incredibly hard to throw that protective ring around our care homes.” “What protective ring?” asks Pelham House manager Roger Waluube. “We don’t understand what the protective ring could have been or was.”      Everyone in Pelham House could now be tested. All 20 residents and 17 staff were checked. Two days later the test results came back. “The manager was just sat there with his mouth open,” says carer Karen White. “He just pointed at the screen and it was horrific. Every resident apart from two were positive. And 80% of the staff.” Karen White It meant most of the staff had to leave immediately. “They had to down tools,” remembers Roger. “That left us in a very vulnerable position, particularly when the cook has to suddenly stop her cooking and go home. “There’s three or four of us who’ve been on the frontline as such and continually testing negative. We could keep going.” Overall, 19 Pelham House residents tested positive and nearly half those living at the home died. The home normally averages about three deaths a year, but it had nine in just 10 days. “We’re not used to death at this scale. Having to say goodbye to so many people so quickly,” says Roger. Carer Karen was hit hard after the funeral of Peter Baker, a resident with learning difficulties and no family, soon to celebrate his 76th birthday. “He just gently passed away,” she recalls tearfully. “He trusted us to look after him. And he always kept saying ‘Love you girls, I love you girls, I’m so happy here.’ We just let him die. With his learning difficulties he wouldn’t have understood.”  Pelham House was also facing another big problem. By July, it was virus free, but the deaths of half of its residents meant the home had lost 50% of its income. Pelham was rated “good” by the regulator, the Care Quality Commission. Before Covid-19, Roger Waluube had plans to develop and redecorate. Coronavirus changed all that. “We were a very healthy and viable business,” he says. “Now our future is in the balance and the outlook is not good.” Roger Waluube By late June, he estimated they had enough money to last six to eight weeks. With little prospect of new residents moving in, he turned to Kent County Council for help. Since March, the government has given councils £3.7bn to help with the additional pandemic costs. The money is for all services under pressure - including support for children, the homeless and transport services. The Local Government Association, which represents local councils, estimates about 40% of the first £3.2bn received has gone to adult social care, including care homes. So far, Pelham has received about £40,000 in council help. Roger is discussing loans, but he estimates it’ll take at least another £100,000 for the home to survive. Closure would see residents like Doreen having to find a new home. It would be difficult for them all. Residents grow to see this place as their home, says Roger. “Moving people from one care home to another never generally has great results because that adjustment can take its toll on people.”    At Blackley, there was finally some good news. Staff lined up in reception to welcome Michael back. He was in hospital with the virus for two weeks but recovered. As the ambulance crew wheeled him in, his daughter and home manager, Michelle, gave him a big hug. Michelle Phillips “I’m really happy,” she laughs. “A feeling I’ve not had for a while.” Vera also recovered and was able to celebrate her 92nd birthday. In mid-June, she saw her daughter and grandson at a distance. She sat on one of the home’s balconies while they were in the garden. Vera smiles at her daughter and grandson Over six weeks, 16 of the home’s 55 residents had Covid-19 officially - while others had symptoms. Nine died. With the outbreak under control, Phil Benson finished his work at Blackley and went on to help other homes. By early July, Pelham House was also coronavirus-free, but its future remained uncertain. Roger Waluube is crowdfunding to see if he can save the home, but he faces some hard decisions. “I will not get to the point where I’ve got two hours to go, and I’ve run out of cash or I can’t care for people any more,” he says.

The government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the social care sector was “slow, inconsistent and at times negligent” is the damning verdict of MPs on the Public Accounts Committee in theirreport of 29 July. The decision to allow hospital patients in England to be discharged to care homes without tests at the start of the pandemicwas “reckless”, they say. The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care declined to be interviewed by Panorama. In a statement, his department said:“We first published guidance for the social care sector in February and have since announced a raft of measures. Our help has meant almost 60% of England’s care homes have had no outbreak at all.” The government has also promised to bring forward plans for reforming the care system in the near future. It has started cross-party talks on what it describes as a complex issue. Mark Adams, of Community Integrated Care, says that change has to happen soon. “When we look back, we will see this as one of the most mismanaged national challenges we’ve ever faced,” he says. “You can’t have a disconnected health and social care system. It can’t be left to local authorities, whose budgets are being cut, and [who] then have to think about who gets care and who doesn’t.” No government will get everything right in the extreme situation a pandemic presents, but it will be judged on how it protects the most vulnerable.

"""The laminated book of dreams,"" was how comedian Bill Bailey jokingly described the plastic-coated Argos catalogue. But 48 years on from its launch, the catalogue is finally coming to an end. The encyclopedia-like catalogues, the basis of many a child's Christmas wishlist, will no longer be regularly printed by the end of January 2021. The catalogue was first launched in 1972 and at its peak was Europe's most widely-printed publication, with only the Bible in more homes across the UK. Read more:Life lessons from the Argos catalogue Comedian Alan Carr famously picked the Argos catalogue as his book choice on Radio 4's programme Desert Island Discs. ""At least there's pictures,"" he said at the time. ""I feel it would help me through."" But now Argos says that online shopping offers ""greater convenience"" than flicking through its print catalogue and no further take-home editions of the catalogue will be produced. Instead, its products will be only listed and displayed online. The catalogue was first launched in 1972 The retailer has produced more than one billion copies of its bi-annual catalogue during its 48-year run, which quickly became synonymous with the brand. During its heyday, its pages featured the likes of Emma Bunton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. In fact, some of the UK's best known celebrities once graced the laminated pages of the retail bible. Strictly Come Dancing presenter Tess Daly modelled clothes for the company before she went on to become a household name in television. This Morning host Holly Willoughby also made an appearance in the late 90s while she was still working as a lingerie model. Other stars who began their career within its pages included actress Michelle Collins, supermodel Lisa Snowdon and presenter Emma Willis. The catalogue became so popular that at one stage more than 10 million copies were printed. However, that dipped to around three million copies when the now-final version was released in January this year. As word of the catalogue's demise spread across social media there was an outpouring of grief. Many declared childhood had been ""ruined"" by the news and decrying that children will never know the joys of circling potential birthday and Christmas gifts. 'RIP Argos' wrote one person, while another said it was another ""horror"" for 2020. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mark Given, chief marketing officer at Sainsbury's - which owns Argos, said the move was in response to a shift in customers' shopping habits. ""Over the decades the Argos catalogue has charted the nation's changing tastes and trends in everything from must-have toys to the latest gadgets and devices,"" he said. ""Just as our customers' tastes have changed over the years, so have their shopping habits. We're seeing an increasing shift towards digital shopping, using our mobile app, website and in-store browsers."" Customers shopping on smartphones and tablets now account for more than 70% of all Argos online sales. The retailer said it would still produce a print version of its annual Christmas gift guide. Steve Dresser, director at Grocery Insight, told the BBC that it had only been a matter of time before the retailer made the shift to digital-only. ""Everyone uses the internet for ordering nowadays, and e-commerce is experiencing a stratospheric rise again,"" he explained. ""Post-Covid 19 there is even less of a call for a catalogue. ""The reality is the march of technology and progression doesn't spare anything, not even the beloved Argos catalogue.""

"Ranae James, now a graphic designer, was excluded dozens of time during a tough period Black pupils are disproportionately hit with fixed-term exclusions in England - by three times as many in some places, data shows. Pupils with black ethnicity have higher temporary exclusion rates in two-thirds of local authority areas, new analysis from the House of Commons library says. Discipline policies banning black hairstyles, kissing teeth and fist-bumping are being blamed in part. Schools have a statutory duty not to discriminate against pupils over race. Rates for fixed-term exclusions - disciplinary measures that may last a day or several weeks - were around three times higher for black pupils in four areas. And in another seven local authorities, black pupils had double the local rate for all pupils, according to 2017-18 data. The revelation comes as the Department for Education publishes new national data on exclusions, which shows black pupils from a Caribbean background had almost twice the England average rate of short term exclusions at 10.37% in 2018-19. Exclusions: what's legal and what's not Overhaul exclusions to beat knife crime, say MPs Ranae James, was excluded dozens of times while her mother grappled with a mental health problem, before she managed to turn things around for herself. She told the BBC how she felt her east London school had ""stereotyped"" her, rather than offering the support she needed. She added: ""If you were upset and you kissed your teeth, you were excluded straight away. ""That was seen as the most antagonistic thing you could do."" Kissing teeth is a way of expressing emotion, often used by African and Caribbean people. It produces a sounds using the teeth and lips which is similar to ""tutting"". Ranae now volunteers with young people Ranae also said the school banned pupils from ""bumping fists"" when they met each other, saying it referred to gang culture. ""It was just the way that we used to greet each other,"" Ranae said, adding: ""None of us were in gangs."" In general, pupils who receive fixed term exclusions often go on to be permanently excluded - but they also tend be those facing the most challenges. These include mental health issues - often expressed in behaviour, difficult home lives and living conditions, such as extreme poverty, as well as special educational needs. Some of these factors are experienced at higher rates among black families in England. Liberal Democrat education spokesman and leadership contender, Layla Moran, who obtained the data, is calling for a new universal code with clear criteria setting out the grounds for exclusions to prevent any bias or discrimination. She said: ""It is a glaring injustice that black pupils growing up across the country are so much more likely to be excluded from school than their peers. ""The government must urgently review what is causing this gap and take action to ensure every child has an equal opportunity to thrive. ""The numbers in some areas may be small, but they still show black pupils are being disproportionately impacted."" Kiran Gill, who runs a charity calledThe Difference,external- which recruits and trains leaders for schools for excluded pupils, says it is not that teachers are racist, but more that a pupil's experience of racism generally can intersect with circumstances that are already tough. Irene Ogunseitan and Jack Weston have worked together to understand how cultural differences can play out in schools Irene Ogunseitan, assistant principal at Harris Aspire, Croydon, south London and a Difference Leader, says the issue is often down to a lack of thought about how school policies can affect certain groups. She says hair styles, and the requirement for all pupils to look the same, can be a flashpoint. Ms Ogunseitan said: ""I have seen in schools when parents have had their child's hair cut low, they thought they were getting their child school ready, and that child ends up in an isolation unit."" She has worked on the broader issue through the charity with another Difference Leader Jack Weston, who is assistant head teacher of another school for excluded pupils in Medway. He says the black pupils who come into his school often see racism as part of the reason they are there. Gillian LaRoque says black pupils can feel worn down by having to fit in And Gillian LaRoque, assistant head of The Limes College, Sutton, recalls a girl in another school who had her hair in an Afro being told to cut it because other pupils ""couldn't see the board"". ""These may be small, micro things that you are doing to change yourself,"" she adds, ""but after a while it really wears you down."" ""It's the message that you are almost not good enough. ""You are having to tame your hair, tame your blackness, and it's happening from when you are a child,"" she says. Schools are loaded with cultural norms that can be excluding to minority groups, she says, adding that some teachers have certain expectations about how black pupils will behave. Over the past decade, there has been a drop in the proportion of black pupils given temporary exclusions nationally, but in every year since 2007, pupils from black and mixed backgrounds have had the highest rates. Ms Gill believes one key way to tackle the issue is to promote more black staff to senior positions in school, so staff teams can increase their cultural awareness and sensitivity. This also ""disrupts a tacit message that leadership isn't for black people"", she argues. According to the data, which relates to 2017-18, in four areas, Warrington and Kingston-upon-Thames, Harrow and Bath and NE Somerset, black pupils were around three times more likely to be excluded. Warrington Council pointed to their low numbers of black pupils overall, with only 0.65% of pupils with this ethnicity in 2017-18.  Here, the 5.7% exclusion rate, meant 12 black pupils were temporarily excluded. It added that more recent data showed the number and rate had dropped since then. Kingston-upon-Thames Council also highlighted their low exclusion rate overall, adding that whilst black pupils were proportionally over-represented in 2017-18, there were relatively few pupils involved. It added that the number of black pupils excluded fell the following year from 31 to 24. In Harrow and Bath and North East Somerset, black pupils are just under three times as likely to be disciplined in this way compared to all pupils. In a further seven council areas, Stockport, Trafford, Ealing, Solihull, Redbridge, Herefordshire and Richmond-upon-Thames, the exclusion rate for black pupils was double that for all pupils in these areas. Some of these areas have small black populations, others large and there was no clear pattern as to why black pupils were disproportionately affected. In a statement, the Department for Education said the government had established an independent commission to look at race and ethnic disparities in general, as well as seeking to understand disparities in exclusion rates. The statement said some pupils would return to school in September having experienced loss or adversity due to the coronavirus pandemic and so the department had provided guidance on how to re-engage pupils.

"    By Alison Holt It’s the early hours of the morning and Michelle Heavens moves quickly along one of the care home’s dark corridors. She’s the senior carer on duty overnight and needs to check on 84-year-old Joan Day. Michelle pauses to put on a mask, goggles, apron and gloves before going into Joan’s room. Joan has coronavirus and is going downhill fast. “I loved her from the day she came in,” says Michelle. Joan had been physically fit, but dementia had made her life increasingly difficult. She'd moved into the specialist home at Blackley in Manchester last year and settled in quickly. “She was always singing Joan. Absolutely brilliant lady. She’d ask us if we needed help, rather than us give her any support.” Michelle checks Joan’s oxygen levels. They’re dropping rapidly. She’s having difficulty getting her breath so Michelle and two other carers reposition her to try to make her more comfortable. The nurse also gives her painkilling drugs. Joan Day  By early morning, it’s clear Joan is not improving. Normally her family would be with her, but coronavirus restrictions mean they haven’t seen her for weeks. Joan’s daughter, Yvonne Connelly, is herself shielding. Carers are her only link to what’s happening in the home. Shortly before finishing her shift, Michelle calls Yvonne. She explains that Joan’s health is deteriorating. “There’s not much else I can say, apart from she’s not coming back from it.” Yvonne wants to speak to her mother on the phone, but Joan is too ill. “When Michelle called she was lovely about it. She was upset herself,” reflects Yvonne. “She said ‘Yvonne, I don’t think she’ll be here when I come back tonight.’” Just a few hours after that call, Joan died. Yvonne was devastated she couldn’t be at her mother’s side. “It’s the worst feeling in the world.” Across the UK, more than 22,000 care home residents have died with Covid-19. Joan Day was one of nine residents to die with the virus at EachStep Blackley - one of two care homes that granted Panorama access during the pandemic.    Nurse Phil Benson had heard about a new virus emerging in China on the news, but it seemed a world away. “I was naive about it initially. It didn’t seem like it was a real thing. Nothing to worry about.” Phil’s a dementia specialist working for Community Integrated Care, the charity that runs EachStep Blackley. In the past, he’s worked in A&E and intensive care. “Social care’s probably the most challenging job I’ve ever had, but the best as well. It all starts from the heart.” Phil Benson But that “heart” was soon to be tested beyond measure, in a care sector already struggling with growing demand from an ageing population and years of underfunding. On 23 January, 11 million people were locked down in the Chinese city of Wuhan. A picture was emerging of a new illness that was particularly worrying for older people and those with underlying health conditions. As the virus started to spread globally, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - Sage - held regular meetings and fed advice to ministers. Sage brought together a wide range of experts plus food supply strategists, those with digital marketing experience and even staff from the justice system. But no-one had specific expertise in old age or social care. During February, Sage spent a lot of time planning how the NHS would cope. There were also two discussions about preventing the virus spreading in prisons. More than 400,000 people live in care homes in England, but according to official minutes, care homes didn’t appear on the agenda for the first 11 meetings. “It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected… There is no need to do anything differently in any care setting at present” was the Public Health England and government advice on 25 February. On 3 March, Phil heard about a major virus outbreak at a care home in Seattle in the US. Thirty-seven people would eventually die. “The guy speaking about Seattle said it was spreading from room to room, despite them using the best technologically available PPE [Personal Protective Equipment]. “I was thinking, oh my God, it can’t be, this is going to devastate us.” It was also the day Sage scientists discussed care homes for the first time. In a discussion about social distancing for over-65s the minutes note that: “It will be a challenge to implement this measure in communal settings, such as care homes.” At a televised briefing, England’s Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty said there would be “specific advice for care homes, but they didn’t want to do it too early”. But it already felt too late for Mark Adams, Phil’s boss and head of the charity Community Integrated Care. Mark Adams “We set up our own war room. We made our own decisions about what we could do to protect people.” Ordering PPE for many care homes was also a major problem. They claimed some of their usual supplies were being diverted to the NHS and the price of masks, aprons and gloves had skyrocketed. Community Integrated Care locked down all its homes on 13 March, including EachStep Blackley. Family and friends could no longer visit. The same day, the government withdrew advice which said the virus spread in care homes was unlikely. It said no-one with suspected Covid-19, or who was unwell, should visit care homes.

More than 200 miles away in Kent, at Pelham House in Folkestone, they were also worrying about how they would deal with the virus. A small, privately-run dementia home looking after 20 people, Pelham, like Blackley, also allowed Panorama in during the pandemic. Pelham’s owner, Roger Waluube, locked down on 16 March. “At that stage we began to get reports Covid was here on our doorstep,” says Roger. “We had to keep the wolf at bay.”  Roger Waluube That evening, at the first 5pm Downing Street daily briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said no-one should make “unnecessary” visits to care homes - but he stopped short of saying people must not visit relatives under any circumstances. By mid-March, the number of people needing treatment for Covid-19 in hospitals was rising rapidly. On the 17 March, NHS England sent hospitals a letter saying all medically-fit patients should be discharged as soon as possible. There was no requirement for testing. During the next four weeks, 25,000 patients were discharged to care homes. Panorama has gathered data from 39 hospital trusts, which shows three-quarters of people discharged were untested. The social care system is run by local councils, not the NHS. In all parts of the UK it’s under pressure from an ageing population and funding cuts. James Bullion was just taking over the role as president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), representing officials who run council care services in England. When he and colleagues met the prime minister and the Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock - he says making sure the NHS could cope was the overriding message. “There was a very strong feeling that anything that got in the way of that discharge arrangement [from hospitals] needed to be got out of the way. “Social care, the NHS and government should have had the forethought to think ‘It’s not right to discharge people without a test,” he says.  NHS England says testing policy is set by ministers and it has never supported pressure being put on care homes to accept admissions. The government has also repeatedly said that hospital discharge decisions during this time were made by medical professionals on a case-by-case basis. Sage advisers have since said residents moving into and out of hospital “may have been an important source” of the introduction of Covid-19 into care homes.

Sage advisers have since said residents moving into and out of hospital “may have been an important source” of the introduction of Covid-19 into care homes.   On 23 March, as the national lockdown began and streets fell eerily quiet, Phil Benson was on standby for the first coronavirus outbreak at a home run by Community Integrated Care. “I remember at that time the anxiety building,” he says. That week, there would be more than 500 outbreaks of coronavirus in care homes in England. On the last day of March, Phil got the call. EachStep Blackley had an outbreak. A resident, who’d been in hospital with breathing problems, had tested positive. She was very poorly and returned to the home for her last few days. “It was scary. We didn’t know much about Covid at that point,” says Debra Fielding, one of the advanced carers. “She came in through the back way, straight into an end bedroom. No residents were near her. Only certain staff were going in, they had to wear special PPE - visors, goggles, aprons, gloves.” Debra Fielding Other Blackley residents had started showing Covid-19 symptoms before she returned, but she was the first to die with the virus. In Kent, staff at Pelham House felt they were doing well keeping the virus out. Eighty-seven-year-old Doreen is one of the residents. She moved in after being diagnosed with dementia. She misses her late husband and old home. She has some understanding of what’s going on. “Coronavirus - that’s something that if you’ve got it, you must stay isolated,” she says. “It’s a bit frightening.” Doreen Pelham House, like many homes, was struggling to get enough PPE. Even basics, like food, were problematic - with the home’s regular supplier stopping deliveries. As a small care home, we were “left alone and set adrift, if I’m honest”, says Roger Waluube.  At Blackley, they checked residents’ temperatures, oxygen levels and blood pressure four times a day. They even brought in air purifiers, but the virus was spreading. In the two weeks after their first confirmed case, five died and 14 were showing symptoms. But none of those deaths were reflected at the televised daily government briefings. For the first six weeks, graphs that ministers and scientists pointed to - showing the number of coronavirus deaths - only showed what was happening in hospitals. Care home numbers were not included. Hospital deaths linked to Covid-19 peaked in England on 8 April. The peak in care homes followed soon after. “Family and friends should be advised not to visit care homes, except next of kin in exceptional situations such as end of life” “Negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home” “Respirators, fluid-resistant surgical masks, eye protection... can be subject to single sessional use - for example, a ward round or taking observations of several patients” Behind the scenes, directors of councils care services were increasingly worried. On 11 April, they sent a strongly worded letter to the Department of Health and Social Care. Social care appeared an afterthought, it said, adding that government guidance was contradictory and PPE distribution shambolic. The letter was leaked. James Bullion, ADASS president, says they were “distressed” by their “emotive” message going public, but it was an exceptional time. “We were frustrated by the lack of grip of the PPE issue, and lack of understanding about how you get, effectively, PPE to thousands of local organisations,” he says. The government says over the course of the pandemic it has provided 156 million items of protective equipment to social care.     At Blackley, staff were particularly worried about 85-year-old Bryan McHugh. A resident for two-and-a-half years, he had a history of lung problems. His daughter, Susan Murray, smiles at photos of Bryan with his grandson. “He was just lovely. He’d do anything for anybody. Nothing was ever too much trouble.” On 15 April, the home told her father had Covid symptoms. The following day he deteriorated. It took more than two hours for an ambulance to arrive. By then, Bryan was in a lot of pain and struggling to breathe. Advanced carer, Chelsea Mills, says it was tough. “To watch someone in pain is absolutely horrendous when you feel helpless. It was extremely hard.”  Chelsea Mills    There were difficult discussions between paramedics, Blackley staff and Bryan’s family about what to do for the best. Bryan was dying and being in hospital would not save him. It was agreed he should remain in the home surrounded by people he knew. His daughter Susan had asked the carers to give him a message. “Just tell him there’s Covid outside. We’ve got to be isolated in our own homes. That’s why we can’t come. And just tell him that we love him.” On the night shift, experienced nurse Herbert Mumbamarwo gave Bryan prescribed painkilling drugs - including morphine - but they weren’t working. Herbert Mumbamarwo  “Bryan over the last 10 to 12 months has never spoken a complete sentence,” says Herbert. “But that night, he managed to say ‘I can’t breathe, I’m drowning,’ words I didn’t know he could speak. That explains the extent of the trauma he was experiencing.” In a hospital, Herbert could have turned to senior doctors for advice to make Bryan more comfortable in his final hours, but in the care home he was the only medically-trained person on duty. “I was going on YouTube, on NICE guidelines, trying to find better ways to help. It didn’t help much. After my shift, I had a feeling of… I’ve failed Bryan.” Bryan was more comfortable by morning, but died the following night. Family photo: Susan, Bryan and his wife Sheila  “I feel as though I’ve let my dad down,” says daughter Susan. “Not being able to hold his hand was just horrendous. He relied on me, he used to say he always wanted me there if he was poorly.” NHS England says care homes had medical support through the pandemic.  Herbert understands the whole system was under pressure, but believes there are still lessons to learn. “We would benefit from a team of specialists, specifically on standby to respond to extreme cases of Covid. They could give advice on what best to do. “We’re not defying death, but what we’re trying to do is our mission statement - to make it comfortable.” In the week Bryan died, care home deaths peaked. More than 3,300 residents died in England and Wales. At its worst, 540 died in a single day. It’s a situation that angers Mark Adams from Community Integrated Care - the charity that runs EachStep Blackley. “Nobody really thought about the challenge that care organisations were going to face until, if I’m being brutal, the body count became so high they couldn’t ignore it.”  At Blackley, staff were particularly worried about 85-year-old Bryan McHugh. A resident for two-and-a-half years, he had a history of lung problems. His daughter, Susan Murray, smiles at photos of Bryan in the garden with his grandson. “He was just lovely. He’d do anything for anybody. Nothing was ever too much trouble.” On 15 April, the home told her father had Covid symptoms. The following day he deteriorated. It took more than two hours for an ambulance to arrive. By then, Bryan was in a lot of pain and struggling to breathe. Advanced carer, Chelsea Mills, says it was tough. “To watch someone in pain is absolutely horrendous when you feel helpless. It was extremely hard.” Chelsea Mills There were difficult discussions between paramedics, Blackley staff and Bryan’s family about what to do for the best. Bryan was dying and being in hospital would not save him. It was agreed he should remain in the home surrounded by people he knew. His daughter Susan had asked the carers to give him a message. “Just tell him there’s Covid outside. We’ve got to be isolated in our own homes. That’s why we can’t come. And just tell him that we love him.” On the night shift, experienced nurse Herbert Mumbamarwo gave Bryan prescribed painkilling drugs - including morphine - but they weren’t working.

Previous advice had stated that: “Negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home.” There would also be testing for all care home residents and staff showing symptoms. A shortage of tests had seen NHS staff prioritised and few care workers checked. By the end of April, there was increasing evidence that one of the ways the virus was getting into homes was through staff - particularly those working in more than one care home or hospital. It was also becoming clearer many residents and staff who tested positive for the virus showed no symptoms.

Other parts of the UK: (Sources: ONS, NRS, NISRA)  By early May, in Kent, Pelham House was still free of the virus. “We were meticulous about PPE,” says Karen White, one of the home’s most experienced carers. “Temperature-taking every morning, the staff, the residents. We were bobbing along. We were so pleased with ourselves, because we hadn’t got one single case.” But that was about to change. Francis, a resident for six years, was starting to feel poorly. “He was a fit and well man at the age of 96, and had served in the war,” says owner Roger Waluube. “He wasn’t feeling well, unusual for Francis, so he went into hospital.” Francis Chapman (photo: Paul Smith) The next morning, they got a call saying Francis needed to be discharged. The hospital said there was no clinical need for him to stay. It had followed guidance and tested him, but the results were not back. The government’s Social Care Action Plan stated: “Where a test result is still awaited, the patient will be discharged and pending the result, isolated in the same way as a Covid-positive patient will be.” But staff at Pelham wanted to wait until they knew what they were dealing with. “It escalated to the consultant in A&E being on the phone and really, really requesting and stating that Francis had to come home on that day,” says Roger. Asked if they felt bullied, he says: “We did. Yes. There was no other option but to take Francis back to the care home and if we didn’t agree, he would be sent back anyway in an ambulance.”  Pelham House does not have nursing facilities and Francis was very ill. He was back at the home when staff got the call saying he’d tested positive for Covid-19. “You knew you couldn’t stop it, you were powerless,” says Roger. “It was very scary. It was inevitable, we knew people were going to go.” The Kent and Medway Clinical Commissioning Group said in a statement: “As symptoms can take up to 14 days to appear following exposure, it is likely the resident would already have been infected.” It also said the home was given advice and support around minimising the risk of Covid-19 spreading in the home. In his final hours, Francis was moved to a nearby hospice, which provided him with the end of life care he needed. Other Pelham House residents were now also falling ill with the virus.   At Blackley, Covid-19 had spread from one end of the building to the other. Staff were worried about 91-year-old Vera, normally seen making her way around the home with her walking frame. “She does look after everybody, mother everybody. And she chats non-stop, so that’s what we like,” says advanced carer, Debra Fielding. But Vera had developed a cough and her temperature was up. Vera Another resident, Michael, was taken to hospital because of his particular underlying medical condition. His daughter, Michelle Phillips, is Blackley’s manager. “He was poorly when he left. When he spotted me in reception, he waved and shouted after me that he loved me. That just made me cry.” At this point, Blackley was only able to test residents or staff with Covid-19 symptoms. To stand a chance of controlling the virus they needed to be able to identify all those who were infected but without symptoms. Phil Benson was on the phone every few days trying to get more tests. “I remember begging ‘Please can one of these people come and just test? Can we not have everyone tested? Surely there’s such a severe outbreak here, it’s in everyone’s interest to be tested?’ “And it was ‘No, the policy is clear. We only test people who’ve got symptoms.’”  Nearly two months after the country locked down, on 15 May, the Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, announced an infection control plan for care homes. It included £600-million ring-fenced to help with increased Covid-19 costs, a named clinician to provide each home with medical support and testing for all care home residents and staff. At the daily briefing, the health secretary said that: “From the start we’ve worked incredibly hard to throw that protective ring around our care homes.” “What protective ring?” asks Pelham House manager Roger Waluube. “We don’t understand what the protective ring could have been or was.”      Everyone in Pelham House could now be tested. All 20 residents and 17 staff were checked. Two days later the test results came back. “The manager was just sat there with his mouth open,” says carer Karen White. “He just pointed at the screen and it was horrific. Every resident apart from two were positive. And 80% of the staff.” Karen White It meant most of the staff had to leave immediately. “They had to down tools,” remembers Roger. “That left us in a very vulnerable position, particularly when the cook has to suddenly stop her cooking and go home. “There’s three or four of us who’ve been on the frontline as such and continually testing negative. We could keep going.” Overall, 19 Pelham House residents tested positive and nearly half those living at the home died. The home normally averages about three deaths a year, but it had nine in just 10 days. “We’re not used to death at this scale. Having to say goodbye to so many people so quickly,” says Roger. Carer Karen was hit hard after the funeral of Peter Baker, a resident with learning difficulties and no family, soon to celebrate his 76th birthday. “He just gently passed away,” she recalls tearfully. “He trusted us to look after him. And he always kept saying ‘Love you girls, I love you girls, I’m so happy here.’ We just let him die. With his learning difficulties he wouldn’t have understood.”  Pelham House was also facing another big problem. By July, it was virus free, but the deaths of half of its residents meant the home had lost 50% of its income. Pelham was rated “good” by the regulator, the Care Quality Commission. Before Covid-19, Roger Waluube had plans to develop and redecorate. Coronavirus changed all that. “We were a very healthy and viable business,” he says. “Now our future is in the balance and the outlook is not good.” Roger Waluube By late June, he estimated they had enough money to last six to eight weeks. With little prospect of new residents moving in, he turned to Kent County Council for help. Since March, the government has given councils £3.7bn to help with the additional pandemic costs. The money is for all services under pressure - including support for children, the homeless and transport services. The Local Government Association, which represents local councils, estimates about 40% of the first £3.2bn received has gone to adult social care, including care homes. So far, Pelham has received about £40,000 in council help. Roger is discussing loans, but he estimates it’ll take at least another £100,000 for the home to survive. Closure would see residents like Doreen having to find a new home. It would be difficult for them all. Residents grow to see this place as their home, says Roger. “Moving people from one care home to another never generally has great results because that adjustment can take its toll on people.”    At Blackley, there was finally some good news. Staff lined up in reception to welcome Michael back. He was in hospital with the virus for two weeks but recovered. As the ambulance crew wheeled him in, his daughter and home manager, Michelle, gave him a big hug. Michelle Phillips “I’m really happy,” she laughs. “A feeling I’ve not had for a while.” Vera also recovered and was able to celebrate her 92nd birthday. In mid-June, she saw her daughter and grandson at a distance. She sat on one of the home’s balconies while they were in the garden. Vera smiles at her daughter and grandson Over six weeks, 16 of the home’s 55 residents had Covid-19 officially - while others had symptoms. Nine died. With the outbreak under control, Phil Benson finished his work at Blackley and went on to help other homes. By early July, Pelham House was also coronavirus-free, but its future remained uncertain. Roger Waluube is crowdfunding to see if he can save the home, but he faces some hard decisions. “I will not get to the point where I’ve got two hours to go, and I’ve run out of cash or I can’t care for people any more,” he says.

The government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the social care sector was “slow, inconsistent and at times negligent” is the damning verdict of MPs on the Public Accounts Committee in theirreport of 29 July. The decision to allow hospital patients in England to be discharged to care homes without tests at the start of the pandemicwas “reckless”, they say. The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care declined to be interviewed by Panorama. In a statement, his department said:“We first published guidance for the social care sector in February and have since announced a raft of measures. Our help has meant almost 60% of England’s care homes have had no outbreak at all.” The government has also promised to bring forward plans for reforming the care system in the near future. It has started cross-party talks on what it describes as a complex issue. Mark Adams, of Community Integrated Care, says that change has to happen soon. “When we look back, we will see this as one of the most mismanaged national challenges we’ve ever faced,” he says. “You can’t have a disconnected health and social care system. It can’t be left to local authorities, whose budgets are being cut, and [who] then have to think about who gets care and who doesn’t.” No government will get everything right in the extreme situation a pandemic presents, but it will be judged on how it protects the most vulnerable.

"The UK saw some of the biggest rises in deaths rates in Europe in the months until the middle of June, official analysis shows. England saw the largest increase in death rates in Europe, with Scotland seeing the third largest increase. TheOffice for National Statistics says,externalthat Spain saw the highest peak in rates of death in Europe. But the UK had the longest period of above-average deaths and so overall saw higher death rates. By 29 May, the death rate in England was 7.5% higher than it has been in recent years.

"Live updates from Addenbrooke's Hospital as it emerges from the post-Covid-19 peak Hospital faces waiting list backlog after coronavirus pandemic The hospital has about 14 patients with Covid-19 and none in critical care 'We're starting to get back into the normal work at the right time' - surgeon Stories from patients and staff at one of the UK's leading hospitals You can share your stories about Addenbrooke's Hospital by using the hashtag #hospitallivebbc on Twitter or by emailing eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk Laurence Cawley, Phil Shepka, Orla Moore and Stuart Bailey So, we've come to the end of our 12 hours of live coverage from Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. We've spent the day meeting patients and staff, hearing how they coped during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic and about their hopes for the future. Thanks for joining us and for sharing your stories. It seems only right we give the last word to one man who's been at the hospital non-stop, throughout the past three-and-a-half challenging months. Ronald Jaffray, 77, arrived in May with a collapsed lung and is still recovering from complications. He said: ""I don't know when I'm going to go home. I can't fault the nursing staff but I miss my little dog. She's a 10-year-old Yorkshire terrier and is living with a friend at the moment. She's my life."" We've heard a lot today about how Addenbrooke's has coped with huge demand for Covid-19 tests, both for patients and staff, throughout the pandemic. A senior boss at Cambridge University Hospitals has hailed the way its staff have worked with the Public Health Laboratory (PHE) and the University of Cambridge to make that happen. Operations manager Brian Warner said a 24/7 rapid Covid test facility was set up ""within days"" for patients arriving in A&E. He said: ""The PHE laboratory in Cambridge increased its testing capacity and vastly reduced its turnaround time to support all the patients within the trust. ""Plus the University of Cambridge, set up a laboratory to manage the testing and repeat testing of all staff on the CUH site. ""A fantastic effort, by many dedicated organisations and the staff within them."" It's been a busy day for Dr Kanwalraj Moar, whowe spoke to earlier. She's the director of women's and children's service and is in charge of the Rosie Maternity Hospital but was back in the operating theatre today. In between surgery on babies with cleft lips, she's been in meetings about the new children's hospital planned for the site. She said: ""It's something really exciting. It'll allow us to put all the care that's spread out, into one place. ""It's a zone designed for children, it's meant for children and is only for them. ""We're the only region in the country that doesn't have that, and we should."" Anxiety about catching Covid-19 has meant many people have put off seeing a doctor about important health issues to avoid going to hospital. That's the fear of Sarah Randall, a deputy head of nursing at Addenbrooke's. She said: ""Some of the evidence suggests people have become poorly at home. There's anxiety for patients not wanting to come to a hospital because of the fear factor around that."" The hospital has sent outreach teams to patients with respiratory problems to check on their wellbeing. Phil ShepkaBBC News Iâve come back to the adjoining Rosie Maternity Hospital. Specifically, birthing room number six. It's full of all the equipment you could need during birth, including a bed, a water bath and a Bluetooth speaker set masquerading as a lava lamp. Expectant mums often have the option of choosing a room leading out to the garden, like this view from birthing room three. You might not expect a hospital to have a senior stylist, but there's been a hair salon in Addenbrooke's for more than 30 years. Like the rest of the staff, Heidi Natijanic is having to get used to doing her job dressed in personal protective equipment. Since it reopened after lockdown on 4 July, Heidi's had a lot of haircut repair work to do. ""We've had a lot of people come in who've tried to dye or cut their hair themselves. Some of the men look like Dr Einstein, it's been quite funny,"" she said. ""We have lots of regular clients from the wards and it's been a great experience to come back and see them all again."" About 7,000 Addenbrooke's staff have been tested for Covid-19 antibodies, which can show whether a person has had the virus. About 8% of those tested positive, including the hospital's director of corporate affairs. Ian Walker said: ""I've been working throughout the period and had no suggestion of even the mildest of Covid symptoms, so it was a real surprise and a shock."" Ian added he had been wearing masks, keeping his distance from others and holding meetings via video calls during that time. He's now taking part in a study looking at whether antibodies offer protection from getting the virus again. This video can not be played About 1,000 Covid-19 tests a day end up in this lab. Even though they're over the peak, senior biomedical scientist Paul Lavender said they're now busy putting plans in place for a possible increase in suspected cases over winter. Healthcare assistant Clare Munday is a familiar face on the wards. Since April, she's put in the steps delivering and collecting test swabs for staff - then preparing them for processing in the labs. She delivers about 150 a day, and today has visited six different areas of the hospital. Staff should get their results in a couple of days. Michael Weekes is an infectious diseases consultant here at Addenbrooke's Hospital and has a laboratory at Cambridge University. There are two streams of staff coming to the pods for testing: those with symptoms, about 30 to 50 a day, and general tests of staff without symptoms, around 250 a day. And he has good news. ""We have had no positive Covid-19 test results here since the beginning of June,"" he said. ""However, we need to keep testing to see if it comes back. It's an early warning system for us."" Tim Machin is waiting for an X-ray after experiencing chest pain during his treatment for leukaemia. ""Outpatients is like a second home, part of my actual normal - as opposed to the new normal,"" he said. ""Wearing masks doesn't seem to be an issue but it is difficult to see full expressions on faces. ""I'd like GPs and hospitals to adopt video conferencing all the time so patients can see their professionals face-to-face, albeit not in the same room."" Kate got in touch to tell us about the treatment her son received at the hospital when he had a brain tumour removed in February. She said: ""We have been back since for MRI scans and eye appointments and each time Addenbrooke's has been amazing. ""Itâs like a different place with the amount of people but the quality remains unchanged."" Meanwhile, Toby wanted to say: ""Shout out to the ambulance cleaners at Addenbrooke's keeping the rate of infections down."" Phil ShepkaBBC News ""Stopping services was easy, restarting them has been the difficult part,"" James Brennan, in imaging tells me. James is head of radiology.  ""When we had to cancel non-essential and routine imaging, tens of thousands of appointments were put on hold,"" he said. ""We were beside ourselves."" Martine Smith has contacted us to say she has been on the waiting list for orthopaedic surgery at Addenbrooke's Hospital since the autum. It follows complications after she broke her femur almost five years ago. Her operation was set for May but had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the meantime, I
continue to take huge amounts of painkillers... and my walking is now almost non-existent,"" she says. ""I havenât had a
nightâs sleep in months because of the pain and still the surgery looks no
closer.  The impact on my day to day life is huge. ""I donât blame the
orthopaedic department - the skill and care is absolutely first class but surely Covid
cases can be isolated in one part of hospital to enable to rest of the
departments to operate as normal. ""This makes no sense to me."" Sue Ross, 58, a medical secretary at Princess of Wales Hospital in Ely, is having her second chemotherapy session. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in June and has felt ""very secure and well looked-after"" at the hospital but missed seeing her two daughters during lockdown. She said: ""It's hard going to an appointment on your own but my husband was allowed to take part in the consultation by speakerphone from a distance, which worked well."" This is what ""telemedicine"" looks like. Little Rowan Walter and his mum Sarah are catching up with the cleft team. The three-year-old was born with a cleft lip and palate, and has been undergoing speech therapy from the age of 18 months. ""Face-to-face is better with something like speech, but this is the best the hospital can offer,"" Sarah told us. ""The support has been brilliant. I'm so grateful to Addenbrooke's and the cleft team for everything they've done."" Hospitals quickly adapted to cope with an influx of Covid-19 patients, but other life-saving treatments have had to continue too. Addenbrooke's Hospital gets about 280 cancer referrals per month but the number of chemotherapy spaces was cut from 40 to 23 to space patients out during the pandemic. Sarah Jefferies, clinical director for cancer, said they ""kept the same capacity going"" by extending treatment hours during the day and opening at weekends. They also reacted quickly to a breast cancer study, which said some patients could be treated safely over a week, rather than three. She said: ""Managing these departments through the pandemic has been my greatest challenge as a doctor. ""We've seen incredible changes and I have been massively impressed by all of my staff from receptionists to consultants."" Dr Liam Brennan is a consultant anaesthetist who also heads up the hospital's PPE procurement. ""This was something we were all unfamiliar with, the experience of managing patients during a pandemic, and making sure we had the right PPE in the right places,"" he said. Masks, like their wearers, come in all shapes and sizes. ""Certain types have to be fitted to their specific staff member - we have to accommodate everyone,"" he said. ""And it's not just protective equipment - it's all the extra things, like ventilators. ""Covid hasn't gone away. But we're ready for it now - we're more resilient."" Daniel Wotherspoon has needed regular check-ups since his kidney and pancreas transplant in November 2018. The 37-year-old said it was ""worrying at first"" to come to hospital while shielding but he quickly got used to it and felt reassured. He said: ""There aren't many people in the waiting rooms because they're spacing out appointments. It seems to be working well. It's making a big difference."" It was a baptism of fire for nurse Sarah Thurston, who started her new job in outpatients as the covronavirus pandemic took hold. She said: ""We are quite a resilient lot anyway and we're used to adapting to change. ""But it's the first time in our careers when we've had to think about ourselves and our own safety, rather than just thinking about our patients."" She previously worked as a surgery nurse and had to get used to a new role and a new team while dealing with changes brought in because of Covid-19. ""I felt safe, we had enough protective equipment and procedures in place to isolate covid patients. But it's been a rollercoaster of emotions,"" she said. Â© 2025 BBC.

She said the decision would be reviewed in three weeks to see if the date could be brought forward to late August. Gyms in England reopened last weekend, and Scottish owners havevoiced concernsabout the impact of their continued closure. Ms Sturgeon said the 14 September date was indicative at this stage. ""I absolutely understand and share the desire to see these facilities open as quickly as possible,"" she said. Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter As we reported earlier, US President Donald Trump has suggested postponing November's presidential election.He has claimed that increased postal voting because of the coronavirus pandemic could lead to fraudand inaccurate results. There is little evidence that this would be the case - but does he have the power to delay it? The short answer is no. It would take an act of Congress - approved by majorities in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate - to change the date of the election. And the prospect of a bipartisan legislative consensus signing off on any delay is unlikely in the extreme. What's more, even if the voting day were changed, the US Constitution mandates that a presidential administration only last four years. In other words, Donald Trump's first term will expire at noon on 20 January 2021 one way or another. Read more analysis here. The leader of the UN's health body also warned young people against complacency The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the world must ""learn to live"" with the coronavirus. Speaking at a daily press briefing, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""We must all learn to live with the virus and to take the steps necessary to live our lives, while protecting ourselves and others."" He also praised the measures that were put in place forthe annual Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabiaon Wednesday. ""This is a powerful demonstration of the kinds of measures that countries can and must take to adapt to the new normal,"" he said. Dr Tedros also warned against complaceny among young people. ""We have said it before and weâll say it again: Young people are not invincible,"" he said. ""Young people can be infected; young people can die; and young people can transmit the virus to others. ""Thatâs why young people must take the same precautions to protect themselves and protect others as everyone else,"" he added. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News We could find out if the vaccine designed by the University of Oxford is effective in October. AstraZeneca, which is aiming to manufacture two billion doses by the end of next year, said the results of trials in the UK, US, Brazil and South Africa should be known by then. The company told BBC Newscast they are âhoping the immune response will last for at least 12 months, but hopefully closer to 24 or longerâ. If protection waned after a year, it would mean an annual jab would be needed like the winter flu vaccine. Early trials of the coronavirus vaccine show it can train the immune system, but it is unknown whether this is enough to offer protection. Data from those trials suggested two doses gave a stronger response than one and AstraZeneca said that looked like âthe most effective doseâ. However, there is still uncertainty about how long protection lasts and how effective it is in older age groups, who are most at risk of the disease. You can listen to Newscast here.  The government has yet to say whether it will lift or extend local lockdown restrictions in Leicester. The city's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, said he and local officials ""haven't got a clue what's going on"", complaining they have been ""messed about all day"". He claimed No 10 had indicated they were going to make the announcement ""much earlier in the day"" but now he understands ""they're not even going to discuss it until 6pm"". Sir Peter added that he was ""incredibly frustrated"" on behalf of the people of Leicester, particularly businesses who have been ""struggling"" due to an ""extra four weeks"" of lockdown. Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed that businesses in Leicester would getÂ£3m of government funding to help with the financial impact of the local lockdown. The city and some surrounding areas were put under the UK's first local lockdown on 29 June after a spike in Covid-19 cases there, though some restrictions were lifted on 24 July. The app for tracking and tracing coronavirus in Northern Ireland has been released for download from Apple's App Store and on Google Play. StopCOVID NI has several features for logging the details of those experiencing symptoms of the virus. It will supplement the phone-based contact tracing programme that is already in place, and identify those at risk of infection. Northern Ireland is thefirst part of the UK to have a contact tracing app. Within an hour of its release, hundreds of people had installed it on their mobile phones. Read more here. The app automatically contacts anyone at risk of infection The reopening of pubs, restaurants and cafes indoors in Wales has been confirmed for the start of next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford isexpected to
announce the next steps in easing the country's coronavirus restrictions on
Friday. Hospitality businesses have already been allowed to open outdoors in Wales, and indoors in other parts of the UK. They have been shut since the middle of March, just before the country went into lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon has been rebuked by the UK statistics watchdog over her repeated claim that coronavirus rates in England are five times higher than Scotland. The Office for Statistics Regulation said it had initially been ""difficult"" to identify the evidence for the Scottish first minister's claim. It said the sources later cited by the Scottish government ""do not allow for a meaningful comparison to be made"". The Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon had been caught using ""dodgy statistics"". But the first minister insisted evidence suggested ""the prevalence of the virus is significantly lower in Scotland right now than in England"" and accused the Tories of being blinded"" by ""bitter, partisan politics"".

A popular San Diego gym that was operating in violation of the countyâs public health order last week has been confirmed as an outbreak hotspot. At least three cases have now been linked to The Gym in Pacific Beach, officials say. The Gym continue to operate last week, despite being given orders to shut down, according to San Diego media. It has since closed. On Wednesday, officials reported 498 new cases in San Diego, raising the total infections there to over 28,000. There have also been 547 deaths. A member of staff wears a mask as he waits for customers at the reopening of The Old Stables Restaurant in Liverpool Roughly one in three
furloughed workers
in the UK had returned to their jobs in the first two weeks of July,
according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS survey also revealed differences between business sectors, with
more than 90% of water
treatment or IT staff working, but only
around half of employees in hotels,
restaurants and entertainment venues. However, businesses such as hotels
and restaurants, which only came out of lockdown on 4 July, have seen the
biggest increase in the proportion of staff returning to work. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The 2020 season for the Chinese
Super League, Chinaâs Premier League-equivalent, began earlier this week, on 25
July. But many sporting events are still
banning spectators, meaning that some football fans in the eastern city of
Kunshan were forced to find a creative way to watch their favourite players, without entering
the stadium. Images have gone viral showing
fans cheering and holding banners from windows at a hotel overlooking the
Kunshan Stadium, at a 27 July
match in the city between the Shanghai SIPG and Tianjin Teda teams. Many on the popular Sina Weibo
social media platform have applauded the commitment fans made, paying around
450 yuan (Â£49; $64) to see their favourite teams â technically without breaking
the rules. However, there are hints the
authorities arenât best pleased about this, and hotel staff have told Pear
Video that these âfootball viewing roomsâ may not be available in future. Herman Cain made a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 Herman Cain, the Republican former pizza chain CEO who ran for US president in 2012, has died after testing positive for Covid-19.Cain, who more recently hosted radio and TV programmes, was admitted to hospital on 1 July. âHerman Cain - our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us â has passed away,âa statement on his website,externalsaid. ""We knew when he was first hospitalised... that this was going to be a rough fight,"" it added. His social media accounts had been providing regular updates on his condition. On 7 July, a post from his Twitter account said âdoctors are trying to make sure his oxygen levels are right"". ""This is a tough virus,"" it said. ""Please continue praying."" Cain ran for office in 2012 after a stint as CEO of Godfatherâs Pizza. He is often remembered for his 9-9-9 tax reform plan. In 2019, US President Donald Trump asked him to sit on the Federal Reserve Board, but he withdrew his nomination after several Republican senators refused to back his appointment Our colleagues in Cambridge are reporting from Addenbrooke's Hospital today as it emerges from a post-coronavirus peak. They have stories from patients and staff at one of the UK's leading hospitals. Deputy matron Nicola Cundell says it's been ""pretty full on"" and staff are ""exhausted"". ""Normally patients have someone with them, a relative to sit with them and hold their hand, so we've had to be a little bit of everything,"" she said. You can read more from Addenbrooke's and follow the team's live updates here. The US state of New Jersey, which has suffered the highest rate of Covid-19 deaths behind bars in the US, appears set to release around 20% of its prison population in an effort to reduce transmission rates among prisoners and guards. The bill that New Jersey senators are voting on today may release 3,000 inmates who are within one year of finishing their sentence. The American Civil Rights Union has called it the first of its kind legislation in the nation. The bill's authors contend that the governor has bungled the response in prison outbreaks, allowing thousands of infections and at least 50 deaths, while given early release to fewer than 300 inmates since March. In comes as other officials around the US order prisons populations reduced in an effort to halt the virus' spread. Can this California prison save itself from Covid-19? A further 12 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospitals in England, NHS England says. The patients were
aged between 40 and 96 years old and all had known underlying health conditions. Wales recorded another two deaths. There were no coronavirus deaths recorded in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Separate UK-wide figures, which include deaths in all settings, will be released later. A top US health official has said there is no evidence to suggest that wearing a mask can cause a person to catch Covid-19, after an infected lawmaker blamed his mask for his positive test. US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn's advice to wear a mask comes after a Texas congressman who tested positive yesterday suggested that his mask was to blame. Republican Louie Gohmert mused during an interview after he was barred from travelling with President Trump ""if my keeping a mask on and keeping it in place, that if I might have put some germs or some of the virus onto the mask and breathed it in"". In fact, it's the complete opposite - wearing a mask helps prevent transmission of the virus.The false notion that masks cause infections was popularised by an online video called ""Plandemic"",which is filled with medical misinformation about where the virus came from and how it is transmitted. In an interview with NBC on Thursday, Dr Hahn said there is no ""medical evidence that that's the case"". ""What our data show is that people should wear masks, particularly when they can't socially distance. And they should follow their local ordinances with respect to masks."" The US has seen increased demand for food banks The US economy has shrunk by a 32.9% annual rate in the April-to-June quarter in the wake of cutbacks in spending during the pandemic. It was the deepest decline since the government began keeping records in 1947 and three times more severe than the prior record of 10% set in 1958. Reduced spending on healthcare and consumer goods drove the fall. Also on Thursday, Germany reported a record quarterly decline of 10.1%, while Mexico's economy also reported a double digit contraction. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that global growth will fall by 4.9% this year. Read more from our business team here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"People who test positive for coronavirus or show symptoms in the UK must now self-isolate for at least 10 days, rather than seven. The change,announced by the UK's chief medical officers,external, comes as ministers try to avoid a resurgence of the virus. Until now, those showing key symptoms - a new continuous cough, a temperature or loss of taste or smell - have had to self-isolate for at least a week. The new advice is in line with World Health Organization guidance. The chief medical officers said the change is ""particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission"". Evidence shows that people with Covid-19 have ""a low but real possibility of infectiousness"" between seven and nine days after falling ill, they said. People are most contagious just before they first display symptoms and for the first few days afterwards. But scientists say evidence that they could pass it on up to nine days later has ""strengthened"". Advice on the length of isolation varies between countries. For example,the Irish Republic,externalsays those who have symptoms should isolate for 14 days, while inthe US,externalthose with symptoms are told to isolate for 10 days and can only leave isolation if they have had at least 24 hours without a fever. It comes after the prime minister warned ofsigns of a ""second wave"" of the pandemic in parts of Europe. Speaking on BBC Breakfast before the announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wanted to ""take a precautionary approach"" and ""protect people from that wave reaching our shores"". Frank Atherton, chief medical officer for Wales, said the change was ""vital"" and ""nobody should be under the illusion that coronavirus has gone away"". England death rate among worst in Europe What's the evidence Europe is having a 'second wave'? UK signs deal for 60 million virus vaccine doses The government has also confirmed that registered health and care professionals travelling to the UK from high-risk countries will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. An quarantine exemption for health professionals had been in place since June. There have also been concerns about several local outbreaks across the UK, including inOldham,WrexhamandStaffordshire. Meanwhile, the government is expected on Friday to announce a decision on whether to ease restrictions in Leicester, a month after the citywas put into extended lockdownfollowing a spike in cases. The mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, expressed frustration at the delayed decision, originally expected on Thursday. ""We haven't got a clue what's going on, we really haven't,"" he said. Two or three weeks ago the message from the prime minister was that, hopefully, we would be back to near-normality by Christmas. The direction of travel was one of lockdown easing, with pubs and restaurants reopening, as well as a feeling that we seemed to be getting through it. Now, there's a real sense of the brakes beginning to go on. We saw it with the quick quarantine measures imposed on people returning from Spain. Luxembourg may well have similar restrictions soon and they're keeping an eye on Belgium too. We had restrictions imposed in Oldham to curb the virus there and now there's been an extension of the self-isolation period. The real apprehension is that what is happening in the rest of Europe may, in time, happen here. To some extent, that has been the story of coronavirus: we have tended to follow what has emerged in mainland Europe. Official figures published on Thursday showed that 43,119 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in England had their cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace since its launch in May. The tracing system successfully contacted just over 77% of these - but just over 23% were not reached. The figures, from the Department of Health and Social Care, also showed that of 222,589 people identified as close contacts of those who tested positive, 83% had been reached and asked to self-isolate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge - that by the end of June everyone tested in person would receive results within 24 hours - is still not being met, with about three-quarters (76.4%) of people getting results on time in the week up to July 22. For those using home testing kits, 76.9% received results within 48 hours. But the government is concerned that some people are not coming forward for testing, hampering its ability to track outbreaks, because they wrongly think they have to pay for it or that they are not eligible. The UK requirement for people who test positive or show symptoms to isolate for seven days was always on the low side - plenty of other countries require 10 days or even longer. As coronavirus is new, there is still a lack of certainty over how long someone remains infectious, which is why there are a variety of approaches. UK health officials say there is enough evidence now to point to a ""low, but tangible"" risk of transmission from seven to 10 days, even for those with mild to moderate illness. This is a decision that could have been taken weeks, even months, ago in truth. But officials are describing it as a ""value judgement"" based on a variety of reasons. For one thing the easing of restrictions means we have more social contacts than we did previously - so even with the low risk of transmission post seven days, the chances of passing it on increases. The availability of widespread testing also means only those with a positively confirmed infection need to continue isolating - earlier in the pandemic the lack of testing meant a blanket approach had to be taken so anyone with symptoms was asked to isolate. But it is about sending an important signal too. Levels of infection are low, but the message is clear: we can't be complacent. The government is launching a TV and online advertising campaign on Thursday night stressing that anyone with symptoms should get tested, which is free and available to all. Only about a third of people infected are thought to come forward for tests, although some of the untested cases may be people who do not have any symptoms. Those in a household with anyone who tests positive or shows symptoms are told to self-isolate for 14 days. And people returning to the UK from certain countries are also being asked to quarantine for 14 days -a move that has sparked complaints from travel firms. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? Ministers are also looking for a way to reduce the current 14-day quarantine period for arrivals to the UK, meaning that quarantine and self-isolation time periods could be standardised at 10 days. Mr Hancock told Today that the government is looking at using testing to reduce the length of the quarantine period - but there would be no imminent changes. On Thursday evening, Luxembourg was removed from the quarantine-free list, meaning people arriving in the UK from the small land-locked country from midnight will need to self-isolate for two weeks. A senior government source told the BBC that Belgium would stay off the list - for the moment - but case numbers would continue to be monitored. Leading travel and airline industry figures called on Wednesday forcoronavirus testing at airportsin the UK but the source said that ""any new system had to be workable and at the moment it isn't"". Mr Hancock told Breakfast that the ""big scientific challenge"" with testing arrivals at the border is that people ""can incubate this disease for many days without displaying any symptoms, and that wouldn't show up in a test"". Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it. Anyone who has either tested positive for coronavirus or shown symptoms should isolate themselves for at least 10 days, and those who show symptoms should arrange to get tested. Symptoms include: a new continuous cough a high temperature a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell They should continue to self-isolate if they still feel unwell after that initial period. Other members of their household should isolate for 14 days and not leave their homes. If you test positive you will be contacted by contact tracers, who will establish who else you might have passed on the infection to. Anybody they deem to be at risk will have to isolate themselves for 14 days from the point of contact.

The change,announced by the UK's chief medical officers,external, comes as ministers try to avoid a resurgence of the virus. Until now, those showing key symptoms - a new continuous cough, a temperature or loss of taste or smell - have had to self-isolate for at least a week. The new advice is in line with World Health Organization guidance. The chief medical officers said the change is ""particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission"". Evidence shows that people with Covid-19 have ""a low but real possibility of infectiousness"" between seven and nine days after falling ill, they said. People are most contagious just before they first display symptoms and for the first few days afterwards. But scientists say evidence that they could pass it on up to nine days later has ""strengthened"". Advice on the length of isolation varies between countries. For example,the Irish Republic,externalsays those who have symptoms should isolate for 14 days, while inthe US,externalthose with symptoms are told to isolate for 10 days and can only leave isolation if they have had at least 24 hours without a fever. It comes after the prime minister warned ofsigns of a ""second wave"" of the pandemic in parts of Europe. Speaking on BBC Breakfast before the announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wanted to ""take a precautionary approach"" and ""protect people from that wave reaching our shores"". Frank Atherton, chief medical officer for Wales, said the change was ""vital"" and ""nobody should be under the illusion that coronavirus has gone away"". England death rate among worst in Europe What's the evidence Europe is having a 'second wave'? UK signs deal for 60 million virus vaccine doses The government has also confirmed that registered health and care professionals travelling to the UK from high-risk countries will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. An quarantine exemption for health professionals had been in place since June. There have also been concerns about several local outbreaks across the UK, including inOldham,WrexhamandStaffordshire. Meanwhile, the government is expected on Friday to announce a decision on whether to ease restrictions in Leicester, a month after the citywas put into extended lockdownfollowing a spike in cases. The mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, expressed frustration at the delayed decision, originally expected on Thursday. ""We haven't got a clue what's going on, we really haven't,"" he said. Two or three weeks ago the message from the prime minister was that, hopefully, we would be back to near-normality by Christmas. The direction of travel was one of lockdown easing, with pubs and restaurants reopening, as well as a feeling that we seemed to be getting through it. Now, there's a real sense of the brakes beginning to go on. We saw it with the quick quarantine measures imposed on people returning from Spain. Luxembourg may well have similar restrictions soon and they're keeping an eye on Belgium too. We had restrictions imposed in Oldham to curb the virus there and now there's been an extension of the self-isolation period. The real apprehension is that what is happening in the rest of Europe may, in time, happen here. To some extent, that has been the story of coronavirus: we have tended to follow what has emerged in mainland Europe. Official figures published on Thursday showed that 43,119 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in England had their cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace since its launch in May. The tracing system successfully contacted just over 77% of these - but just over 23% were not reached. The figures, from the Department of Health and Social Care, also showed that of 222,589 people identified as close contacts of those who tested positive, 83% had been reached and asked to self-isolate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge - that by the end of June everyone tested in person would receive results within 24 hours - is still not being met, with about three-quarters (76.4%) of people getting results on time in the week up to July 22. For those using home testing kits, 76.9% received results within 48 hours. But the government is concerned that some people are not coming forward for testing, hampering its ability to track outbreaks, because they wrongly think they have to pay for it or that they are not eligible. The UK requirement for people who test positive or show symptoms to isolate for seven days was always on the low side - plenty of other countries require 10 days or even longer. As coronavirus is new, there is still a lack of certainty over how long someone remains infectious, which is why there are a variety of approaches. UK health officials say there is enough evidence now to point to a ""low, but tangible"" risk of transmission from seven to 10 days, even for those with mild to moderate illness. This is a decision that could have been taken weeks, even months, ago in truth. But officials are describing it as a ""value judgement"" based on a variety of reasons. For one thing the easing of restrictions means we have more social contacts than we did previously - so even with the low risk of transmission post seven days, the chances of passing it on increases. The availability of widespread testing also means only those with a positively confirmed infection need to continue isolating - earlier in the pandemic the lack of testing meant a blanket approach had to be taken so anyone with symptoms was asked to isolate. But it is about sending an important signal too. Levels of infection are low, but the message is clear: we can't be complacent. The government is launching a TV and online advertising campaign on Thursday night stressing that anyone with symptoms should get tested, which is free and available to all. Only about a third of people infected are thought to come forward for tests, although some of the untested cases may be people who do not have any symptoms. Those in a household with anyone who tests positive or shows symptoms are told to self-isolate for 14 days. And people returning to the UK from certain countries are also being asked to quarantine for 14 days -a move that has sparked complaints from travel firms. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? Ministers are also looking for a way to reduce the current 14-day quarantine period for arrivals to the UK, meaning that quarantine and self-isolation time periods could be standardised at 10 days. Mr Hancock told Today that the government is looking at using testing to reduce the length of the quarantine period - but there would be no imminent changes. On Thursday evening, Luxembourg was removed from the quarantine-free list, meaning people arriving in the UK from the small land-locked country from midnight will need to self-isolate for two weeks. A senior government source told the BBC that Belgium would stay off the list - for the moment - but case numbers would continue to be monitored. Leading travel and airline industry figures called on Wednesday forcoronavirus testing at airportsin the UK but the source said that ""any new system had to be workable and at the moment it isn't"". Mr Hancock told Breakfast that the ""big scientific challenge"" with testing arrivals at the border is that people ""can incubate this disease for many days without displaying any symptoms, and that wouldn't show up in a test"". Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it. Anyone who has either tested positive for coronavirus or shown symptoms should isolate themselves for at least 10 days, and those who show symptoms should arrange to get tested. Symptoms include: a new continuous cough a high temperature a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell They should continue to self-isolate if they still feel unwell after that initial period. Other members of their household should isolate for 14 days and not leave their homes. If you test positive you will be contacted by contact tracers, who will establish who else you might have passed on the infection to. Anybody they deem to be at risk will have to isolate themselves for 14 days from the point of contact.

"The pharmacy in John Wood Street is one of two businesses linked to the cluster A further two people have tested positive for Covid-19 as part of a cluster of cases in the Inverclyde area. The total number of positive cases involved is now 13, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday. Amazon has confirmed that a member of staff, based at a warehouse in Gourock, is in quarantine. An M&D Green Pharmacy in Port Glasgow is also linked. Some individuals visited a number of businesses in the Greater Glasgow area. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) said they may have been infectious at the time. Pharmacy linked to Inverclyde Covid-19 cluster Scotland's virus death 'capital' calls for support The businesses included The Botany bar and restaurant in Glasgow, and Sweeney's Cruises in West Dunbartonshire, both on Sunday. Individuals also visited The Queen of the Loch by Marston's Inn in Balloch and Lomond Woods Holiday Park on the weekend of 24 July. All the businesses linked to the outbreak are continuing to operate, and the health board has previously said the cases were only experiencing mild symptoms. In a statement on Facebook, Sweeney's Cruises said they were visited by council health officials and had been ""given the green light to carry on with our daily cruises"". Queen Of The Loch and Marston's Inn said on Facebook that it had ""enhanced cleaning procedures in place"", had undergone a ""full deep clean"" and was co-operating with the local authority. None of the cases linked to the pharmacy are currently working there and customers have been told it is safe to keep using its facilities. Dr Daniel Carter, consultant in public health medicine and chairman of the incident management team dealing with the cluster, said: ""All those who have tested positive for Covid-19 are self-isolating and we are working with a number of businesses including a local pharmacy to trace any close contacts. ""We would like to take this opportunity to remind local residents of the importance of continuing with the general measures to minimise the risk of Covid-19 to themselves and to others."" Ms Sturgeon has previously thanked the businesses concerned for ""acting swiftly, and for fully cooperating with the guidance and procedures to contain this cluster"". Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe said news of the local cluster was ""soul-destroying"" in an area which has already been one of the worst-hit by coronavirus in Scotland. ""There has been a lot of anxiety, rightly, in the community over the last few months,"" he said. ""We saw some light at the end of the tunnel with the number of deaths reducing - in the previous three weeks we didn't have any - and now this has come back. ""But there is a degree of reassurance that the effective systems are in place and hopefully we can contain the virus."" Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe said he was hopeful the virus could be contained Mr McCabe also said he hoped track and trace measures could help avoid a local lockdown. He said: ""Obviously, if the outbreak can't be contained, there are potential consequences. ""We have seen in Dumfries and Galloway and parts of England that major outbreaks do lead potentially to local lockdowns and I hope we can avoid that situation."" Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday that the pharmacy in Port Glasgow was still open but that locals should not be concerned about using services. He said: ""We've been in touch with the pharmacy and we're very, very comfortable with how the pharmacy has behaved both up to this point and yesterday. ""People should not be scared to use pharmacies in the area."" He added that the option of a local lockdown to control the Inverclyde cluster was being kept ""in reserve"" and would be used if necessary. ""If we thought this virus had gone into community transmission mode, like we saw in early and late March, then we would of course do something more dramatic,"" he said. M&D Green managing director Martin Green said ""some staff"" at its John Wood Street branch had tested positive for Covid-19. He said: ""We have been working with Health Protection Scotland and environmental health officers, who are satisfied with the infection control measures we have in place and have immediately implemented the minor additional actions recommended."" Mr Green added: ""We have been reassured by the local outbreak management team that these measures allow us to continue to provide the full range of pharmaceutical services without any risk to the public.""

"Live updates from Addenbrooke's Hospital as it emerges from the post-Covid-19 peak Hospital faces waiting list backlog after coronavirus pandemic The hospital has about 14 patients with Covid-19 and none in critical care 'We're starting to get back into the normal work at the right time' - surgeon Stories from patients and staff at one of the UK's leading hospitals You can share your stories about Addenbrooke's Hospital by using the hashtag #hospitallivebbc on Twitter or by emailing eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk Laurence Cawley, Phil Shepka, Orla Moore and Stuart Bailey So, we've come to the end of our 12 hours of live coverage from Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. We've spent the day meeting patients and staff, hearing how they coped during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic and about their hopes for the future. Thanks for joining us and for sharing your stories. It seems only right we give the last word to one man who's been at the hospital non-stop, throughout the past three-and-a-half challenging months. Ronald Jaffray, 77, arrived in May with a collapsed lung and is still recovering from complications. He said: ""I don't know when I'm going to go home. I can't fault the nursing staff but I miss my little dog. She's a 10-year-old Yorkshire terrier and is living with a friend at the moment. She's my life."" We've heard a lot today about how Addenbrooke's has coped with huge demand for Covid-19 tests, both for patients and staff, throughout the pandemic. A senior boss at Cambridge University Hospitals has hailed the way its staff have worked with the Public Health Laboratory (PHE) and the University of Cambridge to make that happen. Operations manager Brian Warner said a 24/7 rapid Covid test facility was set up ""within days"" for patients arriving in A&E. He said: ""The PHE laboratory in Cambridge increased its testing capacity and vastly reduced its turnaround time to support all the patients within the trust. ""Plus the University of Cambridge, set up a laboratory to manage the testing and repeat testing of all staff on the CUH site. ""A fantastic effort, by many dedicated organisations and the staff within them."" It's been a busy day for Dr Kanwalraj Moar, whowe spoke to earlier. She's the director of women's and children's service and is in charge of the Rosie Maternity Hospital but was back in the operating theatre today. In between surgery on babies with cleft lips, she's been in meetings about the new children's hospital planned for the site. She said: ""It's something really exciting. It'll allow us to put all the care that's spread out, into one place. ""It's a zone designed for children, it's meant for children and is only for them. ""We're the only region in the country that doesn't have that, and we should."" Anxiety about catching Covid-19 has meant many people have put off seeing a doctor about important health issues to avoid going to hospital. That's the fear of Sarah Randall, a deputy head of nursing at Addenbrooke's. She said: ""Some of the evidence suggests people have become poorly at home. There's anxiety for patients not wanting to come to a hospital because of the fear factor around that."" The hospital has sent outreach teams to patients with respiratory problems to check on their wellbeing. Phil ShepkaBBC News Iâve come back to the adjoining Rosie Maternity Hospital. Specifically, birthing room number six. It's full of all the equipment you could need during birth, including a bed, a water bath and a Bluetooth speaker set masquerading as a lava lamp. Expectant mums often have the option of choosing a room leading out to the garden, like this view from birthing room three. You might not expect a hospital to have a senior stylist, but there's been a hair salon in Addenbrooke's for more than 30 years. Like the rest of the staff, Heidi Natijanic is having to get used to doing her job dressed in personal protective equipment. Since it reopened after lockdown on 4 July, Heidi's had a lot of haircut repair work to do. ""We've had a lot of people come in who've tried to dye or cut their hair themselves. Some of the men look like Dr Einstein, it's been quite funny,"" she said. ""We have lots of regular clients from the wards and it's been a great experience to come back and see them all again."" About 7,000 Addenbrooke's staff have been tested for Covid-19 antibodies, which can show whether a person has had the virus. About 8% of those tested positive, including the hospital's director of corporate affairs. Ian Walker said: ""I've been working throughout the period and had no suggestion of even the mildest of Covid symptoms, so it was a real surprise and a shock."" Ian added he had been wearing masks, keeping his distance from others and holding meetings via video calls during that time. He's now taking part in a study looking at whether antibodies offer protection from getting the virus again. This video can not be played About 1,000 Covid-19 tests a day end up in this lab. Even though they're over the peak, senior biomedical scientist Paul Lavender said they're now busy putting plans in place for a possible increase in suspected cases over winter. Healthcare assistant Clare Munday is a familiar face on the wards. Since April, she's put in the steps delivering and collecting test swabs for staff - then preparing them for processing in the labs. She delivers about 150 a day, and today has visited six different areas of the hospital. Staff should get their results in a couple of days. Michael Weekes is an infectious diseases consultant here at Addenbrooke's Hospital and has a laboratory at Cambridge University. There are two streams of staff coming to the pods for testing: those with symptoms, about 30 to 50 a day, and general tests of staff without symptoms, around 250 a day. And he has good news. ""We have had no positive Covid-19 test results here since the beginning of June,"" he said. ""However, we need to keep testing to see if it comes back. It's an early warning system for us."" Tim Machin is waiting for an X-ray after experiencing chest pain during his treatment for leukaemia. ""Outpatients is like a second home, part of my actual normal - as opposed to the new normal,"" he said. ""Wearing masks doesn't seem to be an issue but it is difficult to see full expressions on faces. ""I'd like GPs and hospitals to adopt video conferencing all the time so patients can see their professionals face-to-face, albeit not in the same room."" Kate got in touch to tell us about the treatment her son received at the hospital when he had a brain tumour removed in February. She said: ""We have been back since for MRI scans and eye appointments and each time Addenbrooke's has been amazing. ""Itâs like a different place with the amount of people but the quality remains unchanged."" Meanwhile, Toby wanted to say: ""Shout out to the ambulance cleaners at Addenbrooke's keeping the rate of infections down."" Phil ShepkaBBC News ""Stopping services was easy, restarting them has been the difficult part,"" James Brennan, in imaging tells me. James is head of radiology.  ""When we had to cancel non-essential and routine imaging, tens of thousands of appointments were put on hold,"" he said. ""We were beside ourselves."" Martine Smith has contacted us to say she has been on the waiting list for orthopaedic surgery at Addenbrooke's Hospital since the autum. It follows complications after she broke her femur almost five years ago. Her operation was set for May but had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the meantime, I
continue to take huge amounts of painkillers... and my walking is now almost non-existent,"" she says. ""I havenât had a
nightâs sleep in months because of the pain and still the surgery looks no
closer.  The impact on my day to day life is huge. ""I donât blame the
orthopaedic department - the skill and care is absolutely first class but surely Covid
cases can be isolated in one part of hospital to enable to rest of the
departments to operate as normal. ""This makes no sense to me."" Sue Ross, 58, a medical secretary at Princess of Wales Hospital in Ely, is having her second chemotherapy session. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in June and has felt ""very secure and well looked-after"" at the hospital but missed seeing her two daughters during lockdown. She said: ""It's hard going to an appointment on your own but my husband was allowed to take part in the consultation by speakerphone from a distance, which worked well."" This is what ""telemedicine"" looks like. Little Rowan Walter and his mum Sarah are catching up with the cleft team. The three-year-old was born with a cleft lip and palate, and has been undergoing speech therapy from the age of 18 months. ""Face-to-face is better with something like speech, but this is the best the hospital can offer,"" Sarah told us. ""The support has been brilliant. I'm so grateful to Addenbrooke's and the cleft team for everything they've done."" Hospitals quickly adapted to cope with an influx of Covid-19 patients, but other life-saving treatments have had to continue too. Addenbrooke's Hospital gets about 280 cancer referrals per month but the number of chemotherapy spaces was cut from 40 to 23 to space patients out during the pandemic. Sarah Jefferies, clinical director for cancer, said they ""kept the same capacity going"" by extending treatment hours during the day and opening at weekends. They also reacted quickly to a breast cancer study, which said some patients could be treated safely over a week, rather than three. She said: ""Managing these departments through the pandemic has been my greatest challenge as a doctor. ""We've seen incredible changes and I have been massively impressed by all of my staff from receptionists to consultants."" Dr Liam Brennan is a consultant anaesthetist who also heads up the hospital's PPE procurement. ""This was something we were all unfamiliar with, the experience of managing patients during a pandemic, and making sure we had the right PPE in the right places,"" he said. Masks, like their wearers, come in all shapes and sizes. ""Certain types have to be fitted to their specific staff member - we have to accommodate everyone,"" he said. ""And it's not just protective equipment - it's all the extra things, like ventilators. ""Covid hasn't gone away. But we're ready for it now - we're more resilient."" Daniel Wotherspoon has needed regular check-ups since his kidney and pancreas transplant in November 2018. The 37-year-old said it was ""worrying at first"" to come to hospital while shielding but he quickly got used to it and felt reassured. He said: ""There aren't many people in the waiting rooms because they're spacing out appointments. It seems to be working well. It's making a big difference."" It was a baptism of fire for nurse Sarah Thurston, who started her new job in outpatients as the covronavirus pandemic took hold. She said: ""We are quite a resilient lot anyway and we're used to adapting to change. ""But it's the first time in our careers when we've had to think about ourselves and our own safety, rather than just thinking about our patients."" She previously worked as a surgery nurse and had to get used to a new role and a new team while dealing with changes brought in because of Covid-19. ""I felt safe, we had enough protective equipment and procedures in place to isolate covid patients. But it's been a rollercoaster of emotions,"" she said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Domino's Pizza has dropped a promotion offering free pizza to women named Karen after it was met with a backlash. In recent years, the name ""Karen"" has been used as an insult to describe white middle-aged women who are perceived to be obnoxious or racist. The pizza franchise's New Zealand arm initially said it wanted to give ""nice Karens"" a break from negativity. But some said it was tone-deaf, ignored more important issues, and ""rewarded privilege"". A giveaway, titled ""Calling all (nice) Karens"" was posted on the pizza chain's Australian and New Zealand pages. It asked those named Karen to tell Domino's in 250 words how they were one of the ""nice ones"". ""The name 'Karen' has become synonymous with anyone who is entitled, selfish and likes to complain,"" Domino's chief marketing officer in the region, Allan Collins, said while introducing the offer. ""What used to be a light-hearted meme has become quite the insult to anyone actually named Karen. ""Well, today we're taking the name Karen back. At Domino's, we're all about bringing people together and we want to celebrate all the great Karens out there by shouting them a free pizza!"" The offer was immediately criticised, with many arguing ""Karen negativity"" was an issue that affected mostly ""privileged white women"". ""Most of the time Karens are entitled privileged white women. If a few people actually called Karen can't handle the meme they should try handling 400 years of oppression,"" said one user on Twitter. ""When you wanna reward more privilege to the most privileged in our society,"" another said. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Others asked the company to find more worthwhile causes, like giving to ""people who actually need it... like [those] who are homeless and have no food security"". Even before the offer, the term ""Karen"" has proved controversial online. Many have argued using the name as an insult is itself racist and misogynistic. Domino's New Zealand quickly apologised for the offer on Facebook. It said it merely ""wanted to bring a smile to customers who are doing the right thing - Karen the nurse, Karen the teacher, Karen the mum"".

"The Trade Bill provides a framework for the UK government's post-Brexit trade policy The Welsh Government's approach to agreeing post-Brexit legislation with the UK government is ""high-risk and flawed"", a report has said. The Senedd's constitution committee is worried the Trade Bill currently going through Parliament in Westminster could ""override"" devolution. Its chairman, Mick Antoniw, said he was ""alarmed"" that a Welsh minister had not raised concerns with UK counterparts. The Welsh Government said it would respond to the report ""in due course"". The UK government's Trade Bill provides a framework for the UK's post-Brexit trade policy, but because it covers some devolved areas the Senedd will be asked to give its consent to the legislation. Mr Antoniw called on the Welsh Government ""to stand firm"" and demand changes to the draft legislation. UK-EU trade deal some way off, both sides say What's happening in post-Brexit trade talks? UK-EU trade talks will be tricky from the outset The legislation, justice and constitution committee said it was ""not content"" that the Welsh Government has been prepared to accept non-binding assurances from UK ministers rather than commitments in law. Its report said the bill would have ""significant and potentially long-term implications for key sectors in Wales, including agriculture, fisheries, health and manufacturing"". ""We acknowledge that the negotiation of UK-wide trade agreements remains a power reserved to the UK government,"" it said. ""However, the Welsh Government will be responsible for implementing those trade agreements in devolved areas in Wales, and we do not believe that non-binding intergovernmental agreements are an effective way to safeguard Welsh interests. ""In our view, this is a high-risk and flawed approach."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The committee wrote to the International Relations Minister Eluned Morgan to ask her what representations she made in response to concerns previously raised about the scope of specific powers within the bill. It was ""alarmed"" to hear the minister had ""not made any representations to the UK government"", adding it would have expected her to have had ""robust conversations"". Ms Morgan said she had ""received assurances"" from her counterparts in Whitehall that the UK government would never legislate in devolved areas without consulting Welsh ministers, and these commitments would be repeated at the despatch box in the Commons. Eluned Morgan said she had ""received assurances"" the UK government would not legislate in devolved areas However the committee's report concluded: ""We have repeatedly emphasised that it is important to consider what can be done under a particular legislative provision, and not what a government of the time says it will do with a power. ""The UK government's ability to amend Wales' key devolution legislation alone via subordinate legislation is not something that should be negotiated using the non-binding practice of despatch box commitments in the UK Parliament."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""While we agree that the development of an independent UK international trade policy poses real risks for devolution, we have worked hard to secure concessions from the UK government on this bill in the context of a UK government with a large majority in Parliament. ""We continue to make representations on issues of concern and will come forward with our final views on whether the Senedd should give legislative consent once the bill is in its final stages.""

"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned there are signs of a ""second wave"" of coronavirus cases in Europe, but what's the evidence for that? Talk of a second wave is the stuff of nightmares, conjuring up images of another deadly surge of infections. This is what happened with Spanish Flu after the First World War when a second wave proved deadlier than the first. But the truth is many experts try to avoid the phrase altogether. Margaret Harris, from the World Health Organization, has made clear that what we have seen is ""one big wave"" that is making its way across the globe. Some countries, such as South Korea and Singapore, have been better than others at flattening it from the start by stopping the virus spreading by using comprehensive testing and tracing regimes. But others - and the UK, France, Spain and Italy are examples of this - have just managed to flatten it partway through the wave by introducing lockdowns. This was because they did not have such sophisticated infectious disease systems in place to control the virus. Thanks to investment, they are in a much stronger position now and have been able to release lockdown, while still trying to suppress the virus wave through testing and tracing. But there are signs cases are picking up, especially in Spain. But rather than this being a second wave - or the start of one - perhaps we are better off thinking of these as the existing wave bursting through the defences. Prof Paul Hunter, a Covid expert at Norwich Medical School, says for it to be a second wave the virus would have to have gone away completely, so he prefers to call it a ""resurgence"". And really it should come as no surprise that this happens in highly-populated areas like Western Europe. Containing the virus relies on good systems for detecting cases and for the public to play its part by social distancing, and engaging with the test and trace systems. Clearly any weakness leaves countries susceptible, particularly to this virus which can be transmitted even if people are not displaying symptoms. However, while cases may be going up, it is worth noting they are nowhere near the levels seen during the peak of the pandemic. And bear in mind that the peaks seen in the charts above for all the countries - bar maybe Germany which had widespread testing in place quickly - are a gross underestimate of the true scale of infections. That's because there was not widespread testing available at the time. In the UK alone it is estimated that there were 100,000 cases a day at the peak - 20 times more than the testing in place at the time suggested. The greater access to testing there is, the more likely you are to pick up mild infections. If you only test patients in hospital - as was largely the case in the UK until late April - you are going to miss a lot of cases. What is also clear is that infection levels vary greatly within countries. There are areas where the virus is virtually non-existent, while in others it is lurking menacingly. In the UK there have beenflare-ups in Leicesterand - to a lesser extent -Blackburn with DarwenandOldham. A similar picture emerges when you look at the data for Spain. Even Germany is not immune to this, with local lockdowns announced in recent weeks. There are many reasons why this is happening. There are signs young people are spreading it in certain areas. Certainly, the young are less likely to get extremely sick, which could make them more relaxed about the need for social distancing. But it could also be true that the virus has always been circulating in these groups, it is just that more widespread testing is picking it up. There also seems to be a link to deprivation - where people live in close proximity the likelihood of transmission increases. This video can not be played What factors determine a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections? Whatever the reasons behind the local flare-ups, what is certain is that they will continue for the foreseeable future. Prof Keith Neal, an expert in infectious diseases from University of Nottingham, says these spikes will become a way of life, but they are in ""no way"" a second wave. He says countries across Europe are ""learning to live"" with the virus by taking precautions such as social distancing and wearing masks. He believes that if people remain vigilant, coupled with the improved treatments that are being found and greater testing, the scale of deaths seen during the peaks will hopefully not be repeated. There is a good chance, it seems, that what will be seen are the ripples from the first wave rather than a big second wave.

"The pharmacy in John Wood Street is one of two businesses linked to the cluster A further two people have tested positive for Covid-19 as part of a cluster of cases in the Inverclyde area. The total number of positive cases involved is now 13, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday. Amazon has confirmed that a member of staff, based at a warehouse in Gourock, is in quarantine. An M&D Green Pharmacy in Port Glasgow is also linked. Some individuals visited a number of businesses in the Greater Glasgow area. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) said they may have been infectious at the time. Pharmacy linked to Inverclyde Covid-19 cluster Scotland's virus death 'capital' calls for support The businesses included The Botany bar and restaurant in Glasgow, and Sweeney's Cruises in West Dunbartonshire, both on Sunday. Individuals also visited The Queen of the Loch by Marston's Inn in Balloch and Lomond Woods Holiday Park on the weekend of 24 July. All the businesses linked to the outbreak are continuing to operate, and the health board has previously said the cases were only experiencing mild symptoms. In a statement on Facebook, Sweeney's Cruises said they were visited by council health officials and had been ""given the green light to carry on with our daily cruises"". Queen Of The Loch and Marston's Inn said on Facebook that it had ""enhanced cleaning procedures in place"", had undergone a ""full deep clean"" and was co-operating with the local authority. None of the cases linked to the pharmacy are currently working there and customers have been told it is safe to keep using its facilities. Dr Daniel Carter, consultant in public health medicine and chairman of the incident management team dealing with the cluster, said: ""All those who have tested positive for Covid-19 are self-isolating and we are working with a number of businesses including a local pharmacy to trace any close contacts. ""We would like to take this opportunity to remind local residents of the importance of continuing with the general measures to minimise the risk of Covid-19 to themselves and to others."" Ms Sturgeon has previously thanked the businesses concerned for ""acting swiftly, and for fully cooperating with the guidance and procedures to contain this cluster"". Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe said news of the local cluster was ""soul-destroying"" in an area which has already been one of the worst-hit by coronavirus in Scotland. ""There has been a lot of anxiety, rightly, in the community over the last few months,"" he said. ""We saw some light at the end of the tunnel with the number of deaths reducing - in the previous three weeks we didn't have any - and now this has come back. ""But there is a degree of reassurance that the effective systems are in place and hopefully we can contain the virus."" Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe said he was hopeful the virus could be contained Mr McCabe also said he hoped track and trace measures could help avoid a local lockdown. He said: ""Obviously, if the outbreak can't be contained, there are potential consequences. ""We have seen in Dumfries and Galloway and parts of England that major outbreaks do lead potentially to local lockdowns and I hope we can avoid that situation."" Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday that the pharmacy in Port Glasgow was still open but that locals should not be concerned about using services. He said: ""We've been in touch with the pharmacy and we're very, very comfortable with how the pharmacy has behaved both up to this point and yesterday. ""People should not be scared to use pharmacies in the area."" He added that the option of a local lockdown to control the Inverclyde cluster was being kept ""in reserve"" and would be used if necessary. ""If we thought this virus had gone into community transmission mode, like we saw in early and late March, then we would of course do something more dramatic,"" he said. M&D Green managing director Martin Green said ""some staff"" at its John Wood Street branch had tested positive for Covid-19. He said: ""We have been working with Health Protection Scotland and environmental health officers, who are satisfied with the infection control measures we have in place and have immediately implemented the minor additional actions recommended."" Mr Green added: ""We have been reassured by the local outbreak management team that these measures allow us to continue to provide the full range of pharmaceutical services without any risk to the public."" Amazon said a warehouse worker at its Gourock site was in quarantine In a statement, Amazon said they were supporting the individual in quarantine and were following guidelines from health officials about operations at their buildings. They added: ""We have implemented proactive measures to protect employees, including increased cleaning at all facilities and maintaining social distance."" CASES:Where are the latest cases?

"This video can not be played Listen to a recording of Alice as she's duped by a fraudster pretending to be from a bank ""I find it really hard to sleep at night because I think these people might know where I live. I feel like my privacy has been violated."" Alice, a BBC radio producer, is talking about the moment she realised that she'd become the victim of a sophisticated impersonation scam. She'd had Â£1,600 stolen by someone she was convinced worked for Barclays. This type of scam, also known aspersonal fraud,external, is when someone is targeted by criminals and tricked into handing over personal details. Criminals then use those details to their advantage - in this case, accessing Alice's bank account and transferring Â£1,600 into an account controlled by them. However, what the fraudster could not have known was that Alice had captured eight minutes of the call after thinking it would be easier to record the conversation on her second phone, which was close at hand, than to write down notes. Personal fraud is one of a number that are defined as Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud. UK Finance, a group which represents the banking and finance industry, reported that people lost Â£455m to this type of fraud, with impersonation scams making up nearly a fifth of that figure. This is up 29% compared to the year before. But the figure could be much worse as many frauds go unreported by victims who are too ashamed or too worried to speak out. It's not just the financial impact that can hurt victims. It can cause tremendous harm to a person's emotional and mental wellbeing. ""There is also a really strong sense of guilt,"" says Alice, who is not being named in full because of fears she could be the target of identity fraud. ""I could have lost a lot of money, I could have lost all my savings,"" she says. ""I could have lost the money my grandparents left me so that's a lifetime of savings that I could have lost in, literally, a second."" Tamlyn Edmonds, a specialist fraud prosecutor and partner at law firm Edmonds Marshall McMahon, said criminals behind these types of fraud use classicsocial engineering,externaltricks to gain their victim's trust. ""[The criminal] spends time building up this trust so that Alice has absolutely no awareness she's talking to a fraudster and she just thinks she's talking to a bank employee. ""He has a really friendly voice, he's well spoken, he's calm. He's using language that makes him sound helpful and friendly because that makes people's barriers come down. ""She's distressed, she's worried and he's playing on that."" In Alice's case, the fraudster even warned her about other scams taking place at the moment - another classic reverse psychology trick, according to Ms Edmonds: ""She thinks this is someone really trying to help me here, he's really concerned about me. ""He's drawing her attention to other types of frauds out of concern for her, whilst one is going on right under her nose unbeknown to her."" UK Finance has identified eight different types of scam, split into two categories, defined as APP Fraud: Malicious payee (purchase scam, investment scam, romance scam and advance fee scam) Malicious redirection (invoice and mandate scam, CEO fraud, impersonation of police or bank staff and other impersonations) Fraudsters can easily spoof text messages to make them look authentic Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, says fraudsters are also exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to target people. ""Fraudsters adapt to whatever is happening... and they've absolutely done that with Covid as well. ""We have seen Covid being used as a hook. Fraudsters are also realising there are more people sitting at home so are giving them calls earlier in the day."" Covid was mentioned in Alice's fraud too. Her bank, Barclays, said she had ""been a victim of a very sophisticated and targeted impersonation fraud"". ""The fraudulent withdrawal of Â£1,600 was immediately identified as being suspicious and swift action was taken to protect the account. ""We returned the customer's account back to the position it should have been in after concluding our customer was not liable [and] will support any further police investigation on this matter to help bring the criminals to justice."" Theofficial advice,externalfor people to try to stop them becoming victims is never hand over any personal details to anyone who gets in touch out of the blue on a cold call or cold email and if necessary always call your bank back, ideally from a different phone.

"Domino's Pizza has dropped a promotion offering free pizza to women named Karen after it was met with a backlash. In recent years, the name ""Karen"" has been used as an insult to describe white middle-aged women who are perceived to be obnoxious or racist. The pizza franchise's New Zealand arm initially said it wanted to give ""nice Karens"" a break from negativity. But some said it was tone-deaf, ignored more important issues, and ""rewarded privilege"". A giveaway, titled ""Calling all (nice) Karens"" was posted on the pizza chain's Australian and New Zealand pages. It asked those named Karen to tell Domino's in 250 words how they were one of the ""nice ones"". ""The name 'Karen' has become synonymous with anyone who is entitled, selfish and likes to complain,"" Domino's chief marketing officer in the region, Allan Collins, said while introducing the offer. ""What used to be a light-hearted meme has become quite the insult to anyone actually named Karen. ""Well, today we're taking the name Karen back. At Domino's, we're all about bringing people together and we want to celebrate all the great Karens out there by shouting them a free pizza!"" The offer was immediately criticised, with many arguing ""Karen negativity"" was an issue that affected mostly ""privileged white women"". ""Most of the time Karens are entitled privileged white women. If a few people actually called Karen can't handle the meme they should try handling 400 years of oppression,"" said one user on Twitter. ""When you wanna reward more privilege to the most privileged in our society,"" another said. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Some brought up recent incidents where women were accused of acting like ""Karens"". ""Please Dominos, stop. Karens ask to speak to the manager and actively try to get low wage workers fired. Karens put people at risk by refusing to wear a mask. Karens don't need your defense,"" said another Twitter user. Others asked the company to find more worthwhile causes, like giving to ""people who actually need it... like [those] who are homeless and have no food security"". Even before the offer, the term ""Karen"" has proved controversial online. Many have argued using the name as an insult is itself racist and misogynistic. Domino's New Zealand quickly apologised for the offer on Facebook. It said it merely ""wanted to bring a smile to customers who are doing the right thing - Karen the nurse, Karen the teacher, Karen the mum"". It said its post had come off ""the back of a number of situations in Victoria, Australia [where] a person who decided they didn't have to follow the mandate and wear a mask and took it out on retail workers"". Charge filed against white Central Park 911 caller Earlier this month, a woman in Melbourne threatened to sue hardware store Bunnings, after staff told her it was compulsory to wear a mask. The woman was later dubbed ""Bunnings Karen"". Domino's said that people interpreted their campaign ""in a different way than we intended"". ""Our intention was one of inclusivity only. We want you to know that we are always listening and learning and when we get it wrong, we fix it. We are sorry."" Domino's Australia, which ran the same campaign, did not withdraw the offer - although it is closing on Friday. The company said: ""Thankfully, the majority of Australians interpreted the giveaway in the light-hearted way in which it was intended and had some fun tagging their friends and family named Karen. ""Unfortunately, due to lacking important context in New Zealand, it was not received in the same way. ""Our intention was one of inclusivity only, which is why we removed the post in New Zealand and issued an apology.""

"Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai defended their firms The heads of some of the world's biggest tech companies have appeared before Washington lawmakers to defend their firms against claims they abuse their power to quash competitors. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos said the world ""needs large"" firms, while the heads of Facebook, Apple and Google argued their companies had spurred innovation. The appearance comes as lawmakers consider tougher regulation and competition probes are under way. Some critics want the firms broken up. Democrats pressed the tech titans on competition issues, while Republicans were more concerned about how they managed information and whether they were marginalising conservative views. The hearing as it happened Congressman David Cicilline, the Democrat leading the congressional committee holding the hearing, said a year-long investigation by lawmakers had showed the online platforms had ""wielded their power in destructive, harmful ways in order to expand"". This video can not be played ""Mr Bezos... why on Earth would one of your partners compare your company to a drug dealer?"" He said he was convinced the firms were monopolies and called for action. ""Some need to be broken up and all need to be properly regulated,"" he said at the end of more than five hours of testimony. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google, and Tim Cook of Apple insisted they had done nothing illegal and stressed the American roots and values of their firms. At the hearing, lawmakers accused Google of having stolen content created by smaller firms, like Yelp, in order to keep users on their own web pages. Amazon's treatment of sellers on its site, Facebook's acquisition of competitors such as Instagram, and Apple's App store also drew attention. In response to claims Google had stolen content, Google boss Sundar Pichai said the firm held itself to the ""highest standard"" Mr Cicilline said Amazon had an inherent conflict of interest, since it both hosts sellers and competes against them by offering similar products. Such practice has also come under scrutiny from European regulators. ""Amazon's dual role... is fundamentally anti-competitive and Congress must take action,"" he said. However, some Republicans signalled they were not prepared to split up the firms or significantly overhaul US competition laws, with one committee member saying ""big is not inherently bad"". Republican concerns focused on perceived political bias at the firms, which they accused of suppressing conservative views. ""I'll just cut to the chase - big tech is out to get conservatives,"" said Congressman Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio. Four of the world's top technology company executives may have been testifying before the Judiciary Committee from a distance, but they were still caught in the middle of a political storm on Wednesday afternoon. The stated purpose of the hearing was to address whether existing anti-trust laws provide sufficient regulation of transnational tech Goliaths. The reality, however, was that the proceedings - with each member of the committee receiving five minutes to speak - were more akin to a feeding frenzy, as corporate chiefs faced criticism from every direction Democrats expressed concern that the companies were abusing their power by disadvantaging competitors or buying them out entirely. Republicans accused the witnesses of insufficient patriotism and being too cosy with the Chinese. Both sides expressed outrage over how the companies managed speech and expression on their platforms. They didn't go far enough in removing hateful rhetoric and false information, Democrats said. They singled out conservatives for censorship, the Republicans countered. Through it all, the witnesses thanked the questioners and took their lumps, perhaps confident that they could soon log off and get back to their work. While all the politicians seemed to agree that the big tech companies were a problem, their chances of arriving at any kind of solution seems unlikely. Appearing by remote video, the executives defended their companies, saying their products helped smaller businesses and they remained vulnerable to competition from newcomers. Apple boss Tim Cook said the business climate was ""so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business"". Mr Bezos, in his first appearance before Congress, denied that Amazon's multiple roles were a conflict of interest, but he admitted the firm was reviewing its handling of sales data from sellers on the site. The company has been accused of using such information to launch its own version of hot-selling products. Mr Bezos said Amazon rules forbid staff from looking at sales data from individual companies, but he conceded it was possible that employees had violated the policy. ""We are investigating that,"" he said. A day of reckoning for US tech giants' CEOs Will the US break up the tech giants? Elon Musk calls for 'break up' of Amazon In his prepared remarks, Mr Bezos said Amazon faced significant competition from firms such as Walmart and noted that the company lost money for years as it branched out into new areas. ""I love garage entrepreneurs - I was one. But, just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones. There are things small companies simply can't do,"" he said. This video can not be played WATCH: Who are the 'big four' and just how much power do they have? US President Donald Trump is a long-time critic of Amazon and threatened his own action on Twitter, writing: ""If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders."" He also told reporters that White House officials would be watching the hearing closely. ""There's no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad,"" he said. Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said ""storm clouds"" were building in Washington but he thought it was unlikely that Congress would come together on new legislation that would force tech companies to change. ""We think a legislative fix is the only one that creates a potential for limitations on these companies' ability to conduct business, whether that takes the form of higher taxes or new rules regarding market concentration,"" he wrote. ""Absent a legislative fix, we don't see meaningful change in regulation, although future acquisitions will most certainly be scrutinized and more difficult to close.""
