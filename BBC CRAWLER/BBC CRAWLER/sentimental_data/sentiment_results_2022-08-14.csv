"JK Rowling is among authors who have have voiced support for Salman Rushdie Police are investigating an online threat to JK Rowling, after she tweeted support for Salman Rushdie following his attack in the US. The Harry Potter author, 57, shared screenshots of a message stating: ""Don't worry, you are next"". The same Twitter account also posted messages praising the man who attacked Mr Rushdie on stage at an event in New York state. Ms Rowling said she felt ""very sick"" at the news and hoped he would recover. She shared a screenshot of the threat, writing: ""To all sending supportive messages. Thank you. Police are involved (were already involved on other threats)."" Horrifying, ghastly: Authors condemn Rushdie attack Salman Rushdie: The writer who emerged from hiding The tweet, from an account in Pakistan, had been removed on Sunday morning. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""We have received a report of an online threat being made and officers are carrying out enquiries."" Officers had previouslyinvestigated online criticism targeted at Ms Rowlingover her views on transgender issues. This video can not be played Watch: From the scene where Salman Rushdie was attacked on stage Ms Rowling is among many authors and public figureswho have have voiced support for Mr Rushdie. Warner Bros Discovery, the entertainment company behind the Harry Potter film series, said it strongly condemned the threats against her. It said in a statement : ""We stand with her and all the authors, storytellers and creators who bravely express their creativity and opinions. ""Our thoughts are with Sir Salman Rushdie and his family following the senseless act of violence in New York."" The 75-year-old novelist faced years of death threats for his novel The Satanic Verses, which some Muslims see as blasphemous. He was forced into hiding for nearly 10 years after it was published in 1988. The man charged over Friday's attack has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder, and has been remanded in custody without bail. Hadi Matar, 24, is accused of stabbing Mr Rushdie at least 10 times in the face, neck and abdomen. The author has been taken off a ventilator and is able to talk again, a day after being stabbed.

"There are growing calls to impose a windfall tax on oil giants' earnings as living costs soar Saudi oil giant Aramco has broken its own record with a $48.4bn (Â£40bn) profit for the second quarter of 2022. It is a 90% year-on-year increase and marks the biggest earnings for the world's largest energy exporter since its public listing three years ago. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has seen oil and gas prices skyrocket. Russia is one of the world's biggest exporters but Western nations have pledged to curb their dependence on the country for their energy needs. According to Bloomberg, the Saudi oil giant'sfigure represents ""the biggest quarterly adjusted profit of any listed company"",external. As well as the record profits, the state-owned Saudi energy giant announced it would keep its dividend unchanged at $18.8bn for the third quarter. The company said it would keep expanding to satisfy demand. ""While global market volatility and economic uncertainty remain, events during the first half of this year support our view that ongoing investment in our industry is essential both to help ensure markets remain well supplied and to facilitate an orderly energy transition,"" Aramco president and chief executive Amin Nasser said. ""In fact, we expect oil demand to continue to grow for the rest of the decade, despite downward economic pressures on short-term global forecasts,"" he added. BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as bills soar Why won't the world's big oil producers lower prices? Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Oil prices were already rising before the Ukraine war as economies started to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and demand outstripped supply. The world's biggest oil producers, including ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP, have all posted huge earnings this year - leading to growing calls on governments to impose a windfall tax amid an alarming rise in living costs. In June, US President Joe Biden said Exxon had made ""more money than God this year"". Saudi Arabia is the largest single producer in Opec, a group representing the world's biggest oil producers. Last week Opec+ agreed to raise production slightlyin an effort to help ease high oil prices. However, the latest production output increase is at a much slower pace than in recent months. The decision was a blow to leaders including Mr Biden, who have called for production to be ramped up.

"Taiwan's foreign ministry tweeted an image of members of the group being greeted at a Taipei airport A US congressional delegation has arrived for an unannounced visit to Taiwan, 12 days after a tour of the island by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Five members of Congress will visit until Monday, said Washington's de-facto embassy in the capital Taipei. China launched its largest-ever military exercises around Taiwan after Ms Pelosi's visit earlier in August. Beijing sees the self-governing island as its own, renegade territory that must be united with the mainland. It believes that mission could be necessary with force, if other attempts at unification are unsuccessful. Ms Pelosi became the most senior American politician to visit the island in 25 years during her appearance earlier this month. Her brief, but controversial, stopover was labelled ""manic, irresponsible and irrational"" by the Chinese foreign minister. Speaking during a meeting of south-east Asian foreign ministers in Cambodia, Wang Yi insisted that Taiwan would ""eventually return to the embrace of the motherland"". Beijing continues to carry out military drills near the island. Earlier on Sunday, Taipei said it had detected 22 Chinese aircraft and six naval ships in and around the Taiwan Strait. At the height of China's military exercises, Taiwan accused its neighbour of trying to change the status quo in the region. On Sunday, its foreign ministry published photos of members of the US congressional delegation being greeted at an airport. China and Taiwan: A really simple guide Pelosi leaves Taiwan to sound of Chinese fury A statement from the American Institute in Taiwan said the team's visit was part of a wider visit to the Indo-Pacific region. It added that the five members - led by Democratic Senator Ed Markey - would discuss issues including regional security, trade and investment with Taiwanese leaders. The group are due to meet President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday. President Tsai's office said the month's second high-level American visit signalled ""firm support"" for Taiwan. The US does not officially recognise Taiwan - only a few countries do - however, it does maintain a strong relationship with the island, which includes selling weapons for Taiwan to defend itself.

"A group of people thought to be migrants were taken to Dover from a Border Force vessel on Saturday More than 20,000 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats this year, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed. On Saturday 607 made the crossing in 14 boats - the third time the total has exceeded 600 in 2022. There were 28,526 crossings detected in 2021. By this point last year, just over 11,300 crossings had been made. In April, the governmentannounced plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwandain a bid to deter migrants. Earlier this year, 47 people were told they would be flown the 4,000 miles (6,500km) to Rwanda and a flight was booked for 14 June. However, after a series of legal challenges and a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights, the flight was cancelled. Last month, a Home Affairs Committee reportfound the Rwanda scheme had not been effective. ""There is no clear evidence that the policy will deter migrant crossings - numbers have significantly increased since it was announced in April,"" the report said. The MPs concluded one of the reasons the policy was not reducing numbers ""may be attributed to scaremongering from people traffickers, that because of new regulations coming in across the Channel it will be much harder to access the UK in future, so they had better get on with it"". There have been 3,618 crossings detected so far this month, with 1,694 in the past week, according to the MoD. The highest daily total this year was recorded on 1 August, when 696 people crossed in 14 boats. Saturday's 607 crossings also involved 14 boats - the equivalent of around 43 people per vessel. The calm weather is thought to have been a factor in the recent increase in numbers. However, one group working with refugees in Calais (that did not want to be named) said it heard people smugglers had lowered their prices, as rival groups tried to achieve dominance in the market. Last week, BBC South East reported how suspected people smugglers wereusing TikTokto advertise illegal entry to the UK via the English Channel. Fierce competition between gangs saw various groups boasting they were the ""best"" operator for successful crossings, and stating ""Rwanda has been cancelled"". Posts from various TikTok accounts proclaim to be able to offer safe crossings on set dates A government spokesman said: ""The Nationality and Borders Act makes it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and we have introduced life sentences for those who facilitate illegal entry into the country. ""Since the introduction of the Act, 23 people have been arrested."" The government figures do not include those who arrive in the UK undetected, or where there have been reports of people making the crossing, but no actual encounters.

"Lucy Mills (left) and Elen Kelly picked up 80 different dog poos around Brecon in a short space of time Two dog walkers say they picked up 80 different dog poos in 90 minutes during an attempt to clean up a town centre. Business owners Lucy Mills and Elen Kelly said they were astonished they were able to pick up about one poo a minute on their ""poo patrol"" in Brecon. Ms Mills said there were signs warning people to clean up after their dogs but a lack of enforcement. Powys council said it was up to dog walkers to be responsible and clean up after themselves. But Ms Mills said a lack of visible wardens was an issue. Ukrainian families want pet quarantine rule change School uses dogs to help support pupils in class Stricter rules on puppy and kitten sales begin ""In Brecon there seems to be a big problem with dog poo around the place, whereas in Bristol, where I lived previously, there was less,"" she said. ""In Bristol there are dog wardens and you get called out on it if you don't pick up after your dog whereas here, the most we have is a sign but nothing actually happens if you don't."" She added: ""Brecon is a lovely place. It's a beautiful spot and it attracts lots of tourists who come for walks and I just think it creates a terrible impression if you're having to pick your way through piles of dog poo."" The pair had set aside an hour-and-a-half for their clean up but only managed to get a short way into their planned route because of the volume of dog mess they encountered. Ms Mills said dog owners should be responsible for hygiene and health reasons. Another poo patrol is planned in the autumn ""You can't claim ignorance. Everybody that owns a dog knows you are supposed to carry poo bags and you are supposed to pick up after a dog,"" she said. ""So I don't think its ignorance, I think it's laziness potentially, just assuming that someone else will come along and do it for you."" Ms Mills said she intended to repeat her clean-up in the autumn. ""We've had lots of comments saying 'thank you so much'. People seem to really appreciate it,"" she added. Powys County Council said it was a ""minority"" of dog owners who ""let their communities down"". Lucy believes the council should have wardens to encourage owners to pick up after their pets ""We have waste awareness and enforcement out and about adding signs and engaging with dog owners, whilst our street cleaners are doing their best to clean up after the irresponsible few who refuse to take responsibility for their own pets,"" a council spokesperson said. ""It is an offence to allow a dog in your control, even if you're walking someone else's dog, to foul in a public place and to fail to clean it up immediately after it has fouled and could be issued with a Â£75 fixed penalty notice."" The council urged residents to report people who do not pick up after their dog.

"HervÃ© Trentin, right, and Christophe Dubois. ""This fire is engraved in my mind forever,"" Trentin said HervÃ© Trentin, a 34-year veteran of the Gironde fire department, stood on the edge of a charred section of forest wiping tears from his cheeks. It was the second time he had cried that morning. ""I'm sorry,"" he said, composing himself. ""This is our forest. It is heart-breaking to watch it burn."" Trentin and his small team were moving around an area south of the French city of Bordeaux, in the Gironde region, on Saturday morning, trying to stay ahead of a megafire. Their job was to burn the forest, to create firebreaks - a tactic they had trained for years to master and which put them in a small band of firefighters in the region capable of doing the job. But Trentin also grew up just down the road, and it was making him emotional setting his home soil alight. ""It's hard for me to think that I will not see this forest again like it was,"" he said. ""I'm 53 years old, and this forest will need more than 30 years to recover."" HervÃ© Trentin wept as he described watching his home region on fire. ""It is heartbreaking to watch it burn."" he said Trentin has a three-year-old daughter, and when he thinks about the future of the forest he thinks about her too. ""I wonder what will happen,"" he said, looking up towards the tops of the trees and beyond to the sky. ""I don't want to say our future looks like what we are living this summer, but... you know."" The people of Gironde had barely had time to catch their breath since the last megafire, in July, which burned about 14,000 hectares in the same area. That blaze had appeared to be under control, but the heat was still in the earth - a so-called ""zombie fire"" that can re-emerge in persistent dry conditions and accelerate new fires. Trentin worked the July fire too, up to 48 hours straight among the flames. ""I had never seen such a huge blaze,"" he said. ""I remember the big fires in 91 and 97 but they didn't spread that fast."" Somehow the new fire was worse. The vegetation was drier than ever. ""Even the hardwoods burn like straw,"" Trentin said. ""Usually we use the hardwoods to help us against the fire."" Smoke from nearby fire in a forest in Gironde, near Bordeaux On Saturday morning, Trentin's small crew of specialists was burning sections of forest around several family homes, to protect them. They work by torching sections ahead of the blaze, to remove the flammable material. It is so dry in Gironde that the flames they light can sweep along the long burn sections in seconds and rip up tree trunks to head height. The firefighters can only do this work when the wind is low, to minimise the risk of their counter-fires spreading, but they cannot control the wind. Last Tuesday night, Trentin and his team were carrying out a controlled burn near the village of Hostens when the wind turned on them. The first sign was the feeling of cool air rushing past their legs, he said, creating the sensation of a breeze. It was the fire sucking air towards it as it approached. The men moved quickly into an area that they had already burned and dropped to their knees. They tried to breathe calmly amid the thick smoke. The flames could easily surround them. ""We had lost control of the situation,"" Trentin said. ""We knew the fire was coming."" A tactical fire burns a patch of land next to a family home. The work has to be precise to avoid setting new wildfires There are more than 1,000 French firefighters now in Gironde battling this blaze, assisted by colleagues from various European nations. Not all of them share Trentin's years of experience, and for some it is their first time facing a megafire that can move faster than you. When the new fire was at its peak in the middle of last week, Trentin and his colleague Christophe Dubois were working in the forest when they saw a fireball flying towards them. ""It's like a wave coming over you, you cannot outrun it,"" Dubois said. ""You have to drop and lie flat on the ground."" But four younger colleagues from Toulouse froze, bolt upright. Dubois and a colleague scrambled to spray them with water and pull them down, but mere seconds were too long, and two were injured with second degree burns on the legs and face. Firefighters prepare to extinguish tactical blazes near Hostens Later that night, Dubois worked lighting counter-fires along a highway until 4am. Their hours were dictated by the whims of the fire, he said. ""If you don't have a passion for this work you cannot do it. We may seem like tough guys but we are sensitive. We have a passion for the forest, for nature. It is painful to watch it burning, and painful to burn the pines ourselves to save it."" After a hard morning creating firebreaks around several houses, Dubois and the team headed back for lunch to a base camp where there are hundreds of firefighters at any given time. Between the members of the team, there are decades of experience performing tactical burning. Firefighters plan over a map on Saturday, near the edge of the wildfires in Gironde As they ate, they talked about the rate they had lost ground to the fire that past week - about 6,200 acres in one night alone. ""I have been a firefighter for 40 years and I had never seen such a fire,"" said Jean-Pierre Le Cunff, tactical fire chief for the Haute-Garonne region, who has two sons in the force. ""We are waiting for rain, for snow, for winter, for God,"" he said. There was no disagreement that the climate was changing for the worse. ""We talk about global warming of course,"" Le Cunff said. ""We see it, we feel it. This year, it is striking. In the mountains there is no glacier any more, everything is dry, the herds have nothing to eat."" Flames lick along the set perimeter of a tactical fire near Hostens After lunch, the team was called to an area of forest on the outskirts of Belin-Beliet, an abandoned village that was burned badly in July and again in August. They set a large tactical fire only about 25 metres from a house, to protect it after the owner called to say a new fire had broken out on her land. Firefighters had already told Claudie Decourneau to leave home when the July fire brought towering flames near her perimeter fence, but she declined. On Saturday, she stood and watched as they burned yet more of her land, where she rears livestock to live off and sells her wood. ""I don't want to leave my animals, and I feel more useful here because I can watch for new fires,"" Decourneau said. But she wept as she watched Trentin and Dubois and the team burn the land. On Friday, her power died. ""I am afraid of losing everything,"" she said. ""We will not give up but it is very hard. Pines take many years to grow."" Claudie Ducourneau has lost hundreds of acres of her land, which she lives off. âI am afraid of losing everything,â she said The heat was fierce as Ducourneau's land burned. When the flames licked up the trees the firefighters moved quickly to douse them, but the area would be left completely charred. The rich forest reduced to a wasteland. When the burning part was over, and the air full of smoke, the firefighters pulled back to their trucks, and talk turned to the coming night. A storm was forecast - high winds, maybe lightning, but little rain. ""It is frightening,"" Trentin said. ""We don't know if there will be rain. If there is wind, and lightning, the fire will get worse."" The storm was forecast to roll in about midnight. About 11pm, the lightning and thunder began, but so did the rain. HervÃ© Trentin at work in the forest. ""When my day starts, I have no idea when it will end,"" he said Baptiste Charbonnel contributed to this report. Photographs by Joel Gunter.

"The age of motherhood is shifting relentlessly upward The number of women giving birth aged over 40 has overtaken the number under 20 years of age for the first time. The change is part of a general rise in maternal age, with more births also among 35-39 year olds than 20-24 year olds for the first time. A third of births in 2021 were to women aged 30 to 34, the largest category, figures from the Welsh government show. A health expert said policies would need to be put in place if governments wanted people to have children earlier. Since the turn of the millennium, there has been a steady downwards trend in births among younger women. In 2001, just over 10% of births in Wales were to those aged 19 and under. This number has fallen every year since 2004, with last year's figures showing just 2.8% of births were to teenagers. Increased education and career roles are big factors in later motherhood However, it is still the case that in certain areas, teenage motherhood remains a normalised experience for a significant number. Although figures from the2021 census show the population of Wales and England has grown since the previous one a decade before, it also shows that the population as a whole - like its mothers - is getting older, with the percentage of people aged over 65 at 21.3%, up from 18.4% in 2011. Wales has a lower number of under-15s than any part of England, except the south-west, at 16.5%, which has implications for future populations both in terms of looking after today's expanding numbers of elderly and for the future impact on workforce size. Is this something society should be concerned about looking to the future? Wales is catching up with birth trends elsewhere, Prof Jacky Boivin says Prof Jacky Boivin, a professor in health psychology at Cardiff University, said one of the clear impacts of moving towards an older age of motherhood is that women have fewer children overall. She said: ""Wales is catching up to the rest of the world. These are trends that have been happening in other countries and it's just taken a little longer in Wales. ""As people get older and they postpone having children, the number of children they have drops off. It's rare that people who want to have a child will decide not to have a child at all; they'll have fewer children. ""That's the impact of waiting a long time."" She said there were multiple factors contributing to the rise of older mothers. Why are we having fewer babies and does it matter? Does China's one-child generation want more kids? ""It takes longer to be in education and therefore people kick the can of parenthood [further down the road] and that could be just education per se takes a long time, or it could be the choices people are making, so certain courses are more difficult to make more compatible with parenthood,"" she said. ""Because education is time intensive and more people are going through higher degrees, and those are also time intensive, then more people are postponing having children. ""People want their career to be at the right stage in order to start having children and ostensibly it's just for stability, especially for women, because they could lose opportunities for advancement or if they're out of the market, completely lose opportunities for training and so on."" The changing role of women had meant more options for them might also make having children a harder choice than it once was. And, with the increased likelihood that women are equally or more educated than men, finding a suitable partner can be a barrier, as traditionally women like to ""marry up"", according to the professor. ""As women have become more and more educated, there are fewer men to marry up to, and so we need a cultural shift in the fact that women ought to marry up. There's no need for this now anymore but it still exists,"" she explained. Young people have lost opportunities to socialise because of increased time online The cost of childcare in the UK could also be a factor. ""In countries where you have very liberal policies about childcare, where you get the money at an early age, like in Scandinavia under the age of three, more women will have children sooner,"" said Prof Boivin. ""But in countries like Germany where they don't provide any childcare until the baby is five, it's because they have a pro-natalist policy that says you should have your children at an early age and we want the mother to stay home, basically. ""So obviously, these women are even more likely to postpone for reasons to do with that."" At the other end of the age spectrum, early stage research being done at the Vienna Institute of Demography is pointing to two things, Prof Boivin says: one being the relative ease of access to contraception for teenagers to help them avoid unwanted pregnancy. The other will come as no surprise to parents of teenagers everywhere. ""Young people have got out of the socialisation style that could lead to sexual encounters and unplanned births, basically which is usually when we say less than 20 is what we're thinking about,"" she said. ""[My colleague in Vienna] relates that back to screen time and a loss of opportunity for young people to meet, and to want to meet."" What are her solutions to encourage more people to have children earlier? ""We need to destigmatise things like solo parenthood or sufficient policies like being a parent while in [higher] education,"" she said. ""There may need to be policies around that facilitate people starting early, despite not having reached their career stages and not completed their education.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Green spaces parched in weekend heatwave Much of the UK has been experiencing another day of high temperatures - but the spell of extreme hot weather is coming to an end with thunderstorms. Scotland and Northern Ireland had rain and lower temperatures on Sunday, and rain started falling in parts of north-west England late on Sunday. Other parts of England and Wales will see rain on Monday. Experts have warned a lengthy period of rain would be needed to end the drought declared in parts of England on Friday. 500 more UK wildfires this year than all of 2021 We are waiting for rain' - fighting a megafire in France A lot of land has been left parched and hard by the heat, so rain is likely to hit the ground and run off - as it would on concrete - which could lead to flash flooding. A Met Office extreme heat warning has been in place for a large part of England and Wales for four days - making it the lengthiest alert since the system was introduced last year. It has not been as high as July's heatwave - when recorded temperatures in the UK topped 40C for the first time - but the extreme heat has lasted longer. Temperatures reached as high as 34.1C in Charlwood in Surrey on Sunday - while Edinburgh had thunder and heavy rain. Dan Stroud, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: ""We've had high pressure dominating, now we're having low pressure dominate, so the air is becoming more unstable. ""As we've had some very high ground temperatures, it doesn't actually take too much for the air to become even more unstable and for thundery showers to develop quickly."" Lincolnshire Police confirmeda teenage boy died on Saturday in the sea at Skegnessas temperatures prompted many people to flock to the beaches. The hot weather has also led to wildfires around England, from the North York Moors National Park to Dorset on the south coast. Mark Hardingham, from the National Fire Chiefs' Council, said: ""We've had 745 wildfires this year and that's gone up by 150 in just the last week. Last year we had 247 across the whole of the 12 months."" There are hundreds of other less serious fires in grassland every day, he said. Two men, both 44 and from Boston in Lincolnshire,were arrested on suspicion of arson and criminal damageafter a fire broke out in Norfolk, the county's police forced said. Emergency services had been called to Bawsey Country Park, near King's Lynn, on Sunday at about 11.40am, after a disposable barbecue in a woodland caused a small fire. Norfolk Constabulary said two men, both 44 and from Boston in Lincolnshire, had been arrested on suspicion of arson and criminal damage and taken to King's Lynn for questioning. Everyone must rethink water use - drought chief Five common myths about heatwaves debunked Looking down on London's parched parks Extreme heat warnings are based on the impacts of the weather conditions, rather than when specific temperatures are reached, the Met Office said. This means different conditions in different areas of the UK may trigger an extreme heat warning. The heat warning only covered England and Wales but Northern Ireland experienced its warmest August day for nearly 20 years on Thursday. Meanwhile, temperatures were high enough in Scotland to cause a wildfire in West Lothian that has burned for several days. And farmers in Fife have warned a newly-imposed ban on extracting water from the River Edencould lead to complete failure of some crops, with the National Farmers' Union calling the move ""devastating for agriculture"". But in Scotland and Northern Ireland, a yellow warning for thunderstorms came into effect on Sunday morning, due to last until the end of Monday. Customers at a Tesco supermarket in Inverness had to be evacuated on Sunday after water poured in through the ceiling. Rain fell in parts of north-west England on Sunday evening too, including Lancaster and Kirkby Lonsdale, ahead of the yellow thunderstorm warning spreading to England and Wales across Monday and Tuesday. South-west and south-east England face a third day of yellow warnings on Wednesday when northern areas are expected to be drier. The hot weather has parched the grass in Greenwich Park, south-east London A boat sits in the dried up Huddersfield narrow canal in West Yorkshire An officialdrought was declared for eight areas of Englandon Friday. The move is expected to trigger stricter controls on water use and five water companies have already announced restrictions, including hosepipe bans. John Curtin, executive director of local operations for the Environment Agency, told the BBC ""this is not a normal summer"" and warned lack of water would be an issue for several months. ""We'll need probably average or slightly above average rainfall this autumn into this winter for us to not be in a drought next year,"" he said. The agency has said there is enough water for public supply but has urged everyone to think about their water use. CHEAP DINNERS:Simple recipes that will cost you Â£1 a portion, or less...

"Rakesh Jhunjhunwala was called India's Warren Buffett Tributes have poured in for Indian billionaire Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who has died at the age of 62. Jhunjhunwala, who made a fortune from the stock market, died on Sunday at a hospital in Mumbai city. The hospital said that the cause of death was a ""sudden cardiac arrest"". Often called India's Warren Buffett, Jhunjhunwala had an estimated net worth of around $5.8bn, according to Forbes magazine. He was part of a generation of investors who benefitted from the historic 1991 reforms, which opened up India's economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the tributes to Jhunjhunwala, who was steadfastly bullish on Indian stock markets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""He was very good at reading businesses and had conviction, passion and very blunt opinions about things,"" said businessman Motilal Oswal, who set up one of India's leading brokerages. Jhunjhunwala had recently backed Akasa Air, India's newest budget airline, which began operations earlier in August. While the Covid pandemic had ravaged domestic air travel for the past two years, passenger traffic has risen sharply this year. The son of an income tax officer, Jhunjhunwala has said that he became fascinated with stocks as a child after watching his father balance his market investments. Jhunjhunwala began investing in the stock market in 1985, when he was 25 years old - he started off with $100 that he had borrowed from a relative, reports say. He later set up Rare Enterprises - the name was coined from the first two letters of his name and that of his wife Rekha. He had the reputation of being a risk-taker in his investments, many of which paid off spectacularly. In a 2021 profile, Forbes wrote that while Jhunjhunwala ""acquired his legendary Midas touch by picking winning stocks"", he has also recently started seeing his private equity investments pay off. A decade ago, he told Reuters in an interview that he didn't like being called ""India's Warren Buffett"", adding that the Berkshire Hathaway CEO was ""far, far ahead"" of him. ""I'm not a clone of anybody. I'm Rakesh Jhunjhunwala,"" he had said. Market veteran Ajay Bagga told the BBC that Jhunjhunwala ""personified the India story"". ""[He was] a young middle-class boy rising up the ranks to build such a vast fortune, and setting the stage for the growth momentum in the Indian financial markets,"" he said. Mr Bagga added that Jhunjhunwala had an infectious ""optimism for India"". That optimism was reflected in Jhunjhunwala's other famous nickname - the Big Bull of Dalal Street, a reference to the address of the Bombay Stock Exchange. Jhunjhunwala remained optimistic till the end - a week before his death, he toldnews channel CNBC-TV18,externalthat regardless of global economic conditions, he believed that Indian markets would grow, ""but at a slower pace"". He was also a strong advocate for Indian businesses doing philanthropy. ""Rakesh was keen to make a positive social difference to India - and willing to invest significantly in India's social and educational development. He once told me that the reason for hisÂ success was that his father had encouraged him to be curious as a child."" Ramji Raghavan, founder of the Agastya International Foundation, told the BBC. Jhunjhunwala was an early investor in Agastya, donating 500 million rupees ($6.3m; Â£5.1m) to the foundation's mission to inculcate scientific thought and curiosity in children.

"The age of motherhood is shifting relentlessly upward The number of women giving birth aged over 40 has overtaken the number under 20 years of age for the first time. The change is part of a general rise in maternal age, with more births also among 35-39 year olds than 20-24 year olds for the first time. A third of births in 2021 were to women aged 30 to 34, the largest category, figures from the Welsh government show. A health expert said policies would need to be put in place if governments wanted people to have children earlier. Since the turn of the millennium, there has been a steady downwards trend in births among younger women. In 2001, just over 10% of births in Wales were to those aged 19 and under. This number has fallen every year since 2004, with last year's figures showing just 2.8% of births were to teenagers. Increased education and career roles are big factors in later motherhood However, it is still the case that in certain areas, teenage motherhood remains a normalised experience for a significant number. Although figures from the2021 census show the population of Wales and England has grown since the previous one a decade before, it also shows that the population as a whole - like its mothers - is getting older, with the percentage of people aged over 65 at 21.3%, up from 18.4% in 2011. Wales has a lower number of under-15s than any part of England, except the south-west, at 16.5%, which has implications for future populations both in terms of looking after today's expanding numbers of elderly and for the future impact on workforce size. Is this something society should be concerned about looking to the future? Wales is catching up with birth trends elsewhere, Prof Jacky Boivin says Prof Jacky Boivin, a professor in health psychology at Cardiff University, said one of the clear impacts of moving towards an older age of motherhood is that women have fewer children overall. She said: ""Wales is catching up to the rest of the world. These are trends that have been happening in other countries and it's just taken a little longer in Wales. ""As people get older and they postpone having children, the number of children they have drops off. It's rare that people who want to have a child will decide not to have a child at all; they'll have fewer children. ""That's the impact of waiting a long time."" She said there were multiple factors contributing to the rise of older mothers. Why are we having fewer babies and does it matter? Does China's one-child generation want more kids? ""It takes longer to be in education and therefore people kick the can of parenthood [further down the road] and that could be just education per se takes a long time, or it could be the choices people are making, so certain courses are more difficult to make more compatible with parenthood,"" she said. ""Because education is time intensive and more people are going through higher degrees, and those are also time intensive, then more people are postponing having children. ""People want their career to be at the right stage in order to start having children and ostensibly it's just for stability, especially for women, because they could lose opportunities for advancement or if they're out of the market, completely lose opportunities for training and so on."" The changing role of women had meant more options for them might also make having children a harder choice than it once was. And, with the increased likelihood that women are equally or more educated than men, finding a suitable partner can be a barrier, as traditionally women like to ""marry up"", according to the professor. ""As women have become more and more educated, there are fewer men to marry up to, and so we need a cultural shift in the fact that women ought to marry up. There's no need for this now anymore but it still exists,"" she explained. Young people have lost opportunities to socialise because of increased time online The cost of childcare in the UK could also be a factor. ""In countries where you have very liberal policies about childcare, where you get the money at an early age, like in Scandinavia under the age of three, more women will have children sooner,"" said Prof Boivin. ""But in countries like Germany where they don't provide any childcare until the baby is five, it's because they have a pro-natalist policy that says you should have your children at an early age and we want the mother to stay home, basically. ""So obviously, these women are even more likely to postpone for reasons to do with that.""

""[My colleague in Vienna] relates that back to screen time and a loss of opportunity for young people to meet, and to want to meet."" What are her solutions to encourage more people to have children earlier? ""We need to destigmatise things like solo parenthood or sufficient policies like being a parent while in [higher] education,"" she said.

"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of using ""nuclear blackmail"" at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - Europe's largest. Russia seized the plant in March and has been accused of turning it into a base from where it hits nearby towns. Both countries have traded blame for shelling it in recent days, prompting UN warnings of a nuclear disaster. Mr Zelensky says any Russian soldier who shoots at or under the cover of the plant will be a ""special target"". The six-nuclear reactor Zaporizhzhia station is located in the city of Enerhodar, on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River (Dnipro in Ukrainian) in southern Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, seizing the plant within days. Moscow has kept Ukrainian personnel to operate the facility. The UN has warned that continued hostilities around the station could lead to a nuclear disaster affecting much of Europe. Russia has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing at the plant. It says it seized control of the plant to prevent leaks of radioactive materials during fighting in the region. During his video address late on Saturday, Mr Zelensky said Russia had engaged in ""constant provocations"" by firing on the plant and said forces stationed there had used it as a base to shell the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets - on the other bank of the river. This was being done, the president said, to ""blackmail our state and the entire free world"". But he stressed that ""Russian blackmail only mobilises even more global efforts to confront terror"". ""Every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant, or shoots under the cover of the plant, must understand that he is becoming a special target for our intelligence, for our special services, for our army,"" the president said. He added that ""every day"" of Russia's occupation of the plant ""increases the radiation threat to Europe"". Ukraine's defence intelligence agency also accused Russia of a provocation by parking a Pion self-propelled heavy artillery piece outside a nearby town and painting a Ukrainian flag on it, in an attempt to discredit Kyiv. ABBC investigation revealed earlier this weekthat many of the Ukrainian workers at the site are being kept under armed guard amid harsh conditions. On Thursday, foreign ministers from the G7 group of industrial democracies demanded that Russia withdraw from the site immediately. Their warning echoed statements from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which called for an end to ""all military activities that endanger nuclear security"".

"Jerry Sadowitz, 61, is known for his provocative stand-up material An Edinburgh Festival show by controversial comedian Jerry Sadowitz has been cancelled by venue bosses. The comic and magician had been due to play two nights at The Pleasance at Edinburgh International Conference Centre on Friday and Saturday. The Pleasance said the second night would not go ahead as his material ""does not align with our values"". Sadowitz, 61, an American-born Scot, is known for aggressive stand-up performances. He said on Twitter: ""Did a show last night, 75 mins, thought it went well. Didn't see any walkouts. ""Today I'm told my show's been cancelled. Great stuff. I'm truly sorry for everyone who travelled to see the show tonight."" Lots of laughs for one-man audience at comedy show The doctors having a laugh about life in the NHS The venue's original listing carried the warning: ""This show contains strong language and themes some may find distressing."" However, on Saturday the Pleasance Theatre Trust said the second performance was cancelled ""with immediate effect"". It said in a statement: ""Opinions such as those displayed on stage by Sadowitz are not acceptable and The Pleasance are not prepared to be associated with such material."" It is understood complaints had been received from some audience members who attended Friday night's performance. The Pleasance declined to give detail about what aspects of Sadowitz's material led to the cancellation. Its director, Anthony Alderson, added: ""The Pleasance is a venue that champions freedom of speech and we do not censor comedians' material.

Ukraine's defence intelligence agency also accused Russia of a provocation by parking a Pion self-propelled heavy artillery piece outside a nearby town and painting a Ukrainian flag on it, in an attempt to discredit Kyiv. ABBC investigation revealed earlier this weekthat many of the Ukrainian workers at the site are being kept under armed guard amid harsh conditions. On Thursday, foreign ministers from the G7 group of industrial democracies demanded that Russia withdraw from the site immediately. Their warning echoed statements from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which called for an end to ""all military activities that endanger nuclear security"". UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has warned that the situation at the plant could ""lead to disaster"".
