"This video can not be played The BBC's Anthony Zurcher analyses Mr Trump's response. With the US mid-term elections over, attention in the US again quickly returned to when Robert Mueller would make His Next Move. It turns out the wait was just over three weeks. In what could be a blockbuster move, the special counsel has revealed his first new plea deal in 10 weeks, reaching an agreement with Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. Up until now, Cohen's legal entanglements had been centred on the US attorney's office in lower Manhattan - involving tax and campaign finance misconduct. It was certainly a headache for the president, but it was separate from Mr Mueller's investigation into 2016 Russian election meddling and possible ties to the Trump presidential campaign. Now Cohen looms large in that investigation, sharing information about his involvement in possible Russian business deals during the 2016 presidential election cycle. Trump's ex-lawyer admits lying to Congress It's big news. But lots more happened this week - here's a look at some of the other things you may have missed. On Tuesday multiple US media outlets reported on what appears to be a draft plea deal that was presented by the special counsel's office to Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and a former employee of the conspiracy website InfoWars. The agreement, which closely resembles documents filed by Mr Mueller's team in other cases, says that long-time Trump associate and former campaign adviser Roger Stone (identified as ""person 1"") asked Mr Corsi on 25 July, 2016 - in the middle of the presidential campaign season - to reach out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange days after the group had released hacked Democratic National Committee emails and documents. Michael Cohen, Roger Stone and Julian Assange Mr Stone, according to an email cited by the agreement, wanted to find out what other illicitly gained information WikiLeaks (""organisation 1"") possessed. On 2 August, Mr Corsi emailed Stone saying there were two new email dumps coming - with damaging information about Mrs Clinton's health and the Clinton Foundation. (WikiLeaks would publish Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's hacked emails 10 weeks later, complete with some embarrassing details but not on her health or charitable foundation matters.) A few weeks after that Corsi email, on 21 August, Mr Stone sent out a tweet that has become a central part of the investigation into whether anyone connected to Mr Trump had advance knowledge of the WikiLeaks hacked emails. ""Trust me,"" Mr Stone wrote, ""it will soon be Podesta's time in the barrel."" On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Mr Corsi had told a grand jury empanelled by the special counsel that Mr Stone had asked him to help come up with a ""cover story"" for that Podesta tweet. In the draft deal, Mr Corsi would have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his efforts to contact Mr Assange, who has confined himself to the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden for sexual assault charges since August 2012. He would also admit to deleting relevant emails in an effort to obstruct the investigation. Julian Assange Mr Corsi says he rejected the deal because he did not knowingly lie to investigators and a sealed guilty plea might have resulted in the revocation of his licence to work as a financial securities broker. Mr Stone has confirmed the authenticity of the emails, but he denies having any advance knowledge about the WikiLeaks documents. He told the Washington Post that he was only engaging in ""political gossip"". The special counsel's office has declined to comment on the authenticity of the draft deal or anything else related to this story. In previous indictments, the special counsel has alleged that Russia was behind the hacks of Mr Podesta and Democratic Party officials - a conclusion echoed by the US intelligence community. It has also asserted that WikiLeaks was the outlet chosen by the Russians to inject the purloined documents into the US political bloodstream during the hotly contested presidential elections. Now, it appears, Mr Mueller's team is aggressively pursuing inquiries into whether there are any lines that go from WikiLeaks directly to the Trump campaign. Mr Stone, who has said in the past that he suspects he will be indicted at some point, could be a key piece of the puzzle. The Corsi news is particularly noteworthy because it pulls the curtain back a bit on the next phase of the Mueller investigation - the heart of his mandate to probe possible ties between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. It wasn't the only bit of relevant news on the special counsel investigation this week, however. On WednesdayCNN offered the first possible glimpse at the answers Mr Trump gave the special counsel,externalin response to written questions related to the Russia probe. The president, according to two sources, writes that he did not talk to Mr Stone about WikiLeaks and had no prior knowledge about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr and other campaign officials and a group of Russians. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? All you need to know about Trump Russia story Mr Trump Jr had been told prior to the meeting that the Russians had information that would incriminate Democrat Hillary Clinton, as part of that country's alleged efforts to support the Trump campaign. ""If it's what you say I love it,"" the eldest Trump son replied in an email. The president has publicly denied any advanced knowledge of this meeting and insisted that it was a routine effort to gather information about a political opponent that ended in nothing. Now it seems he has made similar statements under oath - although the CNN sources say the president qualified his answers by writing that they were ""to the best of his recollection"". Needless to say, if evidence emerges that Mr Trump was informed in advance of the Trump Tower meeting - which included Trump Jr, Manafort and son-in-law Jared Kushner - that could be politically and, at this point, legally explosive. California congressman Adam Schiff, who is set to chair the House Intelligence Committee when Democrats take control of the chamber in January, says one of the first things he will investigate is whether Mr Trump Jr spoke with his father about the meeting. In particular, he says he's interested in a phone call the son made to a blocked number the evening after his ""I love it"" email confirming the meeting with the Russians. ""Republicans refused to look at the phone records so that we could find out [the recipient of the call] because they were afraid of what the answer might be,"" Mr Schifftold USA Today,external. According toan article in Observer.com,external, however, Mr Trump Jr's attitude toward the inquiry is a ""yawn"". The website - formerly the New York Observer, which Trump son-in-law Kushner purchased in 2006 - cites a friend of Mr Trump Jr's saying the number wasn't blocked, it was ""private"" and that he makes thousands of calls a day and can't be expected to remember each one. Speaking of explosive revelations, on Tuesday morning the Guardian reported that Manafort met with Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2013, 2015 and March 2016, just as Manafort was pushing to get involved in the Trump campaign. If true, this could be another possible line between WikiLeaks and the Trump team - and would be of considerable interest to the special counsel's office. There are a number of big ""buts"" to attach to this story, however. First, the Guardian has weakened the language of the article since it was first published, with the addition of some conditional tenses and words like ""apparent"" and ""might have"". Second, WikiLeaks has vehemently denied the story, questioning the author's credibility and threatening a lawsuit for libel against the newspaper. Manafort, as well, has pushed back against report, saying he never met Mr Assange. Then again, WikiLeaks and Mr Assange also denied having any contact with long-time Trump associate Roger Stone - andit later turned out they were in communication,externalin October 2016. Other news organisations have yet to independently confirm any of the Guardian's reporting. That this story came out on the heels of Mr Mueller's court filing that Manafort had repeatedly lied and was in violation of his plea agreement to co-operate with the investigators has raised eyebrows, however. The special counsel's office has told the judge overseeing the case that it will offer a ""detailed sentencing submission"" that explains the extent of Manafort's misconduct. If the submission is made public, it could be extremely revealing. CNN's Carl Bernstein has also reported that the special counsel's office is investigating a May 2017 trip Manafort made to Ecuador, where he met that nation's president, Lenin Moreno. The Ecuadorian president's office has explained that the meeting was regarding Chinese investment in a state-owned power company, but Mr Mueller's team is reportedly interested in whether Mr Assange or WikiLeaks came up in conversations. Manafort flanks Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention, when campaign manager In more Assange news, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press tried to convince a federal judge on Tuesday to reveal whether the WikiLeaks founder had been secretly indicted by the US government. The effort relates to the accidental inclusion of Mr Assange's name in an unrelated indictment, prompting speculation that a government lawyer had used an Assange-related document as a template and forgotten to change all the references. ""The only thing we've admitted is we made a mistake,"" a government lawyer told the judge. What does the special counsel do? The tactics of a Russian troll farm If Mr Assange does have secret charges filed against him, there's further details on the nature of the indictment - and whether it's at all related to Mr Mueller's probe. The reporters group ""makes a compelling argument that the public has a right to know what the charges are now that the cat is three-quarters of the way out of the bag,""a lawyer for Assange told ABC News,externalafter the lawsuit was filed. The judge said the parties in the case have two weeks to make further arguments in the case before she renders her decision. In his recent book, Trump's Enemy, former Trump presidential campaign manager Corey Lewandowski writes that, for all his grousing about the ""witch hunt"" investigation, the president himself feels the Mueller probe has made him politically more powerful. ""I think it makes my base stronger,"" Mr Trump tells Lewandowski in the book. ""I would have never said this to you. But I think the level of love now is far greater than when we won."" Will the love still be there after Mr Mueller is done? It's now closer to the day Mr Trump could be re-elected than it is to the day he first won. The time is coming when voters will have a chance to prove him right - or wrong.

"It's the story that has dominated Donald Trump's presidency. But it's complicated. Let's take a step back. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Mr Trump. A special counsel looked into whether anyone from his campaign colluded in the effort. After two years, we have a 448-page report in which the special counsel finds no evidence the campaign conspired with Russia. No, Robert Mueller also looked at 10 instances where the president obstructed justice. But he was unable to decide whether they amounted to a crime. His report also found that the Russian government did interfere in the election. Not really. We found out he tried to fire Mr Mueller. He had called it a witch hunt from the start. No. It was conducted by the hugely respected Mr Mueller, a Republican who used to run the FBI. There were several meetings between senior members of Mr Trump's team with Russian officials. Several meetings were not initially disclosed. Ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador to the US before Mr Trump took office. The president's son, Donald Jr, met a Russian lawyer who said she had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton during the campaign. He brought charges against several of Mr Trump's inner circle. Ex-adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released emails belonging to Democratic officials that had allegedly been hacked by Russians. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion and received a 36-month prison sentence. And former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to the FBI about his work in Ukraine, according to special counsel Robert Mueller, with whom he had been co-operating. Manafort has been jailed for bank fraud. Since he fired the man leading one of the investigations, ex-FBI Director James Comey, there were questions about whether he obstructed justice.

"Phyllis Harvey died nearly two years ago at the age of 88 A church treasurer said she was shocked by the extortionate cost of her mother's funeral - and immediately saved hundreds of pounds by searching for a better price. Chris Harvey said she was quoted more than Â£4,000, even though family members could walk to the church. The Â£2bn funeral services sector now faces a major investigation. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had ""serious concerns"" about above-inflation price rises. Mrs Harvey said her mother, Phyllis Harvey, died nearly two years ago. She told the hospice where her mother died that she was likely to use the same local funeral director that she had used when her father died years earlier. Only later did she discover the business had become part of the Dignity chain. She was unhappy that they appeared to be initially unaware of where her mother's body was being held. She was also shocked by the cost, when she eventually found out how much it would be, describing it as extortionate. ""We could just walk to the church, so it was an extraordinary amount of money,"" Mrs Harvey said. As a church treasurer herself, she knew that relatively little of that money went to the church. She looked on her phone for a better price with another funeral director and said she saved Â£1,400 and received ""a better service"". The family donated those savings to the hospice where Phyllis had been looked after before her death. Mrs Harvey said she was pleased with the CMA investigation: ""They should be more transparent about prices. People do not want to talk about it, but it is important."" The CMA found that people typically spent between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000 organising a funeral, with the average price of the core elements now standing at Â£4,271. The average cremation fee was Â£737 last year, with the fees having risen by 84% in the past 10 years. The CMA report found: The cost of essential elements have risen by more than two-thirds in a decade That is three times the rate of the rise of prices in general, as measured by inflation Those on the lowest incomes could face funeral costs that amount to nearly 40% of their annual outgoings That is more than the amount spent on food, clothing and energy combined in a year The regulator said that these price rises did not appear to be justified by the equivalent rise in providers' own costs or matched by improvements in the quality of service. It has spent six months studying the sector. In Scotland, the national funeral inspector is set to report to the Scottish Parliament on the standard of funeral directors. People arranging a funeral could save more than Â£1,000 by shopping around for a funeral, the CMA said. However, the regulator pointed out that grieving families would be distressed and not in a position to do so. Most prices were not available or clear online, it added. ""People mourning the loss of a loved one are extremely vulnerable and at risk of being exploited,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA. ""We need to make sure that they are protected at such an emotional time, and we're very concerned about the substantial increases in funeral prices over the past decade."" One comparison site - Beyond - said that the UK's funeral sector had been ""allowed to become like the Wild West"". ""It is still true that very few people - only 4% - actually [shop around], often because of a very British taboo around death and being seen to 'shop around' for funeral prices,"" said co-founder Ian Strang. The CMA also said that smaller funeral directors had tried to keep the costs low, but larger chains had consistently increased prices. Following the CMA announcement, the share price of Dignity - one of the largest providers - fell by nearly 16%. ""We're fully committed to ensuring vulnerable consumers are protected. In January this year we started materially reducing our prices,"" said Mike McCollum, chief executive of Dignity. ""We've already started publishing our prices online and will make further improvements before the end of March 2019."" Death in data: What happens at the end of life? 'How could I find Â£3,000 to pay for my mum's funeral?' Watch: Deciding where to bury your parents if they were not born in the UK The Co-op, another large provider, said it had reduced prices on its ""affordable funerals"" and introduced simpler options in the past three years. There is a state safety net,the Funeral Expenses Payment,external, available to people on certain benefits, but critics say it still leaves a shortfall that has to be picked up by families. The report was ""clearly a wake-up call"" for the profession, said Terry Tennens, chief executive of the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors. It has urged members to put prices on their websites. ""The public would benefit from more information about how to arrange a funeral, covering quality and costs,"" he said. A separate inquiry by the Treasury into the pre-paid funeral sector is continuing. Many of these plans do not cover costs such as embalming, limousines, a funeral service, a wake, burial plots or memorial stones. In some cases, families are left having to find an extra Â£2,000, even though they expect such items to be included. The government is considering a move that would mean tougher regulation of pre-paid funerals. Were you to buy the parts of a funeral separately, rather than as a plan, these would be the typical costs - although they can vary significantly in different parts of the UK: Moving deceased to Chapel of Rest Â£99; hearse and chauffeur Â£315; coffin Â£275 to Â£1,500 or more; minister or officiant fee Â£148; funeral director's professional fees Â£1,000 to Â£1,500 Cremation costs: Cremation fee Â£660; cremation urn Â£200; ash plot Â£450; doctor's fees (not payable in Scotland) Â£164 Burial costs: Interment fee (grave-digging and backfilling for a single depth grave) Â£150 to Â£1,734; burial plot cost Â£280 to Â£5,000 or more; stone memorial Â£800 to Â£1,200 or more Optional costs: Embalming Â£136 to Â£165; limousine and chauffeur Â£305; flowers Â£151; order of service sheets Â£72; church service Â£98 to Â£149; catering Â£397 Source: Fairer Finance 'How could I find Â£3,000?'

"Tarana Burke told the TEDWomen conference MeToo had a long way to go The founder of the MeToo movement has said that the campaign against sexual violence she began more than a decade ago has become ""unrecognisable"" to her. Speaking at TEDWomen in Palm Springs, Tarana Burke said a media backlash had framed the movement as a witch hunt. ""Suddenly, a movement to centre survivors of sexual violence is being talked about as a vindictive plot against men,"" she said. ""Victims are heard and then vilified."" She was keen to get back to the original intention she had for MeToo when, in 2006, she wrote the words on a piece of paper as a way of starting an action plan to do something about the sexual violence she saw in her community. The phrase became a globally used hashtag last year in the wake of allegations made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein but Ms Burke says she feels the campaign is neglecting those it was set up to help. What has #MeToo actually changed? Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo Has #MeToo divided women? ""My vision for the Me Too movement is part of a collective vision to see a world free of sexual violence,"" she told delegates at the TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference. ""This is a movement about the one in four girls and the one in six boys who are sexually abused every year, and who carry those wounds into adulthood,"" she says. Ms Burke said in the wake of events like Brett Kavanaugh being appointed to the Supreme Court despite facing allegations of sexual misconduct - which he denied - US politicians seemed to be ""pivoting away from the issue"". ""This movement has been called a watershed moment but some days I wake up feeling that all the evidence points to the contrary,"" she said. She ended her talk with a plea that victims not be forced to relive their traumas by speaking about them and she called for the fight against ""power and privilege"" to continue. ""We have to re-educate ourselves and our children to understand that power and privilege doesn't always have to destroy and take - it can be used to serve and build,"" she said.

"A woman lost a third of her bodyweight after surgery to remove a 26kg ovarian cyst - the weight of seven newborn babies. Despite multiple negative pregnancy tests, doctors insisted Keely Favell must be pregnant as her stomach grew in size. When asked questions about baby due dates, she spared people's embarrassment by playing along. But the 28-year-old believed herself to be ""just fat"". Ms Favell, from Swansea, started gaining weight in 2014. ""I've always been chunky, but over the course of a couple of years, I gradually got this tummy,"" she said. ""It crept up so slowly that I didn't know anything was wrong - I just thought I was putting on timber. ""I've been with my partner Jamie Gibbins for 10 years and we did wonder a few times if I was pregnant - but we did home tests and they always ruled it out."" She said it was ""so embarrassing"" explaining she was not pregnant: ""I'd go along with it to spare everyone the blushes."" After blacking out in her office admin job, Ms Favell plucked up the courage to see a GP in 2016, who said she must be pregnant despite blood negative tests. ""Looking at me, anyone would have thought I was nine months gone. It is a fluid-filled sac that develops on a woman's ovary. They are very common and do not usually cause any symptoms Most ovarian cysts occur naturally and disappear in a few months without needing any treatment Cysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or they may only affect one They only causes symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large, or blocks the blood supply to the ovaries Some of the symptoms can include pelvic pain, pain during sex, needing to go to the toilet regularly, bloating and swollen stomach ""It wasn't the first time I'd been mistaken for an expectant mum... People had seen me waddling around, carrying this lump, and I'd been asked a few times when I was due."" Still believing Ms Favell to be pregnant, her GP referred her for an ultrasound scan in January last year. ""I was lying there with Jamie beside me as the radiologist moved the probe over my tummy. I saw her eyes widen in horror, but the screen was just blank. ""The look on her face said it all - something was wrong, and when she said she had to get a consultant I started to panic. Jamie did his best to reassure me but I felt paralysed with fear."" She was sent for an emergency CT scan which revealed a cyst surrounded by fluid. ""[The consultant] told me I wasn't fat all - I was actually quite thin."" Ms Favell was referred to a high-risk obstetrics consultant and examined in February last year. Keely Favell and her partner of 10 years Jamie Gibbins ""By this time, even walking was a struggle and I had difficulty breathing. ""I'll never forget the look of shock on his face when the consultant examined me. He said I had a large ovarian mass and the only option was surgery.

"There has been a worldwide resurgence of measles, with many countries experiencing ""severe and protracted"" outbreaks last year, a report warns. The World Health Organization data shows a rise in cases in almost every region of the world, with 30% more cases in 2017 than 2016. Experts say complacency, collapsing health systems and a rise in fake news about the vaccine are behind the rise. They say the measles vaccines can save millions of lives. Measles is a highly contagious disease that in severe cases can lead to complications such as blindness, pneumonia and infection and swelling of the brain. The report,external, put together by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at measles cases over the past 17 years. Experts say this is the first year there has been a sustained increase in cases, with 110,000 measles-related deaths. And they are concerned that trends for 2018 are similar after cases reached a high in Europe in the summer. Measles cases hit record high in Europe Big rebound in measles in Europe Russia trolls 'spreading vaccine discord' The Americas, Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean region saw the greatest upsurge in cases. The Western Pacific region was the only area to see a decline. A large number of infections were seen in Venezuela, as health systems collapsed after political and economic crises. The country had previously eliminated the disease. And there are now concerns that as more people move between countries in the region, the disease could continue to spread. Meanwhile the Ukraine, Italy, France, Germany and Greece all saw an increase in cases in the past few years. In the UK, which wasdeclared free of the disease by the WHOlast year, there have also been small outbreaks in 2018. This ledEngland's top doctor to urge parents to get their children vaccinatedand ignore anti-vaccine myths. Dr Martin Friede, of the WHO, told the BBC that it was worrying that in a number of European countries parents were not vaccinating their children. He said: ""Probably in Europe, more than other regions, we are seeing vaccine hesitancy becoming more of a problem than elsewhere. ""In some groups, this is driven by religious beliefs but in quite a few populations it is spread by false concerns about the safety of vaccines."" Dr Friede said that social media was playing a part in this and that new ways must be found to counter misinformation. He said: ""Industrialised countries must not be complacent and forget that the disease can come back like a storm. ""It doesn't take many unvaccinated children for that to happen and when it happens, measles is not just a rash - it can cause blindness and brain problems."" The report estimates that since 2000, the two doses of measles vaccines given to young children have saved more than 21 million lives. But Dr Soumya Swaminathan, of the WHO, said: ""Without urgent efforts to increase vaccination coverage and identify populations with unacceptable levels of under- or unimmunized children, we risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating but entirely preventable disease.""

"This video can not be played Ed Farmer's father tells Today that students involved in future initiations should be expelled Students who defy university rules to organise alcohol-heavy ""initiation"" events should be kicked out, according to the father of a student who died. Ed Farmer, 20, went into cardiac arrest after a bar crawl organised by a Newcastle university student society. His father, Jeremy, told  BBC Radio 4's Today he had been expected to consume large quantities of spirits. Mr Farmer wants students to understand that binge drinking could be lethal and says such ""coercive"" rituals must end. According to his dad, Ed, from Leicester, had a big smile, and liked to have a pint. But as a new student in an initiation ritual for the student agricultural society, he was expected to drink large amounts of spirits. Theinquest into his deathheard rounds of more than 100 triple vodkas were ordered during the evening out in Newcastle. Mr Farmer said for Â£30 the freshers were able to buy more than 50 shots each. Bottles of spirits were also passed around in the street.  A delay in taking Ed to hospital after he passed out at a student house led to irreversible brain damage and his death. He described how he first knew something was wrong when a police car arrived at their house early in the morning. ""When the police had left the house I was 99% certain that he would be a cabbage. Helen, my wife, was more optimistic,"" he said. ""But certainly when we got up to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, they did say that he was in a very serious state. They'd done a brain scan and the brain was dead. ""So our reaction was well, in that case, turn him off. There is no point in keeping him alive."" Mr Farmer said nobody had admitted responsibility during the inquest. ""We certainly don't blame the students who were part of the initiation process,"" he said. ""I think we don't ultimately blame the university. ""It's just a lack of understanding on the university's part of the problem that they have got and I think it's been quite a shock to them to understand the seriousness of the problem."" Mr Farmer said initiation ceremonies were banned at universities across the country but the ban was not being implemented. He pressed for a ""line in the sand"" to be drawn so that ""from here on in everybody knows initiations are banned and if you step over that line you will be removed from university"".

"A roadside drug test labelled old candy floss, also known as cotton candy, as a dangerous drug A Georgia woman spent three months in jail after her bag of candy floss was mistaken for methamphetamine owing to a defective drug test, says a lawsuit. Dasha Fincher, 41, is suing Monroe County, the police and a drug test company over the alleged mix-up during a traffic stop on New Year's Eve 2016. The 41-year-old was held in custody because she could not afford her $1m (Â£780,000) bond. The legal action argues the county violated her civil rights. 'My life was ruined by a police typo' US man 'mistakenly injected with drugs' She was arrested and charged with meth trafficking and possession of meth with intent to distribute, according to the lawsuit. The court documents say she was improperly detained from 31 December 2016 until 4 April, when her charges of drug possession and trafficking were dropped. Dasha Fincher says she missed the birth of her twin grandsons due to the wrongful jailing A state crime laboratory had already tested the bag of light blue candy floss - known as cotton candy in the US - and determined on 22 March it contained no drugs. Ms Fincher says she missed important life events due to the unlawful jailing, including the birth of her twin grandsons and the chance to care for her daughter after a miscarriage. In addition, the arrest remains on her record despite her innocence, according to the lawsuit. Ms Fincher is seeking damages for negligence and wrongful actions, as determined by a jury, from Monroe County, the two officers who arrested her and the test manufacturer Sirchie. County officials and Sirchie did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A 2016 ProPublica investigation,externalfound that cheap roadside drug tests ""routinely produce false positives"" that result in tens of thousands of Americans being wrongfully jailed. According to a list compiled by the Washington Post,external, roadside tests have labelled cookies, mints, deodorant, and tea, among other harmless materials, as drugs.

"Slag heaps may have the potential to absorb CO2 Is it remotely feasible to remove 12 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air? Every year. For decades to come. That's the challenge posed by the latest conclusions of the UN's climate science panel. It says that only by pulling this heat-trapping gas out of the atmosphere can we avoid dangerous climate change. But according to one leading researcher, there's a bit of a hitch: ""We haven't a clue how to do it"". The problem is that scientists reckon that even if the world manages to cut emissions of the gas, it will no longer be enough to avoid the worst impacts. We've got to go a step further, they say, and find ways of doing something never attempted before: get rid of the gas that's already out there.  And get started on it as soon as possible. On an unimaginable scale. The most headline-grabbing solution is forgiant machines to filter the air and strip out the gas, as my colleague Matt McGrath has reported. But although the costs are falling, they remain very high and many wonder whether it's feasible to plaster the planet with so much hardware. Forests do the job of soaking up carbon dioxide, because the trees need it to grow, but if they're left to rot or are burned, the gas will be released back out again. There are schemes for fertilising the oceans to encourage plankton to flourish, absorb COâ and drag it to the ocean floor - but there are risks of unintended consequences. Plants are being fed on soil enriched with volcanic powder Yet another avenue is to mimic a geological process known as weathering, in which rocks are broken down in a chemical reaction that draws carbon dioxide from the air. This happens all the time naturally but took off in spectacular fashion more than 400 million years ago. In an ancient chain reaction, as land-based plants evolved to become larger, it's believed their roots sought to extract more mineral nutrients from the rocks, eroding them and exposing them to the air. That in turn led to a massive reduction in COâ in the atmosphere. Could the same effect be repeated? Prof David Beerling hopes so. A scientist at Sheffield University, he's leading a ten-year project with a Â£10m budget from theLeverhulme Trust,externalto investigate the climate potential of rock. The concept is to take the volcanic rock basalt, grind it up into a powder and then scatter it on fields. Trials on a research farm in Illinois have found that the basalt acts as a fertiliser, boosting crop yields, which might help persuade farmers to use it instead of high-carbon artificial fertiliser. And early results from smaller experiments in Prof Beerling's lab in Sheffield show a more profound benefit: that the presence of the rock in the soil also boosts the amount of carbon dioxide that's taken up, maybe by as much as four times. The powdered volcanic rock can be added to fields to try to trap CO2 As part of the project, trials using basalt have started in Malaysia and Australia to see how different environments affect the results. The vision is for the biggest emitters such as the US, China and Brazil to take this up, use basalt on their vast agri-businesses and - ideally - soak up a few billion tonnes of COâ. Prof Beerling knows that some regard this as over-optimistic but he is clear that a grand strategy is needed. ""Once COâ goes up into the air, it doesn't come down unless you do something about it, and the effects last for millennia. And once the ice sheets go, that's it,"" with millions of people living on or close to coastlines at risk. ""At the moment we have no idea how to remove billions of tonnes of COâ from the atmosphereâ¦ it's an enormous technological challenge that dwarfs anything we've seen before."" If it all had to be freshly dug up, the environmental cost might doom the idea from the start. But the industrial age has cleared billions of tonnes of the right kind of rock from open-cast mines and has also generated massive amounts of ""slag"" - waste from iron and steel production - which could also be used. The practical challenges are obviously immense. But the slag itself, which historically was dumped unwanted in mountainous heaps, is surprisingly good at trapping COâ. Dr Phil Renforth of Cardiff University has been gathering samples from some forgotten corners of Britain's industrial heritage. I joined him on a dark hillside in south Wales. ""Globally we produce half a billion tonnes of slag around the world,"" he said, ""and that could capture something on the order of a quarter of a billion tonnes of COâ. ""So it's not going to do everything but it might be relevant for us."" That's a question that usually produces shrugs. Too little is known at this stage. I ask Prof Beerling when the basalt-spraying technique might be in use, assuming it's eventually proven to work on a large scale. ""The infrastructure for farmers to deploy basalt on their crops is already in place. If proven safe and effective, it might be deployable within a decade or two,"" he says. Yet all the time, even more COâ is being added to the atmosphere - and with few options for reversing it.

"Rahim Mohammadi told jurors they were ""sending an innocent man to prison."" A man murdered an elderly widow with a lawnmower flex to avoid being thrown off his allotment, a court heard. Rahim Mohammadi strangled 80-year-old Lea Adri-Soejoko with the cord and hid her body at Colindale allotments in north London in February last year. Mrs Adri-Soejoko, the secretary of Colindale Allotment Association, was found in a locked mower shed. Mohammadi, 42, was found guilty of murder and will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on Friday. He had a reputation for being ""threatening"" and having a ""volatile"" temper, the court heard. Prosecutor John Price QC had told jurors Mrs Adri-Soejoko had been assaulted by the defendant and then killed to ""stop her complaining"". Lea Adri-Soejoko was secretary for the allotments where her body was found Five months before the attack Mrs Adri-Soejoko, had a ""notorious"" run-in with Mohammadi, from Hackney, at a growers' meeting. During a heated discussion over evictions, she had told him to ""shut up"" and Mohammadi called her a ""bloody old witch"", the court heard. The Iranian had been involved with the allotment since 2008 through Freedom from Torture, an organisation helping torture victims suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The court heard he had ambitions to take over running the allotment, making Mrs Adri-Soejoko wary of him. On the day of the murder Mohammadi assaulted Mrs Adri-Soejoko on the allotment, causing bruises and fractures to the ribs, jurors were told. Mr Price said: ""Mrs Adri-Soejoko was beaten up. That in turn does point to a motive for her murder - to avoid detection for a shocking and very serious assault on a vulnerable old lady."" Mrs Adri-Soejoko's body was found in a lock-up store at the allotments The victim's body was locked up in the mower shed, which only four key-holders had access to, one of whom was Mohammadi. Police found the body by following the sound of her ringing phone found before Mohammadi could cover up the crime. She was wearing Wellington boots and an apron and had the shed keys in her pocket. Mohammadi's DNA was found on the cord used to strangle Mrs Adri-Soejoko and he was captured on CCTV coming and going from the allotment, jurors were told. In police interviews, Mohammadi gave different and inconsistent accounts of his movements. Giving evidence, he said he had gone to the allotments to buy opium for his bad back on the day of the killing. He claimed he heard shouting but dismissed it as a drunken fight. The court was told Mohammadi sought political asylum in Britain in 2005 and was given indefinite leave to remain in 2010. As he was led from the dock, Mohammadi turned to the jury and said: ""You will have that on your conscience sending an innocent man to prison."" Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh, of the Met Police, said: ""This crime has torn a family apart and sent shockwaves through a close-knit community. ""Mohammadi is a violent, evil, and volatile individual and he will spend many years in prison as a result of his appalling actions.""

"""Anne"" spent Â£50,000 in legal fees A woman whose ex-husband was convicted of rape and possessing child abuse images had to go to court to prevent him gaining access to her children, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned. Anne (not her real name) spent Â£50,000 in legal fees after social workers said he should be able to see them. A court order now prevents the man from contacting them, but Anne said she ""really had to fight"" for the ruling. Campaigners now want a change in law. It comes after one victim of the Rotherham child exploitation scandal,Sammy Woodhouse, said the man who had raped herhad been contacted by Rotherham Council about care proceedings involving her son last year. ""Anne"" was married to her abuser for more than a decade and had a number of children with him. Over time that relationship became abusive and she was raped. Then, one day the police turned up at her house, searched the property and child abuse images were found on her ex-husband's computer. The man was eventually convicted and jailed for 10 years. But, Anne said, since being in prison he had made ""many attempts to see my children"" and she had been contacted by social workers. ""They came to my house and basically said it was absolutely paramount that the children saw him,"" she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""I felt very very uneasy about it."" She said the social workers ""knew how dangerous he was, because they'd been tipped off by police about the exact extent of what he was looking at"". But, she added: ""They just think families are better with fathers. And that families have to work together."" The case went to the courts and Anne said she had ""sort of naively assumed nobody would have access to children, certainly once they'd got a conviction for child abuse"". ""But it wasn't as simple as that. ""I basically had to fight him in the courts over a long period of time even after his conviction. ""He's a convicted sex offender. He's a convicted paedophile. He's a rapist. He shouldn't be having any parental rights."" Following the legal fight, which took five years, the man is no longer allowed access to his children - or to contact them directly or via a third party. ""It felt like the right decision but it was something I had to really fight for. You know it was almost like a full-time job,"" Anne said. She added that the legal fees had amounted to about Â£50,000. Anne came forward to the Victoria Derbyshire programme having heard the experiences of Ms Woodhouse, who waived her right to anonymity in an effort to help other victims, Labour MP for Rotherham Sarah Champion told the programme, following Ms Woodhouse's testimony, that many more women would be in the same situation. ""This sort of things just keeps on happening,"" she said. ""It's well known that the family courts are used by perpetrators to get access to victims, re-traumatise their victims."" Sammy Woodhouse said a man who had raped her had been contacted by Rotherham Council about care proceedings involving their son One leading family barrister and head of the Transparency Project, Lucy Reed, explained that the current law was ""derived from our obligations under human rights legislation that a child has the right to family life - and especially a child with an established family life with a father"". She added consideration needed to be given where, for example, a child already had a relationship with a parent who is later convicted of rape, and wanted that to continue.

"Ukrainian cities like Mariupol largely depend on access to the sea US President Donald Trump has cancelled a planned meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over a naval clash between Ukraine and Russia. On Sunday Russian border guards fired on three Ukrainian ships and seized their crews off the Crimean Peninsula. Mr Trump said he would not meet Mr Putin at a G20 summit in the coming days, ""based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed the crisis ""entirely"" on Russia. She said she would raise the issue with President Putin at the G20 meeting, which is due to be held in Argentina on Friday and Saturday. Angela Merkel said only ""sensible dialogue"" would solve the crisis Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has urged Nato to send ships to the area. He has implemented martial law across Ukraine's border regions for 30 days in response to the crisis. Why Ukraine-Russia sea clash is fraught with risk The sea clash explained in 300 words On Thursday he announced that Russians living in Ukraine would soon face restrictions on bank withdrawals, changing foreign currency and travelling abroad. The incident happened on Sunday, when two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug were sailing from Odessa to the port of Mariupol, in the Sea of Azov - which is shared between Russia and Ukraine. The vessels were stopped from entering the Kerch Strait and confronted by FSB border guards. After a lengthy standoff, during which the Ukrainian tug was rammed, the ships began turning back towards Odessa, the Ukrainian government says. The Russians opened fire, wounding at least three sailors, and seized the Ukrainian flotilla. The Kerch Strait separates Russia from Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula that was annexed by Russia in 2014. Who controls the waters? Ukraine says Russia is deliberately blockading Mariupol and another Ukrainian port on the Sea of Azov, Berdyansk. The 24 captured Ukrainian sailors have now been given two months in pre-trial detention by a court in Crimea. This video can not be played Ukraine-Russia sea clash: Are Ukrainians worried? Mr Trump tweeted that ""it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting"" with Mr Putin, adding that he was looking forward to a ""meaningful summit... as soon as this situation is resolved"".

Speaking alongside Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman in Berlin on Thursday, she said the latest crisis was ""entirely the doing of the Russian president"" and accused Moscow of violating a 2003 agreement guaranteeing free movement in the area. ""I want the Ukrainian soldiers released,"" she said. ""The Ukrainian side has asked us to act wisely. There is no military solution to these problems."" Petro Poroshenko asked: ""What will Putin do next if we do not stop him?"" Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic and defence correspondent The call for Nato to deploy warships to the Sea of Azov raises a variety of diplomatic and practical problems. In strict legal terms, Russia and Ukraine share access to its waters under a 2003 treaty. This, though, specifically states that warships from third countries can only enter the sea or make port visits there with the express permission of the other party. Russia is hardly likely to give such permission. In practical terms, it could easily block the Kerch Strait as it did earlier this week, by placing a merchant vessel across the channel. Nato in any case might see such a visit as more likely to inflame tensions. It's more likely that Nato might seek to boost its naval deployments to the Black Sea, where its members - Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey -  are uneasy about Russia's more assertive behaviour. Indeed, the alliance says that its vessels have already spent some 120 days on patrol or exercises in the Black Sea this year, compared with 80 in 2017. Mr Putin called the sea clash ""a provocation"" organised by Ukraine's authorities ""in the run-up to the Ukrainian presidential election"". Mr Poroshenko has low popularity ratings. Recent polls suggest that only about 10% of the electorate plans to vote for him next year, with nearly 50% saying they would not vote for him under any circumstances, the Kyiv Post newspaper reported. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Putin added that Mr Poroshenko's decision to impose martial law after a mere ""border incident"" was extreme, because it was not even imposed during the conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russian state media report that Moscow has delivered a battalion of S-400 surface-to-air missiles to north Crimea, and also plans to build a new missile early-warning radar station there. Mr Putin insisted that Russia's military response was appropriate as the Ukrainians had ""trespassed"" into Russia's territorial waters. However,Ukrainian officials published a map on Wednesday,external, placing all three Ukrainian boats just outside Crimea's territorial waters at the time they were seized.

"Japanese pilot Katsutoshi Jitsukawa failed a breath test 50 minutes before he was due to fly A Japanese pilot has been jailed after being caught more than nine times over the alcohol limit as he prepared to fly a passenger jet from Heathrow airport. Judge Phillip Matthews condemned Katsutoshi Jitsukawa, 42, saying the prospect of him flying the Japan Airlines (JAL) plane was ""too appalling to contemplate"". Jitsukawa, of no fixed abode, was sentenced to 10 months in prison at Isleworth Crown Court. He said he felt an ""abject disgrace"". He wasarrested on 28 October at the airport after failing a breath test50 minutes before the Japan Airlines (JAL) flight to Tokyo was due to fly with him in the cockpit. He was found to have 189mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system - the legal limit for a pilot is 20mg. The drink-drive limit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is 80mg per 100ml of blood. Jitsukawa admitted to one count of performing an aviation function when his ability was impaired through alcohol. Judge Phillip Matthews described the co-pilot, who has since lost his job, as ""very intoxicated"" ahead of the 28 October flight. ""You are an experienced pilot but you had clearly been drinking for a long period up to a time shortly before you were due to go into that plane,"" the judge said. ""Most important is the safety of all persons on board that very long-haul flight, potentially 12 hours or more. Their safety was put at risk by your inebriation and drunkenness. ""The prospect of you taking over control of that aircraft is too appalling to contemplate. The potential consequences for those on board was catastrophic."" Jitsukawa was caught after security noticed he smelled of alcohol, appeared drunk and had ""glazed eyes"". An officer later noticed he had ""difficulty standing straight"". Yasuhiro Kikuchi, a vice president for Japan Airlines, apologised outside court and said colleagues did not cover up Jitsukawa's actions The judge suggested Jitsukawa put colleagues in a position of either performing a ""cover up"" or reporting him to superiors. Speaking outside court, the company's vice president Yasuhiro Kikuchi denied Jitsukawa's colleagues acted improperly. ""As an organisation we are going to work together to prevent this happening again,"" he said. Prosecutor Douglas Adams said that after he was challenged by security staff on the plane, Jitsukawa said he drank whisky the night before but had already passed a breathalyser test. After Jitsukawa said he needed to get his blazer from the plane, the security manager followed him on to find the pilot in the toilet rinsing and gargling his mouth with mouthwash, the prosecutor said. The plane, a Boeing 777 holding up to 244 passengers, departed for Tokyo after a 69 minute delay. CCTV footage shows Jitsukawa being arrested after failing a breath test Bill Emlyn Jones, mitigating, said Jitsukawa had become depressed. ""It would seem he used alcohol as a means of self-medication,"" the lawyer said. The pilot feels ""abject disgrace"" and wishes to apologise to the airline, passengers and his family ""for the shame he had brought upon them"", he added. Jitsukawa was clean-shaven and in a grey tracksuit as he appeared on a videolink from Wandsworth prison. Jitsukawa had earlier cheated on an in-house breathalyser test, taking it at a distance from the chief pilots who were supposed to oversee it, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported. Earlier this monthJapan Airlines said it would introduce a new breathalyser systemat airports abroad. Since August 2017,there have been 19 cases where Japan Airlines pilots have failed the company's alcohol tests, the company confirmed.

"This video can not be played 'From the outside, we were a normal family' A report into a father who shot dead his wife and daughter has said it is ""vital"" for all professionals to recognise signs of coercive control. Lance Hart, 57, killed his wife Claire, 50, and daughter Charlotte, 19, before killing himself, in Spalding in 2016. A council-led domestic homicide review,externalhas recommended staff training and a public awareness campaign. Hart's sons, Luke and Ryan, said there were ""potential opportunities"" for GPs and other agencies ""to step in"". Claire Hart and her children Charlotte, Luke and Ryan were unaware they were being coercively controlled by Lance Hart Ryan and Luke Hart are trying to raise awareness of coercive behaviour Safer Lincolnshire Partnership's review detailed how Mrs Hart and her three children had been suffering from coercive control abuse by her husband for many years without them realising. How to tell if your partner's controlling you 'I didn't think my father would kill' Police train to spot coercive behaviour Latest news and updates from across Lincolnshire Hart shot the pair with a single-barrel shotgun in a swimming pool car park before turning the weapon on himself. The murders happened days after Mrs Hart had left the family home following a breakdown in the couple's marriage. Hart's behaviour was not known to professionals or understood by members of his family, the report said. But health records showed Claire, Charlotte and Lance had a number of illnesses, with Hart having been prescribed anti-depressant drugs. Brothers Luke and Ryan, with their sister Charlotte Hart The review said that Mrs Hart told her GP a month before her death that pain from a facial condition she was suffering from had become worse due to ""some marital stress"". But as she did not ""indicate any domestic abuse or fear of domestic abuse"", her GP had not questioned it further. As a result, the report also recommended health professionals should question patients more about domestic abuse. ""This means it is vital for all professionals to be able to recognise the criminal cases of Coercive and Controlling and respond to them - as the victims themselves may not either see themselves as victims or be physically unable to break free,"" the report said. Luke and Ryan Hart say domestic abuse, in the form of coercive control, is not fully recognised by members of the public or authorities Ryan Hart told the BBC: ""No one knew what to look for... unfortunately it was missed by us and we lived it."" His brother Luke said: ""We were living a personal hell and our father was dangerous."" ""I think a lot of people felt afraid of asking us what was going on because of the fear our father cultivated, especially around our close family. They were all afraid of helping us because of that fear."" Luke with his sister Charlotte Coercive control became a criminal offence in 2015. Sandra Horley, from domestic violence support charity Refuge, said police and other authorities ""were having difficulty gathering evidence because they don't really understand what coercive control means - and this is across the board"". ""They haven't had sufficient training to understand the complex dynamics of domestic abuse which doesn't have to involve physical abuse,"" she added. A Home Office spokesperson said it would ""continue to work with police and prosecutors to ensure the laws are used to maximum effect"".

"Staff at Wazir Akbar Khan hospital treated the wounded A British national is among five G4S employees killed in an attack on the security firm's base in Kabul. Luke Griffin, 33 and from Merseyside, died in the attack along with four Afghans working for the security firm. Gunmen stormed the compound after a car bomb was detonated outside, according to the Afghan interior ministry. A sixth person was killed, as well as four attackers, a spokesman for Afghanistan's public health ministry said. Dozens more people were injured. G4S said the victims' next of kin had been informed. The Taliban say they committed the attack. Who are the Taliban? Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever G4S, one of the world's largest security groups, helps guard the area around the British embassy in Kabul. Charlie Burbridge, managing director of G4S Risk Management Group, said the ""unprovoked, criminal attack"" left 32 of its employees injured, five of them seriously. ""Our thoughts at this difficult time are with the loved ones of those who have died and been injured, and our brave team in Afghanistan who have lost colleagues and friends,"" he said. The attack marked the latest violence to hit the Afghan capital The Foreign Office said it was aware of the incident and was working with the authorities to establish further details. Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever The attack came hours after President Ashraf Ghani announced plans to form a team to seek a peace deal with the Taliban. Face-to-face talks would be held with the militant group, but any agreement reached would need the approval of the Afghan people.

"Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conduct A Welsh Government minister found hanged days after being sacked, told his driver ""I have brought it on myself"", an inquest has heard. Carl Sargeant, 49,was discovered dead at his homein Connah's Quay, Flintshire, on 7 November last year. The Labour AM had been accused of behaving inappropriately towards women, which he denied. The hearing was told ministerial driver Calvin Williams heard Mr Sargeant say: ""It's my own fault."" Giving evidence on day four of the  inquest, Mr Williams said he was sent to Cardiff Central Station to pick up AMs Mr Sargeant and Lesley Griffiths, before taking them to Welsh Government offices in Cathays Park on 3 November last year. He said Mr Sargeant appeared ""quite chirpy"" on the morning he dropped him off at the offices before emerging 15 minutes later looking ""very quiet"". Mr Williams said: ""I asked him 'is all okay?' He said 'no, I'm gone'."" On 7 November, following Mr Sargeant's death, Mr Williams said he made a note of the conversation he had had with Mr Sargeant four days previously. His notes said that as Mr Sargeant left the car, he said: ""It's OK. It's my own fault. I have brought it on myself."" Carl Sargeant inquest at glance Mr Sargeantfound hanged after being sacked as a cabinet ministerfor the Welsh Government His dismissal came after allegations that he acted inappropriately towards women - something he strongly denied Mr Sargeant left a letterapologising to his family and telling them: ""I have failed you."" Inquest told two""tangible complaints""made against the Labour AM in October 2017 First Minister Carwyn Jonesgave evidence on day three Mr Jones says he did not not know Mr Sargeant suffered from depression Welsh Labour leader also defended decision not to tell Mr Sargeant who his alleged accusers were. Jack Sargeant with his mother Bernadette arriving at the inquest Mr Williams said that a ""day or two"" later he was driving the First Minister Carwyn Jones and mentioned the conversation he had with the late Mr Sargeant. Asked what Mr Jones' response was, Mr Williams said: ""He didn't really give one. He was quite quiet and then he said 'do you mind if I share this with others?'"" Within a couple of days, Mr Williams said, he was asked to go to the office of senior civil servant Peter Greening with another member of staff, where he handed over the note. First minister Carwyn Jones gave evidence at the inquest on Wednesday The inquest, which is taking place in Ruthin, heard that the first minister spoke with a senior party colleague about the allegations concerning Mr Sargeant three days before announcing his cabinet reshuffle. Welsh Labour general secretary Louise Magee said: ""He (Mr Jones) told me the nature of the complaints but he didn't tell me who the women were."" Ms Magee later spoke to one of the alleged complainants - which prompted questions from coroner John Gittins. Mr Gittins asked: ""You are speaking to the woman and you are doing so because you think it's the right thing to do... you don't feel it was right to afford the same courtesy to Carl Sargeant?"" Ms Magee said it ""would have been inappropriate"" in her role. Sargeant inquest witness 'may have lied' Timeline: The death of Carl Sargeant Carl Sargeant: Profile of AM's career Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay The Welsh Labour chief said she spoke to Mr Sargeant at 13:00 GMT - after the cabinet reshuffle had been made. ""He was calm,"" Ms Magee said. ""He sounded frustrated... he hadn't been told yet whether he was being suspended or not and he did not know who had made the complaints. ""He asked 'will I find out today?' And I said 'yes, I imagine very, very soon'."" St Asaph-born Mr Sargeant learned he was suspended from the party an hour later, the inquest was told. The hearing was also told that security staff at the Welsh Assembly had been asked to change the access rights to Mr Sargeant's key card hours after he had lost his job. Craig Stephenson, director of engagement for the National Assembly for Wales, said the first staff heard about Mr Sargeant's dismissal came via social media. Mr Stephenson also said the late politician did not contact a ""support team"" which is available for AMs. Daran Hill described himself as ""Carl's closest friend"" The inquest heard that while Mr Sargeant had anticipated being suspended, he first learned about it via Twitter. Political consultant Daran Hill, who described himself as ""Carl's closest friend"", said this caused the Labour politician to lose trust with his party. Mr Hill also felt ""there had been something of a change"" in Mr Sargeant during the last period of his life. He added: ""He seemed distracted some of the time."" Feeling ""besieged"", Mr Sargeant tweeted a 102-word statement strongly denying the allegations against him. Mr Hill said the Alyn & Deeside AM ""didn't want people to feel he'd been moved from his job for incompetence"". Another friend and confidante, David Taylor, said Mr Sargeant had asked about how to delay sending a text messages. On the day of his death, Mr Sargeant sent a message saying: ""love you all x."" Mr Taylor said he tried calling back repeatedly but could not get through. He said one of Mr Sargeant's former colleagues managed to get through to the Sargeant family's landline. The inquest heard the politician's son Jack answered - minutes after they had found the body.

"The number of EU citizens moving to the UK has continued to drop, but more people coming from elsewhere means the overall migration rate is unchanged. Figures show net migration - the difference between how many people came to the UK for at least 12 months and how many left - was 273,000 last year. EU net migration was 74,000 in the year to the end of June 2018, while non-EU net migration was 248,000. The ONS,externalsaid more Asian citizens had been moving to the UK for work. The Office for National Statistics says 219,000 EU citizens arrived in the UK, as 145,000 left, making net EU migration the lowest it had been since 2012. The data also showed non-EU net migration was the highest since 2004. How has EU migration changed the UK? Jay Lindop, director of the ONS's centre for international migration, said overall net migration had peaked in 2016 and remained fairly stable since then. Overall net migration takes into account the migration of British citizens, of which 49,000 more left the country than returned in the year to the end of June 2018. In the year to the end of June 2017, EU net migration was 107,000 and non-EU net migration was 173,000. Overall net migration was 273,000 in the same period. The government's policy is to reduce overall migration to below 100,000 a year. Separately, the Home Office has released statistics on the number of British citizenship applications, which show the number of EU nationals applying has increased by almost a third over the past year. There were 43,545 requests in the 12 months to the end of September - a rise of 32% on last year. How has EU migration changed the UK?

"Mobiles.co.uk offered Phone XR contracts at cheaper rates than could be attained directly from Vodafone or other operators Carphone Warehouse-owned website Mobiles.co.uk and other online phone retailers are facing a backlash from customers wrongly refused Black Friday smartphone deals. A problem with Vodafone's credit check systems meant that some applications submitted via the contract resellers were incorrectly turned down. The BBC understands that about 5% of consumers experienced the issue. Many affected complained on social media and Trustpilot's review site. Although Vodafone is offering to recheck applications from anyone who contacts it, this has not always been communicated to the rejected customers. Carphone Warehouse-owned website Mobiles.co.uk has attracted the brunt of the fallout. This is in part because one of its iPhone XR deals gained a huge amount of publicity. But it is also related to the fact the business charges 13p a minute to call its sales helpline. Some customershave said they were on the line for more than an hour,externalwithout the matter being resolved. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Black Friday weekend represented one of the busiest times of the year for smartphone sales. In some cases, retailers took as many orders in a few days as they would normally take in two months. The BBC initially flagged the issue of rejected credit checks to Mobiles.co.uk's parent company Dixons Carphone on Monday, after noticing a number of complaints on Twitter. ""We have seen no change in our credit check 'accept rate' for this deal compared with our usual rate,"" the firm responded. A follow-up query was responded to on Wednesday with a similar reply, a statement by which the firm stands. However, when the BBC spoke to a store assistant in one of the group's Carphone Warehouse's retail outlets, it was told that the shop had repeatedly had to submit some customers' applications to get them approved, because of problems with Vodafone's systems. Mobiles.co.uk charges callers a premium phone rate It appears, however, that members of the public who used the Mobiles.co.uk website only, had their details submitted once and were sent an automated rejection email if they failed. Customers of other online retailers including Mobile Phones Direct, Affordable Mobiles and Fonehouse have reported experiencing a similar fate. ""Due to the high volume of interest in our Black Friday deals, the system dealing with credit applications from indirect partners experienced some issues,"" said a spokeswoman for Vodafone. ""This meant that a small number of applications were declined incorrectly. ""The system is now back up and running properly and we are rechecking applications from anyone who has contacted us to query our decision on their application. ""These customers will still be able to take advantage of our Black Friday offers."" Vodafone added that the follow-up checks would not affect consumers' credit scores. Warning on 'misleading' Black Friday deals Top tips for online shopping this Christmas Carphone Warehouse fined Â£400,000 over data breach Dixons Carphone has acknowledged that some of its customers have still to be told whether or not they have been accepted, but it has not acknowledged Vodafone's accuracy problem. ""Due to an incredibly high take-up of our very competitive Black Friday deals with Vodafone, there is a backlog processing credit checks,"" said a spokeswoman. ""We're working with Vodafone to resolve this and the backlog is expected to be cleared by the end of the week. ""Vodafone has told us they will honour the deals for those customers who ultimately pass the credit checks."" One industry expert expressed surprise that Dixons Carphone had not addressed the failed credit checks. ""If you're going to offer a promotion that almost looks too good to be true, the likelihood is that you are going to get deluged with people and you have to be able to cope with that as an organisation,"" said Ben Wood from CCS Insight.

"""Anne"" spent Â£50,000 in legal fees A woman whose ex-husband was convicted of rape and possessing child abuse images had to go to court to prevent him gaining access to her children, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned. Anne (not her real name) spent Â£50,000 in legal fees after social workers said he should be able to see them. A court order now prevents the man from contacting them, but Anne said she ""really had to fight"" for the ruling. Campaigners now want a change in law. It comes after one victim of the Rotherham child exploitation scandal,Sammy Woodhouse, said the man who had raped herhad been contacted by Rotherham Council about care proceedings involving her son last year. ""Anne"" was married to her abuser for more than a decade and had a number of children with him. Over time that relationship became abusive and she was raped. Then, one day the police turned up at her house, searched the property and child abuse images were found on her ex-husband's computer. The man was eventually convicted and jailed for 10 years. But, Anne said, since being in prison he had made ""many attempts to see my children"" and she had been contacted by social workers. ""They came to my house and basically said it was absolutely paramount that the children saw him,"" she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""I felt very very uneasy about it."" She said the social workers ""knew how dangerous he was, because they'd been tipped off by police about the exact extent of what he was looking at"". But, she added: ""They just think families are better with fathers. And that families have to work together."" The case went to the courts and Anne said she had ""sort of naively assumed nobody would have access to children, certainly once they'd got a conviction for child abuse"". ""But it wasn't as simple as that. ""I basically had to fight him in the courts over a long period of time even after his conviction. ""He's a convicted sex offender. He's a convicted paedophile. He's a rapist. He shouldn't be having any parental rights."" Following the legal fight, which took five years, the man is no longer allowed access to his children - or to contact them directly or via a third party. ""It felt like the right decision but it was something I had to really fight for. You know it was almost like a full-time job,"" Anne said. She added that the legal fees had amounted to about Â£50,000. Anne came forward to the Victoria Derbyshire programme having heard the experiences of Ms Woodhouse, who waived her right to anonymity in an effort to help other victims, Labour MP for Rotherham Sarah Champion told the programme, following Ms Woodhouse's testimony, that many more women would be in the same situation. ""This sort of things just keeps on happening,"" she said. ""It's well known that the family courts are used by perpetrators to get access to victims, re-traumatise their victims."" Sammy Woodhouse said a man who had raped her had been contacted by Rotherham Council about care proceedings involving their son One leading family barrister and head of the Transparency Project, Lucy Reed, explained that the current law was ""derived from our obligations under human rights legislation that a child has the right to family life - and especially a child with an established family life with a father"". She added consideration needed to be given where, for example, a child already had a relationship with a parent who is later convicted of rape, and wanted that to continue.

"Ukrainian cities like Mariupol largely depend on access to the sea US President Donald Trump has cancelled a planned meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over a naval clash between Ukraine and Russia. On Sunday Russian border guards fired on three Ukrainian ships and seized their crews off the Crimean Peninsula. Mr Trump said he would not meet Mr Putin at a G20 summit in the coming days, ""based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed the crisis ""entirely"" on Russia. She said she would raise the issue with President Putin at the G20 meeting, which is due to be held in Argentina on Friday and Saturday. Angela Merkel said only ""sensible dialogue"" would solve the crisis Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has urged Nato to send ships to the area. He has implemented martial law across Ukraine's border regions for 30 days in response to the crisis. Why Ukraine-Russia sea clash is fraught with risk The sea clash explained in 300 words On Thursday he announced that Russians living in Ukraine would soon face restrictions on bank withdrawals, changing foreign currency and travelling abroad. The incident happened on Sunday, when two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug were sailing from Odessa to the port of Mariupol, in the Sea of Azov - which is shared between Russia and Ukraine. The vessels were stopped from entering the Kerch Strait and confronted by FSB border guards. After a lengthy standoff, during which the Ukrainian tug was rammed, the ships began turning back towards Odessa, the Ukrainian government says. The Russians opened fire, wounding at least three sailors, and seized the Ukrainian flotilla. The Kerch Strait separates Russia from Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula that was annexed by Russia in 2014. Who controls the waters? Ukraine says Russia is deliberately blockading Mariupol and another Ukrainian port on the Sea of Azov, Berdyansk. The 24 captured Ukrainian sailors have now been given two months in pre-trial detention by a court in Crimea. This video can not be played Ukraine-Russia sea clash: Are Ukrainians worried? Mr Trump tweeted that ""it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting"" with Mr Putin, adding that he was looking forward to a ""meaningful summit... as soon as this situation is resolved"".

Also on Thursday, Ms Merkel accused Russia of restricting access to the Sea of Azov by building a bridge over the Kerch Strait. Speaking alongside Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman in Berlin on Thursday, she said the latest crisis was ""entirely the doing of the Russian president"" and accused Moscow of violating a 2003 agreement guaranteeing free movement in the area. ""I want the Ukrainian soldiers released,"" she said. ""The Ukrainian side has asked us to act wisely. There is no military solution to these problems."" Petro Poroshenko asked: ""What will Putin do next if we do not stop him?"" Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic and defence correspondent The call for Nato to deploy warships to the Sea of Azov raises a variety of diplomatic and practical problems. In strict legal terms, Russia and Ukraine share access to its waters under a 2003 treaty. This, though, specifically states that warships from third countries can only enter the sea or make port visits there with the express permission of the other party. Russia is hardly likely to give such permission. In practical terms, it could easily block the Kerch Strait as it did earlier this week, by placing a merchant vessel across the channel. Nato in any case might see such a visit as more likely to inflame tensions. It's more likely that Nato might seek to boost its naval deployments to the Black Sea, where its members - Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey -  are uneasy about Russia's more assertive behaviour. Indeed, the alliance says that its vessels have already spent some 120 days on patrol or exercises in the Black Sea this year, compared with 80 in 2017. Mr Putin called the sea clash ""a provocation"" organised by Ukraine's authorities ""in the run-up to the Ukrainian presidential election"". Mr Poroshenko has low popularity ratings. Recent polls suggest that only about 10% of the electorate plans to vote for him next year, with nearly 50% saying they would not vote for him under any circumstances, the Kyiv Post newspaper reported. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Putin added that Mr Poroshenko's decision to impose martial law after a mere ""border incident"" was extreme, because it was not even imposed during the conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russian state media report that Moscow has delivered a battalion of S-400 surface-to-air missiles to north Crimea, and also plans to build a new missile early-warning radar station there. Mr Putin insisted that Russia's military response was appropriate as the Ukrainians had ""trespassed"" into Russia's territorial waters. However,Ukrainian officials published a map on Wednesday,external, placing all three Ukrainian boats just outside Crimea's territorial waters at the time they were seized.

"Rahim Mohammadi told jurors they were ""sending an innocent man to prison."" A man murdered an elderly widow with a lawnmower flex to avoid being thrown off his allotment, a court heard. Rahim Mohammadi strangled 80-year-old Lea Adri-Soejoko with the cord and hid her body at Colindale allotments in north London in February last year. Mrs Adri-Soejoko, the secretary of Colindale Allotment Association, was found in a locked mower shed. Mohammadi, 42, was found guilty of murder and will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on Friday. He had a reputation for being ""threatening"" and having a ""volatile"" temper, the court heard. Prosecutor John Price QC had told jurors Mrs Adri-Soejoko had been assaulted by the defendant and then killed to ""stop her complaining"". Lea Adri-Soejoko was secretary for the allotments where her body was found Five months before the attack Mrs Adri-Soejoko, had a ""notorious"" run-in with Mohammadi, from Hackney, at a growers' meeting. During a heated discussion over evictions, she had told him to ""shut up"" and Mohammadi called her a ""bloody old witch"", the court heard. The Iranian had been involved with the allotment since 2008 through Freedom from Torture, an organisation helping torture victims suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The court heard he had ambitions to take over running the allotment, making Mrs Adri-Soejoko wary of him. On the day of the murder Mohammadi assaulted Mrs Adri-Soejoko on the allotment, causing bruises and fractures to the ribs, jurors were told. Mr Price said: ""Mrs Adri-Soejoko was beaten up. That in turn does point to a motive for her murder - to avoid detection for a shocking and very serious assault on a vulnerable old lady."" Mrs Adri-Soejoko's body was found in a lock-up store at the allotments The victim's body was locked up in the mower shed, which only four key-holders had access to, one of whom was Mohammadi. Police found the body by following the sound of her ringing phone found before Mohammadi could cover up the crime. She was wearing Wellington boots and an apron and had the shed keys in her pocket. Mohammadi's DNA was found on the cord used to strangle Mrs Adri-Soejoko and he was captured on CCTV coming and going from the allotment, jurors were told. In police interviews, Mohammadi gave different and inconsistent accounts of his movements. Giving evidence, he said he had gone to the allotments to buy opium for his bad back on the day of the killing. He claimed he heard shouting but dismissed it as a drunken fight. The court was told Mohammadi sought political asylum in Britain in 2005 and was given indefinite leave to remain in 2010. As he was led from the dock, Mohammadi turned to the jury and said: ""You will have that on your conscience sending an innocent man to prison."" Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh, of the Met Police, said: ""This crime has torn a family apart and sent shockwaves through a close-knit community. ""Mohammadi is a violent, evil, and volatile individual and he will spend many years in prison as a result of his appalling actions.""

"Prime Minister Theresa May has accepted the BBC's offer to take part in a debate on Brexit on Sunday 9 December, two days before MPs vote onher deal. But Labour sources say the party has not yet agreed to take part, with Jeremy Corbyn telling This Morning he preferred ITV's offer. The BBC said it was ""delighted"" Mrs May had accepted the offer. It added it would discuss debate formats with both parties and would announce further details soon. Mr Corbyn claimed he preferred ITV's bid out of ""respect"" for viewers who wanted to watch the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! final on ITV the same evening - 9 December. ""I want to watch it myself,"" he said. May won't rule out 'no-deal' Brexit Brexit: A really simple guide The withdrawal agreement - what it all means When approached by the BBC, ITV confirmed the final of the show would air at 21:00 GMT. It is understood the BBC debate programme would start at 20:00 in Birmingham, after Strictly Come Dancing and replacing David Attenborough's Dynasties on BBC One. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May had accepted this offer ""because there was a view on the government's side that the BBC would address the crux of the issue, namely the deal"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn tells the This Morning programme he prefers ITV's Brexit debate proposal By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason Recent history tells us TV debates involving politicians are long in the gestation, and painful in labour. Welcome to 2018's anticipated arrival. The BBC announces Theresa May has agreed to a debate  - but there is a snag. Jeremy Corbyn hasn't said he will turn up. He would rather go on ITV. And so starts the posturing among the telly luvvies along the lines of ""my audience is bigger than yours"". There are other awkward questions for the broadcasters too: where is the passionate Brexiteer voice? Where is the advocate of another referendum? Because even if Mr Corbyn accepts, the two biggest names on the programme wouldn't be a million miles apart on the fundamentals. It would be a discussion between two people who voted Remain and are committed to delivering Brexit, talking to an audience that doesn't have a say on what happens next. Oh and one last thought: this TV show, involving both of them, still might not happen. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs May previously rejected calls for smaller political parties to take part in the debate, saying she and Mr Corbyn represented almost 90% of MPs in the Commons between them. However, it is understood the BBC's proposed debate format would include a range of parties and opinions. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens have demanded to be involved. Green MP Caroline Lucas tweeted that the debate should include dialogue ""about all possible routes forward"" - including another referendum. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable - who has also campaigned for another referendum -said,externalhe was ""raring and willing to go"" in the TV debate, adding it would be a ""travesty"" if only Mrs May and Mr Corbyn were involved. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said his party had been ""sidelined throughout the Brexit process"" and their omission from any debate would perpetuate that problem. Further referendum campaign People's Vote, meanwhile, said it had written to both the BBC and broadcasting regulator Ofcom regarding the proposed format of the debate. The group said that, while other views may be represented as part of a panel, it ""would not be acceptable to us if they were relegated to a sideshow away from the main debate between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn"". What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit: The view from small businesses No-deal Brexit could sink UK into recession Ahead of the 2017 general election, Mrs May refused to take part in televised debates, with then home secretary Amber Ruddstanding in for her on the BBC's programme.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Anthony Zurcher analyses Mr Trump's response. US President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has admitted he lied about a Trump property deal in Russia during the 2016 election. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. He said he did so out of loyalty to Mr Trump. Mr Trump said his former right-hand man was ""lying"" to prosecutors in the hope of receiving a reduced sentence. A special counsel is investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election and whether Mr Trump colluded with it. In August, Cohen pleaded guilty to violating finance laws during the 2016 election by handling hush money for Mr Trump's alleged lovers. Appearing unexpectedly before a federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday morning, Cohen, 52, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to Congress. He said at the hearing that he had submitted a false written statement about a Trump Organization plan to build a skyscraper in the Russian capital. ""I made these misstatements to be consistent with individual 1's political messaging and out of loyalty to individual 1,"" Cohen said in court. He has previously identified ""individual 1"" as Mr Trump. Cohen was interviewed in October last year behind closed doors by lawmakers conducting their own investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign worked with Russia to sway the US election two years ago. According to the criminal complaint,external, he told the Senate and House intelligence committees that talks over the Moscow project had lasted from September 2015 until January 2016, while Mr Trump was running for the White House. But the criminal complaint says that ""as Cohen well knew"", negotiations over the Moscow project continued until June 2016. Cohen also told lawmakers he had had limited contact with Mr Trump about the project, when in fact it had been ""more extensive"". Prosecutors said Cohen had tried to give a false impression that the Moscow project ended before the Republican presidential campaign properly began in 2016. What (else) we've just learnt about Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's pit bull  In a press scrum outside court, Cohen said nothing to reporters. But his lawyer said: ""Mr Cohen has co-operated. Mr Cohen will continue to co-operate."" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Up until now, Michael Cohen had been a tangential figure in Donald Trump's Russia-related headaches. After his plea agreement with the special counsel's office, however, he's now smack dab in the middle of Robert Mueller's probe. In particular, Cohen is sharing information with the special counsel about Mr Trump's Russian business interests - including efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow - which, according to the president's former personal lawyer, continued well into Mr Trump's presidential campaign. That runs counter to the president's continued insistence that he had no financial ties to Russia - an assertion he frequently made when questioned about his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and efforts to improve US-Russian relations. If Cohen can provide evidence supporting his claims, it would be a political nightmare for the president and, if Mr Trump made false claims in his recent written testimony to Mr Mueller, a legal one, as well. The president has been tweeting furiously about the special counsel team in recent days, and given the steady drumbeat of news on Mr Mueller's investigation, it feels as though a crescendo is approaching. As he left the White House for a G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Mr Trump told reporters of Cohen: ""He's a weak person and not a very smart person. ""He's got himself a big prison sentence. And he's trying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up this story."" This video can not be played Donald Trump dismissed Michael Cohen as a ""weak person"" and a liar Mr Trump told reporters of the Moscow real estate project, which never came to fruition: ""When I'm running for president, that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to do business."" He added: ""He's lying about a project that everybody knew about. I mean, we were very open with it."" Soon after those remarks, Mr Trump abruptly cancelled a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Argentina, citing the current Ukraine crisis. Trump cancels Putin talks over Ukraine Cohen once famously vowed he would take a bullet for Mr Trump, but in April this year the pugnacious attorney's home and office were raided by the FBI. In August Cohen, who had been Mr Trump's personal lawyer for more than a decade, pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges, including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. He said he had paid hush money to two women who alleged they had affairs with Mr Trump, at the direction of ""the candidate"", implicating Mr Trump. Undisclosed payments to bury embarrassing stories about a political candidate can be treated as a violation of US campaign finance laws. In September, Cohen's lawyer said his client had been providing ""critical information"" to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

On Monday, his prosecutors said in a court filing thatformer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had lied to them, breaching a plea agreement. Manafort has already pleaded guilty to a range of charges from money laundering to unregistered lobbying. On Thursday, Mr Trump told reporters: ""It is sad what happened to Paul."" The president also said he had not explicitly offered a pardon to Manafort, but: ""I'm not taking anything off the table."" US media report that Mr Trump last week provided much-anticipated written answers to Mr Mueller's questions about two key issues in the inquiry. The president reportedly denied a political associate, Roger Stone, had tipped him off that Wikileaks would publish hacked Democratic emails, and said he had no knowledge of a 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between his son and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Mr Mueller has already brought criminal charges against a series of former Trump aides and associates, including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Russian individuals and entities. The inquiry is ongoing, but no hard evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Kremlin has so far been produced.

"Theresa May has refused to rule out a 'no deal' Brexit, if the deal agreed with the EU is rejected by MPs. The PM was pressed repeatedly on the issue by MPs, amid Bank of England warnings it could trigger a recession worse than the 2008 financial crisis. She said if MPs ""voted down"" her deal in December ""then obviously decisions would have to be taken"" and no-deal planning would be stepped up. Jeremy Corbyn later told ITV that MPs would not allow a no-deal Brexit. The Labour leader said: ""The alternative isn't no deal. Nobody's going to allow no deal. How could we?"" Labour is hoping to force a general election or, failing that, another referendum, if, as is currently widely expected, MPs reject Mrs May's deal. Mrs May was questioned by the Commons liaison committee, made up of the chairs of all select committees. Nine Tory Brexit tribes May must convince Cross-party bid to stop 'no deal' Brexit Row over Brexit debate TV channel Brexit: The view from small businesses She refused to speculate about what she would do if MPs reject her Brexit deal on 11 December, saying she wanted MPs to ""focus on the choice that lies in front of them"" and ignore other potential options. She also described calls for another referendum or delaying 29 March's departure date as attempts to ""frustrate"" Brexit. Mrs May told the committee the only deal on offer was the one she had negotiated with the EU. ""This is an important point in our history. It is a vote on which we will be deciding whether we deliver on the decision of the British people,"" she told the MPs. ""What has been made clear from the European Union is that this is the deal that has been negotiated and this is the deal that people need to focus on when they are looking at the vote."" Sarah Wollaston asked about the NHS and another referendum She faced repeated calls to rule out a no-deal Brexit but declined to do so. When Labour MP Rachel Reeves put it to her that leaving without a deal would be ""catastrophic"", Mrs May said the UK was leaving the EU in March 2019 and said she was promoting ""a good deal"": She said: ""When we come to the vote... it will be for Parliamentarians to determine whether they want to deliver on the vote that the British people took, whether they want to do that with a good deal - which actually does protect people's jobs into the future."" She added: ""If the House were to vote down the deal that that has been agreed, given that the European Union has been clear this this is the deal that has been agreed... then obviously decisions would have to be taken in relation to the actions that would need to be taken."" Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin questioned the Bank of England report and government analysis of Brexit's economic impact, suggesting they were ""rubbish"". Asked by Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston about fears of medicine shortages and other impacts on the NHS of a no-deal Brexit, the PM said: ""If anybody is concerned about these matters it is another reason to focus on the deal."" She claimed delaying Brexit for another referendum would lead to the re-opening of negotiations with the EU, something she said Brussels had ruled out. But the main reason she was against another referendum, she told MPs, was that it would destroy trust in politics and lead to ""more uncertainty and more division in this country"". Labour has tabled an amendment to the vote on 11 December calling on MPs to reject Mrs May's ""bad"" Brexit deal. It also calls on MPs to prevent ""the chaos of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal"" and to ""keep all options on the table to protect the UK from a no deal scenario, with a general election as the best outcome for the country"". If Labour fails to get MPs' backing for its Brexit proposals or a general election the party has said it will seek support for another referendum. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is to make a statement to MPs on Monday, on his legal advice to the government on its EU withdrawal agreement, ahead of five days of debate on the Brexit deal. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, told MPs: ""The binding motion that was passed was for nothing less than the full and final legal advice provided by the attorney general, so it is wholly unacceptable, and frankly shows contempt for this House."" Earlier Mr Corbyn told ITV's mid-morning chat show Mrs May would lose 11 December's vote but ""nobody is going to allow no-deal"". The Labour leader said his focus was on forcing a general election - and he conceded that it might take ""some time"" for an incoming Labour government to negotiate a fresh Brexit deal with Brussels - possibly up to two years. He refused to say how he would vote if there was another EU referendum, saying: ""It depends what the questions are."" He had agreed to ITV's proposal for a TV debate ahead of the Commons vote, he told host Philip Schofield, before Downing Street said Mrs May had agreed to take part in a debate on the BBC. He also revealed that he had some sympathy for Mrs May because ""leadership is a lonely place and that can be difficult"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said Mrs May's Brexit plan ""is the only possible deal"". He told the European Parliament: ""We are not at the end of the process, which is going to go on being difficult."" He said he would ""respect"" the democratic debate in the UK, adding that British MPs would be considering a text ""where the future of their country is at stake"". A legally-binding withdrawal agreement guaranteeing citizens' rights after Brexit, the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"", a 21 month transition period and ""backstop"" to prevent a hard Irish border if trade talks have not been completed by the end of the transition A 26-page ""political declaration"" setting out ambitions for a free trade deal with the EU and close cooperation in security and defence Conservative MP Julian Lewis, who chairs the defence committee, repeatedly asked the PM under what circumstances a hard Irish border would be erected. Theresa May said ministers would do ""everything in our power"" to avoid a hard border, and emphasised that she could not speak for the Irish government. UK not ready for no-deal Brexit - Carney Referendum may be inevitable - McDonnell Davis attacks 'flawed' Brexit forecasts Conservative MP Andrew Murrison asked if Mrs May's arrangement with the Democratic Unionist Party that keeps her in power was still in place, given that the DUP last week abstained on votes in protest at the EU withdrawal deal. Mrs May said the confidence and supply agreement with the party ""remains in place"". She added that she had had talks about the DUP's ""concerns"", but expected them to continue to support the government in the long run. The SNP's Pete Wishart said Scotland would be worse off under the PM's proposed Brexit deal and ""now is not the time"" to ""make us poorer"". Mrs May said her deal has the support of ""employers and organisations in Scotland"".

"Aaron Reilly and Joshua Brock collapsed after taking the drug at a Basshunter gig in Plymouth A teenager has been jailed for supplying the MDMA that killed two of his friends. Charlie Gregory bought Â£56 of the ecstasy powder from the dark web for him and his friends to take at a Basshunter gig in Plymouth. Aaron Reilly and Joshua Brock, both 19, collapsed after taking the drug at Pryzm nightclub in December. Judge Robert Linford said he had ""no alternative"" but to jail Gregory, sentencing him to 14 months. He told the 19-year-old university student: ""No judge wants to imprison someone like you."" This video can not be played The Pryzm nightclub in Plymouth is evacuated during a Basshunter gig Gregory said the amount of drugs taken was ""generous"", because he had not used scales to measure them. Prosecutor Llewellyn Sellick told the court that the defendant put the drugs down his trousers to smuggle them into the venue. Gregory will serve at least half of his sentence Once inside he handed out a ""bomb"" to Mr Reilly, Mr Brock and another teenager, and swallowed one himself. About an hour later, Gregory gave the victims another dose. Mr Reilly and Mr Brock collapsed in the club at about 02:00 GMT on 9 December and died in hospital soon after. Stephen Nunn, mitigating, said Gregory was 18 at the time and had no previous convictions. More Devon stories He told Plymouth Crown Court that Gregory had been ""naive"" and ""blames himself bitterly for the death of his two friends"". ""This happens too often at these clubs. People are oblivious to the risk of taking drugs, despite no amount of telling, until it happens,"" he said. ""They were all good lads. He will have to live forever with the death of two friends, and nothing he can do can change that. ""He is dreading this day. He tries to be a man but he is still a boy."" Hundreds had been attending a gig by the Swedish dance artist Basshunter when the pair collapsed Gregory, who shook in the dock while awaiting sentencing, admitted four counts of supplying MDMA and one of possessing the class A drug. The court heard how MDMA levels in the blood of Mr Reilly and Mr Brock were ""well within the range where death has been attributed to MDMA alone"". Mr Brock, from Okehampton, was said to be ""a loving son to Steve and Sandra, an inspirational brother to Liam and Demelza and a loyal mate to all his friends"". ""Don't play Russian roulette with your life. One moment of madness led to this tragedy,"" his family said in a statement. ""Instead of a Christmas present this year we are buying a headstone."" The family of Mr Reilly, from Newton Abbot, described him as ""a much-loved son, brother, grandson and boyfriend"" who loved skateboarding and playing computer games. ""No one could ever imagine the pain and heartbreak we have had to go through because of what happened,"" his family said in a statement.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Anthony Zurcher analyses Mr Trump's response. US President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has admitted he lied about a Trump property deal in Russia during the 2016 election. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. He said he did so out of loyalty to Mr Trump. Mr Trump said his former right-hand man was ""lying"" to prosecutors in the hope of receiving a reduced sentence. A special counsel is investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election and whether Mr Trump colluded with it. In August, Cohen pleaded guilty to violating finance laws during the 2016 election by handling hush money for Mr Trump's alleged lovers. Appearing unexpectedly before a federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday morning, Cohen, 52, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to Congress. He said at the hearing that he had submitted a false written statement about a Trump Organization plan to build a skyscraper in the Russian capital. ""I made these misstatements to be consistent with individual 1's political messaging and out of loyalty to individual 1,"" Cohen said in court. He has previously identified ""individual 1"" as Mr Trump. Cohen was interviewed in October last year behind closed doors by lawmakers conducting their own investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign worked with Russia to sway the US election two years ago. According to the criminal complaint,external, he told the Senate and House intelligence committees that talks over the Moscow project had lasted from September 2015 until January 2016, while Mr Trump was running for the White House. But the criminal complaint says that ""as Cohen well knew"", negotiations over the Moscow project continued until June 2016. Cohen also told lawmakers he had had limited contact with Mr Trump about the project, when in fact it had been ""more extensive"". Prosecutors said Cohen had tried to give a false impression that the Moscow project ended before the Republican presidential campaign properly began in 2016. What (else) we've just learnt about Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's pit bull  In a press scrum outside court, Cohen said nothing to reporters. But his lawyer said: ""Mr Cohen has co-operated. Mr Cohen will continue to co-operate."" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Up until now, Michael Cohen had been a tangential figure in Donald Trump's Russia-related headaches. After his plea agreement with the special counsel's office, however, he's now smack dab in the middle of Robert Mueller's probe. In particular, Cohen is sharing information with the special counsel about Mr Trump's Russian business interests - including efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow - which, according to the president's former personal lawyer, continued well into Mr Trump's presidential campaign. That runs counter to the president's continued insistence that he had no financial ties to Russia - an assertion he frequently made when questioned about his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and efforts to improve US-Russian relations. If Cohen can provide evidence supporting his claims, it would be a political nightmare for the president and, if Mr Trump made false claims in his recent written testimony to Mr Mueller, a legal one, as well. The president has been tweeting furiously about the special counsel team in recent days, and given the steady drumbeat of news on Mr Mueller's investigation, it feels as though a crescendo is approaching. As he left the White House for a G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Mr Trump told reporters of Cohen: ""He's a weak person and not a very smart person. ""He's got himself a big prison sentence. And he's trying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up this story."" This video can not be played Donald Trump dismissed Michael Cohen as a ""weak person"" and a liar Mr Trump told reporters of the Moscow real estate project, which never came to fruition: ""When I'm running for president, that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to do business."" He added: ""He's lying about a project that everybody knew about. I mean, we were very open with it."" Soon after those remarks, Mr Trump abruptly cancelled a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Argentina, citing the current Ukraine crisis. Trump cancels Putin talks over Ukraine Cohen once famously vowed he would take a bullet for Mr Trump, but in April this year the pugnacious attorney's home and office were raided by the FBI. In August Cohen, who had been Mr Trump's personal lawyer for more than a decade, pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges, including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. He said he had paid hush money to two women who alleged they had affairs with Mr Trump, at the direction of ""the candidate"", implicating Mr Trump. Undisclosed payments to bury embarrassing stories about a political candidate can be treated as a violation of US campaign finance laws. In September, Cohen's lawyer said his client had been providing ""critical information"" to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

This video can not be played Trump voter: 'They all break the law' It has been a busy week for the special counsel. On Monday, his prosecutors said in a court filing thatformer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had lied to them, breaching a plea agreement. Manafort has already pleaded guilty to a range of charges from money laundering to unregistered lobbying. On Thursday, Mr Trump told reporters: ""It is sad what happened to Paul."" The president also said he had not explicitly offered a pardon to Manafort, but: ""I'm not taking anything off the table.""

"Little was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2014 for three murders in the 1980s (file photograph) An imprisoned murderer is being investigated after confessing to 90 killings across four decades in the US. The FBI believe Samuel Little, who is 78, may be among the most prolific serial killers in US criminal history. State and federal agencies are now working to match his confessions with the deaths of dozens of women across the country from 1970 to 2005. Investigators say they have already linked him to 34 murders and are working to corroborate many others. Little is currently serving life in prison after being sentenced in 2014 for the murders of three women. He has been in custody since September 2012 when he was arrested at a Kentucky homeless shelter and transferred to California where he was wanted on a drugs charge. DNA samples taken from Little were then linked to the unsolved deaths of three women in Los Angeles county in 1987 and 1989. All three of those victims had been beaten and strangled before their bodies were dumped separately. He pleaded not guilty at trial, but was eventually sentenced to three consecutive life sentences with no chance of parole. Before that he already had an extensive criminal record, with offences including rape and armed robbery. Why were there so many serial killers in the 1980s? Golden State Killer: The end of a 40-year hunt? The murder convictions led to Little being referred to the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) - a scheme that works to analyse serial offenders of violent and sexual crimes, and share information with local law enforcement agencies to cross-reference unsolved crimes. Pearl Nelson (left) holds a photo of her mother Audrey Nelson, who Little was found guilty of murdering Officials from the programme say they then uncoveredan ""alarming pattern"" and ""compelling links"" to many more murders,externalacross the US. One unsolved cold-case murder in Odessa, Texas of a woman named Denise Christie Brothers was then pursued by local authorities. A local ranger, James Holland, then travelled to California with ViCAP team members earlier this year to interview Little. They say Little agreed to talk to them because he was hoping to move prisons. The FBI say that Little has confessed to 90 killings in total - stretching states across the breadth of the US, from California to Maryland. The ViCap team said in a news release earlier this week they had so far established his ties to 34 deaths, with many others apparently pending confirmation. ""Over the course of that interview in May, he went through city and state and gave Ranger Holland the number of people he killed in each place. Jackson, Mississippi - one; Cincinnati, Ohio - one; Phoenix, Arizona - three; Las Vegas, Nevada - one,"" ViCAP Crime Analyst Christina Palazzolo said in the report. They believe Little particularly targeted marginalised and vulnerable women who were involved in prostitution or addicted to drugs. Investigators say their bodies were often left unidentified and their deaths un-investigated by authorities. ""Little's method of killing also didn't always leave obvious signs that the death was a homicide. The one-time competitive boxer usually stunned or knocked out his victims with powerful punches and then strangled them,"" the FBI report said. ""With no stab marks or bullet wounds, many of these deaths were not classified as homicides but attributed to drug overdoses, accidents, or natural causes,"" it continued. A large number are believed to have taken place in the 1970s and early 1980s before DNA technology was available to police. A recent mugshot of Little, who reportedly also went by the name Samuel McDowell Beth Silverman, the Los Angeles County prosecutor who helped convict Little in 2014, told the New York Times that ""a lot of agencies around the country...dropped the ball on this case"". ""He got off over and over and over again,"",externalshe told the newspaper. The FBI says the 78-year-old is ""in poor health"" and is likely to now remain in prison in Texas until his death, where he was transferred from California after admitting the Odessa killing. The bureau says it is continuing to work alongside Ranger Holland, who is said to be interviewing Little ""nearly daily"", to help build an accurate and full picture of his crimes. ""The biggest lesson in this case is the power of information sharing,"" Kevin Fitzsimmons, ViCAP's supervisory crime analyst said in the FBI report. ""A Jane Doe [unidentified victim] who turned up dead in an alley in New Orleans may look like an isolated event but when entered into the ViCAP database and examined with other mysterious deaths or missing persons, patterns emerge. That is the value of ViCAP."" Why was there a spike in serial killers?

"This video can not be played Magdiele, Mariely and a friend said they were told they had to pay Â£300 each before they could see a property. A letting agency has been demanding hundreds of pounds in payment before prospective tenants are allowed to view properties for rent, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has found. The practice, by Flintons, breaches guidelines and could be unlawful. Shadow housing minister Melanie Onn said renters needed more rights  and the case was the ""tip of the iceberg"". Flintons, in London, denied any wrongdoing and said it did not charge any fees for viewings. Guidance from the Competition and Markets Authority says that to ""require a deposit from a tenant before they have been given the opportunity to inspect the property or the tenancy agreement"" could constitute an ""aggressive practice"" and be unlawful. Several of Flintons's clients told the Victoria Derbyshire programme they had been assured by their estate agent that they would have their payment refunded if they did not like the property but after requesting refunds had been told the money was not refundable after all. Israel Kujore and his friend Harry responded to one of Flintons's adverts. He said they had gone to see an agent who had told them they needed to pay a deposit to see a room but that the money would be refundable. They had paid Â£300 each to see a property, but Israel soon realised something was wrong. Israel Kujore said the experience had left him feeling ""really miserable and defeated"" Mr Kujore had then looked into the company online and found dozens of negative reviews. ""I was seeing reviews and horror stories. I was feeling really miserable and defeated. I was really upset,"" he said. He had decided to seek a refund but had been told that the money was not refundable. ""Â£300 is half my rent gone. What can I do? I don't have the money to sue them. I don't have legal expertise to deal with it - I'm powerless."" Get in touch with the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme by emailing victoria@bbc.co.uk. Flintons said it issued receipts specifying the sums involved were non-refundable. While this is true, Mr Kujore - and other tenants with similar experiences - said they had not been given this document to sign until after they had made the payment. They added that at the time they had been assured verbally that they could get their money back and that they had felt under pressure to pay the money immediately. David Smith said the practice was legally questionable David Smith, a leading specialist in residential landlord and tenant law, said the practice was legally questionable. ""Asking somebody for money, without being able to see what that contract is about, to do a viewing, would quite likely to be seen by professional people in the property sector as unreasonable and unfair behaviour,"" he said. ""It is therefore likely to be an offence under the consumer protection from unfair trading regulations."" Ms Onn called for the government to give greater protection to renters. ""Letting agents as well as landlords should be properly regulated,"" she said. ""Of the 8,000 letting agents we've got around the country, only about half of those are voluntarily signed up to a code that means that they will operate to the highest professional standards. That means that half of them are not."" Flintons denies any wrongdoing. It said it did not charge any fees for viewings and payment was taken only when someone confirmed they wanted to rent the property. It said these payments were taken as a ""holding deposit"" - money paid to a landlord or letting agent to reserve a rental property - which were always non-refundable and that it did not believe there would be any purpose in taking deposits if the individual could get their money back. It added that all those featured in the BBC's report had been made aware that their deposits were not refundable and it did not agree with their version of events.

"The Frankfurt headquarters of Deutsche Bank have been raided by prosecutors in a money laundering investigation. Germany's public prosecutor alleged that two staff members have helped clients launder money from criminal activities. Police cars were seen outside the tower blocks that house the headquarters of Germany's biggest bank. Five other Deutsche offices in the city were searched in an operation involving about 170 police and officials. Prosecutors are looking into whether Deutsche Bank staff helped clients set up offshore accounts to ""transfer money from criminal activities"". The investigation, which began in August, focuses on activities between 2013 and the start of 2018. In 2016 alone, more than 900 customers were served by a Deutsche Bank subsidiary registered in the British Virgin Islands, generating a volume of â¬311m, the prosecutors allege. The investigation was sparked byrevelations in the 2016 ""Panama Papers""- an enormous amount of information leaked from a Panamanian law firm called Mossack Fonseca. What are the Panama Papers? Other banks have been fined as a result of information contained in the Panama Papers. Deutsche shares fell 3% after news of the raid emerged. The bank confirmed that police had raided several locations in Germany and that it was co-operating fully with the probe. Paperwork and electronic documents were seized by officials during the raids on the bank's properties. Deutsche Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt occupy two towers Deutsche has been connected with another huge money laundering scandal at Denmark's Danske Bank. Earlier this month, Deutsche confirmed that it was involved in processing payments for the Danish bank in Estonia. An internal investigation by Danskefound that about â¬200bn (Â£177bn) of payments were funnelled through its Estonian branch. The Danish bank said many of those payments were suspicious. Deutsche said it had terminated its relationship with Danske in 2015 after ""identifying suspicious activity"". Deutsche Bank has been sanctioned in the past for failing to tackle money laundering. In September, Germany's financial regulator ordered the bank to take further action to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. It also appointed an independent auditor to monitor Deutsche Bank's efforts over three years. In 2017, Deutsche Bank was fined $630m(Â£504m) by US and UK regulators in connection with a Russian money laundering plan. Under the scheme, clients illegally moved $10bn out of Russia via shares bought and sold through the bank's Moscow, London and New York offices. Chief executive Christian Sewing took over at Deutsche Bank in April The trouble with authorities comes at a time when Deutsche continued to face problems with its business. Pre-tax profits for the three months to September fell 45% to â¬506m compared with the same period last year. Chief executive Christian Sewing, who took over in April, has been shedding jobs and making other cost cuts in an attempt to revive the bank's performance. However, investors have yet to be been won over by his efforts and Deutsche shares have halved this year. What are the Panama Papers?

"Aaron Reilly and Joshua Brock collapsed after taking the drug at a Basshunter gig in Plymouth A teenager has been jailed for supplying the MDMA that killed two of his friends. Charlie Gregory bought Â£56 of the ecstasy powder from the dark web for him and his friends to take at a Basshunter gig in Plymouth. Aaron Reilly and Joshua Brock, both 19, collapsed after taking the drug at Pryzm nightclub in December. Judge Robert Linford said he had ""no alternative"" but to jail Gregory, sentencing him to 14 months. He told the 19-year-old university student: ""No judge wants to imprison someone like you."" This video can not be played The Pryzm nightclub in Plymouth is evacuated during a Basshunter gig Gregory said the amount of drugs taken was ""generous"", because he had not used scales to measure them. Prosecutor Llewellyn Sellick told the court that the defendant put the drugs down his trousers to smuggle them into the venue. Gregory will serve at least half of his sentence Once inside he handed out a ""bomb"" to Mr Reilly, Mr Brock and another teenager, and swallowed one himself. About an hour later, Gregory gave the victims another dose. Mr Reilly and Mr Brock collapsed in the club at about 02:00 GMT on 9 December and died in hospital soon after. Stephen Nunn, mitigating, said Gregory was 18 at the time and had no previous convictions. More Devon stories He told Plymouth Crown Court that Gregory had been ""naive"" and ""blames himself bitterly for the death of his two friends"". ""This happens too often at these clubs. People are oblivious to the risk of taking drugs, despite no amount of telling, until it happens,"" he said. ""They were all good lads. He will have to live forever with the death of two friends, and nothing he can do can change that. ""He is dreading this day. He tries to be a man but he is still a boy."" Hundreds had been attending a gig by the Swedish dance artist Basshunter when the pair collapsed Gregory, who shook in the dock while awaiting sentencing, admitted four counts of supplying MDMA and one of possessing the class A drug. The court heard how MDMA levels in the blood of Mr Reilly and Mr Brock were ""well within the range where death has been attributed to MDMA alone"". Mr Brock, from Okehampton, was said to be ""a loving son to Steve and Sandra, an inspirational brother to Liam and Demelza and a loyal mate to all his friends"". ""Don't play Russian roulette with your life. One moment of madness led to this tragedy,"" his family said in a statement. ""Instead of a Christmas present this year we are buying a headstone.""

"Ukrainian cities like Mariupol largely depend on access to the sea US President Donald Trump has cancelled a planned meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over a naval clash between Ukraine and Russia. On Sunday Russian border guards fired on three Ukrainian ships and seized their crews off the Crimean Peninsula. Mr Trump said he would not meet Mr Putin at a G20 summit in the coming days, ""based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed the crisis ""entirely"" on Russia. She said she would raise the issue with President Putin at the G20 meeting, which is due to be held in Argentina on Friday and Saturday. Angela Merkel said only ""sensible dialogue"" would solve the crisis Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has urged Nato to send ships to the area. He has implemented martial law across Ukraine's border regions for 30 days in response to the crisis. Why Ukraine-Russia sea clash is fraught with risk The sea clash explained in 300 words On Thursday he announced that Russians living in Ukraine would soon face restrictions on bank withdrawals, changing foreign currency and travelling abroad. The incident happened on Sunday, when two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug were sailing from Odessa to the port of Mariupol, in the Sea of Azov - which is shared between Russia and Ukraine. The vessels were stopped from entering the Kerch Strait and confronted by FSB border guards. After a lengthy standoff, during which the Ukrainian tug was rammed, the ships began turning back towards Odessa, the Ukrainian government says. The Russians opened fire, wounding at least three sailors, and seized the Ukrainian flotilla. The Kerch Strait separates Russia from Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula that was annexed by Russia in 2014. Who controls the waters? Ukraine says Russia is deliberately blockading Mariupol and another Ukrainian port on the Sea of Azov, Berdyansk. The 24 captured Ukrainian sailors have now been given two months in pre-trial detention by a court in Crimea. This video can not be played Ukraine-Russia sea clash: Are Ukrainians worried? Mr Trump tweeted that ""it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting"" with Mr Putin, adding that he was looking forward to a ""meaningful summit... as soon as this situation is resolved"".

Also on Thursday, Ms Merkel accused Russia of restricting access to the Sea of Azov by building a bridge over the Kerch Strait. Speaking alongside Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman in Berlin on Thursday, she said the latest crisis was ""entirely the doing of the Russian president"" and accused Moscow of violating a 2003 agreement guaranteeing free movement in the area. ""I want the Ukrainian soldiers released,"" she said. ""The Ukrainian side has asked us to act wisely. There is no military solution to these problems."" Petro Poroshenko asked: ""What will Putin do next if we do not stop him?"" Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic and defence correspondent The call for Nato to deploy warships to the Sea of Azov raises a variety of diplomatic and practical problems. In strict legal terms, Russia and Ukraine share access to its waters under a 2003 treaty. This, though, specifically states that warships from third countries can only enter the sea or make port visits there with the express permission of the other party. Russia is hardly likely to give such permission. In practical terms, it could easily block the Kerch Strait as it did earlier this week, by placing a merchant vessel across the channel. Nato in any case might see such a visit as more likely to inflame tensions. It's more likely that Nato might seek to boost its naval deployments to the Black Sea, where its members - Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey -  are uneasy about Russia's more assertive behaviour. Indeed, the alliance says that its vessels have already spent some 120 days on patrol or exercises in the Black Sea this year, compared with 80 in 2017. Mr Putin called the sea clash ""a provocation"" organised by Ukraine's authorities ""in the run-up to the Ukrainian presidential election"". Mr Poroshenko has low popularity ratings. Recent polls suggest that only about 10% of the electorate plans to vote for him next year, with nearly 50% saying they would not vote for him under any circumstances, the Kyiv Post newspaper reported. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Putin added that Mr Poroshenko's decision to impose martial law after a mere ""border incident"" was extreme, because it was not even imposed during the conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russian state media report that Moscow has delivered a battalion of S-400 surface-to-air missiles to north Crimea, and also plans to build a new missile early-warning radar station there. Mr Putin insisted that Russia's military response was appropriate as the Ukrainians had ""trespassed"" into Russia's territorial waters.

"Some universities are recruiting students with unconditional offers during the application process, says the university admissions service Ucas. They are telling students that A-level grade requirements will be dropped completely if they put the university down as their first choice. It comes as new Ucas figures show one-third of applicants aged 18 received an unconditional offer last year. England's Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the news was ""disturbing"". He added: ""The systematic use of unconditional offers is not in the interest of students and they should not be used just to get people through the door. ""I expect universities to use them responsibly and where institutions cannot justify the rising numbers being offered, I have made clear to the Office for Students that they should use the full range of powers at their disposal to take action."" Head teachers urged students to resist the ""inducement"" of such offers and universities to stop making them. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said the practice could lead students to choose a course which is not the right one for them. ""We are particularly concerned about students being required to make a university their first choice in return for an unconditional offer. ""It is essential that students choose the course which is right for them rather than ending up on an unsuitable course which they later regret. ""We advise them to resist this inducement and urge universities to desist from this practice."" London university stops making unconditional offers University unconditional offers 'undermine education' Huge rise in unconditional university offers for students Ucas has analysed the impact of what it calls ""conditional unconditional offers"" for the first time. It defined conditional unconditional ones as those which are initially made by the university as conditional, then updated to unconditional if the offer is accepted as the student's first (firm) choice. It also found 34.4% of 18-year-old applicants from England, Wales and Northern Ireland received at least one unconditional offer. In Scotland, the applications process is arranged differently and so are not included in the analysis. These figures now include the conditional unconditional offers, and have pushed the figures up for 2018 from 23%. There has been a steady rise in their use over the past few years, because higher education providers are now able to recruit unlimited numbers of students. Ucas said: ""Unconditional offers are made by universities and colleges that are satisfied applicants have demonstrated sufficient ability and potential to succeed on their chosen course. ""This may include consideration of exam results, and outcomes from interviews or auditions. For example, 18% of offers made to applicants for creative arts courses are unconditional, where more emphasis could be placed on a strong portfolio. ""Unconditional offers are also made to support widening participation, and to address the health and wellbeing needs of some students. ""Many students responding to Ucas's survey reported a reduction in stress knowing they had a confirmed place."" But it also highlighted how more students with unconditional offers than those with conditional offers miss out on their predicted grades. Ucas chief executive Clare Marchant said unconditional offers were used ""in a variety of ways to enable students to progress on to undergraduate courses."" She added that while students are broadly supportive of them, ""the link with their A-level attainment can't be ignored"". Mr Barton said: ""It is clear this practice is now completely out of control and is driven by market forces rather than by educational considerations. ""The problem with unconditional offers is that some students take their foot off the gas and underachieve in A-levels or other qualifications and this hampers their employment prospects later in life."" William Whittington, 21, from Nottingham, says receiving unconditional offers from two of the five universities he applied to in 2015 did make a difference to how he prepared for his A-levels. ""My first choice was originally going to be Loughborough University but then I got an unconditional offer from Sheffield Hallam straight away and I thought 'let's go with that', because I wasn't sure I'd get the grades for my other choices,"" he recalls. ""Then an hour later the postman came and there was a letter from Hull University saying that if I made it my first choice, the offer would change to unconditional. I'd been to the open day at Hull and loved it - it was my second choice, so I went there. ""Having an unconditional offer changed my mindset and how I worked towards my A-levels. ""I was relaxed and less stressed compared to my friends because I knew where I was going anyway. I don't regret going to Hull, I couldn't have asked any more from the lecturers."" For Saul Westbrook, the unconditional offer he received from the University of Birmingham ""didn't really make a difference"". The 18-year-old, who is studying economics at the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: ""I wanted to have a choice later of where I could go and study. ""I also wanted to get good grades and to keep the pressure on myself to work harder. ""I knew that if I took the unconditional offer, my grades might drop a little bit.""

President Poroshenko inspected tank crews during a visit to Chernihiv, northern Ukraine ""We cannot accept this aggressive policy of Russia. First it was Crimea, then eastern Ukraine, now he wants the Sea of Azov. Germany, too, has to ask itself: What will Putin do next if we do not stop him?"" A Nato spokeswoman would not comment directly on Mr Poroshenko's request, but stressed that ""since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Nato has substantially increased its presence in the Black Sea."" Earlier this week,Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg called on Russia to free the Ukrainian ships and sailors,externaland said the bloc would continue to provide ""political and practical support"" toUkraine, which is a Nato partner country,external. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Diplomatic correspondent The call for Nato to deploy warships to the Sea of Azov raises a variety of diplomatic and practical problems. In strict legal terms Russia and Ukraine share access to its waters under a 2003 treaty. This though specifically states that warships from third countries can only enter the Sea or make port visits there with the express permission of the other party. Russia is hardly likely to give such permission. In practical terms it could easily block the Kerch Strait as it did earlier this week by placing a merchant vessel across the channel. Nato in any case might see such a visit as more likely to inflame tensions. It's more likely that Nato might seek to boost its naval deployments to the Black Sea where its members - Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey -  are uneasy about Russia's more assertive behaviour. Indeed the alliance says that its vessels have already spent some 120 days on patrol or exercises in the Black Sea this year, compared with 80 in 2017. At least three Ukrainian sailors were wounded when Russian FSB border guards opened fire on two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug off Crimea. The peninsula was annexed by Russia in 2014, but officially remains part of Ukraine. The naval boats had been sailing from Odessa to Mariupol, a Ukrainian port on the Azov sea, when they were confronted by the FSB vessels. Ukraine says Russia is deliberately blockading Mariupol and another port, Berdyansk, preventing ships from getting through the Kerch Strait. The 24 captured Ukrainian sailors have now been given two months in pre-trial detention by a court in Crimea. Russia's decision to open a bridge across the Kerch Strait earlier this year had already exacerbated tensions. The Russian president said the incident was ""undoubtedly a provocation"". He said that it had been organised by Ukraine's authorities ""and, I think, the incumbent president in the run-up to the Ukrainian presidential election in March 2019"". Mr Poroshenko has low popularity ratings. Recent polls suggest that only about 10% of the electorate plans to vote for him next year, with nearly 50% saying they would not vote for him under any circumstances, the Kyiv Post newspaper reported. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Putin added that the Ukrainian president's decision to impose martial law after a mere ""border incident"" was extreme, because martial law was not even imposed at the height of the conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Mr Putin insisted that Russia's military response was appropriate as the Ukrainians had ""trespassed"" into Russia's territorial waters. Ukrainian officials published a map on Wednesday,external, placing all three Ukrainian boats just outside Crimea's territorial waters at the time they were seized. Western governments have backed the Ukrainian government. On Wednesday the EU strongly condemned Russia's actions but failed to agree on new sanctions against Russia. After three days of debate, the EU issued a statement expressing ""utmost concern about the dangerous increase of tensions"" and dismay at the ""unacceptable"" use of force by Russia. It called on Russia to release the ships and their crews and respect Ukraine's sovereignty. Poland had wanted new sanctions on Moscow while Germany and France stressed the need to ease tensions. US President Donald Trump has also said he may cancel a planned meeting with Mr Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week. Are Ukrainians worried Russia might invade?

"A woman lost a third of her bodyweight after surgery to remove a 26kg ovarian cyst - the weight of seven newborn babies. Despite multiple negative pregnancy tests, doctors insisted Keely Favell must be pregnant as her stomach grew in size. When asked questions about baby due dates, she spared people's embarrassment by playing along. But the 28-year-old believed herself to be ""just fat"". Ms Favell, from Swansea, started gaining weight in 2014. ""I've always been chunky, but over the course of a couple of years, I gradually got this tummy,"" she said. ""It crept up so slowly that I didn't know anything was wrong - I just thought I was putting on timber. ""I've been with my partner Jamie Gibbins for 10 years and we did wonder a few times if I was pregnant - but we did home tests and they always ruled it out."" She said it was ""so embarrassing"" explaining she was not pregnant: ""I'd go along with it to spare everyone the blushes."" After blacking out in her office admin job, Ms Favell plucked up the courage to see a GP in 2016, who said she must be pregnant despite blood negative tests. ""Looking at me, anyone would have thought I was nine months gone. It is a fluid-filled sac that develops on a woman's ovary. They are very common and do not usually cause any symptoms Most ovarian cysts occur naturally and disappear in a few months without needing any treatment Cysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or they may only affect one They only causes symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large, or blocks the blood supply to the ovaries Some of the symptoms can include pelvic pain, pain during sex, needing to go to the toilet regularly, bloating and swollen stomach ""It wasn't the first time I'd been mistaken for an expectant mum... People had seen me waddling around, carrying this lump, and I'd been asked a few times when I was due."" Still believing Ms Favell to be pregnant, her GP referred her for an ultrasound scan in January last year. ""I was lying there with Jamie beside me as the radiologist moved the probe over my tummy. I saw her eyes widen in horror, but the screen was just blank. ""The look on her face said it all - something was wrong, and when she said she had to get a consultant I started to panic. Jamie did his best to reassure me but I felt paralysed with fear."" She was sent for an emergency CT scan which revealed a cyst surrounded by fluid. ""[The consultant] told me I wasn't fat all - I was actually quite thin."" Ms Favell was referred to a high-risk obstetrics consultant and examined in February last year. Keely Favell and her partner of 10 years Jamie Gibbins ""By this time, even walking was a struggle and I had difficulty breathing. ""I'll never forget the look of shock on his face when the consultant examined me. He said I had a large ovarian mass and the only option was surgery. He couldn't say what it was, exactly, or how big."" The cyst was finally removed in March last year, and was revealed to be 26kg the weight of a seven or eight-year-old child - or seven average-sized newborn babies. ""They explained how big this cyst was and showed me the pictures - I couldn't believe I'd been walking around for so long carrying this medical alien. ""It looked like a massive pile of ice cream so I called it Mr Whippy."" Ms Favell has been left with a large scar and stretch marks, but will still be able to have children. ""I lost sight of how difficult even simple things like driving a car or walking up the stairs had become. Losing my lump gave me my life back - I can't thank my surgeon enough.""

"Riley Long: ""You have no choice but to do what they're asking you"" A majority of young holidaymakers working as au pairs in Australia are being exploited, a study suggests. Au pairs are typically given board and some payment by an overseas family in return for minding children and doing light housework. But many end up being effectively used as employees earning well below the minimum wage, the report says. The Australian government said it did not tolerate ""exploitative practices"". The study, billed as the biggest of its kind, surveyed 1,500 international au pairs working across Australia. ""The demand for au pairing is often explained by Australian families' need for affordable childcare,"" said co-author Laurie Berg from the University of Technology, Sydney. ""But we found that the majority of families were taking advantage of a large supply of working holidaymakers to get cheap housekeepers as well.  So au pairs are working as full-time housekeepers but being paid like babysitters."" It's estimated there are at least 10,000 people working as au pairs in Australia - with 90% of them young women. There is no specific visa for the role - with most coming onto the country on a working holiday visa which allows them to stay with a family for half a year. Ryleigh Brown says she is happier after moving in with a new family Families can then apply for the au pair to be given a six-month extension. ""The lack of regulation means there's a stark power imbalance between families and au pairs,"" Dr Berg said. Findings of the report, conducted by UTS and Macquarie University, included: 60% of au pairs found themselves working for about 36 hours a week, doing not only childcare but daily cooking, cleaning and other household tasks. One in three au pairs who had their contracts terminated were given just 24 hours to move out and find alternative accommodation. Au pairs who found a host family through an agency fared no better than those who made their own arrangements through Facebook groups and other methods. Riley Long, 30, from Kansas has returned to the US after working as an au pair in Australia. He told the BBC exploitation was common, from being asked to do additional cleaning to regular babysitting well beyond what initially had been expected. ""You have very little privacy and because you live under their roof, you have no choice but to do what they're asking you,"" he said. British au pair Ryleigh Brown, 20, from Eastbourne in East Sussex has found happiness helping look after four children with a family living outside Canberra. But she told the BBC previous jobs had left her isolated - claiming one family was not welcoming, communicated mainly by text message and expected her to do far more cleaning than she bargained for. ""I felt like 'the help'. It was like they just wanted an extra pair of hands, not someone to come and look after their kid,"" she said. ""It's supposed to be a cultural exchange but I didn't get anything out of it that I couldn't have got back home."" Australia's Home Affairs Department said that people on working holiday visas had the same rights as all other employees - and that employers who exploited workers faced prosecution. The Cultural Au Pair Association of Australia has been lobbying the government for more regulation, including a push for a specific au pair visa. ""We send young Australians to the US who work as au pairs under well-regulated programmes and so we should expect the same for young people who come here to Australia,"" chairwoman Wendi Alyward told the BBC. But she said that despite the horror stories, most au pairs enjoyed their time in the country. ""Overwhelmingly au pairs are happy with their experience. A family engages with an au pair, an au pair shares their culture. That's cultural exchange. It's very hard to measure currently but we know it happens in most cases."" Ms Alyward - who is also managing director of travel firm AIFS, which includes an au pair agency - said arranging placements with a reputable firm which screened both au pairs and families was one way to help ensure the experience was positive for everyone. Reports of exploitation in sectors of the Australian workforce reliant on backpackers are not new. Last year a study foundone in three backpackers and a quarter of foreign students working in Australia were being paid about half the minimum wage or less, with those in fruit-picking jobs faring worst.

The man who raped her, Arshid Hussain, was reportedly contacted by Rotherham Council about care proceedings involving her son heard last year. Ms Woodhousetweeted,external: ""Thanks so much to everyone for the support."" Inthe petition,externalstarted on Wednesday, Ms Woodhouse says: ""After rebuilding my life, I was made to relive the trauma again last year when the courts said my abuser Hussain could seek visits with my son. ""That's why I'm calling for a change in the law, a simple amendment to the Children's Act 1989 that would ban any male with a child conceived by rape from applying for access/rights.""

However, speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Lucy Reed, - family law barrister and head of the Transparency Project - said current legislation was clear. ""It is derived from our obligation under human rights legislation that a child - rather than a parent - has the right to family life,"" she said. She said consideration needed to be given where, for example, a child already had a relationship with a parent who is later convicted of rape, and wanted that to continue. Arshid Hussain was convicted of grooming and sexually abusing young girls in Rotherham Hussain, known around Rotherham as Mad Ash,was one of three brothersbehind the grooming and sexual abuse of more than 50 girls, including Ms Woodhouse. He was jailed for 35 years in 2016. Ms Woodhouse, who waived her anonymity in an effort to help other victims,told the BBC on Wednesdayshe was ""shocked"" when she was informed of the council's approach. Latest news from across Yorkshire Rotherham Council said: ""We must be clear that at no stage has it been the intention of the council to put any child at risk, or to allow any convicted child sexual exploitation offender to have care of any child."" The authority said it was seeking ""clarification from the Ministry of Justice as to how legal directions relating to Family Court proceedings should be applied"". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said: ""Local authorities can apply to courts to request permission not to notify parents without parental responsibility about care proceedings, and courts should consider the potential harm to the child and mother when making this decision.""

"Theresa May has refused to rule out a 'no deal' Brexit, if the deal agreed with the EU is rejected by MPs. The PM was pressed repeatedly on the issue by MPs, amid Bank of England warnings it could trigger a recession worse than the 2008 financial crisis. She said if MPs ""voted down"" her deal in December ""then obviously decisions would have to be taken"" and no-deal planning would be stepped up. Jeremy Corbyn later told ITV that MPs would not allow a no-deal Brexit. The Labour leader said: ""The alternative isn't no deal. Nobody's going to allow no deal. How could we?"" Labour is hoping to force a general election or, failing that, another referendum, if, as is currently widely expected, MPs reject Mrs May's deal. Mrs May was questioned by the Commons liaison committee, made up of the chairs of all select committees. Nine Tory Brexit tribes May must convince Cross-party bid to stop 'no deal' Brexit Row over Brexit debate TV channel Brexit: The view from small businesses She refused to speculate about what she would do if MPs reject her Brexit deal on 11 December, saying she wanted MPs to ""focus on the choice that lies in front of them"" and ignore other potential options. She also described calls for another referendum or delaying 29 March's departure date as attempts to ""frustrate"" Brexit. Mrs May told the committee the only deal on offer was the one she had negotiated with the EU. ""This is an important point in our history. It is a vote on which we will be deciding whether we deliver on the decision of the British people,"" she told the MPs. ""What has been made clear from the European Union is that this is the deal that has been negotiated and this is the deal that people need to focus on when they are looking at the vote."" Sarah Wollaston asked about the NHS and another referendum She faced repeated calls to rule out a no-deal Brexit but declined to do so. When Labour MP Rachel Reeves put it to her that leaving without a deal would be ""catastrophic"", Mrs May said the UK was leaving the EU in March 2019 and said she was promoting ""a good deal"": She said: ""When we come to the vote... it will be for Parliamentarians to determine whether they want to deliver on the vote that the British people took, whether they want to do that with a good deal - which actually does protect people's jobs into the future."" She added: ""If the House were to vote down the deal that that has been agreed, given that the European Union has been clear this this is the deal that has been agreed... then obviously decisions would have to be taken in relation to the actions that would need to be taken."" Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin questioned the Bank of England report and government analysis of Brexit's economic impact, suggesting they were ""rubbish"". Asked by Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston about fears of medicine shortages and other impacts on the NHS of a no-deal Brexit, the PM said: ""If anybody is concerned about these matters it is another reason to focus on the deal."" She claimed delaying Brexit for another referendum would lead to the re-opening of negotiations with the EU, something she said Brussels had ruled out. But the main reason she was against another referendum, she told MPs, was that it would destroy trust in politics and lead to ""more uncertainty and more division in this country"". Labour has tabled an amendment to the vote on 11 December calling on MPs to reject Mrs May's ""bad"" Brexit deal. It also calls on MPs to prevent ""the chaos of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal"" and to ""keep all options on the table to protect the UK from a no deal scenario, with a general election as the best outcome for the country"". If Labour fails to get MPs' backing for its Brexit proposals or a general election the party has said it will seek support for another referendum. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is to make a statement to MPs on Monday, on his legal advice to the government on its EU withdrawal agreement, ahead of five days of debate on the Brexit deal. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, told MPs: ""The binding motion that was passed was for nothing less than the full and final legal advice provided by the attorney general, so it is wholly unacceptable, and frankly shows contempt for this House."" Earlier Mr Corbyn told ITV's mid-morning chat show Mrs May would lose 11 December's vote but ""nobody is going to allow no-deal"". The Labour leader said his focus was on forcing a general election - and he conceded that it might take ""some time"" for an incoming Labour government to negotiate a fresh Brexit deal with Brussels - possibly up to two years. He refused to say how he would vote if there was another EU referendum, saying: ""It depends what the questions are."" He had agreed to ITV's proposal for a TV debate ahead of the Commons vote, he told host Philip Schofield, before Downing Street said Mrs May had agreed to take part in a debate on the BBC. He also revealed that he had some sympathy for Mrs May because ""leadership is a lonely place and that can be difficult"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He told the European Parliament: ""We are not at the end of the process, which is going to go on being difficult.""

Theresa May said ministers would do ""everything in our power"" to avoid a hard border, and emphasised that she could not speak for the Irish government. UK not ready for no-deal Brexit - Carney Referendum may be inevitable - McDonnell Davis attacks 'flawed' Brexit forecasts Conservative MP Andrew Murrison asked if Mrs May's arrangement with the Democratic Unionist Party that keeps her in power was still in place, given that the DUP last week abstained on votes in protest at the EU withdrawal deal. Mrs May said the confidence and supply agreement with the party ""remains in place"". She added that she had had talks about the DUP's ""concerns"", but expected them to continue to support the government in the long run. The SNP's Pete Wishart said Scotland would be worse off under the PM's proposed Brexit deal and ""now is not the time"" to ""make us poorer"".

"This video can not be played Carney warns of lower pound and higher inflation on no-deal A no-deal Brexit could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis, the Bank of England has warned. It said the UK economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, while house prices could fall by almost a third. The Bank of England also warned the pound could fall by a quarter. The Bank's analysis comes afterthe Treasury said the UK would be worse offunder any form of Brexit. This Bank's scenario is not what it expects to happen, but represents a worst-case scenario, based on a so called ""disorderly Brexit"". The scenario looks at the five-year period after the UK leaves the EU. But by the end of 2023, the economy is expected to resume growing. What did we learn from the Bank of England? Brexit will make UK worse off, government warns ""These are scenarios not forecasts. They illustrate what could happen not necessarily what is most likely to happen. ""Taken together the scenarios highlight that the impact of Brexit will depend on the direction, magnitude and speed of the effect of reduced openness of the UK economy,"" Bank of England governor Mark Carney said. The Bank of England has made a number of assumptions - not forecasts - about what would cause a disorderly Brexit. The UK reverts to World Trade Organization rules No new trade deals are implemented by 2022 The UK loses all access to existing trade agreements between the EU and third countries Severe disruption at borders because of customs checks Migration reverses from 150,000 a year to falling by 100,000 a year The Bank of England does not give a probability of this happening. Scenarios drawn up by the Bank of England show that GDP would fall by 8% in 2019 against its current forecast. Growth would quickly resume and the economy would expand again by the end of 2023 but be smaller than where it was before. Unemployment would rise to 7.5%, house prices fall by 30% and commercial property prices collapse by 48%. Interest rates would reach 4%. The Bank looked at three other scenarios. a ""disruptive"" Brexit - one where the UK retained access to some trade agreements what might happen if trading arrangements were agreed to give the UK a ""close"" relationship what might happen if trading arrangements were agreed to give the UK a ""less close"" relationship A close relationship is one with no customs checks, no regulatory barriers and a partial deal agreed on financial services. A less close relationship is one where customs checks start after 2021 and other regulatory checks are put in place. If Brexit is disruptive rather than disorderly, GDP falls 3% over the five years to 2022, house prices slide 14%, and unemployment reaches 5.75% If a close trading relationship is agreed, the economy could still be 1% smaller than if the UK had remained in the EU but 1.5% higher than the bank's most recent estimate. If it is less close, the economy's growth could be 3.75% less than if the UK had remained in the EU and 0.75% less than forecast over the last inflation report. These figures cover the period to 2023. By political reporter Brian Wheeler Theresa May will not have told the Bank's economists what to say in their report but it is definitely helpful to her. The timing is significant too. A leaked copy of Downing Street's media grid had today down as ""economy"". Tomorrow is ""security"". So expect a steady drumbeat of official warnings about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit in the run up to 11 December's vote. Downing Street's hope is that however much they hate her deal (and they do) MPs will come to view it as the only safe option. The problem is that these kind of warnings, however well-grounded in facts and figures, are too easily written off as ""project fear"". The more scary they sound, the easier they are to dismiss. Conservative MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound - saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight ""lack all credibility"". Speaking to the BBC, Mr Rees-Mogg said ""project fear"" had become ""project hysteria"". And the pro-Brexit former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: ""The bottom line of both sets of reports is that project fear like Frankenstein's monster has been resuscitated and is stalking the land."" However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The Bank has confirmed what other independent reports this week have been telling us: a no-deal Brexit could be even worse than the financial crisis of 10 years ago, and the country would be much worse under Theresa May's deal,"" he said. Mr Carney said the Bank was monitoring markets and indicated that it was ready to lend to UK banks if necessary. He also indicated that banks might be allowed to hold less capital if risks became too great. But he warned there was little the Bank could do. ""There is little monetary policy can do to offset the potentially significant hits to productivity and supply that Brexit could entail... the future potential of this economy and its implications of jobs, real wages and wealth are not in the gift of central bankers,"" he said. The Bank of England has exposed seven major lenders to a stress test which it said was two and half times more severe than the Brexit scenarios. All seven lenders - Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, Santander and Nationwide Building Society - passed the test. What did we learn from the Bank of England?

"Phyllis Harvey died nearly two years ago at the age of 88 A church treasurer said she was shocked by the extortionate cost of her mother's funeral - and immediately saved hundreds of pounds by searching for a better price. Chris Harvey said she was quoted more than Â£4,000, even though family members could walk to the church. The Â£2bn funeral services sector now faces a major investigation. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had ""serious concerns"" about above-inflation price rises. Mrs Harvey said her mother, Phyllis Harvey, died nearly two years ago. She told the hospice where her mother died that she was likely to use the same local funeral director that she had used when her father died years earlier. Only later did she discover the business had become part of the Dignity chain. She was unhappy that they appeared to be initially unaware of where her mother's body was being held. She was also shocked by the cost, when she eventually found out how much it would be, describing it as extortionate. ""We could just walk to the church, so it was an extraordinary amount of money,"" Mrs Harvey said. As a church treasurer herself, she knew that relatively little of that money went to the church. She looked on her phone for a better price with another funeral director and said she saved Â£1,400 and received ""a better service"". The family donated those savings to the hospice where Phyllis had been looked after before her death. Mrs Harvey said she was pleased with the CMA investigation: ""They should be more transparent about prices. People do not want to talk about it, but it is important."" The CMA found that people typically spent between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000 organising a funeral, with the average price of the core elements now standing at Â£4,271. The average cremation fee was Â£737 last year, with the fees having risen by 84% in the past 10 years. The CMA report found: The cost of essential elements have risen by more than two-thirds in a decade That is three times the rate of the rise of prices in general, as measured by inflation Those on the lowest incomes could face funeral costs that amount to nearly 40% of their annual outgoings That is more than the amount spent on food, clothing and energy combined in a year The regulator said that these price rises did not appear to be justified by the equivalent rise in providers' own costs or matched by improvements in the quality of service. It has spent six months studying the sector. In Scotland, the national funeral inspector is set to report to the Scottish Parliament on the standard of funeral directors. People arranging a funeral could save more than Â£1,000 by shopping around for a funeral, the CMA said. However, the regulator pointed out that grieving families would be distressed and not in a position to do so. Most prices were not available or clear online, it added. ""People mourning the loss of a loved one are extremely vulnerable and at risk of being exploited,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA. ""We need to make sure that they are protected at such an emotional time, and we're very concerned about the substantial increases in funeral prices over the past decade."" One comparison site - Beyond - said that the UK's funeral sector had been ""allowed to become like the Wild West"". ""It is still true that very few people - only 4% - actually [shop around], often because of a very British taboo around death and being seen to 'shop around' for funeral prices,"" said co-founder Ian Strang. The CMA also said that smaller funeral directors had tried to keep the costs low, but larger chains had consistently increased prices. Following the CMA announcement, the share price of Dignity - one of the largest providers - fell by nearly 16%. ""We're fully committed to ensuring vulnerable consumers are protected. In January this year we started materially reducing our prices,"" said Mike McCollum, chief executive of Dignity. ""We've already started publishing our prices online and will make further improvements before the end of March 2019."" Death in data: What happens at the end of life? 'How could I find Â£3,000 to pay for my mum's funeral?' Watch: Deciding where to bury your parents if they were not born in the UK The Co-op, another large provider, said it had reduced prices on its ""affordable funerals"" and introduced simpler options in the past three years. There is a state safety net,the Funeral Expenses Payment,external, available to people on certain benefits, but critics say it still leaves a shortfall that has to be picked up by families. The report was ""clearly a wake-up call"" for the profession, said Terry Tennens, chief executive of the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors. It has urged members to put prices on their websites. ""The public would benefit from more information about how to arrange a funeral, covering quality and costs,"" he said. A separate inquiry by the Treasury into the pre-paid funeral sector is continuing. Many of these plans do not cover costs such as embalming, limousines, a funeral service, a wake, burial plots or memorial stones. In some cases, families are left having to find an extra Â£2,000, even though they expect such items to be included. The government is considering a move that would mean tougher regulation of pre-paid funerals. Were you to buy the parts of a funeral separately, rather than as a plan, these would be the typical costs - although they can vary significantly in different parts of the UK: Moving deceased to Chapel of Rest Â£99; hearse and chauffeur Â£315; coffin Â£275 to Â£1,500 or more; minister or officiant fee Â£148; funeral director's professional fees Â£1,000 to Â£1,500 Cremation costs: Cremation fee Â£660; cremation urn Â£200; ash plot Â£450; doctor's fees (not payable in Scotland) Â£164 Burial costs: Interment fee (grave-digging and backfilling for a single depth grave) Â£150 to Â£1,734; burial plot cost Â£280 to Â£5,000 or more; stone memorial Â£800 to Â£1,200 or more Optional costs: Embalming Â£136 to Â£165; limousine and chauffeur Â£305; flowers Â£151; order of service sheets Â£72; church service Â£98 to Â£149; catering Â£397 Source: Fairer Finance 'How could I find Â£3,000?'

"Ukrainian forces have been mobilised in the port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has urged Nato to send ships to the Sea of Azov following a naval confrontation with Russia off Crimea. He told Germany's Bild newspaper he hoped the ships could be relocated ""to assist Ukraine and provide security"". On Sunday, Russia opened fire on three Ukrainian ships and seized their crews in the Kerch Strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Nato has expressed ""full support"" for Ukraine, which is not a member state. Amid worsening relations on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Mr Poroshenko of creating the naval ""provocation"" to boost his ratings ahead of 2019 elections. Why Ukraine-Russia sea clash is fraught with risk Who controls the waters? Russia-Ukraine sea clash in 300 words President Poroshenko has implemented martial law across Ukraine's border regions for 30 days in response to the crisis. Inthe interview with Bild,external, Mr Poroshenko said Vladimir Putin wanted ""nothing less than to occupy the [Azov] sea"". ""Germany is one of our closest allies and we hope that states within Nato are now ready to relocate naval ships to the Sea of Azov in order to assist Ukraine and provide security,"" he said. President Poroshenko inspected tank crews during a visit to Chernihiv, northern Ukraine ""We cannot accept this aggressive policy of Russia. First it was Crimea, then eastern Ukraine, now he wants the Sea of Azov. Germany, too, has to ask itself: What will Putin do next if we do not stop him?"" A Nato spokeswoman would not comment directly on Mr Poroshenko's request, but stressed that ""since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Nato has substantially increased its presence in the Black Sea."" Earlier this week,Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg called on Russia to free the Ukrainian ships and sailors,externaland said the bloc would continue to provide ""political and practical support"" toUkraine, which is a Nato partner country,external. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Diplomatic correspondent The call for Nato to deploy warships to the Sea of Azov raises a variety of diplomatic and practical problems. In strict legal terms Russia and Ukraine share access to its waters under a 2003 treaty. This though specifically states that warships from third countries can only enter the Sea or make port visits there with the express permission of the other party. Russia is hardly likely to give such permission. In practical terms it could easily block the Kerch Strait as it did earlier this week by placing a merchant vessel across the channel. Nato in any case might see such a visit as more likely to inflame tensions. It's more likely that Nato might seek to boost its naval deployments to the Black Sea where its members - Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey -  are uneasy about Russia's more assertive behaviour. Indeed the alliance says that its vessels have already spent some 120 days on patrol or exercises in the Black Sea this year, compared with 80 in 2017. At least three Ukrainian sailors were wounded when Russian FSB border guards opened fire on two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug off Crimea. The peninsula was annexed by Russia in 2014, but officially remains part of Ukraine. The naval boats had been sailing from Odessa to Mariupol, a Ukrainian port on the Azov sea, when they were confronted by the FSB vessels. Ukraine says Russia is deliberately blockading Mariupol and another port, Berdyansk, preventing ships from getting through the Kerch Strait. The 24 captured Ukrainian sailors have now been given two months in pre-trial detention by a court in Crimea. Russia's decision to open a bridge across the Kerch Strait earlier this year had already exacerbated tensions. The Russian president said the incident was ""undoubtedly a provocation"". He said that it had been organised by Ukraine's authorities ""and, I think, the incumbent president in the run-up to the Ukrainian presidential election in March 2019"". Mr Poroshenko has low popularity ratings. Recent polls suggest that only about 10% of the electorate plans to vote for him next year, with nearly 50% saying they would not vote for him under any circumstances, the Kyiv Post newspaper reported. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Putin added that the Ukrainian president's decision to impose martial law after a mere ""border incident"" was extreme, because martial law was not even imposed at the height of the conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Mr Putin insisted that Russia's military response was appropriate as the Ukrainians had ""trespassed"" into Russia's territorial waters. Ukrainian officials published a map on Wednesday,external, placing all three Ukrainian boats just outside Crimea's territorial waters at the time they were seized. Western governments have backed the Ukrainian government. On Wednesday the EU strongly condemned Russia's actions but failed to agree on new sanctions against Russia. After three days of debate, the EU issued a statement expressing ""utmost concern about the dangerous increase of tensions"" and dismay at the ""unacceptable"" use of force by Russia. It called on Russia to release the ships and their crews and respect Ukraine's sovereignty. Poland had wanted new sanctions on Moscow while Germany and France stressed the need to ease tensions. US President Donald Trump has also said he may cancel a planned meeting with Mr Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week. Are Ukrainians worried Russia might invade?

"Kellogg's is to put ""traffic light"" labelling on most of its cereal packs sold in the UK from January, having previously refused to do so. The UK government's voluntary scheme, introduced in 2013, indicates how much salt, sugar or fat foods contain. Kellogg's said it had made the change after having ""listened"" to consumers, government and retailers. Consumer organisation Which? said it was a ""positive move"" but it should apply to all cereals, not just some. The traffic light system labels foods green, amber or red, to help consumers easily identify products that have low, medium or high levels of salt, fat and sugar. Kellogg's new labelling will start to appear on brands including Coco Pops, Crunchy Nut, Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Frosties and Special K from January 2019. The rollout will be complete by early 2020. ""We are changing because the people who buy our food told us we should.  Following our announcement late last year to overhaul our cereals in the UK, we decided to look again at labelling,"" Kellogg's said in a statement. Kellogg's UK managing director Oli Morton said the decision followed a survey of 2,000 Britons asking them about their attitudes towards labelling. Mr Morton said: ""Put simply, they said we should change and move to a full colour solution as they want help making healthy decisions. We've listened and now we're acting."" However, traffic light labelling will not be used on Kellogg's multilingual boxes shared across several European countries, where the system is not well-known, nor will it appear on single serve packs. As a result just under 80% of Kellogg's cereal packs sold in the UK and Ireland will carry the new labels. Until now Kellogg's has stuck to the so-called ""Reference Intake"" labelling scheme, displayed in monochrome colours on packs. It shows the maximum amount of calories and nutrients people should eat in a day. Now, though, it said: ""Times have changed; changing to colour coded labels is a response to what consumers and government want from us in the UK."" Many supermarkets have voluntarily adopted the traffic light system for their own brands, while rival cereal maker Nestle introduced the ""traffic light"" scheme on its cereal brands including Shreddies and Cheerios in 2017. Weetabix has used it since 2016. Earlier this yearWhich? called on the governmentto fix the ""chaos"" of food labelling standards when the UK leaves the EU. Under EU rules, traffic light labelling is voluntary, so some manufacturers do not use it. Which? said it should be mandatory. Strategic policy adviser Sue Davies said the organisation believed the traffic light nutrition system helped people to compare ""at a glance"" how much sugar, salt and fat a product contains and was ""an effective way of helping them to make healthier food choices"". ""While this is a very positive move from Kellogg's, it should apply to all the brand's products sold in the UK and Ireland, not just 80% of them. ""The government should now use Brexit as an opportunity to introduce legislation that makes traffic light labelling mandatory as part of an approach based on high food standards and aimed at boosting the nation's health and well-being,"" added Ms Davies.

"Prime Minister Theresa May has accepted the BBC's offer to take part in a debate on Brexit on Sunday 9 December, two days before MPs vote onher deal. But Labour sources say the party has not yet agreed to take part, with Jeremy Corbyn telling This Morning he preferred ITV's offer. The BBC said it was ""delighted"" Mrs May had accepted the offer. It added it would discuss debate formats with both parties and would announce further details soon. Mr Corbyn claimed he preferred ITV's bid out of ""respect"" for viewers who wanted to watch the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! final on ITV the same evening - 9 December. ""I want to watch it myself,"" he said. May won't rule out 'no-deal' Brexit Brexit: A really simple guide The withdrawal agreement - what it all means When approached by the BBC, ITV confirmed the final of the show would air at 21:00 GMT. It is understood the BBC debate programme would start at 20:00 in Birmingham, after Strictly Come Dancing and replacing David Attenborough's Dynasties on BBC One. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May had accepted this offer ""because there was a view on the government's side that the BBC would address the crux of the issue, namely the deal"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn tells the This Morning programme he prefers ITV's Brexit debate proposal By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason Recent history tells us TV debates involving politicians are long in the gestation, and painful in labour. Welcome to 2018's anticipated arrival. The BBC announces Theresa May has agreed to a debate  - but there is a snag. Jeremy Corbyn hasn't said he will turn up. He would rather go on ITV. And so starts the posturing among the telly luvvies along the lines of ""my audience is bigger than yours"". There are other awkward questions for the broadcasters too: where is the passionate Brexiteer voice? Where is the advocate of another referendum? Because even if Mr Corbyn accepts, the two biggest names on the programme wouldn't be a million miles apart on the fundamentals. It would be a discussion between two people who voted Remain and are committed to delivering Brexit, talking to an audience that doesn't have a say on what happens next. Oh and one last thought: this TV show, involving both of them, still might not happen. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs May previously rejected calls for smaller political parties to take part in the debate, saying she and Mr Corbyn represented almost 90% of MPs in the Commons between them. However, it is understood the BBC's proposed debate format would include a range of parties and opinions. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens have demanded to be involved. Green MP Caroline Lucas tweeted that the debate should include dialogue ""about all possible routes forward"" - including another referendum. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable - who has also campaigned for another referendum -said,externalhe was ""raring and willing to go"" in the TV debate, adding it would be a ""travesty"" if only Mrs May and Mr Corbyn were involved. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said his party had been ""sidelined throughout the Brexit process"" and their omission from any debate would perpetuate that problem. Further referendum campaign People's Vote, meanwhile, said it had written to both the BBC and broadcasting regulator Ofcom regarding the proposed format of the debate.

"A no-deal Brexit would hit UK-EU security ties and have a ""real impact"" on protecting the public, security minister Ben Wallace has warned. In a speech to law enforcement leaders, he said close co-operation  was the ""heart of effective security"". Mr Wallace said the PM's deal, which MPs vote on next month, would set the foundations for the most comprehensive security relationship in EU history. But Labour's Diane Abbott said the plan ""failed on guarantees for security"". The shadow home secretary's party is to table an amendment to reject the deal  but also ""prevent the chaos of the UK crashing out of the EU"". A simple guide to Brexit Where are we with Brexit? Five key questions Brexit poses for the NHS UK not ready for no-deal Brexit - Carney The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but, under Theresa May's deal, there would then be a transition period, during which the UK and EU would continue to work together as they do now. The deal for how the UK will leave the EU is accompanied by anon-binding declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UKafter transition has ended, which includes the promise to co-operate on security. MPs are due to vote on the deal on 11 December. If they reject it - and no other solution is found - the UK could leave without a deal. The current arrangements on security co-operation would then end on 29 March with nothing to replace them. In the run-up to the vote, the public can expect a steady drumbeat of official warnings about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, says BBC political reporter Brian Wheeler, as Mrs May and her team try to sell her plan. A leaked copy of Downing Street's own timetable for media announcements has ""security"" listed as a Thursday priority with ""international trade"" scheduled the following day. Please upgrade your browser Mr Wallace was speaking at the International Security Expo in London, where he said that such a no-deal departure would be a step backwards for security co-operation. He added that the UK, through the experience of the last few decades, had learnt the value of working with its European partners. He said: ""We and Europe know, from bitter experience, that often when there is a mistake or when something has been missed that we find, time and time again, that it has been due to a failure of co-operation. ""A no-deal situation would have a real impact on our ability to work with our European partners to protect the public."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The UK wants to maintain all the existing security arrangements - and it knows that the EU wants to maintain this high level of co-operation out of mutual self-interest. But there are problems. Critics of the government's hopes for post-Brexit security are concerned that the proposed final relationship with the EU - that would kick in in 2021 - is long on aspirations but short on solutions. It's not remotely clear if the UK will be able to access EU-organised databases, such as those that exchange criminal records, wanted alerts and DNA and fingerprint records, after the transition. Once transition ends, so does access to the data - unless a security treaty can be agreed. But even if that treaty is signed, it may come up short. Some nations, like Germany, have constitutional bars on how they can co-operate on security with non EU states. In his address, Mr Wallace said that Mrs May's agreement would set the foundations for the broadest security relationship the EU has had with another country. The partnership would include the ability to exchange information on criminals and tackle terrorism, to quickly share data on people travelling to and from the UK to spot potential threats, to exchange DNA and fingerprints, and to fast-track extraditions. Ms Abbott described the government plans as ""dangerously flimsy"". Diane Abbott said the plan was ""simply unacceptable"" She said: ""There is no new security treaty on offer, which is vital for cross-border policing arrangements, especially extradition."" She added that there were ""only aspirations for a vague security partnership, no plans for proper security arrangements, including with Europol"" and that it was ""simply unacceptable"". As the vote on the PM's deal draws closer, details of what will happen in Parliament during the build up were released. The Commons will debate the agreement for eight hours a day on 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11 December under business proposals set out by the government. But MPs will be allowed to table six amendments to the Brexit motion, to be chosen by the Speaker of the House of Commons and heard before the vote on 11 December. Labour has put forward an amendment ""rejecting Theresa May's botched Brexit deal"" and to stop a no-deal, calling for all options to be left on the table if it gets voted down.

"Large parts of the British economy are not ready for a no-deal Brexit, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said. Fewer than half of businesses have initiated contingency plans, Mr Carney told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the UK would need a transition period to adapt to whatever form of exit from the EU that Parliament chose. He denied that the Bank's warning thatno-deal could lead to a UK recessionwas intended to scare people into backing his favoured form of Brexit. Mr Carney told the BBC that ""we know from our contacts with business, others know from their contacts, that less than half the businesses in the country have initiated their contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit"". ""All the industries, all the infrastructure of the country, are they all ready at this point in time? And, as best as we can tell, the answer is no,"" Mr Carney said. It is in the interests of the country that there should be a transition to whatever new relationship the UK has with the EU, he said. He added: ""We know issues around the borders, we go to the ports and we know the issues that are there today. So we need some time to get ready for it."" Security warnings over no-deal Brexit UK and US agree post-Brexit flights deal Brexit: A really simple guide On Wednesday,MPs warned that there was a ""real prospect"" of ""major disruption"" at UK portsin the case of a no-deal Brexit, with government plans ""worryingly under-developed"". However, the Department for Transport said the Public Accounts Committee's conclusions ""were not accurate"". Conservative MP and Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound on Wednesday, saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight ""lack all credibility"". Mr Rees-Mogg said ""project fear"" had become ""project hysteria"". ""The overwhelming majority - 87% - of British companies do not trade with the European Union,"" he said. ""It will not have an effect on them. Leaving the European Union is a real economic opportunity and it's an opportunity that neither the Bank of England nor the Treasury in its forecasts wishes to recognise,"" Mr Rees-Mogg added. Mr Carney's comments come after government forecasts warned that the UK would be economically poorer under any form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU. Under Theresa May's Chequers Brexit plan, the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years compared with staying in the EU, government analysis suggested. With a no-deal Brexit, the hit to the economy would be 9.3%. ""Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,"" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The Bank of England, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that the UK economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath of Brexit if there was no transition period, house prices could fall by almost a third, and that the pound could fall by a quarter. The UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has said the risks of the draft Brexit agreement were ""preferable to the risks of a no-deal scenario"". ""Leaving the EU creates a number of risks for us regardless of the form of exit,""the FCA said in a report.,external ""The implementation period helps address these at the cost of a lower ability to influence regulation during that period. An exit without agreement would carry much higher risk and carry significant uncertainty for us and for firms. ""Against that background, and viewed through the lens of our statutory objectives, the draft Withdrawal Agreement and the outline political declaration are preferable steps."" The FCA was asked by the Treasury Select Committee to consider the impact of Brexit in three areas: a no-deal scenario; the draft withdrawal agreement; and the outline political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK. In a letter to the committee's chairman, Nicky Morgan, FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said a no-deal scenario ""would create significant challenges and risks in terms of firms' readiness, potential market disruption and insufficient public-policy solutions put in place on the side of the EU"".

Ms Woodhousetweeted,external: ""Thanks so much to everyone for the support."" Inthe petition,externalstarted on Wednesday, Ms Woodhouse says: ""After rebuilding my life, I was made to relive the trauma again last year when the courts said my abuser Hussain could seek visits with my son. ""That's why I'm calling for a change in the law, a simple amendment to the Children's Act 1989 that would ban any male with a child conceived by rape from applying for access/rights.""

However, speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Lucy Reed, - family law barrister and head of the Transparency Project - said current legislation was clear. ""It is derived from our obligation under human rights legislation that a child - rather than a parent - has the right to family life,"" she said. She said consideration needed to be given where, for example, a child already had a relationship with a parent who is later convicted of rape, and wanted that to continue. Arshid Hussain was convicted of grooming and sexually abusing young girls in Rotherham Hussain, known around Rotherham as Mad Ash,was one of three brothersbehind the grooming and sexual abuse of more than 50 girls, including Ms Woodhouse. He was jailed for 35 years in 2016. Ms Woodhouse, who waived her anonymity in an effort to help other victims,told the BBC on Wednesdayshe was ""shocked"" when she was informed of the council's approach. Latest news from across Yorkshire Rotherham Council said: ""We must be clear that at no stage has it been the intention of the council to put any child at risk, or to allow any convicted child sexual exploitation offender to have care of any child."" The authority said it was seeking ""clarification from the Ministry of Justice as to how legal directions relating to Family Court proceedings should be applied"". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said: ""Local authorities can apply to courts to request permission not to notify parents without parental responsibility about care proceedings, and courts should consider the potential harm to the child and mother when making this decision.""

"The number of EU citizens moving to the UK has continued to drop, but more people coming from elsewhere means the overall migration rate is unchanged. Figures show net migration - the difference between how many people came to the UK for at least 12 months and how many left - was 273,000 last year. EU net migration was 74,000 in the year to the end of June 2018, while non-EU net migration was 248,000. The ONS,externalsaid more Asian citizens had been moving to the UK for work. The Office for National Statistics says 219,000 EU citizens arrived in the UK, as 145,000 left, making net EU migration the lowest it had been since 2012. The data also showed non-EU net migration was the highest since 2004. How has EU migration changed the UK? Jay Lindop, director of the ONS's centre for international migration, said overall net migration had peaked in 2016 and remained fairly stable since then. Overall net migration takes into account the migration of British citizens, of which 49,000 more left the country than returned in the year to the end of June 2018. In the year to the end of June 2017, EU net migration was 107,000 and non-EU net migration was 173,000. Overall net migration was 273,000 in the same period. The government's policy is to reduce overall migration to below 100,000 a year. Separately, the Home Office has released statistics on the number of British citizenship applications, which show the number of EU nationals applying has increased by almost a third over the past year. There were 43,545 requests in the 12 months to the end of September - a rise of 32% on last year. How has EU migration changed the UK?

"This video can not be played Jack Burn died hours after being born at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford Staff at a hospital trust being investigated over baby deaths say there is a ""culture of bullying and harassment"", a report has revealed. Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust (SaTH), which is already in special measures, has now been rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Emergency and maternity services at its two hospitals were deemed unsafe. Trust chief executive Simon Wright said: ""You cannot be unaffected by a report like this."" The112-page report,external, published on Thursday, lists a catalogue of issues at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, Shropshire. The trust was previously rated as ""requires improvement"" overall. The trust is currently being investigated over alleged maternity failings, with more than 200 families raising concerns about care at the trust. Baby death review: What do we know? It recentlyabandoned a plan to close Telford's A&E department at nightbecause of a shortage of doctors, drafting in extra staff instead. Inspectors also said as well as the bullying and harassment claims they ""found a culture of defensiveness from the executive team"". Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was placed in special measures earlier this month The report said staff felt they were not listened to and were sometimes fearful to raise concerns or issues, there was low morale among staff and high levels of stress and work overload. A former nursepreviously told the BBC of a ""bullying, intimidatory culture"" at the trust, with junior staff frightened to raise concerns or questions for fear of being labelled troublemakers. Inspectors also found: Medical care, surgery, critical care, end of life at both sites require improvement Medical and nurse staffing ""was not adequate to keep patients safe"" particularly at Telford Staff did not feel valued, supported or appreciated by senior staff The CQC's report said inspectors were ""particularly concerned"" about the trust's emergency department and maternity services. A temporary midwife-led unit at Shrewsbury being used after its original building was damaged by snowfall last December was deemed ""unfit for purpose"" with senior staff ""crisis-managing"". There has also been a shortage of midwives due to sickness and maternity leave, inspectors found. People have protested over plans to close the A&E department at The Princess Royal at night The CQC has given the trust a raft of improvements to make, listing 81 issues that needed to be tackled, including ensuring staff are trained to protect patients from harm, and reviewing midwife staffing levels to keep women and babies safe. It said the trust should also improve how it escalates cases of women at high risk at the midwifery-led unit or day assessment unit and review its policy on reduced foetal movements for midwives and sonographers. Hundreds question baby care at NHS trust 'Doctors ignored me - my girls are gone' Latest news from the West Midlands Other required improvements covered the maintenance of safe environments, speeding up complaints handling, the secure storage of medicines and records and the administering of antibiotics for patients with suspected sepsis. However, inspectors rated the trust as ""good"" for being caring and said they did find ""examples of outstanding practice in end of life care services at both sites"" as well as in its postnatal maternity care. The trust said some of the CQC concerns had been addressed through recruitment and improved reporting by its maternity services. By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This damning report will be an awful read for the families who have lost babies as a result of errors by this trust. Speak to any of them, and their fervent wish is that nobody has to go through the same experience as they did. The continuing inability of the trust, therefore, to ensure heart rates are properly monitored and the failure to learn lessons after incidents, smacks of a callous arrogance towards those families. Fundamentally this is a trust that has been badly led for years. Today's report is stark in its denunciation of the current management - not all of them have the ""right skills and abilities"" to provide ""high-quality sustainable care"". Chief executive Simon Wright insists he is not out of his depth, but under his watch the trust has demonstrably deteriorated. The recently appointed chairman said on Wednesday that they ""can't carry on doing the same things with the same people"". The growing chorus in Shropshire for Mr Wright to resign will certainly hope so. Prof Ted Baker, chief inspector of hospitals at the CQC, said: ""While we found staff to be caring and dedicated, there is clearly much work needed at the trust to ensure care is delivered in a way that ensures people are safe. ""We remain particularly concerned about the emergency department and maternity services at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. ""We have already taken urgent action to protect people and we are monitoring the trust extremely closely."" Chief executive Mr Wright apologised and said the trust was ""disappointed that we have not made as much progress to tackle the issues and challenges that the Trust faces as we all want"". ""But people should not lose sight of many things that SaTH does not just well but significantly better than many other trusts around the country."" An independent review into a series of baby deaths at the trust was commissioned by the government last year. Previously, an estimated 3,000 people marched in protest over SaTH's plan to close A&E at The Princess Royal at night, with the trust citing staff shortages for its decision.

"The Frankfurt headquarters of Deutsche Bank have been raided by prosecutors in a money laundering investigation. Germany's public prosecutor alleged that two staff members have helped clients launder money from criminal activities. Police cars were seen outside the tower blocks that house the headquarters of Germany's biggest bank. Five other Deutsche offices in the city were searched in an operation involving about 170 police and officials. Prosecutors are looking into whether Deutsche Bank staff helped clients set up offshore accounts to ""transfer money from criminal activities"". The investigation, which began in August, focuses on activities between 2013 and the start of 2018. In 2016 alone, more than 900 customers were served by a Deutsche Bank subsidiary registered in the British Virgin Islands, generating a volume of â¬311m, the prosecutors allege. The investigation was sparked byrevelations in the 2016 ""Panama Papers""- an enormous amount of information leaked from a Panamanian law firm called Mossack Fonseca. What are the Panama Papers? Other banks have been fined as a result of information contained in the Panama Papers. Deutsche shares fell 3% after news of the raid emerged. The bank confirmed that police had raided several locations in Germany and that it was co-operating fully with the probe. Paperwork and electronic documents were seized by officials during the raids on the bank's properties. Deutsche Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt occupy two towers Deutsche has been connected with another huge money laundering scandal at Denmark's Danske Bank. Earlier this month, Deutsche confirmed that it was involved in processing payments for the Danish bank in Estonia. An internal investigation by Danskefound that about â¬200bn (Â£177bn) of payments were funnelled through its Estonian branch. The Danish bank said many of those payments were suspicious. Deutsche said it had terminated its relationship with Danske in 2015 after ""identifying suspicious activity"". Deutsche Bank has been sanctioned in the past for failing to tackle money laundering. In September, Germany's financial regulator ordered the bank to take further action to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. It also appointed an independent auditor to monitor Deutsche Bank's efforts over three years. In 2017, Deutsche Bank was fined $630m(Â£504m) by US and UK regulators in connection with a Russian money laundering plan. Under the scheme, clients illegally moved $10bn out of Russia via shares bought and sold through the bank's Moscow, London and New York offices. Chief executive Christian Sewing took over at Deutsche Bank in April The trouble with authorities comes at a time when Deutsche continued to face problems with its business. Pre-tax profits for the three months to September fell 45% to â¬506m compared with the same period last year. Chief executive Christian Sewing, who took over in April, has been shedding jobs and making other cost cuts in an attempt to revive the bank's performance. However, investors have yet to be been won over by his efforts and Deutsche shares have halved this year. What are the Panama Papers?

"Staff at Wazir Akbar Khan hospital treated the wounded At least 10 people have died and 19 were injured after a compound for British security firm G4S was attacked, authorities said. Gunmen stormed the compound after a car bomb was detonated outside, according to an Afghan interior ministry spokesman. A security source has told the BBC that foreigners were among the casualties. There was reportedly a heavy exchange of gunfire. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack. While the interior ministry confirmed the death toll, it also warned the number could well rise. Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever Afghanistan profile - Timeline G4S, one of the world's largest security groups, helps guard the area around the British embassy.

""The situation is ongoing and we are co-ordinating with the Afghan authorities to bring it to a conclusion."" Authorities expect the number of casualties to rise Hafizullah, the father of three children wounded in a house near the compound, told Reuters news agency that the blast ""shattered"" all the doors of his home. ""There was a bang and right after that, all the windows and ceiling collapsed over the children,"" he said. The attack marked the latest violence to hit the Afghan capital.

Today's report is stark in its denunciation of the current management - not all of them have the ""right skills and abilities"" to provide ""high-quality sustainable care"". Chief executive Simon Wright insists he is not out of his depth, but under his watch the trust has demonstrably deteriorated. The recently appointed chairman said on Wednesday that they ""can't carry on doing the same things with the same people"". The growing chorus in Shropshire for Mr Wright to resign will certainly hope so. Prof Ted Baker, chief inspector of hospitals at the CQC, said: ""While we found staff to be caring and dedicated, there is clearly much work needed at the trust to ensure care is delivered in a way that ensures people are safe. ""We remain particularly concerned about the emergency department and maternity services at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. ""We have already taken urgent action to protect people and we are monitoring the trust extremely closely."" Chief executive Mr Wright apologised and said the trust was ""disappointed that we have not made as much progress to tackle the issues and challenges that the Trust faces as we all want"". ""But people should not lose sight of many things that SaTH does not just well but significantly better than many other trusts around the country."" An independent review into a series of baby deaths at the trust was commissioned by the government last year.

"Kellogg's is to put ""traffic light"" labelling on most of its cereal packs sold in the UK from January, having previously refused to do so. The UK government's voluntary scheme, introduced in 2013, indicates how much salt, sugar or fat foods contain. Kellogg's said it had made the change after having ""listened"" to consumers, government and retailers. Consumer organisation Which? said it was a ""positive move"" but it should apply to all cereals, not just some. The traffic light system labels foods green, amber or red, to help consumers easily identify products that have low, medium or high levels of salt, fat and sugar. Kellogg's new labelling will start to appear on brands including Coco Pops, Crunchy Nut, Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Frosties and Special K from January 2019. The rollout will be complete by early 2020. ""We are changing because the people who buy our food told us we should.  Following our announcement late last year to overhaul our cereals in the UK, we decided to look again at labelling,"" Kellogg's said in a statement. Kellogg's UK managing director Oli Morton said the decision followed a survey of 2,000 Britons asking them about their attitudes towards labelling. Mr Morton said: ""Put simply, they said we should change and move to a full colour solution as they want help making healthy decisions. We've listened and now we're acting."" However, traffic light labelling will not be used on Kellogg's multilingual boxes shared across several European countries, where the system is not well-known, nor will it appear on single serve packs. As a result just under 80% of Kellogg's cereal packs sold in the UK and Ireland will carry the new labels. Until now Kellogg's has stuck to the so-called ""Reference Intake"" labelling scheme, displayed in monochrome colours on packs. It shows the maximum amount of calories and nutrients people should eat in a day. Now, though, it said: ""Times have changed; changing to colour coded labels is a response to what consumers and government want from us in the UK."" Many supermarkets have voluntarily adopted the traffic light system for their own brands, while rival cereal maker Nestle introduced the ""traffic light"" scheme on its cereal brands including Shreddies and Cheerios in 2017. Weetabix has used it since 2016. Earlier this yearWhich? called on the governmentto fix the ""chaos"" of food labelling standards when the UK leaves the EU. Under EU rules, traffic light labelling is voluntary, so some manufacturers do not use it. Which? said it should be mandatory. Strategic policy adviser Sue Davies said the organisation believed the traffic light nutrition system helped people to compare ""at a glance"" how much sugar, salt and fat a product contains and was ""an effective way of helping them to make healthier food choices"". ""While this is a very positive move from Kellogg's, it should apply to all the brand's products sold in the UK and Ireland, not just 80% of them. ""The government should now use Brexit as an opportunity to introduce legislation that makes traffic light labelling mandatory as part of an approach based on high food standards and aimed at boosting the nation's health and well-being,"" added Ms Davies.

"A no-deal Brexit would hit UK-EU security ties and have a ""real impact"" on protecting the public, security minister Ben Wallace has warned. In a speech to law enforcement leaders, he said close co-operation  was the ""heart of effective security"". Mr Wallace said the PM's deal, which MPs vote on next month, would set the foundations for the most comprehensive security relationship in EU history. But Labour's Diane Abbott said the plan ""failed on guarantees for security"". The shadow home secretary's party is to table an amendment to reject the deal  but also ""prevent the chaos of the UK crashing out of the EU"". A simple guide to Brexit Where are we with Brexit? Five key questions Brexit poses for the NHS UK not ready for no-deal Brexit - Carney The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but, under Theresa May's deal, there would then be a transition period, during which the UK and EU would continue to work together as they do now. The deal for how the UK will leave the EU is accompanied by anon-binding declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UKafter transition has ended, which includes the promise to co-operate on security. MPs are due to vote on the deal on 11 December. If they reject it - and no other solution is found - the UK could leave without a deal. The current arrangements on security co-operation would then end on 29 March with nothing to replace them. In the run-up to the vote, the public can expect a steady drumbeat of official warnings about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, says BBC political reporter Brian Wheeler, as Mrs May and her team try to sell her plan. A leaked copy of Downing Street's own timetable for media announcements has ""security"" listed as a Thursday priority with ""international trade"" scheduled the following day. Please upgrade your browser Mr Wallace was speaking at the International Security Expo in London, where he said that such a no-deal departure would be a step backwards for security co-operation. He added that the UK, through the experience of the last few decades, had learnt the value of working with its European partners. He said: ""We and Europe know, from bitter experience, that often when there is a mistake or when something has been missed that we find, time and time again, that it has been due to a failure of co-operation. ""A no-deal situation would have a real impact on our ability to work with our European partners to protect the public."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The UK wants to maintain all the existing security arrangements - and it knows that the EU wants to maintain this high level of co-operation out of mutual self-interest. But there are problems. Critics of the government's hopes for post-Brexit security are concerned that the proposed final relationship with the EU - that would kick in in 2021 - is long on aspirations but short on solutions. It's not remotely clear if the UK will be able to access EU-organised databases, such as those that exchange criminal records, wanted alerts and DNA and fingerprint records, after the transition. Once transition ends, so does access to the data - unless a security treaty can be agreed. But even if that treaty is signed, it may come up short. Some nations, like Germany, have constitutional bars on how they can co-operate on security with non EU states. In his address, Mr Wallace said that Mrs May's agreement would set the foundations for the broadest security relationship the EU has had with another country. The partnership would include the ability to exchange information on criminals and tackle terrorism, to quickly share data on people travelling to and from the UK to spot potential threats, to exchange DNA and fingerprints, and to fast-track extraditions. Ms Abbott described the government plans as ""dangerously flimsy"". Diane Abbott said the plan was ""simply unacceptable"" She said: ""There is no new security treaty on offer, which is vital for cross-border policing arrangements, especially extradition."" She added that there were ""only aspirations for a vague security partnership, no plans for proper security arrangements, including with Europol"" and that it was ""simply unacceptable"". As the vote on the PM's deal draws closer, details of what will happen in Parliament during the build up were released. The Commons will debate the agreement for eight hours a day on 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11 December under business proposals set out by the government. But MPs will be allowed to table six amendments to the Brexit motion, to be chosen by the Speaker of the House of Commons and heard before the vote on 11 December. Labour has put forward an amendment ""rejecting Theresa May's botched Brexit deal"" and to stop a no-deal, calling for all options to be left on the table if it gets voted down. The party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the deal ""is a miserable failure of negotiation by a government that has wasted the last two years fighting with itself, rather than securing a better deal with the EU"". Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis called the amendment ""shameful and irresponsible behaviour"", adding: ""All they are interested in is trying to force a general election.""

"The UK and US have agreed an ""open skies"" deal for post-Brexit flights, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said. The arrangement means airlines would continue to fly from the UK to the US after Brexit, the Department for Transport (DfT) said. Flights between the countries operate under the US-EU open skies treaty. The deal with the US is one of nine bilateral air services arrangements secured by the UK to replace it. The others are with Albania, Georgia, Iceland, Israel, Kosovo, Montenegro, Morocco and Switzerland. Discussions with Canada are at an ""advanced stage"", according to the DfT. Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Mr Grayling said transatlantic flights have helped bring the UK and US ""even closer together, strengthening our ties and boosting our economies"". The Brexit campaigner went on: ""This new arrangement and those concluded with eight other countries around the world are proof that the UK will continue to be a major player on the world stage after we leave the EU."" Under the deal, EU majority-owned airlines that are operating between the UK and US will be able to continue to fly existing routes as long as they remain owned and controlled by EU/EEA nationals or UK nationals. But any airline that is not owned and controlled by UK nationals and wants to start offering transatlantic routes after Brexit would need to seek a waiver from the US government. That technicality aside, aviation consultant John Strickland said: ""It's positive news for UK airlines operating to the US market that this agreement has been reached. ""It appears that enough flexibility has been negotiated to allow for different scenarios of either UK or EU majority ownership, a point of importance for IAG, and for Virgin, which is in the process of becoming non-UK majority owned as Air France takes a stake."" Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways owner IAG, described the aviation agreement with the US as ""a significant positive development which we welcome"" that ""facilitates strong competition and is clearly pro-consumer"". IAG is registered in Spain and has shareholders from around the world. Sir Richard Branson is in the process of reducing his stake in Virgin Atlantic to 20% by selling almost a third of the business to Air France-KLM. Theresa May'sBrexit agreement with Brussels says that the UK and EU have agreed to negotiate a ""comprehensive air transport agreement"",externalfor UK-EU flights during the planned transition period but it would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal.

"Large parts of the British economy are not ready for a no-deal Brexit, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said. Fewer than half of businesses have initiated contingency plans, Mr Carney told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the UK would need a transition period to adapt to whatever form of exit from the EU that Parliament chose. He denied that the Bank's warning thatno-deal could lead to a UK recessionwas intended to scare people into backing his favoured form of Brexit. Mr Carney told the BBC that ""we know from our contacts with business, others know from their contacts, that less than half the businesses in the country have initiated their contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit"". ""All the industries, all the infrastructure of the country, are they all ready at this point in time? And, as best as we can tell, the answer is no,"" Mr Carney said. It is in the interests of the country that there should be a transition to whatever new relationship the UK has with the EU, he said. He added: ""We know issues around the borders, we go to the ports and we know the issues that are there today. So we need some time to get ready for it."" Security warnings over no-deal Brexit UK and US agree post-Brexit flights deal Brexit: A really simple guide On Wednesday,MPs warned that there was a ""real prospect"" of ""major disruption"" at UK portsin the case of a no-deal Brexit, with government plans ""worryingly under-developed"". However, the Department for Transport said the Public Accounts Committee's conclusions ""were not accurate"". Conservative MP and Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound on Wednesday, saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight ""lack all credibility"". Mr Rees-Mogg said ""project fear"" had become ""project hysteria"". ""The overwhelming majority - 87% - of British companies do not trade with the European Union,"" he said. ""It will not have an effect on them. Leaving the European Union is a real economic opportunity and it's an opportunity that neither the Bank of England nor the Treasury in its forecasts wishes to recognise,"" Mr Rees-Mogg added. Mr Carney's comments come after government forecasts warned that the UK would be economically poorer under any form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU. Under Theresa May's Chequers Brexit plan, the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years compared with staying in the EU, government analysis suggested. With a no-deal Brexit, the hit to the economy would be 9.3%. ""Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,"" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The Bank of England, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that the UK economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath of Brexit if there was no transition period, house prices could fall by almost a third, and that the pound could fall by a quarter. The UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has said the risks of the draft Brexit agreement were ""preferable to the risks of a no-deal scenario"". ""Leaving the EU creates a number of risks for us regardless of the form of exit,""the FCA said in a report.,external ""The implementation period helps address these at the cost of a lower ability to influence regulation during that period. An exit without agreement would carry much higher risk and carry significant uncertainty for us and for firms. ""Against that background, and viewed through the lens of our statutory objectives, the draft Withdrawal Agreement and the outline political declaration are preferable steps."" The FCA was asked by the Treasury Select Committee to consider the impact of Brexit in three areas: a no-deal scenario; the draft withdrawal agreement; and the outline political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK. In a letter to the committee's chairman, Nicky Morgan, FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said a no-deal scenario ""would create significant challenges and risks in terms of firms' readiness, potential market disruption and insufficient public-policy solutions put in place on the side of the EU"".

"This video can not be played Jack Burn died hours after being born at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford Staff at a hospital trust being investigated over baby deaths say there is a ""culture of bullying and harassment"", a report has revealed. Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust (SaTH), which is already in special measures, has now been rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Emergency and maternity services at its two hospitals were deemed unsafe. Trust chief executive Simon Wright said: ""You cannot be unaffected by a report like this."" The112-page report,external, published on Thursday, lists a catalogue of issues at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, Shropshire. The trust was previously rated as ""requires improvement"" overall. The trust is currently being investigated over alleged maternity failings, with more than 200 families raising concerns about care at the trust. Baby death review: What do we know? It recentlyabandoned a plan to close Telford's A&E department at nightbecause of a shortage of doctors, drafting in extra staff instead. Inspectors also said as well as the bullying and harassment claims they ""found a culture of defensiveness from the executive team"". Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was placed in special measures earlier this month The report said staff felt they were not listened to and were sometimes fearful to raise concerns or issues, there was low morale among staff and high levels of stress and work overload. A former nursepreviously told the BBC of a ""bullying, intimidatory culture"" at the trust, with junior staff frightened to raise concerns or questions for fear of being labelled troublemakers. Inspectors also found: Medical care, surgery, critical care, end of life at both sites require improvement Medical and nurse staffing ""was not adequate to keep patients safe"" particularly at Telford Staff did not feel valued, supported or appreciated by senior staff The CQC's report said inspectors were ""particularly concerned"" about the trust's emergency department and maternity services. A temporary midwife-led unit at Shrewsbury being used after its original building was damaged by snowfall last December was deemed ""unfit for purpose"" with senior staff ""crisis-managing"". There has also been a shortage of midwives due to sickness and maternity leave, inspectors found. People have protested over plans to close the A&E department at The Princess Royal at night The CQC has given the trust a raft of improvements to make, listing 81 issues that needed to be tackled, including ensuring staff are trained to protect patients from harm, and reviewing midwife staffing levels to keep women and babies safe. It said the trust should also improve how it escalates cases of women at high risk at the midwifery-led unit or day assessment unit and review its policy on reduced foetal movements for midwives and sonographers. Hundreds question baby care at NHS trust 'Doctors ignored me - my girls are gone' Latest news from the West Midlands Other required improvements covered the maintenance of safe environments, speeding up complaints handling, the secure storage of medicines and records and the administering of antibiotics for patients with suspected sepsis. However, inspectors rated the trust as ""good"" for being caring and said they did find ""examples of outstanding practice in end of life care services at both sites"" as well as in its postnatal maternity care. The trust said some of the CQC concerns had been addressed through recruitment and improved reporting by its maternity services. By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This damning report will be an awful read for the families who have lost babies as a result of errors by this trust. Speak to any of them, and their fervent wish is that nobody has to go through the same experience as they did. The continuing inability of the trust, therefore, to ensure heart rates are properly monitored and the failure to learn lessons after incidents, smacks of a callous arrogance towards those families. Fundamentally this is a trust that has been badly led for years. Today's report is stark in its denunciation of the current management - not all of them have the ""right skills and abilities"" to provide ""high-quality sustainable care"". Chief executive Simon Wright insists he is not out of his depth, but under his watch the trust has demonstrably deteriorated. The recently appointed chairman said on Wednesday that they ""can't carry on doing the same things with the same people"".

"Large parts of the British economy are not ready for a no-deal Brexit, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said. Fewer than half of businesses have initiated contingency plans, Mr Carney told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the UK would need a transition period to adapt to whatever form of exit from the EU that Parliament chose. He denied that the Bank's warning thatno-deal could lead to a UK recessionwas intended to scare people into backing his favoured form of Brexit. Mr Carney told the BBC that ""we know from our contacts with business, others know from their contacts, that less than half the businesses in the country have initiated their contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit"". ""All the industries, all the infrastructure of the country, are they all ready at this point in time? And, as best as we can tell, the answer is no,"" Mr Carney said. It is in the interests of the country that there should be a transition to whatever new relationship the UK has with the EU, he said. He added: ""We know issues around the borders, we go to the ports and we know the issues that are there today. So we need some time to get ready for it."" Security warnings over no-deal Brexit UK and US agree post-Brexit flights deal Brexit: A really simple guide On Wednesday,MPs warned that there was a ""real prospect"" of ""major disruption"" at UK portsin the case of a no-deal Brexit, with government plans ""worryingly under-developed"". However, the Department for Transport said the Public Accounts Committee's conclusions ""were not accurate"". Conservative MP and Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound on Wednesday, saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight ""lack all credibility"". Mr Rees-Mogg said ""project fear"" had become ""project hysteria"". ""The overwhelming majority - 87% - of British companies do not trade with the European Union,"" he said. ""It will not have an effect on them. Leaving the European Union is a real economic opportunity and it's an opportunity that neither the Bank of England nor the Treasury in its forecasts wishes to recognise,"" Mr Rees-Mogg added. Mr Carney's comments come after government forecasts warned that the UK would be economically poorer under any form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU. Under Theresa May's Chequers Brexit plan, the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years compared with staying in the EU, government analysis suggested. With a no-deal Brexit, the hit to the economy would be 9.3%. ""Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,"" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The Bank of England, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that the UK economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath of Brexit if there was no transition period, house prices could fall by almost a third, and that the pound could fall by a quarter. The UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has said the risks of the draft Brexit agreement were ""preferable to the risks of a no-deal scenario"". ""Leaving the EU creates a number of risks for us regardless of the form of exit,""the FCA said in a report.,external ""The implementation period helps address these at the cost of a lower ability to influence regulation during that period. An exit without agreement would carry much higher risk and carry significant uncertainty for us and for firms. ""Against that background, and viewed through the lens of our statutory objectives, the draft Withdrawal Agreement and the outline political declaration are preferable steps."" The FCA was asked by the Treasury Select Committee to consider the impact of Brexit in three areas: a no-deal scenario; the draft withdrawal agreement; and the outline political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK. In a letter to the committee's chairman, Nicky Morgan, FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said a no-deal scenario ""would create significant challenges and risks in terms of firms' readiness, potential market disruption and insufficient public-policy solutions put in place on the side of the EU"".

"Riley Long: ""You have no choice but to do what they're asking you"" A majority of young holidaymakers working as au pairs in Australia are being exploited, a study suggests. Au pairs are typically given board and some payment by an overseas family in return for minding children and doing light housework. But many end up being effectively used as employees earning well below the minimum wage, the report says. The Australian government said it did not tolerate ""exploitative practices"". The study, billed as the biggest of its kind, surveyed 1,500 international au pairs working across Australia. ""The demand for au pairing is often explained by Australian families' need for affordable childcare,"" said co-author Laurie Berg from the University of Technology, Sydney. ""But we found that the majority of families were taking advantage of a large supply of working holidaymakers to get cheap housekeepers as well.  So au pairs are working as full-time housekeepers but being paid like babysitters."" It's estimated there are at least 10,000 people working as au pairs in Australia - with 90% of them young women. There is no specific visa for the role - with most coming onto the country on a working holiday visa which allows them to stay with a family for half a year. Ryleigh Brown says she is happier after moving in with a new family Families can then apply for the au pair to be given a six-month extension. ""The lack of regulation means there's a stark power imbalance between families and au pairs,"" Dr Berg said. Findings of the report, conducted by UTS and Macquarie University, included: 60% of au pairs found themselves working for about 36 hours a week, doing not only childcare but daily cooking, cleaning and other household tasks. One in three au pairs who had their contracts terminated were given just 24 hours to move out and find alternative accommodation. Au pairs who found a host family through an agency fared no better than those who made their own arrangements through Facebook groups and other methods. Riley Long, 30, from Kansas has returned to the US after working as an au pair in Australia. He told the BBC exploitation was common, from being asked to do additional cleaning to regular babysitting well beyond what initially had been expected. ""You have very little privacy and because you live under their roof, you have no choice but to do what they're asking you,"" he said. British au pair Ryleigh Brown, 20, from Eastbourne in East Sussex has found happiness helping look after four children with a family living outside Canberra. But she told the BBC previous jobs had left her isolated - claiming one family was not welcoming, communicated mainly by text message and expected her to do far more cleaning than she bargained for. ""I felt like 'the help'. It was like they just wanted an extra pair of hands, not someone to come and look after their kid,"" she said. ""It's supposed to be a cultural exchange but I didn't get anything out of it that I couldn't have got back home."" Australia's Home Affairs Department said that people on working holiday visas had the same rights as all other employees - and that employers who exploited workers faced prosecution. The Cultural Au Pair Association of Australia has been lobbying the government for more regulation, including a push for a specific au pair visa. ""We send young Australians to the US who work as au pairs under well-regulated programmes and so we should expect the same for young people who come here to Australia,"" chairwoman Wendi Alyward told the BBC. But she said that despite the horror stories, most au pairs enjoyed their time in the country. ""Overwhelmingly au pairs are happy with their experience. A family engages with an au pair, an au pair shares their culture. That's cultural exchange. It's very hard to measure currently but we know it happens in most cases."" Ms Alyward - who is also managing director of travel firm AIFS, which includes an au pair agency - said arranging placements with a reputable firm which screened both au pairs and families was one way to help ensure the experience was positive for everyone. Reports of exploitation in sectors of the Australian workforce reliant on backpackers are not new. Last year a study foundone in three backpackers and a quarter of foreign students working in Australia were being paid about half the minimum wage or less, with those in fruit-picking jobs faring worst.

"The killing of Kian Delos Santos was one of the most high-profile deaths in the campaign Three Philippine police officers have been found guilty of the high-profile murder of a teenager, the first such convictions since President Rodrigo Duterte's ""war on drugs"" began. A court sentenced them to up to 40 years in prison each for the killing of 17-year-old Kian Delos Santos in 2017. President Duterte launched the anti-narcotics campaign in 2016, to deal with a rampant drug problem. Since then 5,000 dealers or users have been killed, according to police. President Duterte has been criticised by human rights groups for what is seen as sanctioning the extrajudicial killings and promising to pardon police officers convicted for ""drug war"" killings. The judge said murder was ""not a function of law enforcement"" ""A shoot first, think later attitude can never be countenanced in a civilised society,"" said Thursday's ruling by Judge Roldolfo Azucena. ""Never has homicide or murder been a function of law enforcement. The public peace is never predicated on the cost of human life,"" he added. Philippine mourners angry at Duterte 'The Rock' behind Duterte's drugs war Manila police removed after teen deaths The killing of Kian Delos Santos in the capital city, Manila, has been one of the most high-profile deaths in the campaign. He was found dead in an alley. He was accused by police of being a drug runner - though the family dispute this. Police said they had killed him in self-defence. Then CCTV footage emerged contradicting the official police report and sparking huge public outrage and protests. Howard Johnson, BBC News, Manila On the day of Kian Delos Santos's funeral, hundreds turned out wearing white T-shirts with the words ""Justice for Kian"" emblazoned across them. But Kian's death had a much wider significance: it was the first drug war killing that caused national outrage. Kian was the son of an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW), his mother Lorenza worked in Saudi Arabia as a domestic helper, sending remittances to her family. Many in the Philippines with OFW relatives could relate to the family's trauma. President Duterte had modelled himself as father-like figure to clean up drugs and crime back at home, but now his drug war had killed a teenager. Two days after the funeral, President Duterte met the Delos Santos family at the President's Palace in Manila and promised to ensure an early resolution of the case. Today's verdict will no doubt be celebrated by the government as a delivery of that promise, but human rights groups say there are still thousands of other drug war killings that are yet to be independently investigated and given due process. Two months after the killing the police were ordered to stop the anti-drugs campaign. But the campaign was reinstated in December last year with President Duterte citing a worsening drug situation. Human Rights Watch called the convictions a ""triumph of justice and accountability"". The group also said it served as ""warning to members of the Philippine National Police to respect due process and the rights of civilians as they do their job"". The three convicted policeman are not eligible for parole. Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a press briefing the verdict showed ""that this country has a robust judicial system"". Mr Panelo also reiterated that President Duterte's ""war on drugs"" was always intolerant of any kind of abuse from military or police. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is currently examining the anti-narcotics campaign and the extrajudicial killings. In response,Mr Duterte has started the process of withdrawing the Philippines from the ICC. Manila's brutal nightshift. Video, 00:04:48Manila's brutal nightshift Profiting from death?

"This video can not be played A further video of a separate incident involving the boy's sister has since emerged A video appearing to show the sister of a Syrian refugee being attacked at the same school where her brother was allegedly assaulted has emerged. Footage circulated online shows the boy, 15, being pushed to the ground at Almondbury Community School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. A 16-year-old is to be charged with assault.

"The UN has called the Yemen war the world's worst humanitarian crisis The US Senate has advanced a measure to withdraw American support for a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, in a blow to President Donald Trump. Many senators are unhappy with Mr Trump's response to the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had urged senators not to back the motion, saying it would worsen the situation in Yemen. However, senators voted 63-37 to take forward the bipartisan motion. Criticism of Saudi Arabia has grown since Khashoggi, a US resident, was killed while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in Turkey on 2 October. US media have said the CIA believes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered his killing. President Trump has consistently defended US business and military ties with Saudi Arabia However, President Trump has dismissed the report, saying the CIA had not drawn firm conclusions. He has described Saudi Arabia as a vital ally and resisted calls for sanctions against the kingdom's leadership. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far The journalist who vanished into a consulate Senators are also unhappy that CIA director Gina Haspel did not attend their closed session hearing on relations with Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. Ms Haspel has heard what Turkey claims is a recording of Khashoggi's murder and has studied evidence in the case. One senator described her absence as a ""cover-up"". ""It's time to send Saudi Arabia a message, both on its violation of human rights and the incredible humanitarian catastrophe it's creating in Yemen,"" Democratic Senator Bob Menendez said. Republican Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said: ""We have a problem here. We understand that Saudi Arabia is an ally, of sorts, and a semi-important country. We also have a crown prince that's out of control."" Why is Saudi Arabia so influential? A similar resolution came up for a Senate vote earlier in the year and failed to pass, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher reports from Washington. But the climate is different now, and senators are more and more concerned about the way Saudi Arabia is conducting the war, citing its terrible toll on civilians, our correspondent adds. The vote in the Senate means further debate on US support for Saudi Arabia is expected next week. Some of the senators who voted for the motion do support coalition efforts in Yemen, but wanted to show their deep disapproval with how the Trump administration had handled Khashoggi's death. Mike Pompeo said ending support for the Saudi-led war would be ""untimely"" Even if the Senate ultimately passes the resolution, it is unlikely to be approved in the current House of Representatives. Republicans hold a majority and have voted down similar measures in the past. However, this could change in the new year, when Democrats take over the majority. There could also be an impact on other votes - for example, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has said he will withhold his vote on any key issue, including spending bills, until the CIA gives senators a briefing on the Khashoggi killing. What's the US government position? Mike Pompeo has restated the White House's view that ""there is no direct reporting connecting the Saudi crown prince to the order to murder Jamal Khashoggi"". The Saudis have blamed rogue intelligence officers for the killing. Jamal Khashoggi wrote a column for the Washington Post Mr Pompeo also defended the administration's continued support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen, saying withdrawing it would undermine efforts to reach a ceasefire. How my country has changed The girl with the strawberry ring He said the US was ""on a cusp"" of gathering the warring parties for talks ""to hopefully achieve a ceasefire"". A vote, he added, would ""encourage the Houthis"" and their Iranian allies. The conflict between the Saudi-led military coalition and Houthi rebels has killed thousands of people and pushed millions more Yemenis to the brink of starvation. Yemen: Who is fighting whom? Yemen's conflict in 400 words The US provides logistical and intelligence support to the coalition and sells weapons used by the Saudis. The support includes helping coalition planes refuel mid-air, and offering military advice - for example, on how to target air strikes precisely.

"The UN has called the Yemen war the world's worst humanitarian crisis The US Senate has advanced a measure to withdraw American support for a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, in a blow to President Donald Trump. Many senators are unhappy with Mr Trump's response to the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had urged senators not to back the motion, saying it would worsen the situation in Yemen. However, senators voted 63-37 to take forward the bipartisan motion. Criticism of Saudi Arabia has grown since Khashoggi, a US resident, was killed while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in Turkey on 2 October. US media have said the CIA believes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered his killing. President Trump has consistently defended US business and military ties with Saudi Arabia However, President Trump has dismissed the report, saying the CIA had not drawn firm conclusions. He has described Saudi Arabia as a vital ally and resisted calls for sanctions against the kingdom's leadership. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far The journalist who vanished into a consulate Senators are also unhappy that CIA director Gina Haspel did not attend their closed session hearing on relations with Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. Ms Haspel has heard what Turkey claims is a recording of Khashoggi's murder and has studied evidence in the case. One senator described her absence as a ""cover-up"". ""It's time to send Saudi Arabia a message, both on its violation of human rights and the incredible humanitarian catastrophe it's creating in Yemen,"" Democratic Senator Bob Menendez said. Republican Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said: ""We have a problem here. We understand that Saudi Arabia is an ally, of sorts, and a semi-important country. We also have a crown prince that's out of control."" Why is Saudi Arabia so influential? A similar resolution came up for a Senate vote earlier in the year and failed to pass, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher reports from Washington. But the climate is different now, and senators are more and more concerned about the way Saudi Arabia is conducting the war, citing its terrible toll on civilians, our correspondent adds. The vote in the Senate means further debate on US support for Saudi Arabia is expected next week. Some of the senators who voted for the motion do support coalition efforts in Yemen, but wanted to show their deep disapproval with how the Trump administration had handled Khashoggi's death. Mike Pompeo said ending support for the Saudi-led war would be ""untimely"" Even if the Senate ultimately passes the resolution, it is unlikely to be approved in the current House of Representatives. Republicans hold a majority and have voted down similar measures in the past. However, this could change in the new year, when Democrats take over the majority. There could also be an impact on other votes - for example, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has said he will withhold his vote on any key issue, including spending bills, until the CIA gives senators a briefing on the Khashoggi killing. What's the US government position? Mike Pompeo has restated the White House's view that ""there is no direct reporting connecting the Saudi crown prince to the order to murder Jamal Khashoggi"". The Saudis have blamed rogue intelligence officers for the killing. Jamal Khashoggi wrote a column for the Washington Post Mr Pompeo also defended the administration's continued support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen, saying withdrawing it would undermine efforts to reach a ceasefire. How my country has changed The girl with the strawberry ring He said the US was ""on a cusp"" of gathering the warring parties for talks ""to hopefully achieve a ceasefire"". A vote, he added, would ""encourage the Houthis"" and their Iranian allies. The conflict between the Saudi-led military coalition and Houthi rebels has killed thousands of people and pushed millions more Yemenis to the brink of starvation. Yemen: Who is fighting whom? Yemen's conflict in 400 words The US provides logistical and intelligence support to the coalition and sells weapons used by the Saudis. The support includes helping coalition planes refuel mid-air, and offering military advice - for example, on how to target air strikes precisely. More generally, the US provides more than 60% of Saudi Arabia's arms imports. The conflict began in 2014 when the Houthi Shia rebels seized control of the north of the country and went on to take the capital Sanaa, forcing the president to flee. It escalated dramatically in March 2015, when Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Muslim Arab states - backed by the US, UK and France - began air strikes against the Houthis, with the aim of restoring the government.

"This video can not be played Magdiele, Mariely and a friend said they were told they had to pay Â£300 each before they could see a property. A letting agency has been demanding hundreds of pounds in payment before prospective tenants are allowed to view properties for rent, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has found. The practice, by Flintons, breaches guidelines and could be unlawful. Shadow housing minister Melanie Onn said renters needed more rights  and the case was the ""tip of the iceberg"". Flintons, in London, denied any wrongdoing and said it did not charge any fees for viewings. Guidance from the Competition and Markets Authority says that to ""require a deposit from a tenant before they have been given the opportunity to inspect the property or the tenancy agreement"" could constitute an ""aggressive practice"" and be unlawful. Several of Flintons's clients told the Victoria Derbyshire programme they had been assured by their estate agent that they would have their payment refunded if they did not like the property but after requesting refunds had been told the money was not refundable after all. Israel Kujore and his friend Harry responded to one of Flintons's adverts. He said they had gone to see an agent who had told them they needed to pay a deposit to see a room but that the money would be refundable. They had paid Â£300 each to see a property, but Israel soon realised something was wrong. Israel Kujore said the experience had left him feeling ""really miserable and defeated"" Mr Kujore had then looked into the company online and found dozens of negative reviews. ""I was seeing reviews and horror stories. I was feeling really miserable and defeated. I was really upset,"" he said. He had decided to seek a refund but had been told that the money was not refundable. ""Â£300 is half my rent gone. What can I do? I don't have the money to sue them. I don't have legal expertise to deal with it - I'm powerless."" Get in touch with the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme by emailing victoria@bbc.co.uk. Flintons said it issued receipts specifying the sums involved were non-refundable. While this is true, Mr Kujore - and other tenants with similar experiences - said they had not been given this document to sign until after they had made the payment. They added that at the time they had been assured verbally that they could get their money back and that they had felt under pressure to pay the money immediately. David Smith said the practice was legally questionable David Smith, a leading specialist in residential landlord and tenant law, said the practice was legally questionable. ""Asking somebody for money, without being able to see what that contract is about, to do a viewing, would quite likely to be seen by professional people in the property sector as unreasonable and unfair behaviour,"" he said. ""It is therefore likely to be an offence under the consumer protection from unfair trading regulations."" Ms Onn called for the government to give greater protection to renters. ""Letting agents as well as landlords should be properly regulated,"" she said. ""Of the 8,000 letting agents we've got around the country, only about half of those are voluntarily signed up to a code that means that they will operate to the highest professional standards. That means that half of them are not."" Flintons denies any wrongdoing. It said it did not charge any fees for viewings and payment was taken only when someone confirmed they wanted to rent the property. It said these payments were taken as a ""holding deposit"" - money paid to a landlord or letting agent to reserve a rental property - which were always non-refundable and that it did not believe there would be any purpose in taking deposits if the individual could get their money back. It added that all those featured in the BBC's report had been made aware that their deposits were not refundable and it did not agree with their version of events.

"Whether it is a no-deal Brexit or the agreement brokered by the prime minister, leaving the European Union promises to have a profound impact on patients and the wider NHS. From the staff who work on the wards and in the GP surgeries to the supply of vital medicines, there are implications. Here is a look at six key questions. The UK imports 37 million packs of medicine each month from the EU - although it exports even more. The port of Dover is the key supply route in and the transition arrangements mean it will remain unaffected. The key challenge will be if there is a no-deal Brexit, because there is concern of potential huge delays at the port. The government has asked firms to stockpile a six-week supply of drugs to mitigate any problems if there is no deal. However, that is logistically difficult for medicines that need refrigerating, like insulin and vaccines, or those with a short shelf life, such as some cancer drugs. Supplies of radioactive materials for scans could also be hit. Contingency plans have been put in place to fly in vital treatments,  the government has said. But even the stockpiling of normal medicines is proving problematic, according to industry. Small firms in particular have reported problems stockpiling drugs because they do not have the cash flows to fund reserves of supplies. Last month, Martin Sawer, of the Healthcare Distributors Association, told the Health Select Committee that he was ""very concerned"" about the prospect of a no deal, saying it could have ""catastrophic"" consequences for the supply of drugs. He even suggestedthe public may have to stockpile drugs themselves. The government has always insisted this is not needed - and could in fact make the situation worse. Only this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was telling MPs that while a no-deal scenario would be ""difficult"", he was ""confident that if everyone does everything they need to do, then we will have an unhindered supply of medicines"". The health and social care sectors are huge employers with one-and-a-half million and two million staff respectively. About 5% of the registered workforce in each area are from Europe. The Brexit agreement means all those currently working will have the opportunity to obtain ""settled status"" to allow them to stay. It is not clear what a no-deal Brexit would mean. The government has also indicated it will create a skilled migrants system similar to the one that operates for workers from the rest of the world. That system - known as tier two visas - allows doctors and senior nurses to be recruited from overseas. But unions have pointed out that some lower-paid nurses and non-clinical staff such as health care assistants, porters and care workers will not be covered by such a system, because the cut-off is that the worker must be earning at least Â£30,000 a year. Nicola Sturgeon urges answers on how much Brexit will cost the NHS NHS managers warn about impact of no deal The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' There are other related factors too. The message Brexit sends to people from Europe and the weaker value of the pound, which means any money sent back to their homeland is worth less, could put off people from working in the UK. That is a point made last month by the Cavendish Coalition, a group of 36 health and care charities. It predicted Brexit could worsen the staffing shortages currently being seen in the health service. The government is more confident, arguing staff from Europe will stay and that it has a plan to ""grow its own"", with increasing numbers of doctors and nurses in training. About 27 million people in the UK have European Health Insurance Cards. They entitle the holder to state-provided medical treatment across the EU and also in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland. The cards cover pre-existing medical conditions as well as emergency care. This will continue during the transition period, but, like much else, what happens afterwards has yet to be resolved. And if there is a no deal, the cover EHIC provides will cease to exist in theory. Attempts could be made to put reciprocal agreements in place - and given the amount of tourism into the UK from Europe it would clearly be in everyone's interest to ensure individuals are entitled to health care. Then there are the one million UK citizens who live abroad in the EU. They are currently eligible for the same health care as citizens of the EU country in which they live and they can use EHIC when they travel. The EU and UK have agreed that these people would retain their rights, but once again a no-deal Brexit could scupper that. The UK is considered a world leader in medical research, having produced around 25 of the top 100 prescription treatments. The country currently benefits from access to research funding from the EU via programmes such as Horizon 2020 and the Innovative Medicines Initiative. These will continue during the transition phase, but beyond that it seems likely the UK will be treated as a third-party collaborator, meaning it will be less likely to lead programmes and will have little role in the design of them. Collaboration on rare diseases could also be put at risk. As the number of patients with rare conditions in each country is low, it is only possible to recruit enough patients for clinical trials by carrying out those trials across countries, according to the Brexit Health Alliance. Restrictions to the free movement of researchers and academics could also have an impact. Around three-quarters of UK researchers have worked abroad and currently nearly a fifth of science, technology, engineering and mathematics academics at UK institutions are from the EU. The government believes a ""mutually beneficial outcome"" is perfectly possible to deal with all these problems, given the UK is such a key player in medical and scientific research. The government is also increasing its spending on research and development. Medical research concern over Brexit Clearly, the NHS is struggling to cope with the number of patients it is seeing. The three key waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and hospital operations are being missed in every part of the UK. The public does believe migrants are a factor in this - or at least the wider demand on services. In 2017 an Ipsos opinion poll found 58% of people in the UK agreed with the view that immigration placed pressure on public services. The government's Migration Advisory Committee looked at this in the autumn. Its report,externalfound migrants were net contributors to the health service - in that they gave more than they took. That is because of the significant numbers working in the health service and the fact they were less likely to use it. The committee said this was because they tended to be young and healthy. The only exception was in maternity care, the committee said. The proportion of births to mothers from the EU has trebled in the past 15 years to one in 10. It was one of the most controversial claims of the referendum campaign. Vote Leave said the money saved in payments to the EU would mean an extra Â£350m a week could be spent on the NHS. The prime minister has claimed this has come true. Over the summer she announced the NHS budget would increase by Â£20bn by 2023. On top of that, about Â£4bn will be given to the rest of the UK. That amounts to more than the promised Â£350m a week. Theresa May has said it will be partly paid for by a Brexit ""dividend"". Although, as the UK is committed to paying into the EU budget until the end of the transition period and will also have to pay the Â£39bn divorce bill, it arguably leaves little to cover the cost of the rise. The Treasury has said a combination of economic growth and perhaps even tax rises may be needed. Another way to look at it is to ask whether the NHS would have got such a rise if Brexit was not on the cards? Many think so. After all, it was long overdue. Since 2010 the NHS has been receiving between 1% to 2% extra each year - half the average rises it previously enjoyed. Who gets social care and who pays for it?

"Waterstones called Rooney's second novel ""astounding"" Sally Rooney's novel Normal People, which has won rave reviews and a deal to become a BBC drama, has been named the best book of 2018 by Waterstones. The novel tells the intimate story of an on-off relationship between two school friends in a small Irish town after the financial crisis. Waterstones said the book confirmed the 27-year-old author as ""one of the outstanding novelists at work today"". Dublin-born Rooney said she was ""very touched by the honour"". Normal People is Rooney's second novel and was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize earlier this year. It was described as ""a future classic""by the Guardian,external, ""superb""by the Irish Times,external, and ""quite astonishing""by the Independent,external.

"This video can not be played How Carlsen kept his World Chess Championship crown...after 50 hours! World number one Norwegian Magnus Carlsen has retained his World Chess Championship title, beating US opponent Fabiano Caruana in a tie-breaker event. He beat Caruana in three time-limited games, ending the American's hopes of becoming the first US champion since Bobby Fischer won in 1972. This showdown followed a new record, in which all 12 matches of regular play were drawn. Carlsen told the BBC that the win was ""huge for me"". ""Fabiano played very well and he's an extremely strong player so it's very special,"" he said. ""It was very tense for these whole three weeks and there was no point in particular where I felt I was going to win the match. I didn't particularly feel that I was losing it either. It was always hanging in the balance."" Caruana, however, told Norway's NRK TV that he had had a ""bad day"". ""I didn't even put up a fight,"" he said. Why is this year's World Chess Championship so exciting? Carlsen, who has won the championship three times before and was the favourite to win the game, took a two-match lead and needed only a draw in the third tie-breaker to seal his victory. But Caruana resigned in the third as it became increasingly clear the Norwegian would win. Players needed to win the best of four of these shortened games to take the title. Fabiano Caruana, right, is ranked number two in the world after Carlsen While there have been longer streaks of draws in chess, the lack of a win or loss in the entire championship battle set the new record. ""The match has made history, though of an ignoble kind,"" the World Chess broadcast's tournament report on the 12th and final regular game said, reflecting the frustration of some viewers after so many draws. Carlsen's tie-breaker victory came after he seemed to play for the tie-breaker event in the final regular game - drawing criticism from former world champion Garry Kasparov, who said the ""shocking draw offer"" showed he was ""losing his nerve"" and no longer favourite to win. Vladimir Kramnik, another Russian chess grandmaster, said: ""He might be tired of tension, fighting; maybe even of chess itself to a certain degree."" However,the Norwegian is ranked number one worldwide for fast-paced games,external, whereas Caruana is ranked at number 18. ""I'm a bit surprised that it's never occurred to anybody that I might know what's best for me,"" Carlsen told the BBC. ""It was a purely sporting decision and regardless of the result today I would have felt that it was the right one. After Carlsen's victory, Kasparov tweeted that his consistency was ""phenomenal"".

"Kellogg's is to put ""traffic light"" labelling on most of its cereal packs sold in the UK from January, having previously refused to do so. The UK government's voluntary scheme, introduced in 2013, indicates how much salt, sugar or fat foods contain. Kellogg's said it had made the change after having ""listened"" to consumers, government and retailers. Consumer organisation Which? said it was a ""positive move"" but it should apply to all cereals, not just some. The traffic light system labels foods green, amber or red, to help consumers easily identify products that have low, medium or high levels of salt, fat and sugar. Kellogg's new labelling will start to appear on brands including Coco Pops, Crunchy Nut, Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Frosties and Special K from January 2019. The rollout will be complete by early 2020. ""We are changing because the people who buy our food told us we should.  Following our announcement late last year to overhaul our cereals in the UK, we decided to look again at labelling,"" Kellogg's said in a statement. Kellogg's UK managing director Oli Morton said the decision followed a survey of 2,000 Britons asking them about their attitudes towards labelling. Mr Morton said: ""Put simply, they said we should change and move to a full colour solution as they want help making healthy decisions. We've listened and now we're acting."" However, traffic light labelling will not be used on Kellogg's multilingual boxes shared across several European countries, where the system is not well-known, nor will it appear on single serve packs. As a result just under 80% of Kellogg's cereal packs sold in the UK and Ireland will carry the new labels. Until now Kellogg's has stuck to the so-called ""Reference Intake"" labelling scheme, displayed in monochrome colours on packs. It shows the maximum amount of calories and nutrients people should eat in a day. Now, though, it said: ""Times have changed; changing to colour coded labels is a response to what consumers and government want from us in the UK."" Many supermarkets have voluntarily adopted the traffic light system for their own brands, while rival cereal maker Nestle introduced the ""traffic light"" scheme on its cereal brands including Shreddies and Cheerios in 2017. Weetabix has used it since 2016. Earlier this yearWhich? called on the governmentto fix the ""chaos"" of food labelling standards when the UK leaves the EU. Under EU rules, traffic light labelling is voluntary, so some manufacturers do not use it. Which? said it should be mandatory. Strategic policy adviser Sue Davies said the organisation believed the traffic light nutrition system helped people to compare ""at a glance"" how much sugar, salt and fat a product contains and was ""an effective way of helping them to make healthier food choices"". ""While this is a very positive move from Kellogg's, it should apply to all the brand's products sold in the UK and Ireland, not just 80% of them.

"This video can not be played Carney warns of lower pound and higher inflation on no-deal A no-deal Brexit could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis, the Bank of England has warned. It said the UK economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, while house prices could fall by almost a third. The Bank of England also warned the pound could fall by a quarter. The Bank's analysis comes afterthe Treasury said the UK would be worse offunder any form of Brexit. This Bank's scenario is not what it expects to happen, but represents a worst-case scenario, based on a so called ""disorderly Brexit"". The scenario looks at the five-year period after the UK leaves the EU. But by the end of 2023, the economy is expected to resume growing. What did we learn from the Bank of England? Brexit will make UK worse off, government warns ""These are scenarios not forecasts. They illustrate what could happen not necessarily what is most likely to happen. ""Taken together the scenarios highlight that the impact of Brexit will depend on the direction, magnitude and speed of the effect of reduced openness of the UK economy,"" Bank of England governor Mark Carney said. The Bank of England has made a number of assumptions - not forecasts - about what would cause a disorderly Brexit. The UK reverts to World Trade Organization rules No new trade deals are implemented by 2022 The UK loses all access to existing trade agreements between the EU and third countries Severe disruption at borders because of customs checks Migration reverses from 150,000 a year to falling by 100,000 a year The Bank of England does not give a probability of this happening. Scenarios drawn up by the Bank of England show that GDP would fall by 8% in 2019 against its current forecast. Growth would quickly resume and the economy would expand again by the end of 2023 but be smaller than where it was before. Unemployment would rise to 7.5%, house prices fall by 30% and commercial property prices collapse by 48%. Interest rates would reach 4%. The Bank looked at three other scenarios. a ""disruptive"" Brexit - one where the UK retained access to some trade agreements what might happen if trading arrangements were agreed to give the UK a ""close"" relationship what might happen if trading arrangements were agreed to give the UK a ""less close"" relationship A close relationship is one with no customs checks, no regulatory barriers and a partial deal agreed on financial services. A less close relationship is one where customs checks start after 2021 and other regulatory checks are put in place. If Brexit is disruptive rather than disorderly, GDP falls 3% over the five years to 2022, house prices slide 14%, and unemployment reaches 5.75% If a close trading relationship is agreed, the economy could still be 1% smaller than if the UK had remained in the EU but 1.5% higher than the bank's most recent estimate. If it is less close, the economy's growth could be 3.75% less than if the UK had remained in the EU and 0.75% less than forecast over the last inflation report. These figures cover the period to 2023. By political reporter Brian Wheeler Theresa May will not have told the Bank's economists what to say in their report but it is definitely helpful to her. The timing is significant too. A leaked copy of Downing Street's media grid had today down as ""economy"". Tomorrow is ""security"". So expect a steady drumbeat of official warnings about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit in the run up to 11 December's vote. Downing Street's hope is that however much they hate her deal (and they do) MPs will come to view it as the only safe option. The problem is that these kind of warnings, however well-grounded in facts and figures, are too easily written off as ""project fear"". The more scary they sound, the easier they are to dismiss. Conservative MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound - saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight ""lack all credibility"". Speaking to the BBC, Mr Rees-Mogg said ""project fear"" had become ""project hysteria"". And the pro-Brexit former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: ""The bottom line of both sets of reports is that project fear like Frankenstein's monster has been resuscitated and is stalking the land."" However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The Bank has confirmed what other independent reports this week have been telling us: a no-deal Brexit could be even worse than the financial crisis of 10 years ago, and the country would be much worse under Theresa May's deal,"" he said. Mr Carney said the Bank was monitoring markets and indicated that it was ready to lend to UK banks if necessary. He also indicated that banks might be allowed to hold less capital if risks became too great. But he warned there was little the Bank could do. ""There is little monetary policy can do to offset the potentially significant hits to productivity and supply that Brexit could entail... the future potential of this economy and its implications of jobs, real wages and wealth are not in the gift of central bankers,"" he said. The Bank of England has exposed seven major lenders to a stress test which it said was two and half times more severe than the Brexit scenarios. All seven lenders - Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, Santander and Nationwide Building Society - passed the test. What did we learn from the Bank of England?

"A disorderly Brexit - with no deal and no transition period - could, in a worst-case scenario, deliver a severe economic shock to the economy, triggering a worse recession than we saw after the financial crisis, with the economy shrinking by 8%. House prices could fall by 30%, commercial property by 48%. Unemployment nearly doubles, the value of the pound could fall by a quarter, which would push up the price of imported goods, and see inflation rise by 6.5%. That could prevent the Bank from lowering interest rates to help the economy - in fact interest rates might rise to 4% to tackle inflation. Holy cow - so far so bad. But wait. The bank also said today in itsFinancial Stability Report,externalthat a close economic partnership after Brexit between the UK and the EU with zero friction at the border could see the UK economy boosted by up to 1.75% compared to current estimates as uncertainty lifted and confidence returned. That doesn't appear to be on the table if you read the recent deal signed by the EU 27. A more realistic assumption perhaps is a trade deal based on the one Canada has with the EU which involves some non-tariff barriers at or behind the border. Not entirely frictionless - but Canada plus. On this basis, the bank thinks the UK economy will be between 1.25% and 3.75% lower in five years time than it would otherwise have been. The government's own assessment was that kind of scenario would leave the UK economy between 2.5 and 3.9% smaller by 2035 than if we'd stayed in the EU. To argue the toss over half a percent here when comparing highly uncertain scenario analyses over long and different time scales like these is pretty pointless. But the broad outlook from both the government and the Bank is similar. Almost every plausible scenario makes the UK worse off than it would have been if it had stayed in the EU. According to the Bank - the worst outcome is worse than the government thinks, and the best likely outcome is less bad. Its important to remember these are scenarios - not forecasts of what will happen to the economy. That gets affected by loads of other factors like trade wars, real wars, technology, natural disasters and so on, but in looking at the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit, the bank has in some ways come to the Prime Minister's aid. The difference between her Brexit and no deal is very wide indeed. Her deal is not good, but its not that bad and no deal could be positively ugly. Correction 26 March 2019: This article has been amended to make clear that in a worst-case scenario one of the consequences of a Brexit with no deal and no transition period could include the economy shrinking by 8%, according to the Bank of England.

"The UK will be poorer economically under any form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU, new government analysis suggests. Official figures say the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under Theresa May's Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU. But a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit, the new estimates say. The prime minister said her deal was the best one available for jobs and the economy. ""Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,"" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The government's Brexit deal faces a potentially difficult vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Before that Mrs May is touring the country to promote the deal and was due to be in Scotland on Wednesday afternoon. Reality Check: Can forecasts get it wrong? May defends Brexit deal Davis attacks 'flawed' Brexit forecasts A guide to where we are with Brexit Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal? Confusinglythe 83-page document does not,externalforecast the impact of the prime minister's current deal. Instead it looks at the potential impact of the proposals agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers in July, which is the basis of the current proposal. Under those circumstances the economy would be 3.9% smaller than if the UK had remained part of the European Union. The estimates do not put a cash figure on the potential impact on the economy, but independent experts have said that 3.9% of GDP would equate to about Â£100bn a year by the 2030s. The government report also examines three other possible scenarios including a no-deal Brexit, which would be the most damaging. The economy will continue to grow under all the scenarios, but there is a wide variation in how much. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis questioned the research, saying previous Treasury forecasts had been proved wrong and were based on ""flawed assumptions"". Chancellor Philip Hammond said the planned Brexit deal combined most of the economic benefits of remaining in the EU with the political benefits of leaving the EU. Asked if the UK would be poorer under Mrs May's deal, he said: ""The economy will be slightly smaller in the prime minister's preferred version of the future partnership."" But Mr Hammond argued that staying in the EU was not politically ""viable"". Veteran Conservative Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash said Mr Hammond was effectively arguing for the UK to stay in the European Union in his ""extraordinary"" statement. He said the chancellor had ignored potential economic benefits of leaving the EU, asking: ""What about the trade deals which could give us the most enormous opportunities throughout the world, if we are able to strike them?"" Under Mrs May's deal, the UK would be able to negotiate trade deals during the transition period after 29 March's Brexit day, but would not be able to implement them until the end of the planned 21-month transition period, which could itself be extended. By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent This exercise doesn't predict how much the economy will grow over the 15-year period, but rather the impact of specific changes in Britain's trade relationships, other things being equal. That is after all the question we want answered. One problem is that it will be harder to judge when we look back whether the figures were right, because we would be comparing what actually happened with a hypothetical alternative that didn't. The same applies to the impact on the government's finances. That said, all the scenarios in the analysis show an adverse effect; the saving on contributions to the EU is more than offset by the lower tax revenues that would result from the weaker economic growth. There are also some striking differences in regional economic impacts. In the no-deal situation the biggest effects are in North East England and the West Midlands. London gets away with least damage in that situation, but the capital is worst hit in the government's preferred option. That is because London specialises in services that would gain less, compared to no deal, than manufacturing from the relationship the government is seeking to negotiate.

"Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conduct A witness in the Carl Sargeant inquest may have lied to the coroner, the hearing has been told. Mr Sargeant, 49,was found hanged by his wife Bernadette on 7 November at his homein Connah's Quay, Flintshire. A statement from Flintshire council's deputy leader, Bernie Attridge, said he thought ""the sacking killed my friend"". But Cathy McGahey, counsel for Carwyn Jones, said it appeared Mr Attridge had some ""knowledge of behaviour that would have made Mr Sargeant anxious"". Mr Sargeant was found dead four days after he wassacked as communities minister by the first minister. The Labour AM had been accused of behaving inappropriately towards women, which he denied, and the inquest was told""tangible"" complaints were made weeks before he died. He left a letterapologising to his family and telling them: ""I have failed you."" Coroner John Gittins agreed to hear applications on the potential submission of new evidence which has come to light from witnesses including Flintshire council leader Aaron Shotton. Ms McGahey said: ""Mr Shotton has come forward with a witness statement that contradicts some of Mr Attridge's evidence. ""There is what appears to be a text message from Mr Attridge to Mr Shotton on November 1 2017... and it appears to refer to Mr Sargeant. ""Mr Attridge bets he is shitting bricks... He refers to MPs in Westminster being exposed and it won't be long before AMs are... on the hit list."" I failed you', Carl Sargeant told family 'Tangible' complaint made against Sargeant Carl Sargeant timeline Carl Sargeant: Profile of AM's career First Minister Carwyn Jones gave evidence to the inquest on Wednesday Ms McGahey said Mr Attridge went on to say, on 5 November, that rumours about Mr Sargeant were circulating in the Labour Club and he wanted to discourage people in the Labour group from saying anything in support of him. He then implied, she said, Mr Sargeant had done something ""that could lead to imprisonment"". ""Mr Attridge and Mr Attridge alone will know exactly what he meant by those,"" she told the coroner, before adding: ""It does appear on the face of it that Mr Attridge has not told you the truth. ""Signing the statement of truth when you know something you are saying is not true, is a contempt of court."" Mr Gittins heard applications from counsel relating to the submission of this new evidence, but he declined, saying he already had enough to do his job. Earlier, the inquest heard the first minister warned Mr Sargeant to ""be careful"" over conduct and drinking after an anonymous letter said he was ""not fit to be around women"". Leslie Thomas QC questioned Carwyn Jones on how Carl Sargeant's sacking was handled Speaking at the inquest in Ruthin, Denbighshire, on Wednesday, Mr Jones said he had received an anonymous letter in 2014 from someone in Mr Sargeant's Alyn and Deeside constituency. ""I remember the words 'he's not fit to be around women', but the letter was anonymous. I showed it to Carl,"" he told the hearing. Mr Jones said he told Mr Sargeant in 2014: ""You need to know... be careful, there's obviously someone who's watching you. ""Be careful how you conduct yourself and how much you drink."" He said Mr Sargeant ""wasn't an alcoholic"", but the company he kept was ""quite a hard-drinking bunch"". He told Mr Gittins the pair had known each other since 2001 and had ""never had a cross word"". Mr Jones did not know Mr Sargeant suffered from depression or had taken anti-depressants, the inquest heard. Carl Sargeant tweeted a statement after being sacked by the Welsh Government four days before he died. Asked when he first became aware of rumours about Mr Sargeant's conduct, he said: ""Rumours are plentiful in politics. Evidence is rare."" He did not know what the rumours were, but became aware of them on 18 October 2017, the day he held a meeting with senior advisors to discuss the cabinet reshuffle. One of two complainants who had made allegations about Mr Sargeant put it in writing to the Labour party in October, dating from an event in summer 2017. Pushed by the coroner why he had not spoken to Mr Sargeant, he said: ""Had I given him more details in terms of the allegations... he'd have known straight away, I suspect, who those people were and that was a risk I couldn't take."" He said ""the fact we had names"" meant there was ""an obligation to look further"". Mr Sargeant tweeted a statement on the afternoon he was sacked - highlighting that it related to personal conduct - and Mr Jones said there was ""no need to volunteer the information"". Mr Gittins responded: ""So that's what happens in politics? We keep secrets because it suits everybody to do so?"" ""It's not secrets. It's a gentler way of doing it,"" said Mr Jones. Carwyn Jones is stepping down as first minister in December Ahead of the meeting between the pair, Mr Jones said he had ""a feeling of dread going in that morning... I had lost sleep over it,"" but said it ""had to be done"". Mr Sargeant's response was ""curious"", and he said he ""did not recognise"" the allegations. ""In politics, that's not a denial,"" Mr Jones said. He was ""a little panicked but not distraught,"" but Mr Jones said there was ""no reason to doubt that he understood the implications"". He advised him to speak to his trade union for advice and ""keep your head down"". But following Mr Sargeant's tweet, he said the Welsh Government had to ""firefight"". ""The press would speculate. Twitter is corrosive,"" he added. ""Because of that tweet there was a media frenzy that made all manner of allegations about Carl that weren't true."" The inquest heard audio of Mr Jones speaking on a BBC Wales news broadcast on 6 November, the day before Mr Sargeant died. In it, Mr Jones used the words ""incidents"". The coroner asked him if he saw the difference between that and the word ""allegations"". ""It's quite clear from that news report that the news report is about allegations,"" he replied. Leslie Thomas QC is representing the Sargeant family Mr Jones had said the reshuffle happened on a Friday as Mr Sargeant had been away and if it was held mid-week he would not have had the support of his family on hand. Leslie Thomas QC, representing the Sargeant family, asked why it was necessary to draw Mr Sargeant's attention to the anonymous letter sent in 2014. Mr Jones felt it was right to let him know, as the letter had also been sent to Mrs Sargeant. He had not spoken to Mr Sargeant about a complaint from 2016 because ""the complainant didn't want me to"". The inquest heard Ann Jones AM acted in a liaison role between the Labour group and Mr Sargeant, and secondly in a pastoral role. Mr Jones said this happened on the afternoon following Mr Sargeant's dismissal and Ms Jones ""wanted to make sure that Carl was okay from a personal level as well"". Mr Jones planned to hold a reshuffle in November 2017 because he was in talks with an AM who had left his party, as well as wanting to offer new opportunities to others. During the course of the discussions, he received the written complaints about Mr Sargeant. Prior to that, Mr Jones characterised rumours about Mr Sargeant as ""tittle-tattle"", according to evidence from one of his special advisors. Mr Jones said the written allegations, which came just days before the reshuffle on 3 November, ""could not be ignored as part of the reshuffle process"". Mr Sargeant, who was being considered for the role of leader of the house, was sacked that day. Mr Jones confirmed it was ""wholly"" his responsibility who was appointed or moved and he had ""complete discretion"" over the cabinet. Earlier, Mr Jones' senior special advisor Matthew Greenough was recalled to the inquest to clarify some of the evidence he gave on Tuesday, around the timings of allegations made against Mr Sargeant. The ""tangible"" complaints referred to alleged incidents in summer 2017, made by women known in court as Miss A and Miss B. These were reported via the Labour Party to Mr Jones in October 2017. One of two women involved later made a written statement. There had previously been two separate allegations in 2016, although one was in the form of an anonymous letter. Mr Greenough agreed one allegation by a woman known as Miss C could have been made in 2015, but he did not know about it until 2016. He told the court he was present in the room when the reshuffle where Mr Sargeant lost his job took place and no information regarding any of the women was discussed in his presence. He told Mr Thomas he did not believe Mr Jones could have had a conversation with anyone without him knowing. Special advisor Jane Runeckles confirmed there were ""rumours"" about Mr Sargeant, but he was still in consideration for leader of the house at a meeting on 18 October 2017. Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay The coroner said he struggled to understand how that might still be the case. ""The first minister was absolutely clear at that point that it was tittle-tattle. He had nothing to suggest otherwise,"" she replied. Mr Sargeant's sacking was precipitated by Mr Greenough receiving the written statement from one complainant on 1 November. Mr Gittins asked if that was ""the deciding factor in terms of his removal from office"", to which Ms Runeckles replied ""yes"", adding it would have been difficult to postpone a reshuffle. Mr Sargeant's brother Andy asked whether Ms Runeckles did anything to support him, and she said ""no"", explaining: ""The whim of the electorate is something [politicians] subject themselves to... you go into it knowing that this kind of thing can happen to you."" Mr Thomas repeatedly questioned Ms Runeckles over the 18 October meeting and any discussion of the rumours around Mr Sargeant, particularly in light of the #MeToo movement and ""political fallout"" in Westminster. She told the court she did not enquire where the rumours had come from and said they were ""not relevant"", which Mr Thomas challenged. She agreed she could have spoken to Mr Sargeant about the matter, but did not. Mr Thomas asked if the reshuffle was ""just a convenient way of trying to mask"" the situation surrounding Mr Sargeant. ""Absolutely not,"" she replied. The first minister was asked why, after allegations from Miss A and Miss B in 2017, Miss C - who made her original allegation in 2016 - was contacted to see if she wished to complain. He accused Mr Jones of ""setting the scene"" to ""get rid"" of Mr Sargeant. ""I could've removed Carl from the cabinet for no reason at all,"" Mr Jones responded. He said he felt it was right someone who had come forward in 2016 should now be asked if they wanted to make a complaint.

"Kellogg's is to put ""traffic light"" labelling on most of its cereal packs sold in the UK from January, having previously refused to do so. The UK government's voluntary scheme, introduced in 2013, indicates how much salt, sugar or fat foods contain. Kellogg's said it had made the change after having ""listened"" to consumers, government and retailers. Consumer organisation Which? said it was a ""positive move"" but it should apply to all cereals, not just some. The traffic light system labels foods green, amber or red, to help consumers easily identify products that have low, medium or high levels of salt, fat and sugar. Kellogg's new labelling will start to appear on brands including Coco Pops, Crunchy Nut, Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Frosties and Special K from January 2019. The rollout will be complete by early 2020. ""We are changing because the people who buy our food told us we should.  Following our announcement late last year to overhaul our cereals in the UK, we decided to look again at labelling,"" Kellogg's said in a statement. Kellogg's UK managing director Oli Morton said the decision followed a survey of 2,000 Britons asking them about their attitudes towards labelling. Mr Morton said: ""Put simply, they said we should change and move to a full colour solution as they want help making healthy decisions. We've listened and now we're acting."" However, traffic light labelling will not be used on Kellogg's multilingual boxes shared across several European countries, where the system is not well-known, nor will it appear on single serve packs. As a result just under 80% of Kellogg's cereal packs sold in the UK and Ireland will carry the new labels. Until now Kellogg's has stuck to the so-called ""Reference Intake"" labelling scheme, displayed in monochrome colours on packs. It shows the maximum amount of calories and nutrients people should eat in a day. Now, though, it said: ""Times have changed; changing to colour coded labels is a response to what consumers and government want from us in the UK."" Many supermarkets have voluntarily adopted the traffic light system for their own brands, while rival cereal maker Nestle introduced the ""traffic light"" scheme on its cereal brands including Shreddies and Cheerios in 2017. Weetabix has used it since 2016. Earlier this yearWhich? called on the governmentto fix the ""chaos"" of food labelling standards when the UK leaves the EU. Under EU rules, traffic light labelling is voluntary, so some manufacturers do not use it. Which? said it should be mandatory. Strategic policy adviser Sue Davies said the organisation believed the traffic light nutrition system helped people to compare ""at a glance"" how much sugar, salt and fat a product contains and was ""an effective way of helping them to make healthier food choices"". ""While this is a very positive move from Kellogg's, it should apply to all the brand's products sold in the UK and Ireland, not just 80% of them.

"This video can not be played Rape victim Sammy Woodhouse says she is ""constantly being re-victimised"" A victim of child sexual exploitation has called for a change in the law amid claims a man who raped her was offered a role in her son's life. It is understood Arshid Hussain, who was jailed for 35 years in 2016, was contacted by Rotherham Council about care proceedings heard last year. His victim Sammy Woodhouse told the BBC she was ""shocked"" when she was informed of the council's approach. The authority said it had ""no intention"" of putting a child at risk. Urgent efforts would be taken to ""address the failings in this case"", The MoJ said. Latest news from across Yorkshire Ms Woodhouse described Hussain as ""a danger to myself and to other children"". In a video posted on Twitter she urged the government ""to change the law to ensure rapists can't gain access to children conceived through rape"". 'What about my rights?' Hussain, known around Rotherham as Mad Ash, was one of three brothers behind the grooming and sexual abuse of more than 50 girls, including Ms Woodhouse. She was just 14 when she met him. Arshid Hussain was convicted of grooming and sexually abusing young girls in Rotherham Ms Woodhouse, who waived her anonymity in an effort to help other victims, said she thought when Hussain was jailed she could then get on with her life and would never hear from him again. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Woodhouse said: ""We're constantly being re-victimised and as a rape victim I'm constantly told 'well actually, he's got his human rights'. ""What about my human rights?  What about other people's human rights and our children and our right to constantly have to keep our children safe?"" Ms Woodhouse, who now speaks about child sexual exploitation and her experiences, is calling for changes to the 1989 Children Act, alongside Sheffield Heeley MP Louise Haigh. Although Hussain has not made any application, Ms Woodhouse said it was important to get the law changed to protect others. ""This is happening all over the country, and it needs to stop,"" she added. Ms Woodhouse said her son was supporting her and had given his permission for her to speak out. According to The Times, the council had contacted Hussain and promised to keep him informed about future proceedings, after he was listed as a ""respondent"" in a Family Court case involving the boy. Solicitor Denise Lester, former chair of the Law Society's children law sub-committee, described it as ""a very, very difficult case"". ""The issue here is the law as it stands allows rapists and other abusers to participate in care and other public law proceedings She added: ""But, within that there are obviously procedures and decisions that would be made on a case by case basis by social workers to exclude a father or not"". By BBC Reality Check Legal guidelines in England and Wales state that all parents, regardless of parental responsibility, should be given notice of care proceedings. This means that by default, a convicted rapist does have the right to be notified of care proceedings involving his child. If they are married to their victim, men convicted of rape have parental responsibility and will automatically be a party in any court proceedings in which they will have their interests considered. That's the legal status that gives parents right to be given information about and be involved in important decisions affecting their child's upbringing. This doesn't mean they have any automatic rights to contact with their children however. Any application for access will assess the risk to a child and their welfare before allowing contact. Councils can apply to the court to make an exceptional order in order to avoid notifying a parent of care proceedings - although it's not guaranteed this application will be successful. These are usually only granted in cases where the child has no relationship with the father - such as in cases of stranger rape - or where there is a risk to the child, for example in cases of extreme domestic violence. In a statement, the authority said: ""We must be clear that at no stage has it been the intention of the council to put any child at risk, or to allow any convicted child sexual exploitation offender to have care of any child."" It was seeking clarification from the Ministry of Justice as to how legal directions relating to Family Court proceedings should be applied, it said. This was ""not just for Rotherham,"" it added, ""but to ensure that other councils across the country who may face similar issues are able to act with certainty and no more survivors of abuse have to experience further trauma"". A Ministry of Justice statement said: ""Local authorities can apply to courts to request permission not to notify parents without parental responsibility about care proceedings, and courts should consider the potential harm to the child and mother when making this decision."" It added: ""This is obviously a very distressing incident and the relevant departments and local authority will work urgently to understand and address the failings in this case.""
