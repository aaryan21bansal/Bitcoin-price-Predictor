"Nicola Sturgeon has warned against any ""reckless"" move to ease lockdown in Scotland despite a growing ""economic crisis"" and rising unemployment. The first minister spoke after the release ofthe latest jobless figures. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in Scotland between February and April, compared with a UK-wide rate of 3.9%. Ms Sturgeon said easing the lockdown ""too quickly"" would risk a resurgence of the virus which would cost lives and economic productivity. She said the progress made in suppressing Covid-19 so far could help build a ""sustainable economy recovery"". And she called on the UK government to extend the job retention ""furlough"" scheme, saying it was ""almost certain"" to be needed beyond October. Scotland is expected to move to the second phase of the government's ""route map"" towards lifting lockdown on Thursday, which could see a ""safe re-opening"" of more shops and workplaces. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggested that unemployment in Scotland had risen by 30,000 to 127,000 between February and April, covering the period when lockdown first hit the labour market. Ms Sturgeon said it was important to be ""cautious"" about drawing conclusions from the data. She said the protection of the furlough scheme ""means these figures are likely to be an underestimate of the full impact of Covid-19 on business activity"". However, she said it ""undoubtedly"" showed that ""dealing with the public health crisis of Covid has created an economic crisis that demands our full focus and attention"". She said: ""These kinds of statistics and generally increasing economic anxiety will lead some to argue for a quicker than planned exit from lockdown. ""But difficult though all this is, we must guard against a reckless relaxation of lockdown. If we ease restrictions too quickly and allow the virus to run out of control again, that would be economically unproductive and would cost more lives. ""The progress we have made is an essential foundation for the sustainable economic recovery we want - the more we can suppress this virus now, the more normality we can restore as we do open up the economy and society."" The latest review of Scotland's lockdown is to be held on Thursday, with the first minister saying she would ""hope and expect"" that Scotland could move to the second phase ofher government's ""route map"",external. Measures included in phase two include letting people meet in larger groups outdoors, and with another household indoors. It could also see factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops re-open and the construction industry begin to re-start. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Not all major changes will happen overnight, but I do hope in the coming weeks that further important restrictions will be lifted so workers can return to factories, with strict hygiene and physical distancing measures in place, so the construction industry can continue its restart plan, and non-essential shops have a date for safe re-opening. ""None of this will restore the economy immediately to full health but will be a sustainable improvement on our current position."" The Scottish government has identifiedfour phases for easing the restrictions,external: Phase 1:Virus not yet contained but cases are falling. From 28 May you should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2:Virus controlled. You can meet larger groups outdoors, and meet another household indoors. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops can resume work. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3:Virus suppressed.  You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4:Virus no longer a significant threat. University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. The first minister said she had ""zero interest in keeping any part of the country in lockdown any longer than is necessary"", but said ""patience will pay dividends in the future"". She said: ""A gradual re-emergence is crucial - it allows our businesses to start to operate and make money again, but we know that because this re-emergence is by necessity gradual it must be accompanied by continued support for business. ""We have welcomed assistance from the UK government such as the job retention scheme, but it's essential this is extended if that proves necessary - which I think is almost certain."" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the UK government was providing ""comprehensive coronavirus support packages"" and that thefurlough schemeand a similar system for the self-employed had ""saved nearly 800,000 jobs across Scotland"". More than a quarter of the UK's workforce isnow covered by the furlough scheme, which is due to run until the end of October - although the amount of money firms have to contribute is to increase each month. Ms Sturgeon also resisted calls to relax the 2m (6ft) physical distancing rule, saying it would hit businesses harder if the virus were to start spreading out of control again. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said it was ""essential"" this rule be relaxed ""to prevent wholesale economic collapse"" of the retail, hotel and restaurant sectors. The Scottish Beer and Pub Association said the limit ""simply does not make financial sense"". Ms Sturgeon said the rule would be kept under review, but said it was better to re-open the economy ""sustainably"" than to ""run the risk of having to shut it again weeks or months later"" because of a resurgence of the virus.

"The final closing time: General manager Jackie Cunliffe stacks chairs in the Beresford Hotel dining room Three months after lockdown shut down large parts of the UK economy, job losses are beginning to bite -  nowhere more so than in the Cornish town of Newquay where more than half of those employed work in the badly affected sectors such as tourism and hospitality. Standing in the dining room, amid a sea of upturned chair legs, piled on once bustling tables, Jackie Cunliffe reflects on the 30 years she spent working in Newquay's Beresford Hotel. ""It belonged to Shearings holidays, but actually it didn't. It belonged to us. ""We managed it, we owned it, we cared for it."" The 63-year-old general manager is widely respected and held in great affection by the 50 staff who lost their jobs when the hotel closed in May, after Shearings' parent company went into administration. Job cuts warning as 600,000 roles go in lockdown Job losses 'just the tip of the iceberg' Travel firm collapses with loss of 2,500 jobs ""We should have 200 people in here, having their breakfast, going out on tours all around Cornwall. ""We have diaries full of people asking for tables-for-two, specific rooms. All of it has just gone."" Some of the staff had gathered in the hotel ballroom to join a conference call on 22 May, when the chief executive of Shearings' parent company, Specialist Leisure Group (SLG), told nearly 2,500 employees across the UK that efforts to save the group had failed. Just three years after reporting record sales and profits, the group - owned by American private equity firmLone Star Funds,external- called in administrators, bringing to an end a company whose origins can be traced back 117 years. Remembering happier times - Caroline Tansley was a key member of the Beresford team Among those in tears at the news was Caroline Tansley, who worked at The Beresford for 20 years - primarily as a receptionist, though she often pitched in with the entertainment: singing, dancing, bingo, comedy, and as 'Mother Christmas', handing out presents to guests. As well as losing her job, Caroline is losing her accommodation and is obliged to move out by 3 July. ""Normally at this time of year, with the lovely weather we've been having, it would be heaving. ""To the see the hotel standing empty is just heart-breaking,"" she says. Her partner, Darren Philips, is in the same boat. A part-time assistant manager at the hotel, he says the company were brilliant when he lost the sight in his left eye 10 years ago, and even developed a role specially for him. The hotel's part-time assistant manger, Darren Philips, fears he will not work again The sight in his right eye isn't great either, and he fears he may not work again. ""I can't use computers. Anything that needs me to see really, I struggle with. ""I've worked here for so long, I know the building like the back of my hand. I'd struggle if I went to a different building, with steps. I'd end up falling down."" The 107-room Beresford Hotel is one of two hotels in Newquay that have been forced to close due to SLG's demise. A few yards along the same road, the 52 rooms of the Marina Hotel are empty too, the front doors directing any questions to the administrators in Wigan. Two other hotels owned by the group in Cornwall have also shut - some 150 jobs are estimated to have been lost. Newquay has seen at least two hotels close this year While Covid-19 has been less of a health crisis in the south west of England than many had feared, the pandemic is predicted to hammer the local economy. Cornwall Council will consider a report on Wednesday that indicates as many as 72,800 jobs - 27% of all jobs in the county - are at risk due to the ongoing lockdown. It calculates that the all-important tourism sector will lose Â£630m by the end of June. Data released last month showed a 61% increase in applications for Universal Credit across Cornwall; the rise in applications between March and April in Bodmin, Bude, Penzance and Newquay was over 1000%. Anda report in April from think tank, the Centre for Towns,externalpredicts Newquay will suffer the greatest economic hit of any town in England and Wales. No surprise then, that hopes of finding a new job quickly are not high among the Beresford's former employees. Some are being told they are competing with up to 500 people for jobs in local supermarkets - an intimidating prospect for the many staff who have not faced a job interview in decades. Head chef Phillip Milne says he is losing his pride Head chef Phillip Milne, who spent 18 years at the hotel and took great pride in teaching culinary skills to the many international staff who passed through, says the past few weeks have been demoralising. ""To have no security, and no jobs in the area, is very hard to swallow. ""You feel as though your pride's been taken away a bit. ""You're up at 6 o'clock in the morning because your pattern is still the same, and you're on the internet going through every single website looking for work."" Phillip led a kitchen team that could serve 190 covers in around 90 minutes on a busy day. The hotel mainly catered for older visitors, who often returned year after year for the comfort and familiarity which The Beresford offered. At the height of the summer, Shearings could bring 1,000 people to Cornwall every week. Former head housekeeper Katie Korvisia has been offered work cleaning holiday homes There is hope, if the lockdown is further eased next month and tourists begin to return, that some jobs will open up. Katie Kovisia, the hotel's former head housekeeper, has been offered a cleaning job at a holiday park for the summer, or she could clean holiday cottages on a self-employed basis. Neither prospect is particularly appealing for the 15-year veteran of the Beresford, but she realises she may not have many options: ""Here I was part of a family. It's been my life. It's very sad.""

"The number of workers on UK payrolls dived more than 600,000 by May compared to before lockdown, official figures suggest. The number of people claiming work-related benefits, which includes the unemployed, was up 126% to 2.8 million. The early estimates reflect the impact of around six weeks of lockdown in which large parts of the UK were shut. But economists say the full effect on employment will not be felt until wage support schemes end in October. ""The slowdown in the economy is now visibly hitting the labour market, especially in terms of hours worked,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics (ONS)."" NI unemployment more than doubles in two months Scotland's unemployment rate highest in UK Number claiming benefits in Wales doubles Seven charts on the coronavirus jobs market Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the Trades Union Congress, said the labour market was ""on red alert"". ""We need strong action now to stop lasting economic damage,"" she added. Separate figures published by HMRC on Tuesday showed that a total of 9.1 million workers are having their wages paid through the government's furlough scheme - more than a quarter of the workforce. Overall, the official UK unemployment rate for the three months to April held steady at 3.9% as the massive state wage support in place stopped job losses. Reflecting that, the ONS said the total number of weekly hours worked in the period dropped to 959.9 million - down by a record 94.2 million, or 9%, on the previous year. However, the agency said that early estimates from the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system showed that the number of payroll employees fell by 612,000, or 2.1%  in May compared to March, when lockdown was implemented. And it said there had been a record fall in job vacancies in that period to 476,000 - down 342,000 from the previous quarter - hinting at worse to come. Capital Economics economist Ruth Gregory said it was ""abundantly clear"" that the labour market had weakened dramatically. ""Some of this will surely start to filter through into the actual unemployment figures as the government's job furlough scheme is wound down from August."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, agreed: ""The furlough scheme continues to hold off the bulk of job losses, but unemployment is likely to surge in the months ahead."" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, warned that many businesses were expected to bring only part of their furloughed workforce back, while they sought to tentatively reopen after the lockdown. ""Hiring new workers is also likely to be put on hold for some time,"" she said. Kayleigh Rennix has never struggled to find work before. The HR manager from Essex was earning close to Â£40,000 working in the education sector before she resigned in March, fearing her role was at risk. Since then she's applied for dozens of jobs, but has had little interest from employers. ""As my leaving date approached, coronavirus reared its ugly head. I would say I've applied for more than 100 jobs and not had many call-backs,"" she says. Now the 34-year-old has found herself relying on benefit payments for the first time in her life, and expects to move back in with her parents when her tenancy expires later in the summer. Read more here Some economists believe unemployment could hit 10% - a rate not since since the mid-1990s - as social distancing rules remain in place and consumers curb their spending. The Institute of Employment Studies (IES), an apolitical think tank, pointed out that the number of claims for work benefits had risen 1.6 million since March - a rate faster, it says, than during the Great Depression of 1929. At the same time, it says there are eight unemployed people are chasing every job vacancy in the UK - up from just two before the crisis. ""It's clear too that this crisis is hitting many poorer areas hardest - with coastal towns and ex-industrial areas seeing particularly big increases in unemployment,"" said director Tony Wilson. The IES said among the worst hit areas of the UK were: Blackpool, where one in eight residents is claiming work related benefits Thanet in Kent, where the rate stands at one in eleven And Birmingham, where the rate is also one in eleven. The headline quarterly employment and unemployment numbers remain barely changed, as all the furloughed workers count as having jobs. The furlough scheme is working in suppressing unemployment and protecting livelihoods so far, the real test of its functioning is what happens now. The test of it will be whether those jobs remain as the taxpayer wage support is eased away. It requires the government to inject as much confidence as possible, into the minds of employers facing uncertainty and declining bank balances. But further rescue package and employment support will be required too. The balancing act with the pandemic remains as delicate as ever. As one Cabinet minister puts it - ""we need to restart the economy, without restarting the virus"". This video can not be played Restaurant chain owner: 'It's the worst news you can give as an employer' A swathe of businesses have announced job cuts as the economy has contracted sharply due to the pandemic, opting not to furlough those workers instead. Examples include: The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie and Benny's, which expects to cut up to 3,000 workers The UK's biggest builders' merchant, Travis Perkins, which plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. British Airways, which expects to cut 12,000 jobs BP, which is slashing 10,000 jobs worldwide And jet engine-maker Rolls-Royce is cutting 9,000 jobs, mainly in the UK. Bosses in sectors such as car making, aviation and hospitality have warned there could be many further cuts without additional government support. In normal times, the employment rate tells you most of what you need to know about jobs. But these are not normal times. With the furloughing scheme keeping people employed, if not working, we have to look elsewhere to get a picture of what's happening. It's like building a jigsaw, but with pieces from different boxes: surveys, payroll data, jobs advertised, three-month trends and even looking at week-on-week changes. The picture it builds is different to the headline employment figure but perhaps not surprising: Serious pressure on jobs during lockdown. Last week, the ONS revealedthe UK economy shrank by a 20.4% in April- the largest monthly contraction on record - as the country spent its first full month in lockdown. That is three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. Britain's economy is likely to slump by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy,the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned. Meanwhile, the latest furlough figures from HMRC indicate that more than a quarter of the UK workforce is having 80% of their monthly wages, up to Â£2,500, paid by the government, while they are temporarily off work. Their employer, which chooses whether or not to furlough workers, can top up the remaining 20% if it wishes. The Treasury also said there had been 2.6 million claims for support grants from the self-employed. The Prime Minister's spokesman said: ""We are seeing the impact of coronavirus on our economy, as is the case in many countries. ""It is starting to show in today's [jobs] figures but our extensive support through the furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts has protected thousands of businesses and millions of jobs.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We tolerate a risk of our left and right hands working independently"". The government department responsible for overseas aid is to be merged with the Foreign Office (FCO), the PM has announced. Boris Johnson told MPs abolishing the separate Department for International Development (DfID) would mean aid spending better reflected UK aims. He said the ""long overdue reform"" would ensure ""maximum value"" for taxpayers. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the move would weaken UK influence, and he would re-establish DfID if elected PM. Three former prime ministers - Conservative David Cameron, and Labour's Gordon Brown and Tony Blair - have also criticised the move. Mr Cameron said it would mean ""less expertise, less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the UK overseas"". What's behind the PM's aid department decision? UK aid budget to help boost trade agenda Ministers are aiming to set up the new joint department - called the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office - by September. The move to combine the two, which have a previous history of being merged and split up again, has long been mooted in Conservative circles. Announcing the plan in the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new joint department would lend ""extra throw-weight and kilowattage"" to the UK's aims overseas. He added that it was ""outdated"" to keep the departments separate, with other developed countries already running aid as part of their foreign ministries. For too long, he said, UK aid spending had ""been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests"". However he pledged DfID's budget - which at Â£15bn last year dwarfed the Â£2.4bn spent by the FCO - would be maintained, with the UK committed to continuing to spend 0.7% of national income on aid projects. Boris Johnson has wanted to merge the Foreign Office and Department for International Development for years. He believes that it is wrong to have two arms of UK foreign policy acting independently, and wants more coherence so the UK can speak with one voice on overseas matters. But critics within the aid sector fear this merger may see more of the money focused on UK national interests and less on poverty reduction. As such, this is a politically controversial move. Some will see it as a sensible reordering of Whitehall, to ensure joined up policy and more effective aid spending, helping the most vulnerable while also promoting Britain abroad. Others will see it as a bureaucratic distraction that will potentially weaken the UK's global reputation as an aid superpower. Read more from James Landale In response, Sir Keir said there was ""no rationale"" for the merger, which he said was being made now to ""deflect attention"" from the government's handling of the Covid-19 crisis. He said DfID had proved one of the UK's ""best performing departments,"" and abolishing it represented ""the tactics of pure distraction"". ""Abolishing DfID diminishes Britain's place in the world,"" he told MPs. Asked later on Tuesday whether he would undo the merger if elected PM, he replied: ""Yes, we introduced DfID for a reason. ""This was cross-party consensus for many many years that DfID did good work. Of course it should be reinstated."" Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, who was in charge of DfID between 2010 and 2012, said abolishing the department would be a ""quite extraordinary mistake"". But fellow Conservative Jeremy Hunt, who said he had ""wrested with this issue"" as a former foreign secretary, said the merger was the ""right thing to do"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Merger plans ""intended to deflect attention"". Oxfam, which has delivered development projects using money from DfID, said the merger would harm the fight to reduce global poverty. The charity's chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah said the move was ""scarcely believable"" at a time when the world was focused on fighting coronavirus. ""This decision puts politics above the needs of the poorest people and will mean more people around the world will die unnecessarily from hunger and disease."" ""The Foreign Office may be excellent at diplomacy, but it has a patchy record of aid delivery and is not as transparent as DfID"", he said. Former Labour PM Tony Blair - who carved DfID out of the Foreign Office during his time in Downing Street - also called the move ""wrong and regressive"". ""The strategic aims of alignment with diplomacy and focus on new areas of strategic interest to Britain could be accomplished without its abolition,"" he said. His successor Gordon Brown said the decision to axe DfID was ""sad,"" adding it had been ""one of the UK's great international assets."" SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the move represented the UK ""turning its back on the world and to those most in need"". Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said that ""confusing"" aid objectives with foreign policy decisions was a ""massive step backwards"". The department now known as DfID began life under Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964 as the Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM). It was later merged with the Foreign Office under Ted Heath's Conservative government in 1970, but was re-established as a separate ministry by Mr Wilson after his return to Downing Street in 1974. It was re-merged with the Foreign Office again however after the election of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1979. It obtained its current name of the Department for International Development (DfID) in 1997 after the carve-out under Mr Blair.

Cornwall Council will consider a report on Wednesday that indicates as many as 72,800 jobs - 27% of all jobs in the county - are at risk due to the ongoing lockdown. It calculates that the all-important tourism sector will lose Â£630m by the end of June. Data released last month showed a 61% increase in applications for Universal Credit across Cornwall; the rise in applications between March and April in Bodmin, Bude, Penzance and Newquay was over 1000%. Anda report in April from think tank, the Centre for Towns,externalpredicts Newquay will suffer the greatest economic hit of any town in England and Wales. No surprise then, that hopes of finding a new job quickly are not high among the Beresford's former employees. Some are being told they are competing with up to 500 people for jobs in local supermarkets - an intimidating prospect for the many staff who have not faced a job interview in decades. Head chef Phillip Milne says he is losing his pride Head chef Phillip Milne, who spent 18 years at the hotel and took great pride in teaching culinary skills to the many international staff who passed through, says the past few weeks have been demoralising. ""To have no security, and no jobs in the area, is very hard to swallow. ""You feel as though your pride's been taken away a bit. ""You're up at 6 o'clock in the morning because your pattern is still the same, and you're on the internet going through every single website looking for work."" Phillip led a kitchen team that could serve 190 covers in around 90 minutes on a busy day. The hotel mainly catered for older visitors, who often returned year after year for the comfort and familiarity which The Beresford offered. At the height of the summer, Shearings could bring 1,000 people to Cornwall every week. Former head housekeeper Katie Korvisia has been offered work cleaning holiday homes There is hope, if the lockdown is further eased next month and tourists begin to return, that some jobs will open up. Katie Kovisia, the hotel's former head housekeeper, has been offered a cleaning job at a holiday park for the summer, or she could clean holiday cottages on a self-employed basis. Neither prospect is particularly appealing for the 15-year veteran of the Beresford, but she realises she may not have many options: ""Here I was part of a family. It's been my life. It's very sad.""

"Fans can expect more live events, some related to the game and others about music and film Gamers in a virtual queue to join a much-anticipated live Fortnite event were left disappointed as servers hit capacity one minute after fans had been asked to join. There were some 12 million in-game players, and a further 8.4 million watched via Twitch or YouTube. The event marked the end of Season 2 and the beginning of Season 3 for the Battle Royale game. Large events like this are likely to become the norm, thinks one expert. Fortnite is one of the world's most popular online multiplayer games, with 350 million registered players according to developer Epic Games. The event - dubbed The Device - began with players gathered around The Agency, a central building on the island the game is set on. Players were transported to a not-seen-before office, and the event ended with the island surrounded by walls of water. Season 3, which has been delayed, is due out on June 17 at 07:00 BST. The much-anticipated Doomsday event had come with a warning from Epic that servers might reach capacity quickly and, when they did, it recommended gamers watch the event via Twitch or YouTube. Afterwards the firm tweeted: ""We were overwhelmed by the response to The Device. At 12 million players in-game we capped participation for stability while 8.4 million more watched live on Twitch and YouTube. As we push the edge of what live events can be, we're improving systems so more of you can experience them in-game. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lockdowns around the world have seen more and more people flocking to gaming, and Fortnite has seen a surge in virtual meet-ups during the pandemic as it bids to become a destination rather than just a game. Nearly 28 million watched a virtual Fortnite concert by rapper Travis Scott, and in May it aired a trailer for a forthcoming movie, Tenet. Another live concert featured Dillon Francis, Steve Aoki and deadmau5. Research firm Ampere Analysis's gaming expert Piers Harding-Rolls told the BBC such events would become ""more numerous as Epic tests ways to expand the game into a social interactive platform for content, or artists that reside outside of the game"". Not all fans will want the in-game experience, but for those who do he thinks it is ""unrealistic for Epic to lay on lots of new servers to deal with a spike in demand"". Epic Games, which also owns the popular chat app Houseparty, now has a valuation of about $17bn (Â£13.4bn), according to Bloomberg.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We tolerate a risk of our left and right hands working independently"". The government department responsible for overseas aid is to be merged with the Foreign Office (FCO), the PM has announced. Boris Johnson told MPs abolishing the separate Department for International Development (DfID) would mean aid spending better reflected UK aims. He said the ""long overdue reform"" would ensure ""maximum value"" for taxpayers. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the move would weaken UK influence, and he would re-establish DfID if elected PM. Three former prime ministers - Conservative David Cameron, and Labour's Gordon Brown and Tony Blair - have also criticised the move. Mr Cameron said it would mean ""less expertise, less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the UK overseas"". What's behind the PM's aid department decision? UK aid budget to help boost trade agenda Ministers are aiming to set up the new joint department - called the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office - by September. The move to combine the two, which have a previous history of being merged and split up again, has long been mooted in Conservative circles. Announcing the plan in the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new joint department would lend ""extra throw-weight and kilowattage"" to the UK's aims overseas. He added that it was ""outdated"" to keep the departments separate, with other developed countries already running aid as part of their foreign ministries. For too long, he said, UK aid spending had ""been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests"". However he pledged DfID's budget - which at Â£15bn last year dwarfed the Â£2.4bn spent by the FCO - would be maintained, with the UK committed to continuing to spend 0.7% of national income on aid projects. Boris Johnson has wanted to merge the Foreign Office and Department for International Development for years. He believes that it is wrong to have two arms of UK foreign policy acting independently, and wants more coherence so the UK can speak with one voice on overseas matters. But critics within the aid sector fear this merger may see more of the money focused on UK national interests and less on poverty reduction. As such, this is a politically controversial move. Some will see it as a sensible reordering of Whitehall, to ensure joined up policy and more effective aid spending, helping the most vulnerable while also promoting Britain abroad. Others will see it as a bureaucratic distraction that will potentially weaken the UK's global reputation as an aid superpower. Read more from James Landale In response, Sir Keir said there was ""no rationale"" for the merger, which he said was being made now to ""deflect attention"" from the government's handling of the Covid-19 crisis. He said DfID had proved one of the UK's ""best performing departments,"" and abolishing it represented ""the tactics of pure distraction"". ""Abolishing DfID diminishes Britain's place in the world,"" he told MPs. Asked later on Tuesday whether he would undo the merger if elected PM, he replied: ""Yes, we introduced DfID for a reason. ""This was cross-party consensus for many many years that DfID did good work. Of course it should be reinstated."" Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, who was in charge of DfID between 2010 and 2012, said abolishing the department would be a ""quite extraordinary mistake"". But fellow Conservative Jeremy Hunt, who said he had ""wrested with this issue"" as a former foreign secretary, said the merger was the ""right thing to do"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Merger plans ""intended to deflect attention"". Oxfam, which has delivered development projects using money from DfID, said the merger would harm the fight to reduce global poverty. The charity's chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah said the move was ""scarcely believable"" at a time when the world was focused on fighting coronavirus. ""This decision puts politics above the needs of the poorest people and will mean more people around the world will die unnecessarily from hunger and disease."" ""The Foreign Office may be excellent at diplomacy, but it has a patchy record of aid delivery and is not as transparent as DfID"", he said. Former Labour PM Tony Blair - who carved DfID out of the Foreign Office during his time in Downing Street - also called the move ""wrong and regressive"". ""The strategic aims of alignment with diplomacy and focus on new areas of strategic interest to Britain could be accomplished without its abolition,"" he said. His successor Gordon Brown said the decision to axe DfID was ""sad,"" adding it had been ""one of the UK's great international assets."" SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the move represented the UK ""turning its back on the world and to those most in need"". Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said that ""confusing"" aid objectives with foreign policy decisions was a ""massive step backwards"". The department now known as DfID began life under Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964 as the Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM). It was later merged with the Foreign Office under Ted Heath's Conservative government in 1970, but was re-established as a separate ministry by Mr Wilson after his return to Downing Street in 1974. It was re-merged with the Foreign Office again however after the election of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1979. It obtained its current name of the Department for International Development (DfID) in 1997 after the carve-out under Mr Blair.

The Manchester United forward, 22, welcomed the six-week voucher for eligible children, saying: ""Look at what we can do when we come together."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the move was a ""welcome U-turn"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised Mr Rashford's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". During the coronavirus lockdown the government is providing vouchers to families whose children qualify for free meals. But it had insisted this would not continue outside of term time.

The credibility factor: why policy u-turns matter Who gets free school meals?

""He was just grateful that someone had an opinion and shared it with people,"" Mr Rashford added. ""Being that voice for people who didn't really have the platform to speak out as much as they would like to.""

For weeks, campaigners have been calling for free school meals to be offered during the holidays. 'We go hungry so we can feed our children' Court action threatened over school meal vouchers Many families whose children qualify for free meals have since the lockdown began been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth Â£15 each week per pupil, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. Almost 1.3 million school children in England - accounting for 15.4% of state-educated pupils - were eligible for and claiming free school meals in January 2019,according to the latest available data,external. Last year's figures showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were getting the free meals. The prime minister's official spokesman said the food vouchers to cover the six-week holiday period were a response to the ""unique circumstances of the pandemic"" and would not continue beyond the summer. Referring to Mr Rashford, he added: ""The PM welcomes his contribution to the debate around poverty and respects the fact that he has been using his profile as a leading sportsman to highlight important issues."" As a striker with a killer instinct in front of goal, Marcus Rashford is used to beating defences. And he's cut straight through a nervous defensive wall of Conservative ministers - leaving them wrong-footed and facing an embarrassing own goal. A number of Tory MPs had already voiced their disquiet - and how many of them really wanted to find themselves up against an England football hero, and the risk of children going hungry? The U-turn means the government will pay the extra Â£120m to extend free school meal vouchers across the six weeks of the holidays, available to 1.3 million children. It's a one-off deal for the unprecedented pressure caused by the coronavirus - with food banks warning of growing demands. But Mr Rashford, and his 2.7 million Twitter followers, proved a tough target for the government - and he's beaten them with a fast-footed appeal directly to public opinion. Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey waswidely criticised for a comment she madein response to Mr Rashford's campaign. Mr Rashford had asked others to think about struggling parents who have had their ""water turned off"", and whose children have gone hungry. Ms Coffey replied to his Twitter thread on free school meals, saying ""water cannot be disconnected"" - prompting the footballer to say he was ""concerned"" she had only acknowledged part of his message. Among Tory MPs praising the U-turn was Tim Loughton, who said he was ""delighted"" the government had ""listened to Conservative backbenchers"".

Sonja from near Basingstoke, who has three teenage children, said the government's change of heart was ""wonderful"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive she found herself out of work and relying on benefits because of the pandemic. The free school meals vouchers have been a lifeline so far, Sonja says, adding that she was grateful to Mr Rashford for his campaign. ""[The U-turn] takes away that worry of the six-week summer holiday and makes it so much less stressful."" she said. But she added: ""I feel sad that it had to be a campaign. They have been throwing money to keep everyone afloat but left behind people on universal credit and free school meals."" Dev Sharma, Youth MP for Leicestershire, said the vouchers have been a safety net for his family and expressed his delight the government has decided to fund them over the summer after all. Dev Sharma is a member of the Bite Back youth campaign for better nutrition for young people The 15-year-old said the move ""means the world"" to him and his brother ""to know that my mum and dad have now sufficient funds to feed [us] over six weeks"".

Andrew Forsey, chief executive of Feeding Britain, said the footballer has ""done incredibly well for himself, but hasn't forgotten his roots"". But Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the government's scheme ""only covers a minority of children in poverty and the pressures are much wider than just school meals"".

The children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, who wrote to the chancellor about the issue last week, said she was pleased ministers had ""seen sense and changed their minds"". Sonja from near Basingstoke, who has three teenage children, said the government's change of heart was ""wonderful"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive she found herself out of work and relying on benefits because of the pandemic. The free school meals vouchers have been a lifeline so far, Sonja says, adding that she was grateful to Mr Rashford for his campaign. ""[The U-turn] takes away that worry of the six-week summer holiday and makes it so much less stressful."" she said. But she added: ""I feel sad that it had to be a campaign. They have been throwing money to keep everyone afloat but left behind people on universal credit and free school meals."" Dev Sharma, Youth MP for Leicestershire, said the vouchers have been a safety net for his family and expressed his delight the government has decided to fund them over the summer after all. Dev Sharma is a member of the Bite Back youth campaign for better nutrition for young people The 15-year-old said the move ""means the world"" to him and his brother ""to know that my mum and dad have now sufficient funds to feed [us] over six weeks"". ""I can now have access to a decent meal and be on the same level as my peers from more affluent backgrounds,"" he said. DIET AND IMMUNITY:How important is diet for the immune system? CORONAVIRUS QUIZ:Debunk the myths Several charities have praised Mr Rashford's campaign. Andrew Forsey, chief executive of Feeding Britain, said the footballer has ""done incredibly well for himself, but hasn't forgotten his roots"". But Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the government's scheme ""only covers a minority of children in poverty and the pressures are much wider than just school meals"". She said ""soaring numbers of families"" were having to rely on foodbanks to get through the pandemic, even with the voucher scheme in place. Does you child qualify for free school meals?

As our live page draws to a close, here are the major world events linked to coronavirus for Tuesday: The top story was really a UK story - the breakthrough in the medical world with the drug dexamethasone, which can save the lives of seriously ill coronavirus patients. But the other top stories globally have been: There are fewer very happy Americans than at any point in nearly 50 years, according to a new survey. The new poll was released by theNational Opinion Research Center,externalat the University of Chicago and used data from the General Social Survey (GSS) data. It found that only 14% of Americans described themselves as very happy. In 2018, the last time the poll was conducted, it was 31%. The GSS has collected data every other year since 1972. The previous low point came in 2010 when 29% of Americans said they were very happy. Currently, 50% of people say they sometimes feel isolated, compared to 23% in 2018. The numbers are somewhat unsurprising, given the lockdowns that have separated communities and led to social isolation. The survey was conducted in May, before the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, which touched off protests across the nation and world. London club Chelsea are 0-3 down to Bayern Munich in the Champions League last-16 European football chiefs look set to finalise plans to finish this season's Champions League and Europa League over the next 24 hours. Uefa's executive committee is expected to announce that Portugal and Germany will host a ""final eight"" knockout tournament for each competition. However, there has been disagreement about how the outstanding last-16 ties in the competitions are to be resolved. BBC Sport have been previewing the plans ahead of the committee's crunch meeting on Wednesday.Read more here. The Duke of Cambridge has joked that he is looking forward to having a pint in the pub, as he praised ambulance staff for their hard work during the pandemic. In his first face-to-face meeting with the public in months, the prince told ambulance crews at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Norfolk he thought the weekly Clap for Carers - when people across the UK stood on their doorsteps to applaud the country's NHS staff and key workers - was ""powerful"". ""Everyone appreciates the NHS, we have an amazing system and many countries around the world envy what we have,"" he told them. In a lighter moment, he joked he was looking forward to being told he could go to the pub again and shared his worry for the country's waistline. ""I've done a lot of baking at home - chocolate goes down very well,"" he said. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released a new video explaining the risks of passing the coronavirus to your household pet. The video, which is spliced with cute cats and dogs around their mask-wearing owners, advises that the chance of catching Covid-19 from a pet is ""considered low"". ""But it does appear that people can give the virus to animals,"" it continues, adding that cats and ferrets are most likely to get infected. Cats should be kept indoors and dogs should be walked on a leash, according to the FDA guidance. Pets should only be allowed to interact with members of their own households. If you do become infected, the FDA advises that you find someone else to watch your pet until you are better. If that isn't possible, then you should wear a mask around your pet, and wash your hands both before and after playing with them. Allow YouTube content?

Health workers protested in French cities including Paris, Strasbourg and Nice Thousands of doctors, nurses and hospital staff in France have been protesting to demand more investment in the health system. Like in many countries, the French public expressed their significant gratitude and support to medics during the pandemic - now health workers want this to be followed with more resources. Around 18,000 people attended the protests in Paris, which ended with violent action by a small group who threw stones and overturned a car. Police made 20 arrests. Unions are asking for pay rises, a recruitment drive and more beds in hospitals, and say Covid-19 exposed the weaknesses of the French health service. President Emmanuel Macron says his government is three weeks into a consultation and has announced bonuses for staff who worked through the crisis. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Patient credits dexamethasone with saving her life We've been hearing a lot about the drug dexamethasone, which has been found in a medical trial to cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. Briton Katherine Millbank took part in the trials and credits the drug with saving her life. An emotional Mrs Millbank has been telling the BBC about her experience. A Beijing official warned the new outbreak - linked to an open air market - is ""extremely severe"" Earlier we reported that a cluster of new cases connected to a Beijing market in China is causing serious concern. Now all schools have been ordered to close in an effort to contain the outbreak. The first case, linked to a market, was recorded on Thursday and cases have been rising since then. Beijing had not seen any new cases for more than 50 days before this. Schools and universities reopened just a few weeks ago, but now classes will once again go online. Entertainment venues will also close, and people must be tested before they will be permitted to leave the capital. This video can not be played Boris Johnson thanks Marcus Rashford for school meal campaign More than a million schoolchildren in England will be able to claim free meal vouchers during the summer, the UK government has said. It followed acampaign championed by footballer Marcus Rashfordfor an existing scheme to be extended during the school holidays due to the coronavirus crisis. The government had previously insisted it would not award free school meals vouchers in England outside of term time, prompting the footballerto pen an open letterto MPs asking for the decision to be reversed. At the Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the Manchester United and England forward, 22, for his efforts. Earlier today, the head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine told MPs that requiring patients to have an appointment before attending hospital casualty departments may be necessary in the UK following the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Katherine Henderson told the Commons Health and Social Care Select
Committee that older people were those usually most in need of emergency treatment but they were also the age group most at risk from Covid-19. She said that emergency wards were used to having ""elastic walls""
and an ""infinite number of patients"" but that they now needed to know who was coming into A&E. Henderson told MPs that
NHS 111 could be the first port of call for those in urgent need who could then be given an appointment to attend hospital. She told the committee that is was ""just impossible"" to have an 80-year-old with a hip fracture left waiting in a corridor alongside a patient with suspected Covid-19.  Many restaurants and bars have remained open throughout the pandemic, with some social distancing introduced Sweden took a different approach to managing coronavirus than most countries - it avoided lockdown and kept many workplaces and social spaces open. Now there is an uptick in cases again in the Scandinavian country - a further 15,000 confirmed infections since the beginning of June, bringing the country's total to 53,000. The leading health official, Anders Tegnell, denied that it was a sign the virus was taking hold again. He put the rise down to an increase in testing. Nonetheless, he urged Swedes to minimise socialising during the upcoming midsummer celebrations. His critics accused him of arrogance for resisting a lockdown, but the country's death rate is better than some countries that introduced serious restrictions, including the UK, Spain and Italy. Nearly 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Sweden. Having been closed to the public for three months, London Zoo welcomed back its first visitors yesterday. The Zoological Society of London had warned it would face permanent closure if the government did not relax restrictions so it could allow the public back in. But the experience of visiting the zoo is now a little different to how it was before the pandemic. The attraction is only allowing 2,000 visitors to come each day, and they must have a pre-booked, timed-entry ticket. Restaurants and cafes are closed and additional hand sanitising stations and distance markers have been installed. This video can not be played Coronavirus: ZSL London Zoo reopens after lockdown The Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has confirmed that the US Open will take place in New York City's Queens borough but without any spectators. The US Tennis Association's (USTA) signature Grand Slam event is due to run from 31 August to 13 September. In a tweet, Cuomo said that organisers would ""take extraordinary precautions to protect players and staff, including robust testing, additional cleaning, extra locker room space, and dedicated housing & transportation"". Some players have already expressed concerns about playing in the tournament. The US Open is normally the fourth and final Grand Slam, but will be only the second this year. The French Open could now start just one week after the end of the US. Wimbledon was cancelled for the first time since 1945. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked
if the UK had banned the export of dexamethasone at today's Downing Street briefing. Itâs a cheap and widely
available drug which a trial at Oxford University has shown can save the lives
of patients who are severely ill with Covid-19 and need oxygen treatment. The prime minister said he wasnât
aware of the ban. On 24 April, dexamethasone,
in the form of tablets and capsules,was added to a list of medicines that cannot be exported from the UK or hoarded,external. And today dexamethasone, in
the form of oral solutions and injections, was also added to the list. According to the governmentâs
website, âexporting a medicine on the list is considered a breach of regulation
43(2) of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and a contraventionâ¦ may lead to
regulatory action by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA), which could include immediate suspension of the wholesale dealer
licence"". Thereâs more detail on the trial of dexamethasone here. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked whether the rules on attendance at funerals in England would be relaxed. At the moment the only mourners
allowed to attend are members of the deceased personâs household and close
family members or close friends if family members are unable to attend. Numbers must be kept low enough to
allow everybody to stay two metres apart. Someone to conduct the service, a
funeral director and other staff may also attend. The guidance for England says that
mourners who are self-isolating for 14 days but do not have symptoms should be
helped to attend, as should those in vulnerable groups who are shielding.
Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus should not attend. In Scotland the advice is slightly
different, with those self-isolating or shielding encouraged to seriously consider
not attending. In Wales, those allowed to attend the
funeral are the person organising it, people who have been invited and any
carers, with numbers again limited by the requirements of social distancing. The
guidance for Northern Ireland includes a limit of 10 mourners and stresses that
those who are self-isolating should not mix with other people attending. Reality Check The prime minister said at the Downing Street briefing that he
only became aware âtodayâ of footballer Marcus Rashfordâs campaign to make the
government change its mind on not extending free school meal vouchers in
England over the summer. The government has now
relented and says it will continue to run the scheme during the summer holiday and
Boris Johnson has congratulated the player. Marcus Rashford first raised his concerns on Twitter on 10 June when he
asked âAnybody know who I can talk to about the government food voucher
scheme?â Labour has also
been campaigning on the issue and sent a letter about it to Education
Secretary Gavin Williamson on 8 June. It was also raised in the House of
Commons on 9 June. In England, about
1.3 million children claimed free school meals in 2019, or about 15% of
state-educated pupils. Extending the scheme over the summer will cost around Â£120m. Thereâs more detail on how it will work and on whatâs happening across the UK in this piece.   Helen CattPolitical correspondent A bit of good news was what the government
really needed, as it faces pressure from its own backbenchers (and today, a
public questioner) on social distancing requirements and after its high profile U-turn on school meal vouchers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his weekly appearance
at the Downing Street briefing to deliver news about an unquestionably positive
development. He was very keen to point up the UK
expertise behind what he called the ""biggest breakthrough yet"" in
treating coronavirus. The scientists at today's press conference also seemed upbeat - excited
even - highlighting that the drug dexamethasone which could save the life of one in eight patients who experience serious breathing
problems is widely available and cheap. There was one note of caution in the
optimistic tone though - having a treatment doesn't necessarily mean less
stringent conditions for all of us if there is a second wave of the virus. And when it comes to that two-metre social
distancing rule, there does seem to be a hint of more wiggle room opening up, but Boris Johnson's message is still ""watch this space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson led todayâs government press conference. He was accompanied by the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford.

We'll be back tomorrow but, for now, thank you for joining us. BBC Newsbeat Georgina is a single parent with five children aged between three and 13. She lost her job as a carer during lockdown and has relied on vouchers to feed her family. She's described the U-turn over free school meals as ""amazing"" and takes the weight off her shoulders after she lost her job as a carer and had to claim benefits. ""To know that we're still going to get that money during the summer holidays is amazing,"" she told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat. ""The summer holidays were looking a little bit bleak if I'm honest. I can split money up on a weekly basis and make sure my children have got breakfast, a lunch and a dinner."" Described as the ""true jewel"" in Norwich's crown, the city's market has been on the same site since it was founded by the Normans in the 11th Century. Normally it boasts 189 stalls and plays an important part in the local economy, but then came the coronavirus lockdown and everything changed. Just over a year ago it was named the ""best large outdoor market in Britain"" but how is it coping with coronavirus restrictions - and can it survive? Stallholders have spoken to the BBC about the challenges they facein a wildly different economical climate. BBC Radio 5 Live A teenager whose family have used the safety net of food vouchers has expressed his delight that the government will fund them over the summer. Dev Sharma, a 15-year-old youth MP for Leicestershire, said the move was hugely important to him and his brother. ""It means the world to know that my mum and dad have now sufficient funds to feed [us] over six weeks,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I can now have access to a decent meal and be on the same level as my peers from more affluent backgrounds,"" he said. A shop owner has been left ""devastated"" by flooding on his first full day of trading after lockdown restrictions were eased. Dale Street in Milnrow, Rochdalewas ""completely flooded""when the River Beal rose rapidly on Monday evening. ""This can't carry on - it is the fifth flood in five years since the Boxing Day floods in 2015,"" said Philip Holt, who owns Carpet Creations. ""We're devastated but we'll dust ourselves down and reopen on Wednesday but we can't keep doing this."" Royal Ascot fans have been donning their finest threads and hats to take part in horse racing's biggest meeting from the comfort of their own homes. The coronavirus pandemic has meant the action is taking place behind closed doors with jockeys wearing face masks. However, ""virtual racegoers"" have kept up with the fun from home, using the hashtags #SharedWithThanks and #hatsfromhome to showcase their outfits on social media. Vicky O'Hagan, of Consett in Durham, and her mother, Dee, opted for a cleaning theme for their headwear. While Christopher Weatherstone, his mother Dawn, and sister Lucy, kept things classic in Rotherham in South Yorkshire, with a bow tie, dresses and fascinators. Ascot's organisers are encouraging racegoers to donate to four front-line charities. The National Emergencies Trust Relief Fund, NHS Charities Together, the Care Workers Charity and the Berkshire Community Foundation Coronavirus Fund, will all benefit. Footballer Marcus Rashford has been widely praised today for persuading the government to extend its free school meal voucher scheme in England, butwhat do the people of Wythenshawe think of their hometown hero? Christian Latimer's six-year-old daughter Mia has benefited from free schools meals during lockdown. The 27-year-old shop worker praised the footballer for his ""amazing"" campaign. ""He showed great fight and he has achieved so much in helping families who struggle to feed their children. ""As a United fan I thought he was great before but now he has shown the whole country what sort of a person he is off the pitch. ""I know he visits his old school and gives presents out to the kids. He is a great role model."" We have focused on Marcus Rashford's successful campaign to help children receive free school meals throughout the summer, but what else has happened around England today? Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit About 868,000 children in England went to school last Thursday, according to the latest data published this afternoon by the Department for Education. Although this was up by a third on the previous Thursday, it still means only 9% of children were in school. When lockdown was imposed only vulnerable pupils and the children of keyworkers were allowed to go in. Schools started to re-open to children in Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 on 8 June. Figures for this week, as some Year 10 and Year 12 pupils started to go back, should be shown in next week's data release. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent As a striker with a killer instinct in front of goal, Marcus Rashford is used to beating defences. And he's cut straight through a nervous defensive wall of Conservative ministers - leaving them wrong-footed and facing an embarrassing own goal. A number of Tory MPs had already voiced their disquiet - and how many of them really wanted to find themselves up against an England football hero, and the risk of children going hungry? The U-turn means the government will pay the extra Â£120m to extend free school meal vouchers across the six weeks of the holidays, available to 1.3 million children. It's a one-off deal for the unprecedented pressure caused by the coronavirus - with food banks warning of growing demands. But Rashford, and his 2.7 million Twitter followers, proved a tough target for the government - and he's beaten them with a fast-footed appeal directly to public opinion. BBC Radio 5 Live The government's change of heart on free school meals has been branded as ""wonderful"" by a woman relying on benefits due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sonja, from near Basingstoke, has three teenage children and has relied on benefits since finding herself out of work during lockdown. She does not start her new job until September. ""[The U-turn] takes away that worry of the six-week summer holiday and makes it so much less stressful,"" she told BBC 5live. But she added: ""I feel sad that it had to be a campaign. [The government has] been throwing money to keep everyone afloat but left behind people on universal credit and free school meals."" Katherine SellgrenBBC News The vast majority of teachers (90%) say their pupils are doing less or much less work than they would normally at this time of the year, a study finds. The report by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) says head teachers believe around a third of pupils are not engaging with set work. Limited or no access to technology was a problem for around a quarter (23%) of pupils, school leaders told the NFER. The government says it has committed more than Â£100m to help home learning.

A supermarket worker, who wishes to remain anonymous, emailed us to say she had witnessed some customers paying for alcohol with free school meals vouchers. She said: ""I appreciate there are so many families in need of food but looking at just how many [vouchers] we have received through the tills and you look at what the customer has bought, very rarely is it what you would class as essential food staples. ""Their trolleys are packed with clothes, alcohol, toys and electronics and they are using the school meal vouchers to pay for this."" ""There is
no block on what items they can purchase and we are not allowed to judge them

"Fans can expect more live events, some related to the game and others about music and film Gamers in a virtual queue to join a much-anticipated live Fortnite event were left disappointed as servers hit capacity one minute after fans had been asked to join. There were some 12 million in-game players, and a further 8.4 million watched via Twitch or YouTube. The event marked the end of Season 2 and the beginning of Season 3 for the Battle Royale game. Large events like this are likely to become the norm, thinks one expert. Fortnite is one of the world's most popular online multiplayer games, with 350 million registered players according to developer Epic Games. The event - dubbed The Device - began with players gathered around The Agency, a central building on the island the game is set on. Players were transported to a not-seen-before office, and the event ended with the island surrounded by walls of water. Season 3, which has been delayed, is due out on June 17 at 07:00 BST. The much-anticipated Doomsday event had come with a warning from Epic that servers might reach capacity quickly and, when they did, it recommended gamers watch the event via Twitch or YouTube. Afterwards the firm tweeted: ""We were overwhelmed by the response to The Device. At 12 million players in-game we capped participation for stability while 8.4 million more watched live on Twitch and YouTube. As we push the edge of what live events can be, we're improving systems so more of you can experience them in-game. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another live concert featured Dillon Francis, Steve Aoki and deadmau5. Research firm Ampere Analysis's gaming expert Piers Harding-Rolls told the BBC such events would become ""more numerous as Epic tests ways to expand the game into a social interactive platform for content, or artists that reside outside of the game"".

"Reni Eddo-Lodge's book was originally published in 2017 Reni Eddo-Lodge has become the first black British author to top UK's best-seller list since the official book chart was launched in 1998. Last week, Eddo-Lodge's book Why I'm No Longer Talking To White People About Race topped the paperback non-fiction chart, following protests about racism. The 2017 work has now become the best-selling title in the UK overall, according to Nielsen BookScan. The author said it felt ""absolutely wild to have broken this record"". Allow Twitter content?

Fellow authorNikesh Shukla congratulated her, adding:,external""Bewildering it's taken so long for this to happen but it couldn't happen to a better writer and person."" After she topped the paperback non-fiction chart last week, Eddo-Lodge criticised the UK publishing industry for the fact it had taken so long for a black author to achieve the feat. She said she was ""dismayed"" that the achievement only came about under ""tragic circumstances"" - referring to the death of George Floyd. Renewed interest in the title was sparked following protests around the death of Mr Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. After her book topped the non-fiction chart, Eddo-Lodge said: ""The fact that it's 2020 and I'm the first. Let's be honest. Reader demand aside, that it took this long is a horrible indictment of the publishing industry.""

"The Navajo Nation, a Native American reservation, spans three states When Valentina Blackhorse tested positive for coronavirus, she texted her sister and told her not to worry. A former pageant queen, Valentina was known for her love of her Native American Navajo heritage, her passion for helping others and her playful sense of humour. She doted on her one-year-old daughter, Poet, and worked as a government administrator, with dreams of leading her people some day as Navajo president. When coronavirus reached the reservation on which she lived, Valentina warned her family to stay indoors and take precautions. Weeks later her boyfriend Bobby fell ill and she tended to him at their home in Kayenta, a small town near the sandstone buttes of Arizona's Monument Valley. She'd lived with rheumatoid arthritis her whole life, but soon her joint pain started to feel different, and breathing wasn't so easy. She took herself for a test and the results came back a week later, confirming her fears. The next day, when Valentina's breathing got worse, Bobby rushed her to a health clinic. She died hours later, aged 28. ""She overcame a lot of things in her life,"" said her sister, Vanielle. ""I thought she was strong enough to pull through."" ""If we had better resources, maybe Valentina would still be alive"" Valentina was one of the youngest victims of coronavirus in the Navajo Nation, a Native American reservation grappling with what is America's worst outbreak. Since Covid-19 was first reported in the Nation on 15 March, infection rates per capita have become the highest in the country when compared with any individual state. As of 14 June, 6,611 cases have been confirmed. More than 300 people have died after contracting the virus as well - a toll higher than 15 states. The Navajo Nation is the largest reservation of its kind, in both size and population. More than 173,000 people live within its borders, in pockets of communities spread across the deserts and canyons of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. If it were a state, the Nation would be larger than 10 others. The Navajo - or DinÃ©, as they call themselves - have lived in the region for centuries, but the Navajo Nation is an American construct. After US expansion forced thousands of Navajo to leave their homes, America carved out a stretch of land where they could maintain some sovereignty. In return, the federal government pledged to support its people with funding for education, healthcare and other services. The Navajo have contributed much to America's development. Perhaps most famously, Navajo soldiers invented a military code, based on their language, that kept American communications secure during World War Two. But as coronavirus has swept through the reservation, it has underscored many of the social and economic inequalities that continue to affect the tribe - all contributing to one another, and all making the outbreak worse. ""If we had better resources, maybe [Valentina] would still be alive,"" said Vanielle. The Navajo Nation's vast scale has made it difficult for residents to access resources during the outbreak Many residents struggle with money. The reservation's unemployment rate is approximately 40%, and a similar number live below the poverty line, earning less than $12,760 (Â£10,191) a year. These factors exacerbate health problems among the Navajo and a third of the population suffers from diabetes, heart conditions and lung disease. In some cases, people have fallen ill after years of radiation exposure from hundreds of abandoned uranium mines dotted around the desert. Severely limited access to healthy food also plays a role. The Navajo Nation spans 71,000 sq km (27,413 sq miles) but has only 13 grocery stores, forcing many residents to drive for hours to towns outside the reservation with better facilities. It is common for people from different households to travel in one vehicle during these excursions because they are unable to afford petrol, further heightening their risk of catching coronavirus. Relief efforts have been hampered by limited healthcare resources, too. The reservation's dozen medical facilities hold just 200 hospital beds - approximately one bed for every 900 residents, and a third the national rate. As a result, some coronavirus patients have been moved to makeshift quarantine facilities, while others have been transferred to hospitals outside the reservation. Many homes are multi-generational as well, making it easier for the virus to spread to elderly and vulnerable residents. A third of households have no access to running water or electricity either, making it hard for thousands of people to wash their hands regularly and to stave off infection. ""This is something that is year-round, it's been going on since we were put on reservations,"" says Emma Robbins, head of DigDeep, a charity that's delivering bottled water and improving access to running water in the Nation. Miss Navajo Nation Shaandiin P. Parrish is one of the volunteers who have helped distribute food and water Ms Robbins was born on the reservation. She now lives nearly 600km (373 miles) away in Los Angeles, California, but is unable to return due to travel restrictions. ""I fear for my family and I fear for my friends,"" she told the BBC, tearfully. ""Hearing these stories and not being able to go home is really hard and I feel so hopeless."" But despite their hardship, Ms Robbins says she feels frustrated by the tone of victimhood that often colours discussions about her tribe. ""It's really trendy to do things surrounding the Navajo Nation in terms of 'Oh look how bad it is here,' but I don't think people highlight enough of the amazing efforts on the ground and the positivity,"" she adds. About a third of households on the reservation have no running water In response to the outbreak, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs told the BBC it had taken ""unprecedented actions to support Indian Country,"" providing the Navajo with protective equipment, contamination trailers, and other technical assistance. The Navajo Nation has also received $600m under the CARES Act, a $2tn economic stimulus package to shore up local economies and communities during the pandemic. But local authorities only received the money a month after the bill was signed into law. In the meantime, the Navajo and 10 other tribes successfully sued the US Treasury over funding disparities in the CARES Act for Native American groups. In the midst of federal funding delays, the Navajo Nation had to rely on donations and its own resources in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak. Navajo President Jonathan Nez has co-ordinated the distribution of food and medical supplies to local residents, and introduced some of the strictest lockdown measures in the US - imposing a series of 57-hour weekend curfew. The untold story of America's biggest cluster Locals are stepping in to help as well. More than $5.1m has been raised for the 'Navajo & Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund' - a crowdfunding campaign started by former Navajo attorney general Ethel Branch. In an unusual twist, thousands of dollars have come from donors in Ireland - many paying respect to Choctaw Indians who, in 1847, donated $170 towards relief efforts in Ireland during the Great Hunger. With help from volunteers, Ms Branch has used the donations to deliver food, water and hand sanitiser to thousands of residents. But poor infrastructure has presented a challenge at times. ""There's one community that's really isolated and we're trying to figure out how to get food there,"" she told the BBC. ""The easiest way would be to go directly, but it's all dirt road, and if we stick to the pavement, that adds on another hour and a half."" Navajo President Jonathan Nez (L): ""There's still much uncertainty right now, but I'm hopeful."" Language barriers have also been a deciding factor in the Navajo Nation's response to the outbreak. As with all public communications, it shares coronavirus updates in the Navajo language as well as English. This is driven by desires to maintain cultural heritage, but is a practical step as well because some residents speak only Navajo, or have limited English skills. In Navajo, coronavirus is translated as Dikos NtsaaÃ­gÃ­Ã­-19, or Big Cough-19. But several residents have told the BBC they believe this translation downplays the severity of coronavirus. Among them is Agnes Attakai, a Navajo Nation native and a director at the University of Arizona's School of Public Health. She said a renaming should be explored in consultation with traditional Navajo healers. ""You have to be respectful of using the language and not invite the negativity of that particular illness,"" said Ms Attakai. ""Once you start respecting and addressing it appropriatelyâ¦ people will be engaged more to change their behaviours rather than linking it up with cough and pneumonia."" But Navajo President Jonathan Nez said it was ""unfair"" to suggest the translation did not adequately convey the dangers. ""That's an excuse being played out there,"" he told the BBC. ""We're respecting our elders and our traditional teaching by avoiding utilising the word death and anything that would bring negativity or hardship on our people."" Looking ahead, as surrounding states begin easing lockdown measures, many residents are concerned about a possible second wave of infections hitting the reservation. ""There's still much uncertainty right now, but I'm hopeful,"" said President Nez. ""You've got to be hopeful to be the leader of the Navajo people."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Artist Angie Lafrance (@ramblerow) told us of her struggle with being alone during lockdown Bit by bit, countries are starting to emerge out of lockdown, some more quickly than others. When the world began to shut down to try and control coronavirus, we interviewed many of you to see how you were coping. Now, we've gone back to ask: how did you change during lockdown, and what did you learn? Musician Laurie Wright, of Cheltenham,had been in recovery for alcohol and drug addiction for four monthswhen lockdown started. Lockdown on the whole was OK. I was with my parents for the whole thing and we get along very well, so I was lucky compared to many who were completely isolated. I raised Â£1,750 for the NHS by live streaming every night and selling my music and merch. I didn't pick up a drink or drug and managed to accept that Narcotics Anonymous meetings are now on Zoom, and we're blessed to have that forum at all. My recovery took a bash in early lockdown as I replaced my recovery with chats I was having with a girl. The nature of addiction being a bigger picture than drugs, this didn't go well, but it's OK now. There's a recovery phrase 'whatever you put in front of your recovery, you will lose,' and I learned the hard way on that and won't be putting anything in front of my recovery again. Recovery comes first, and the rest falls into place. I learned how to cook even more, wrote 14 songs and found I, like most people, enjoy walking. I learned that you don't need to be in London or even out of the house any more to build a fan base, which was cool but slightly scary that the world has turned this way. I'm looking forward to touring the UK and eventually Europe as soon as it is permitted to do so. Like millions of other Americans, artist Angie Lafrance, of Maine, lost her job as coronavirus spread. She spoke to the BBC in Aprilabout how she was struggling with isolating alone. There are a lot of emotions tied to this new way of life and I can always channel them through my art. After the article was published, I had so many people from all over the world who had connected with the illustrations reaching out to me and sharing their own experiences - that in itself has made me feel less isolated. I definitely still feel the weight of uncertainty when it comes to thinking about the future. Where I live, things are slowly starting to open back up in phases but of course, it's far from business as usual. Not too much has changed as far as my day-to-day life: I'm still mostly isolated, I follow social distancing practices and I wear a mask. I think regardless of the lockdown becoming less stringent, I still feel a personal responsibility to keep others safe. We can't control our current administration's response, but we can hold ourselves personally accountable for our own active role in slowing the spread. I have friends who have lost family members to the virus and I worry all the time about my own loved ones. If I could go back in time and give myself any advice, I guess it would probably have to be to focus on the things I can control. Losing my job being separated from my friends and family, and the constant battle between who is and isn't taking it seriously enough are not things that I can control or that I was prepared for. All I can do is take each day as it comes and try to stay healthy and as positive and hopeful as I can. Dr Nick Schindler's grandfather John Cohen died aged 99 while under lockdown -Nick spoke to us in early April. Dr Nick Schindler with his grandfather John Cohen I'm not sure if we have started to grieve for Grandpa yet, it still doesn't quite seem real, and no amount of video chats on Zoom or WhatsApp seems to change that. We talk about him, we make jokes and remember him most times we speak, but it's not the same. Even a brief government-sanctioned meet-up in my parent's garden doesn't quite allow for catharsis. No one wants to cry together at a two-metre distance, and we don't dare risk giving in to even the briefest of hugs. So we have kept quiet and carried on, which is what he would have done. My parents were allowed to retrieve his things from the residential home in the last week, with meticulous precautions. It is strange to see his prize possessions in new places. He always enjoyed trying to give everything he could away to us, organising and wrestling control from fate. We always declined of course. Now he won't take no for an answer, and so his carefully curated world is divided amongst our chaotic ones. Things are a poor substitute for family, and I look forward to us being safely together again soon, and the hugs. Naomi, 21, is a final-year psychology student from Cardiff.She told us her anxiety increased hugelybecause of coronavirus. My finals ended last week, possibly the most stressful few weeks of my life. It was really draining. We can't mark the end of uni, so I'm stuck in some kind of limbo where I feel like I haven't finished. It's a very weird place to be. I was really anxious going into lockdown, but then I got quite settled. Now that measures have started being eased, that's spiked my anxiety again. There's so much change happening. As we're being allowed to go and meet up with people, socially distanced, I actually feel more lonely. I've always struggled with loneliness and feelings of isolation, largely because my friends are very spread out. Lockdown was almost a comfortable place for me. I've always communicated with my friends on video calling or messaging, and when everybody was doing it didn't feel quite as lonely. But now, as we're going back to normal, those feelings are surfacing again. I don't have many friends in Cardiff, whereas my housemate does, so she's not around as much. And the people I was talking to across the country, they're now busier. I haven't seen my family all year, but I start a new job next month, so my mum and my brother are coming down to help me move house. I think there's a lot of exciting things to come. Angela Steatham, from Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant in Wales, has chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and is deemed clinically extremely vulnerable to the virus, meaning she wasone of 2.5 million people in the UK advised not to leave their homes at all. It was business as usual one day, and then suddenly, everything changed - for everybody in the world. At the beginning because it was such an enormous shock, I was very willing to put my trust in the government. But as we've seen how they've handled it throughout, I'm now at the stage where I don't trust they are making the best decisions for everybody. I've lost a lot of my independence. I've always been a fiercely independent woman. For the first time, I've had to accept being looked after by others. I've been labelled extremely vulnerable - I've never been a vulnerable person in my whole life! What's really weird - I think it's a bit like Stockholm syndrome - is I'm sort of used to being inside. I've travelled to war-torn countries. I was in Kathmandu on 9/11, I had to be flown out with the Dalai Lama on a military jet. I've never been afraid. But just driving to the hospital on Monday was really quite scary. Because they told us we were classed as clinically extremely vulnerable, it gives you that sense of fear. It's going to take a long time and a lot of changes for that fear to be reversed.

"A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. The low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone is a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly virus, UK experts say. The drug is part ofthe world's biggest trial testing existing treatments,externalto see if they also work for coronavirus. It cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth. Had the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say. This video can not be played Katherine Millbank spent 15 days in hospital and was put on the drug trial And it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients. The UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate ""a remarkable British scientific achievement"", adding: ""We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak."" Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world. What is dexamethasone and how does it work? Latest coronavirus updates The drug combination that may help us beat Covid-19 About 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. Of those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. And these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. The drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions. And it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. This over-reaction,a cytokine storm, can be deadly. Inthe trial,external, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. For patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. For patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%. Chief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: ""This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough."" Lead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for: every eight patients on a ventilator every 20-25 treated with oxygen ""There is a clear, clear benefit,"" he said. ""The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about Â£5 per patient. ""So essentially it costs Â£35 to save a life. ""This is a drug that is globally available."" When appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said. But people should not go out and buy it to take at home. Dexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently beenditched amid concernsit increases fatalities and heart problems. The antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is alreadybeing made available on the NHS. The first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid. That is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. And that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. Dexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Half of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact. The drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. So far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola. That has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11.

"Reni Eddo-Lodge's book was originally published in 2017 Reni Eddo-Lodge has become the first black British author to top UK's best-seller list since the official book chart was launched in 1998. Last week, Eddo-Lodge's book Why I'm No Longer Talking To White People About Race topped the paperback non-fiction chart, following protests about racism. The 2017 work has now become the best-selling title in the UK overall, according to Nielsen BookScan. The author said it felt ""absolutely wild to have broken this record"". Allow Twitter content?

""My work stands on the shoulders of so many Black British literary giants,""Eddo-Lodge wrote on Twitter.,external""Bernadine Evaristo, Benjamin Zephaniah, Zadie Smith, Andrea Levy, Stella Dadzie, Stuart Hall, Linton K Johnson, Jackie Kay, Gary Younge - to name a few."" Fellow authorNikesh Shukla congratulated her, adding:,external""Bewildering it's taken so long for this to happen but it couldn't happen to a better writer and person."" After she topped the paperback non-fiction chart last week, Eddo-Lodge criticised the UK publishing industry for the fact it had taken so long for a black author to achieve the feat. She said she was ""dismayed"" that the achievement only came about under ""tragic circumstances"" - referring to the death of George Floyd. Renewed interest in the title was sparked following protests around the death of Mr Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. After her book topped the non-fiction chart, Eddo-Lodge said: ""The fact that it's 2020 and I'm the first. Let's be honest. Reader demand aside, that it took this long is a horrible indictment of the publishing industry."" Since 1998, only one other black author, former US first lady Michelle Obama, has scored the overall best-selling book in the UK, with her 2018 memoir Becoming. Bernardine Evaristo jointly won the Booker Prize last year Eddo-Lodge's book explores the links between gender, class and race in the UK and around the world. Last month, the writerposted online,externalthat she had noticed an upsurge in sales, which she found unsettling. ""This book financially transformed my life and I really don't like the idea of personally profiting every time a video of a black person's death goes viral,"" she wrote, urging readers to offer a donation to the Minnesota Freedom Fund. On Monday, the newly-formedBlack Writers' Guild sent an open letter,externalto publishers raising concerns that the companies were ""raising awareness of racial inequality without significantly addressing their own"". The letter was signed by authors including Evaristo, Zephaniah and Malorie Blackman. Last week, fellow author Dorothy Koomsonposted an open letter,externalto the publishing industry, in which she called it an ""extremely damaging"" environment for black authors. Also last week, Evaristo became the first female writer of colour to top the mass market fiction chart with Girl, Woman, Other. Her novel jointly won the Booker Prize last year, together with Margaret Atwood's The Testaments. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Ken Skates made the announcement at the Welsh Government's daily news briefing Everyone aged over 16 in Wales will be offered help to find work, self-employment, education or training to help with the job losses expected in the coming months, a minister has said. Figures show the numbers claiming benefits in Wales havedoubled compared with this time last year. Economy Minister Ken Skates said the support scheme would use Â£40m from theEconomic Resilience Fund.,external The aim was to bring ""hope"" to people fearing losing their job, he said. Shops could reopen at next lockdown review Deaths with coronavirus lowest for 10 weeks According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures there were 118,600 claimants in the middle of May, equivalent to 6.2% of 16 to 64-year-olds. Mr Skates told the Welsh Government's daily news conference on Tuesday, coronavirus ""will have a huge impact on our labour market"". ""We've given hope to businesses that have faced a perilous situation and now we are preparing to deliver hope to people who question whether the virus will steal them of livelihoods,"" he said. ""We will make sure everyone over 16 in Wales gets the offer of support and advice to find work, to pursue self-employment or to find a place in education or training. ""Over and above existing skills and employment support, we are preparing to use an additional Â£40m from our Economic Resilience Fund to deliver this commitment."" Mr Skates said the plan was part of the Welsh Government's Covid commitment to the people of Wales. Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones called on UK and Welsh ministers to ""work closely to respond to the coming crisis"". ""Of course reflection is needed as we consider what building back better means, but when it comes to responding to the immediate crisis it is time for action,"" she said. ""We can't sit around discussing what might be needed when tens of thousands of people face falling off an economic cliff edge in August."" Mr Skates' news conference came after more than 70 mid Wales tourism businesses signed an open letter to the first minister calling for ""clear guidance and timescales"" on when tourism in Wales can be reopened. They said the continued lockdown in Wales was ""out of step"" with the rest of the UK, and the ""stay away"" message was causing ""long-term"" damage to the industry. Tourism in Wales directly supports about 120,000 jobs - almost 10% of Wales' workforce Clwyd West Conservative MP David Jones told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast there was ""certainty"" of bankruptcies, business failures and redundancies if the industry failed to reopen this summer. Last week, a group of Welsh tourism leaders warned the industry was on the ""brink of collapse"". At the lunchtime news conference, Mr Skates said this season's prospects were looking ""much better"". ""My primary concern has been to ensure the industry is sustainable for the future,"" he told journalists. ""The prospects of having a 2020 tourism season are looking much better. But he added: ""We will not just select an arbitrary date and say 'this is when we hope you will be able to open'. ""We need to make sure when we declare a date we are able to commit to that date."" Last week, Mr Skates singled out9 July as a possible dayfor when the Welsh Government ""hopes to be able to say something positive"" for the tourism industry.

"The final closing time: General manager Jackie Cunliffe stacks chairs in the Beresford Hotel dining room Three months after lockdown shut down large parts of the UK economy, job losses are beginning to bite -  nowhere more so than in the Cornish town of Newquay where more than half of those employed work in the badly affected sectors such as tourism and hospitality. Standing in the dining room, amid a sea of upturned chair legs, piled on once bustling tables, Jackie Cunliffe reflects on the 30 years she spent working in Newquay's Beresford Hotel. ""It belonged to Shearings holidays, but actually it didn't. It belonged to us. ""We managed it, we owned it, we cared for it."" The 63-year-old general manager is widely respected and held in great affection by the 50 staff who lost their jobs when the hotel closed in May, after Shearings' parent company went into administration. Job cuts warning as 600,000 roles go in lockdown Job losses 'just the tip of the iceberg' Travel firm collapses with loss of 2,500 jobs ""We should have 200 people in here, having their breakfast, going out on tours all around Cornwall. ""We have diaries full of people asking for tables-for-two, specific rooms. All of it has just gone."" Some of the staff had gathered in the hotel ballroom to join a conference call on 22 May, when the chief executive of Shearings' parent company, Specialist Leisure Group (SLG), told nearly 2,500 employees across the UK that efforts to save the group had failed. Just three years after reporting record sales and profits, the group - owned by American private equity firmLone Star Funds,external- called in administrators, bringing to an end a company whose origins can be traced back 117 years. Remembering happier times - Caroline Tansley was a key member of the Beresford team Among those in tears at the news was Caroline Tansley, who worked at The Beresford for 20 years - primarily as a receptionist, though she often pitched in with the entertainment: singing, dancing, bingo, comedy, and as 'Mother Christmas', handing out presents to guests. As well as losing her job, Caroline is losing her accommodation and is obliged to move out by 3 July. ""Normally at this time of year, with the lovely weather we've been having, it would be heaving. ""To the see the hotel standing empty is just heart-breaking,"" she says. Her partner, Darren Philips, is in the same boat. A part-time assistant manager at the hotel, he says the company were brilliant when he lost the sight in his left eye 10 years ago, and even developed a role specially for him. The hotel's part-time assistant manger, Darren Philips, fears he will not work again The sight in his right eye isn't great either, and he fears he may not work again. ""I can't use computers. Anything that needs me to see really, I struggle with. ""I've worked here for so long, I know the building like the back of my hand. I'd struggle if I went to a different building, with steps. I'd end up falling down."" The 107-room Beresford Hotel is one of two hotels in Newquay that have been forced to close due to SLG's demise. A few yards along the same road, the 52 rooms of the Marina Hotel are empty too, the front doors directing any questions to the administrators in Wigan. Two other hotels owned by the group in Cornwall have also shut - some 150 jobs are estimated to have been lost. Newquay has seen at least two hotels close this year While Covid-19 has been less of a health crisis in the south west of England than many had feared, the pandemic is predicted to hammer the local economy. Cornwall Council will consider a report on Wednesday that indicates as many as 72,800 jobs - 27% of all jobs in the county - are at risk due to the ongoing lockdown. It calculates that the all-important tourism sector will lose Â£630m by the end of June. Data released last month showed a 61% increase in applications for Universal Credit across Cornwall; the rise in applications between March and April in Bodmin, Bude, Penzance and Newquay was over 1000%. Anda report in April from think tank, the Centre for Towns,externalpredicts Newquay will suffer the greatest economic hit of any town in England and Wales. No surprise then, that hopes of finding a new job quickly are not high among the Beresford's former employees. Some are being told they are competing with up to 500 people for jobs in local supermarkets - an intimidating prospect for the many staff who have not faced a job interview in decades. Head chef Phillip Milne says he is losing his pride Head chef Phillip Milne, who spent 18 years at the hotel and took great pride in teaching culinary skills to the many international staff who passed through, says the past few weeks have been demoralising. ""To have no security, and no jobs in the area, is very hard to swallow. ""You feel as though your pride's been taken away a bit. ""You're up at 6 o'clock in the morning because your pattern is still the same, and you're on the internet going through every single website looking for work."" Phillip led a kitchen team that could serve 190 covers in around 90 minutes on a busy day. The hotel mainly catered for older visitors, who often returned year after year for the comfort and familiarity which The Beresford offered. At the height of the summer, Shearings could bring 1,000 people to Cornwall every week. Former head housekeeper Katie Korvisia has been offered work cleaning holiday homes There is hope, if the lockdown is further eased next month and tourists begin to return, that some jobs will open up. Katie Kovisia, the hotel's former head housekeeper, has been offered a cleaning job at a holiday park for the summer, or she could clean holiday cottages on a self-employed basis. Neither prospect is particularly appealing for the 15-year veteran of the Beresford, but she realises she may not have many options: ""Here I was part of a family. It's been my life. It's very sad.""

"Apple faces two European Commission probes into whether it has broken competition rules. One investigation centres on iPad and iPhones being limited to installing apps,externalfrom Apple's own App Store, among other restrictions imposed on third-party developers. The other involves Apple Pay,external, with one issue being that other services cannot use the iPhone's tap-and-go facility. Apple said it was ""disappointing"" the EU was ""advancing baseless complaints"". And it accused companies that had raised allegations against it of wanting a ""free ride"". ""Our goal is simple: for our customers to have access to the best app or service of their choice, in a safe and secure environment."" Apple is also under scrutiny in the US where the House Judiciary Committee is reported to have asked for its chief executive Tim Cook to appear alongside other tech leaders to answer questions about anti-trust concerns. Amazon has said that its chief executive Jeff Bezos is willing to testify, so long as Mr Cook and his counterparts at Facebook and Google also give evidence. The latest development comes days before Apple holds its annual developers conference. The investigation into Apple's App Store stems from a complaint raised by the music streaming service Spotify. Unlike Android, iOS does not offer a way to easily ""sideload"" apps that are not distributed via the official store Last year, it raised two specific concerns: the only way developers can sell content and/or subscriptions directly within an iOS app is via Apple's own system publishers cannot tell users within their apps that the same items can be bought elsewhere - for example via the service's own website Apple typically charges apps a 30% cut of any sales, although that rate falls to 15% for the second and later years of any subscription. Publishers often sell media and other digital goods at a lower price when bought outside of their apps, but consumers can be unaware of the fact. Since Apple only allows apps to be downloaded from its own store, and has repeatedly updated its mobile operating system to prevent ""jailbreaks"" that circumvent this rule, it is argued that third-parties have little option but to comply with its conditions. The only alternative is to offer their products as web-based services, which can limit their functionality. The Financial Times has reported that Rakuten's online bookstore Kobo,externalrecently contacted the European Commission with similar concerns. ""Apple's anti-competitive behaviour has intentionally disadvantaged competitors, created an unlevel playing field, and deprived consumers of meaningful choice for far too long,"" said Spotify in response to the latest development. ""We welcome the European Commission's decision to formally investigate Apple, and hope they'll act with urgency to ensure fair competition on the iOS platform for all participants in the digital economy."" The Apple Pay investigation centres on a technology that allows iPhones and Apple Watches to make tap-and-go payments. It also lets users buy goods via an app or website without having to give their payment card details to the seller. Apple Pay allows iPhone owners to transfer funds from their bank to a store without using a physical card The European Commission has concerns about the conditions imposed on services that have added the facility. It also has reservations that alternative payment tech cannot make use of the near field communication (NFC) chips in Apple's products to work with contactless payment terminals. By contrast, Samsung phones - for example - let their NFC chips be used for both Samsung Pay and Google Pay. ""It is important that Apple's measures do not deny consumers the benefit of new payment technologies, including better choice, quality, innovation and competitive prices,"" said  Margrethe Vestager, the EU's Competition Commissioner and Executive Vice President. The commissioner added that she had not set a deadline for the investigations to be completed. What today's move is about is the huge power over prices and innovation that control of a platform gives to a tech giant. Ever tried to buy a Kindle book via Amazon's iPhone apps? You can't because Amazon doesn't want to see Apple walk away with a 30% cut of the purchase price. App developers big and small have protested over the years about what they see as Apple's abuse of its position as a gatekeeper to its iOS platform. Similarly, the tech giant's strict controls on the way NFC works on its phones has sparked complaints that Apple Pay has huge advantages over what could be more innovative payment systems. Complaints about this behaviour aren't limited to Europe, but once again Margrethe Vestager has shown that she wants to set the pace in pushing back against the power of the big tech platforms. And another American behemoth may be about to feel the heat - all the signs are that Ms Vestager is about todetermine the outcome of an existing probe into how Amazoncontrols its online retailing platform. The twin inquiries follow an earlier case in which Brussels ordered Apple to pay 13bn euros ($14.4bn; Â£11.4bn) after claims that Ireland had given the company illegal state aid by failing to tax it properly. TheIrish government and Apple have appealed the ruling. The latest probes are likely to cast a shadow over the firm's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which begins on Monday. Apple is holding a virtual event for WWDC this year because of the coronavirus pandemic Apple has already claimed itsapp ecosystem generated more than half a trillion dollarsin sales and other billings last year, saying the vast majority of that was not subject to it taking a commission. But its relationships with some developers have become strained. In recent days,one has called on Apple to reduce its standard cut from 30% to 20%,externalwhile another has accused the firm ofoperating a ""capricious and inconsistent review process"",externalthat can cause delays to the release of even minor app updates. In an interview pegged to last year's WWDC, Mr Cook said that he thought that scrutiny of the firm was fair but added that regulatorsshould bear in mind it does not have a monopoly of any market,external.

"Ex-Tory Leader William Hague says lockdown is an ""economic catastrophe"" and is calling for the two-metre distancing rule to be scrapped. Writing in the Telegraph,external, Lord Hague said lockdown was increasing inequality, social tension and debt. The hospitality industry, and some MPs and scientists, have called for the 2m (6ft) rule to be relaxed in England. No 10 has said a review into the rule will be completed ""in the coming weeks"". And Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said the government would not amend the restriction until 4 July at the earliest. He told BBC Breakfast the public would be ""rightly very unforgiving"" if the UK experienced a second spike of coronavirus caused by ""rushing"" a change in restrictions. So far England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all maintained the two-metre rule. It comes as official figures suggest the number of workers on UK payrollsdived more than 600,000 between March and May- reflecting the impact of about six weeks in lockdown. But economists say the full impact on employment will not be felt until wage support schemes end in October. âI've applied for more than 100 jobsâ Two-metre review to be completed in 'coming weeks' When will pubs, cafes and restaurants reopen? Am I exempt from quarantine? In his article, Lord Hague said the lockdown had been so ""destructive"" that it could ""only ever be allowed to happen once"". He urged the government to scrap the quarantine on international arrivals - which requires all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days - and the 2m social distancing rule. ""We can now see that it is not necessary to have a two-metre separation between people to keep the virus in retreat where it is already at a low level,"" he writes. ""We know this from the experience of countries such as Denmark, France and Germany where the recommended distance is shorter, and we should not have to spend weeks agonising over it."" He said lockdown was ""like Dunkirk - a heroic operation in itself but the result of a massive failure"". And this was a failure ""at multiple levels"" he said, adding: ""A failure by the whole world to prevent the trading of wild animals for consumption; by China to report the initial outbreak openly; by our and many other countries to prepare for this type of pandemic."" He said ""crucial lessons"" had also been learnt, including that some countries - including Germany and South Korea - ""have escaped a good deal of the brutal costs of having to pursue a tight lockdown"" after they were ""much more ambitious about testing"". Other Tory MPs have echoed Lord Hague's words. Former Tory Leader Iain Duncan-Smith has warned MPs that they were ""in danger of losing sight of what will happen, probably to the poorest in society"". Ex-defence minister Tobias Ellwood has told the Commons that halving social distancing to 1m would be ""game-changing"" and should be done now. And,in a joint article for the Telegraph,external, Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferson from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford said there was no evidence for the 2m rule. They said it was ""seriously impacting schools, pubs, restaurants and our ability to go about our daily lives"". ""Handwashing and encouragement are what we need, not formalised rules."" THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? But Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""People will be, I think rightly very unforgiving about a second spike caused by rushing from two metres to one metre, or what have you. ""So, what we're doing is - right now, properly reviewing all of the evidence and we're aware that other countries have come to different conclusions."" Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, has said: ""It is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces and the risks are associated with distance, so risk falls after 2m. ""It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is 2m or nothing - that is not what the advice has been and it is not what the advice is now.""

Join us again tomorrow. And here's the round-up of coronavirus news stories in the UK. As our live page draws to a close, here are the major world events linked to coronavirus for Tuesday: The top story was really a UK story - the breakthrough in the medical world with the drug dexamethasone, which can save the lives of seriously ill coronavirus patients. But the other top stories globally have been: There are fewer very happy Americans than at any point in nearly 50 years, according to a new survey. The new poll was released by theNational Opinion Research Center,externalat the University of Chicago and used data from the General Social Survey (GSS) data. It found that only 14% of Americans described themselves as very happy. In 2018, the last time the poll was conducted, it was 31%. The GSS has collected data every other year since 1972. The previous low point came in 2010 when 29% of Americans said they were very happy. Currently, 50% of people say they sometimes feel isolated, compared to 23% in 2018. The numbers are somewhat unsurprising, given the lockdowns that have separated communities and led to social isolation. The survey was conducted in May, before the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, which touched off protests across the nation and world. London club Chelsea are 0-3 down to Bayern Munich in the Champions League last-16 European football chiefs look set to finalise plans to finish this season's Champions League and Europa League over the next 24 hours. Uefa's executive committee is expected to announce that Portugal and Germany will host a ""final eight"" knockout tournament for each competition. However, there has been disagreement about how the outstanding last-16 ties in the competitions are to be resolved. BBC Sport have been previewing the plans ahead of the committee's crunch meeting on Wednesday.Read more here. The Duke of Cambridge has joked that he is looking forward to having a pint in the pub, as he praised ambulance staff for their hard work during the pandemic. In his first face-to-face meeting with the public in months, the prince told ambulance crews at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Norfolk he thought the weekly Clap for Carers - when people across the UK stood on their doorsteps to applaud the country's NHS staff and key workers - was ""powerful"". ""Everyone appreciates the NHS, we have an amazing system and many countries around the world envy what we have,"" he told them. In a lighter moment, he joked he was looking forward to being told he could go to the pub again and shared his worry for the country's waistline. ""I've done a lot of baking at home - chocolate goes down very well,"" he said. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released a new video explaining the risks of passing the coronavirus to your household pet. The video, which is spliced with cute cats and dogs around their mask-wearing owners, advises that the chance of catching Covid-19 from a pet is ""considered low"". ""But it does appear that people can give the virus to animals,"" it continues, adding that cats and ferrets are most likely to get infected. Cats should be kept indoors and dogs should be walked on a leash, according to the FDA guidance. Pets should only be allowed to interact with members of their own households. If you do become infected, the FDA advises that you find someone else to watch your pet until you are better. If that isn't possible, then you should wear a mask around your pet, and wash your hands both before and after playing with them. Allow YouTube content?

Health workers protested in French cities including Paris, Strasbourg and Nice Thousands of doctors, nurses and hospital staff in France have been protesting to demand more investment in the health system. Like in many countries, the French public expressed their significant gratitude and support to medics during the pandemic - now health workers want this to be followed with more resources. Around 18,000 people attended the protests in Paris, which ended with violent action by a small group who threw stones and overturned a car. Police made 20 arrests. Unions are asking for pay rises, a recruitment drive and more beds in hospitals, and say Covid-19 exposed the weaknesses of the French health service. President Emmanuel Macron says his government is three weeks into a consultation and has announced bonuses for staff who worked through the crisis. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Patient credits dexamethasone with saving her life We've been hearing a lot about the drug dexamethasone, which has been found in a medical trial to cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. Briton Katherine Millbank took part in the trials and credits the drug with saving her life. An emotional Mrs Millbank has been telling the BBC about her experience. A Beijing official warned the new outbreak - linked to an open air market - is ""extremely severe"" Earlier we reported that a cluster of new cases connected to a Beijing market in China is causing serious concern. Now all schools have been ordered to close in an effort to contain the outbreak. The first case, linked to a market, was recorded on Thursday and cases have been rising since then. Beijing had not seen any new cases for more than 50 days before this. Schools and universities reopened just a few weeks ago, but now classes will once again go online. Entertainment venues will also close, and people must be tested before they will be permitted to leave the capital. This video can not be played Boris Johnson thanks Marcus Rashford for school meal campaign More than a million schoolchildren in England will be able to claim free meal vouchers during the summer, the UK government has said. It followed acampaign championed by footballer Marcus Rashfordfor an existing scheme to be extended during the school holidays due to the coronavirus crisis. The government had previously insisted it would not award free school meals vouchers in England outside of term time, prompting the footballerto pen an open letterto MPs asking for the decision to be reversed. At the Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the Manchester United and England forward, 22, for his efforts. Earlier today, the head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine told MPs that requiring patients to have an appointment before attending hospital casualty departments may be necessary in the UK following the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Katherine Henderson told the Commons Health and Social Care Select
Committee that older people were those usually most in need of emergency treatment but they were also the age group most at risk from Covid-19. She said that emergency wards were used to having ""elastic walls""
and an ""infinite number of patients"" but that they now needed to know who was coming into A&E. Henderson told MPs that
NHS 111 could be the first port of call for those in urgent need who could then be given an appointment to attend hospital. She told the committee that is was ""just impossible"" to have an 80-year-old with a hip fracture left waiting in a corridor alongside a patient with suspected Covid-19.  Many restaurants and bars have remained open throughout the pandemic, with some social distancing introduced Sweden took a different approach to managing coronavirus than most countries - it avoided lockdown and kept many workplaces and social spaces open. Now there is an uptick in cases again in the Scandinavian country - a further 15,000 confirmed infections since the beginning of June, bringing the country's total to 53,000. The leading health official, Anders Tegnell, denied that it was a sign the virus was taking hold again. He put the rise down to an increase in testing. Nonetheless, he urged Swedes to minimise socialising during the upcoming midsummer celebrations. His critics accused him of arrogance for resisting a lockdown, but the country's death rate is better than some countries that introduced serious restrictions, including the UK, Spain and Italy. Nearly 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Sweden. Having been closed to the public for three months, London Zoo welcomed back its first visitors yesterday. The Zoological Society of London had warned it would face permanent closure if the government did not relax restrictions so it could allow the public back in. But the experience of visiting the zoo is now a little different to how it was before the pandemic. The attraction is only allowing 2,000 visitors to come each day, and they must have a pre-booked, timed-entry ticket. Restaurants and cafes are closed and additional hand sanitising stations and distance markers have been installed. This video can not be played Coronavirus: ZSL London Zoo reopens after lockdown The Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has confirmed that the US Open will take place in New York City's Queens borough but without any spectators. The US Tennis Association's (USTA) signature Grand Slam event is due to run from 31 August to 13 September. In a tweet, Cuomo said that organisers would ""take extraordinary precautions to protect players and staff, including robust testing, additional cleaning, extra locker room space, and dedicated housing & transportation"". Some players have already expressed concerns about playing in the tournament. The US Open is normally the fourth and final Grand Slam, but will be only the second this year. The French Open could now start just one week after the end of the US. Wimbledon was cancelled for the first time since 1945. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked
if the UK had banned the export of dexamethasone at today's Downing Street briefing. Itâs a cheap and widely
available drug which a trial at Oxford University has shown can save the lives
of patients who are severely ill with Covid-19 and need oxygen treatment. The prime minister said he wasnât
aware of the ban. On 24 April, dexamethasone,
in the form of tablets and capsules,was added to a list of medicines that cannot be exported from the UK or hoarded,external. And today dexamethasone, in
the form of oral solutions and injections, was also added to the list. According to the governmentâs
website, âexporting a medicine on the list is considered a breach of regulation
43(2) of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and a contraventionâ¦ may lead to
regulatory action by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA), which could include immediate suspension of the wholesale dealer
licence"". Thereâs more detail on the trial of dexamethasone here. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked whether the rules on attendance at funerals in England would be relaxed. At the moment the only mourners
allowed to attend are members of the deceased personâs household and close
family members or close friends if family members are unable to attend. Numbers must be kept low enough to
allow everybody to stay two metres apart. Someone to conduct the service, a
funeral director and other staff may also attend. The guidance for England says that
mourners who are self-isolating for 14 days but do not have symptoms should be
helped to attend, as should those in vulnerable groups who are shielding.
Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus should not attend. In Scotland the advice is slightly
different, with those self-isolating or shielding encouraged to seriously consider
not attending. In Wales, those allowed to attend the
funeral are the person organising it, people who have been invited and any
carers, with numbers again limited by the requirements of social distancing. The
guidance for Northern Ireland includes a limit of 10 mourners and stresses that
those who are self-isolating should not mix with other people attending. Reality Check The prime minister said at the Downing Street briefing that he
only became aware âtodayâ of footballer Marcus Rashfordâs campaign to make the
government change its mind on not extending free school meal vouchers in
England over the summer. The government has now
relented and says it will continue to run the scheme during the summer holiday and
Boris Johnson has congratulated the player. Marcus Rashford first raised his concerns on Twitter on 10 June when he
asked âAnybody know who I can talk to about the government food voucher
scheme?â Labour has also
been campaigning on the issue and sent a letter about it to Education
Secretary Gavin Williamson on 8 June. It was also raised in the House of
Commons on 9 June. In England, about
1.3 million children claimed free school meals in 2019, or about 15% of
state-educated pupils. Extending the scheme over the summer will cost around Â£120m. Thereâs more detail on how it will work and on whatâs happening across the UK in this piece.   Helen CattPolitical correspondent A bit of good news was what the government
really needed, as it faces pressure from its own backbenchers (and today, a
public questioner) on social distancing requirements and after its high profile U-turn on school meal vouchers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his weekly appearance
at the Downing Street briefing to deliver news about an unquestionably positive
development. He was very keen to point up the UK
expertise behind what he called the ""biggest breakthrough yet"" in
treating coronavirus. The scientists at today's press conference also seemed upbeat - excited
even - highlighting that the drug dexamethasone which could save the life of one in eight patients who experience serious breathing
problems is widely available and cheap. There was one note of caution in the
optimistic tone though - having a treatment doesn't necessarily mean less
stringent conditions for all of us if there is a second wave of the virus. And when it comes to that two-metre social
distancing rule, there does seem to be a hint of more wiggle room opening up, but Boris Johnson's message is still ""watch this space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson led todayâs government press conference. He was accompanied by the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford.

Health workers protested in French cities including Paris, Strasbourg and Nice Thousands of doctors, nurses and hospital staff in France have been protesting to demand more investment in the health system. Like in many countries, the French public expressed their significant gratitude and support to medics during the pandemic - now health workers want this to be followed with more resources. Around 18,000 people attended the protests in Paris, which ended with violent action by a small group who threw stones and overturned a car. Police made 20 arrests. Unions are asking for pay rises, a recruitment drive and more beds in hospitals, and say Covid-19 exposed the weaknesses of the French health service. President Emmanuel Macron says his government is three weeks into a consultation and has announced bonuses for staff who worked through the crisis.

Briton Katherine Millbank took part in the trials and credits the drug with saving her life. An emotional Mrs Millbank has been telling the BBC about her experience. A Beijing official warned the new outbreak - linked to an open air market - is ""extremely severe"" Earlier we reported that a cluster of new cases connected to a Beijing market in China is causing serious concern. Now all schools have been ordered to close in an effort to contain the outbreak. The first case, linked to a market, was recorded on Thursday and cases have been rising since then. Beijing had not seen any new cases for more than 50 days before this. Schools and universities reopened just a few weeks ago, but now classes will once again go online. Entertainment venues will also close, and people must be tested before they will be permitted to leave the capital. This video can not be played Boris Johnson thanks Marcus Rashford for school meal campaign More than a million schoolchildren in England will be able to claim free meal vouchers during the summer, the UK government has said. It followed acampaign championed by footballer Marcus Rashfordfor an existing scheme to be extended during the school holidays due to the coronavirus crisis. The government had previously insisted it would not award free school meals vouchers in England outside of term time, prompting the footballerto pen an open letterto MPs asking for the decision to be reversed. At the Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the Manchester United and England forward, 22, for his efforts. Earlier today, the head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine told MPs that requiring patients to have an appointment before attending hospital casualty departments may be necessary in the UK following the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Katherine Henderson told the Commons Health and Social Care Select
Committee that older people were those usually most in need of emergency treatment but they were also the age group most at risk from Covid-19. She said that emergency wards were used to having ""elastic walls""
and an ""infinite number of patients"" but that they now needed to know who was coming into A&E. Henderson told MPs that
NHS 111 could be the first port of call for those in urgent need who could then be given an appointment to attend hospital. She told the committee that is was ""just impossible"" to have an 80-year-old with a hip fracture left waiting in a corridor alongside a patient with suspected Covid-19.  Many restaurants and bars have remained open throughout the pandemic, with some social distancing introduced Sweden took a different approach to managing coronavirus than most countries - it avoided lockdown and kept many workplaces and social spaces open. Now there is an uptick in cases again in the Scandinavian country - a further 15,000 confirmed infections since the beginning of June, bringing the country's total to 53,000. The leading health official, Anders Tegnell, denied that it was a sign the virus was taking hold again. He put the rise down to an increase in testing. Nonetheless, he urged Swedes to minimise socialising during the upcoming midsummer celebrations. His critics accused him of arrogance for resisting a lockdown, but the country's death rate is better than some countries that introduced serious restrictions, including the UK, Spain and Italy. Nearly 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Sweden. Having been closed to the public for three months, London Zoo welcomed back its first visitors yesterday. The Zoological Society of London had warned it would face permanent closure if the government did not relax restrictions so it could allow the public back in. But the experience of visiting the zoo is now a little different to how it was before the pandemic. The attraction is only allowing 2,000 visitors to come each day, and they must have a pre-booked, timed-entry ticket. Restaurants and cafes are closed and additional hand sanitising stations and distance markers have been installed. This video can not be played Coronavirus: ZSL London Zoo reopens after lockdown The Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has confirmed that the US Open will take place in New York City's Queens borough but without any spectators. The US Tennis Association's (USTA) signature Grand Slam event is due to run from 31 August to 13 September. In a tweet, Cuomo said that organisers would ""take extraordinary precautions to protect players and staff, including robust testing, additional cleaning, extra locker room space, and dedicated housing & transportation"". Some players have already expressed concerns about playing in the tournament. The US Open is normally the fourth and final Grand Slam, but will be only the second this year. The French Open could now start just one week after the end of the US. Wimbledon was cancelled for the first time since 1945. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked
if the UK had banned the export of dexamethasone at today's Downing Street briefing. Itâs a cheap and widely
available drug which a trial at Oxford University has shown can save the lives
of patients who are severely ill with Covid-19 and need oxygen treatment. The prime minister said he wasnât
aware of the ban. On 24 April, dexamethasone,
in the form of tablets and capsules,was added to a list of medicines that cannot be exported from the UK or hoarded,external. And today dexamethasone, in
the form of oral solutions and injections, was also added to the list. According to the governmentâs
website, âexporting a medicine on the list is considered a breach of regulation
43(2) of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and a contraventionâ¦ may lead to
regulatory action by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA), which could include immediate suspension of the wholesale dealer
licence"". Thereâs more detail on the trial of dexamethasone here. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked whether the rules on attendance at funerals in England would be relaxed. At the moment the only mourners
allowed to attend are members of the deceased personâs household and close
family members or close friends if family members are unable to attend. Numbers must be kept low enough to
allow everybody to stay two metres apart. Someone to conduct the service, a
funeral director and other staff may also attend. The guidance for England says that
mourners who are self-isolating for 14 days but do not have symptoms should be
helped to attend, as should those in vulnerable groups who are shielding.
Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus should not attend. In Scotland the advice is slightly
different, with those self-isolating or shielding encouraged to seriously consider
not attending. In Wales, those allowed to attend the
funeral are the person organising it, people who have been invited and any
carers, with numbers again limited by the requirements of social distancing. The
guidance for Northern Ireland includes a limit of 10 mourners and stresses that
those who are self-isolating should not mix with other people attending. Reality Check The prime minister said at the Downing Street briefing that he
only became aware âtodayâ of footballer Marcus Rashfordâs campaign to make the
government change its mind on not extending free school meal vouchers in
England over the summer. The government has now
relented and says it will continue to run the scheme during the summer holiday and
Boris Johnson has congratulated the player. Marcus Rashford first raised his concerns on Twitter on 10 June when he
asked âAnybody know who I can talk to about the government food voucher
scheme?â Labour has also
been campaigning on the issue and sent a letter about it to Education
Secretary Gavin Williamson on 8 June. It was also raised in the House of
Commons on 9 June. In England, about
1.3 million children claimed free school meals in 2019, or about 15% of
state-educated pupils. Extending the scheme over the summer will cost around Â£120m. Thereâs more detail on how it will work and on whatâs happening across the UK in this piece.   Helen CattPolitical correspondent A bit of good news was what the government
really needed, as it faces pressure from its own backbenchers (and today, a
public questioner) on social distancing requirements and after its high profile U-turn on school meal vouchers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his weekly appearance
at the Downing Street briefing to deliver news about an unquestionably positive
development. He was very keen to point up the UK
expertise behind what he called the ""biggest breakthrough yet"" in
treating coronavirus. The scientists at today's press conference also seemed upbeat - excited
even - highlighting that the drug dexamethasone which could save the life of one in eight patients who experience serious breathing
problems is widely available and cheap. There was one note of caution in the
optimistic tone though - having a treatment doesn't necessarily mean less
stringent conditions for all of us if there is a second wave of the virus. And when it comes to that two-metre social
distancing rule, there does seem to be a hint of more wiggle room opening up, but Boris Johnson's message is still ""watch this space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson led todayâs government press conference. He was accompanied by the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford.

"Nicola Sturgeon has warned against any ""reckless"" move to ease lockdown in Scotland despite a growing ""economic crisis"" and rising unemployment. The first minister spoke after the release ofthe latest jobless figures. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in Scotland between February and April, compared with a UK-wide rate of 3.9%. Ms Sturgeon said easing the lockdown ""too quickly"" would risk a resurgence of the virus which would cost lives and economic productivity. She said the progress made in suppressing Covid-19 so far could help build a ""sustainable economy recovery"". And she called on the UK government to extend the job retention ""furlough"" scheme, saying it was ""almost certain"" to be needed beyond October. Scotland is expected to move to the second phase of the government's ""route map"" towards lifting lockdown on Thursday, which could see a ""safe re-opening"" of more shops and workplaces. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggested that unemployment in Scotland had risen by 30,000 to 127,000 between February and April, covering the period when lockdown first hit the labour market. Ms Sturgeon said it was important to be ""cautious"" about drawing conclusions from the data. She said the protection of the furlough scheme ""means these figures are likely to be an underestimate of the full impact of Covid-19 on business activity"". However, she said it ""undoubtedly"" showed that ""dealing with the public health crisis of Covid has created an economic crisis that demands our full focus and attention"". She said: ""These kinds of statistics and generally increasing economic anxiety will lead some to argue for a quicker than planned exit from lockdown. ""But difficult though all this is, we must guard against a reckless relaxation of lockdown. If we ease restrictions too quickly and allow the virus to run out of control again, that would be economically unproductive and would cost more lives. ""The progress we have made is an essential foundation for the sustainable economic recovery we want - the more we can suppress this virus now, the more normality we can restore as we do open up the economy and society."" The latest review of Scotland's lockdown is to be held on Thursday, with the first minister saying she would ""hope and expect"" that Scotland could move to the second phase ofher government's ""route map"",external. Measures included in phase two include letting people meet in larger groups outdoors, and with another household indoors. It could also see factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops re-open and the construction industry begin to re-start. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Not all major changes will happen overnight, but I do hope in the coming weeks that further important restrictions will be lifted so workers can return to factories, with strict hygiene and physical distancing measures in place, so the construction industry can continue its restart plan, and non-essential shops have a date for safe re-opening. ""None of this will restore the economy immediately to full health but will be a sustainable improvement on our current position."" The Scottish government has identifiedfour phases for easing the restrictions,external: Phase 1:Virus not yet contained but cases are falling. From 28 May you should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2:Virus controlled. You can meet larger groups outdoors, and meet another household indoors. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops can resume work. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3:Virus suppressed.  You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4:Virus no longer a significant threat. University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. The first minister said she had ""zero interest in keeping any part of the country in lockdown any longer than is necessary"", but said ""patience will pay dividends in the future"". She said: ""A gradual re-emergence is crucial - it allows our businesses to start to operate and make money again, but we know that because this re-emergence is by necessity gradual it must be accompanied by continued support for business. ""We have welcomed assistance from the UK government such as the job retention scheme, but it's essential this is extended if that proves necessary - which I think is almost certain."" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the UK government was providing ""comprehensive coronavirus support packages"" and that thefurlough schemeand a similar system for the self-employed had ""saved nearly 800,000 jobs across Scotland"". More than a quarter of the UK's workforce isnow covered by the furlough scheme, which is due to run until the end of October - although the amount of money firms have to contribute is to increase each month. Ms Sturgeon also resisted calls to relax the 2m (6ft) physical distancing rule, saying it would hit businesses harder if the virus were to start spreading out of control again. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said it was ""essential"" this rule be relaxed ""to prevent wholesale economic collapse"" of the retail, hotel and restaurant sectors. The Scottish Beer and Pub Association said the limit ""simply does not make financial sense"". Ms Sturgeon said the rule would be kept under review, but said it was better to re-open the economy ""sustainably"" than to ""run the risk of having to shut it again weeks or months later"" because of a resurgence of the virus.

"This video can not be played Marcus Rashford: ""I'm grateful the prime minister changed his decision"" About 1.3m children in England will be able to claim free school meal vouchers in the summer holidays, after a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford. The Manchester United forward, 22, welcomed the six-week voucher for eligible children, saying: ""Look at what we can do when we come together."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the move was a ""welcome U-turn"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised Mr Rashford's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". During the coronavirus lockdown the government is providing vouchers to families whose children qualify for free meals. But it had insisted this would not continue outside of term time. This prompted the England squad footballerto pen an open letterto MPs.

The credibility factor: why policy u-turns matter Who gets free school meals? Live reaction as school meal fund promised NI only part of UK not to extend free school meals The footballer said he spoke with Mr Johnson on the phone earlier and that the PM thanked him ""for using what I've built in a positive manner"". ""He was just grateful that someone had an opinion and shared it with people,"" Mr Rashford added. ""Being that voice for people who didn't really have the platform to speak out as much as they would like to.""

For weeks, campaigners have been calling for free school meals to be offered during the holidays. 'We go hungry so we can feed our children' Court action threatened over school meal vouchers Many families whose children qualify for free meals have since the lockdown began been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth Â£15 each week per pupil, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. Almost 1.3 million school children in England - accounting for 15.4% of state-educated pupils - were eligible for and claiming free school meals in January 2019,according to the latest available data,external. Last year's figures showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were getting the free meals. The prime minister's official spokesman said the food vouchers to cover the six-week holiday period were a response to the ""unique circumstances of the pandemic"" and would not continue beyond the summer. Referring to Mr Rashford, he added: ""The PM welcomes his contribution to the debate around poverty and respects the fact that he has been using his profile as a leading sportsman to highlight important issues."" As a striker with a killer instinct in front of goal, Marcus Rashford is used to beating defences. And he's cut straight through a nervous defensive wall of Conservative ministers - leaving them wrong-footed and facing an embarrassing own goal. A number of Tory MPs had already voiced their disquiet - and how many of them really wanted to find themselves up against an England football hero, and the risk of children going hungry? The U-turn means the government will pay the extra Â£120m to extend free school meal vouchers across the six weeks of the holidays, available to 1.3 million children. It's a one-off deal for the unprecedented pressure caused by the coronavirus - with food banks warning of growing demands. But Mr Rashford, and his 2.7 million Twitter followers, proved a tough target for the government - and he's beaten them with a fast-footed appeal directly to public opinion. Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey waswidely criticised for a comment she madein response to Mr Rashford's campaign. Mr Rashford had asked others to think about struggling parents who have had their ""water turned off"", and whose children have gone hungry. Ms Coffey replied to his Twitter thread on free school meals, saying ""water cannot be disconnected"" - prompting the footballer to say he was ""concerned"" she had only acknowledged part of his message. Among Tory MPs praising the U-turn was Tim Loughton, who said he was ""delighted"" the government had ""listened to Conservative backbenchers"". Opposition parties also welcomed the move - while Manchester United said Mr Rashford was a ""hero"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, who wrote to the chancellor about the issue last week, said she was pleased ministers had ""seen sense and changed their minds"". Sonja from near Basingstoke, who has three teenage children, said the government's change of heart was ""wonderful"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive she found herself out of work and relying on benefits because of the pandemic. The free school meals vouchers have been a lifeline so far, Sonja says, adding that she was grateful to Mr Rashford for his campaign. ""[The U-turn] takes away that worry of the six-week summer holiday and makes it so much less stressful."" she said. But she added: ""I feel sad that it had to be a campaign. They have been throwing money to keep everyone afloat but left behind people on universal credit and free school meals."" Dev Sharma, Youth MP for Leicestershire, said the vouchers have been a safety net for his family and expressed his delight the government has decided to fund them over the summer after all. Dev Sharma is a member of the Bite Back youth campaign for better nutrition for young people The 15-year-old said the move ""means the world"" to him and his brother ""to know that my mum and dad have now sufficient funds to feed [us] over six weeks"". ""I can now have access to a decent meal and be on the same level as my peers from more affluent backgrounds,"" he said. DIET AND IMMUNITY:How important is diet for the immune system? CORONAVIRUS QUIZ:Debunk the myths Several charities have praised Mr Rashford's campaign. Andrew Forsey, chief executive of Feeding Britain, said the footballer has ""done incredibly well for himself, but hasn't forgotten his roots"". But Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the government's scheme ""only covers a minority of children in poverty and the pressures are much wider than just school meals"". She said ""soaring numbers of families"" were having to rely on foodbanks to get through the pandemic, even with the voucher scheme in place. Does you child qualify for free school meals?

"A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. The low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone is a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly virus, UK experts say. The drug is part ofthe world's biggest trial testing existing treatments,externalto see if they also work for coronavirus. It cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth. Had the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say. This video can not be played Katherine Millbank spent 15 days in hospital and was put on the drug trial And it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients. The UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate ""a remarkable British scientific achievement"", adding: ""We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak."" Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world. What is dexamethasone and how does it work? Latest coronavirus updates The drug combination that may help us beat Covid-19 About 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. Of those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. And these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. The drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions. And it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. This over-reaction,a cytokine storm, can be deadly. Inthe trial,external, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. For patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. For patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%. Chief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: ""This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough."" Lead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for: every eight patients on a ventilator every 20-25 treated with oxygen ""There is a clear, clear benefit,"" he said. ""The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about Â£5 per patient. ""So essentially it costs Â£35 to save a life. ""This is a drug that is globally available."" When appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said. But people should not go out and buy it to take at home. Dexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently beenditched amid concernsit increases fatalities and heart problems. The antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is alreadybeing made available on the NHS. The first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid. That is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. And that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. Dexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Half of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact. The drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. So far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola. That has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11. But the evidence was not strong enough to show whether it reduced mortality. Unlike dexamethasone, remdesivir is a new drug with limited supplies and a price has yet to be announced.

"Marcus Rashford has renewed his calls for the school meal voucher scheme to be extended in England. The footballer asked others to think about struggling parents who have had their ""water turned off"" in lockdown, and whose children have gone hungry. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has been criticised for replying that ""water cannot be disconnected"". The Manchester United forward, 22, urged MPs to ""put rivalries aside"" in a Parliament debate on the subject later. Labour described Ms Coffey's comment as ""snarky"" while the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives questioned why the government has not yet U-turned on the plans. What's happening to free school meals this summer? Families react to school meal voucher row Families whose children qualify for free meals have received vouchers or parcels in lockdown. While provision is to continue through the summer in Scotland and Wales, it will stop at the end of term in England and Northern Ireland. Almost 1.3 million school children in England - accounting for 15.4% of state-educated pupils - were eligible for and claiming free school mealsaccording to the latest available data,external. Official figures for 2019 showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were getting the free meals. This video can not be played Man United's Rashford speaks about his mother's sacrifices When Ms Coffey replied to Mr Rashford's Twitter thread on the scheme, he said he was ""concerned"" she had only acknowledged his tweet about water being turned off. He urged her to help ""make a difference"". Labour deputy leaderAngela Rayner tweeted,external: ""We often couldn't afford hot water when I was growing up, I don't know if you've ever experienced poverty and being unable to pay the bills but as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions I would have expected better from you."" Ruth Davidson, an MSP and the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said she was ""baffled"" that the government had not already backtracked on the plans. ""Food security during the holidays so important. It's basic. Feed the kids,""she said on Twitter,external. The government says Â£63m is available to councils to help families. Mr Rashford urged Therese Coffey to help ""make a difference"" as work and pensions secretary In an emotional open letter to MPs posted on Monday, Mr Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. Mr Rashford, who grew up in Manchester, said his story was ""all too familiar for families in England"". The Department for Education said it would not reverse its decision - butthe England international said he would fight on, tweeting ""we aren't beaten yet"" and ""MPs, please #maketheUturn"". Hairdresser Jane Keen-Smith says she struggled to redeem the vouchers Jane Keen-Smith, a mother of four boys and a self-employed hairdresser, has seen her livelihood collapse during the lockdown. Underlying health conditions in the family - one son is severely disabled - mean she will be unable to work even once hairdressers are allowed to return next month. She told the BBC the Â£60 vouchers she receives each week make a ""massive difference"", saying the family will be ""stuck"" when they stop and she has no income. The mother from Pershore, Worcestershire, said she has had some help from friends and family - but teenage boys are ""bottomless hunger pits"" and her budget is extremely tight. ""We're basically struggling with everything"", she said, adding that having the vouchers over the summer would be ""a huge help"". Read more: Families fear being 'left with zero' During the Commons debate on the issue later, Labour will say it would be ""callous"" not to take what it will call a ""small step"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said on Twitter that Conservatives have an opportunity to ""do the right thing"" to make sure ""children don't go hungry this summer"". But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted the government is ""not turning a blind eye"" to child poverty during the crisis, and defended its decision not to extend the voucher scheme. He told BBC Breakfast the government had been ""wrapping its arms around people in communities"" to do ""everything it possibly can"" to support them, including the Â£20bn spent on its furlough scheme and payments to local government bodies. He said No 10 had given an extra Â£63m to local authorities to help children during the pandemic, as well as a Â£129m investment ""that's already gone to families and schools as part of the process of helping children"".

Shadow education secretary Ms Long-Bailey said it was ""only right"" for the government to continue the scheme over the summer, so children don't go hungry and are in a position to start ""learning properly"" in September. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she asked ministers to ""just continue the free school meal voucher programme"" and pointing to Scotland and Wales, added: ""They are going to do this over the summer holidays for their children, so why can't the government in England do the same?"" Last week, three Conservative MPs signed a cross-party letter calling for an extension of the scheme - worth Â£15 for each child per week in England - into the summer holidays in England. David Simmonds, the Conservative MP and a member of the education select committee, said Mr Rashford's letter was ""incredibly powerful"" but the free school meals scheme, although ""popular"", is a ""very blunt instrument"" and it doesn't always get to the most vulnerable children. Citing figures from the Local Government Association that show a Â£3bn shortfall in the children's social care sector, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that pressure is ""building"" in the system and that there has been a ""massive increase"" in the number of children coming into care whose needs ""must come first"". He said the government needed to address the ""significant pressure"" on the system ""so the most vulnerable children in this country - of whom there are tens of thousands - are not left behind"". Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker also gave his support to Mr Rashford,saying he was a credit to the sport and his family. He told BBC Newsnight: ""He shouldn't really be the one having to do this, but... he's doing a great job."" The former England striker said he understood ""kids wouldn't ordinarily be fed during the summer holidays"", but these are ""very difficult times"". This video can not be played Gary Lineker: Marcus Rashford credit to his sport and his family Conservative MPs will have a chance to register their unease during the Commons debate, said Newsnight's Nicholas Watt. One Tory backbencher forecast an eventual government U-turn, he added. Ministers, who say free school meals are not usually continued into the summer holidays, are planning to amend the Labour motion to highlight the steps the government has taken to help pupils from poorer backgrounds. This includes the Â£63m for local authorities to help people struggling financially as a result of coronavirus and the Holiday Activities and Food programme, which offers activities and free meals in the summer.

"This video can not be played Marcus Rashford: ""I'm grateful the prime minister changed his decision"" About 1.3m children in England will be able to claim free school meal vouchers in the summer holidays, after a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford. The Manchester United forward, 22, welcomed the six-week voucher for eligible children, saying: ""Look at what we can do when we come together."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the move was a ""welcome U-turn"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised Mr Rashford's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". During the coronavirus lockdown the government is providing vouchers to families whose children qualify for free meals. But it had insisted this would not continue outside of term time. This prompted the England squad footballerto pen an open letterto MPs. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday evening, Mr Rashford said he was ""grateful that the prime minister did change his decision"". The credibility factor: why policy u-turns matter Who gets free school meals? Live reaction as school meal fund promised NI only part of UK not to extend free school meals The footballer said he spoke with Mr Johnson on the phone earlier and that the PM thanked him ""for using what I've built in a positive manner"". ""He was just grateful that someone had an opinion and shared it with people,"" Mr Rashford added. ""Being that voice for people who didn't really have the platform to speak out as much as they would like to.""

For weeks, campaigners have been calling for free school meals to be offered during the holidays. 'We go hungry so we can feed our children' Court action threatened over school meal vouchers Many families whose children qualify for free meals have since the lockdown began been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth Â£15 each week per pupil, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. Almost 1.3 million school children in England - accounting for 15.4% of state-educated pupils - were eligible for and claiming free school meals in January 2019,according to the latest available data,external. Last year's figures showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were getting the free meals. The prime minister's official spokesman said the food vouchers to cover the six-week holiday period were a response to the ""unique circumstances of the pandemic"" and would not continue beyond the summer. Referring to Mr Rashford, he added: ""The PM welcomes his contribution to the debate around poverty and respects the fact that he has been using his profile as a leading sportsman to highlight important issues."" As a striker with a killer instinct in front of goal, Marcus Rashford is used to beating defences. And he's cut straight through a nervous defensive wall of Conservative ministers - leaving them wrong-footed and facing an embarrassing own goal. A number of Tory MPs had already voiced their disquiet - and how many of them really wanted to find themselves up against an England football hero, and the risk of children going hungry? The U-turn means the government will pay the extra Â£120m to extend free school meal vouchers across the six weeks of the holidays, available to 1.3 million children. It's a one-off deal for the unprecedented pressure caused by the coronavirus - with food banks warning of growing demands. But Mr Rashford, and his 2.7 million Twitter followers, proved a tough target for the government - and he's beaten them with a fast-footed appeal directly to public opinion. Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey waswidely criticised for a comment she madein response to Mr Rashford's campaign. Mr Rashford had asked others to think about struggling parents who have had their ""water turned off"", and whose children have gone hungry. Ms Coffey replied to his Twitter thread on free school meals, saying ""water cannot be disconnected"" - prompting the footballer to say he was ""concerned"" she had only acknowledged part of his message. Among Tory MPs praising the U-turn was Tim Loughton, who said he was ""delighted"" the government had ""listened to Conservative backbenchers"". Opposition parties also welcomed the move - while Manchester United said Mr Rashford was a ""hero"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, who wrote to the chancellor about the issue last week, said she was pleased ministers had ""seen sense and changed their minds"". Sonja from near Basingstoke, who has three teenage children, said the government's change of heart was ""wonderful"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive she found herself out of work and relying on benefits because of the pandemic. The free school meals vouchers have been a lifeline so far, Sonja says, adding that she was grateful to Mr Rashford for his campaign. ""[The U-turn] takes away that worry of the six-week summer holiday and makes it so much less stressful."" she said. But she added: ""I feel sad that it had to be a campaign. They have been throwing money to keep everyone afloat but left behind people on universal credit and free school meals."" Dev Sharma, Youth MP for Leicestershire, said the vouchers have been a safety net for his family and expressed his delight the government has decided to fund them over the summer after all. Dev Sharma is a member of the Bite Back youth campaign for better nutrition for young people The 15-year-old said the move ""means the world"" to him and his brother ""to know that my mum and dad have now sufficient funds to feed [us] over six weeks"". ""I can now have access to a decent meal and be on the same level as my peers from more affluent backgrounds,"" he said. DIET AND IMMUNITY:How important is diet for the immune system? CORONAVIRUS QUIZ:Debunk the myths Several charities have praised Mr Rashford's campaign. Andrew Forsey, chief executive of Feeding Britain, said the footballer has ""done incredibly well for himself, but hasn't forgotten his roots"". But Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the government's scheme ""only covers a minority of children in poverty and the pressures are much wider than just school meals"". She said ""soaring numbers of families"" were having to rely on foodbanks to get through the pandemic, even with the voucher scheme in place. Does you child qualify for free school meals?

"School meal scheme extended for children in England after campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford Reacting to the news, the Manchester United forward said ""just look at what we can do when we come together"" The 'Covid summer school fund' works out as about Â£15 a week per recipient, and will cost about Â£120m Latest updates on Tuesday, 16 June Jennifer Meierhans, Jay Vydelingum, Lauren Potts and Jay Freeman That's where we leave things today.

We'll be back tomorrow but, for now, thank you for joining us. BBC Newsbeat Georgina is a single parent with five children aged between three and 13. She lost her job as a carer during lockdown and has relied on vouchers to feed her family. She's described the U-turn over free school meals as ""amazing"" and takes the weight off her shoulders after she lost her job as a carer and had to claim benefits. ""To know that we're still going to get that money during the summer holidays is amazing,"" she told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat. ""The summer holidays were looking a little bit bleak if I'm honest. I can split money up on a weekly basis and make sure my children have got breakfast, a lunch and a dinner."" Described as the ""true jewel"" in Norwich's crown, the city's market has been on the same site since it was founded by the Normans in the 11th Century. Normally it boasts 189 stalls and plays an important part in the local economy, but then came the coronavirus lockdown and everything changed. Just over a year ago it was named the ""best large outdoor market in Britain"" but how is it coping with coronavirus restrictions - and can it survive? Stallholders have spoken to the BBC about the challenges they facein a wildly different economical climate. BBC Radio 5 Live A teenager whose family have used the safety net of food vouchers has expressed his delight that the government will fund them over the summer. Dev Sharma, a 15-year-old youth MP for Leicestershire, said the move was hugely important to him and his brother. ""It means the world to know that my mum and dad have now sufficient funds to feed [us] over six weeks,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I can now have access to a decent meal and be on the same level as my peers from more affluent backgrounds,"" he said. A shop owner has been left ""devastated"" by flooding on his first full day of trading after lockdown restrictions were eased. Dale Street in Milnrow, Rochdalewas ""completely flooded""when the River Beal rose rapidly on Monday evening. ""This can't carry on - it is the fifth flood in five years since the Boxing Day floods in 2015,"" said Philip Holt, who owns Carpet Creations. ""We're devastated but we'll dust ourselves down and reopen on Wednesday but we can't keep doing this."" Royal Ascot fans have been donning their finest threads and hats to take part in horse racing's biggest meeting from the comfort of their own homes. The coronavirus pandemic has meant the action is taking place behind closed doors with jockeys wearing face masks. However, ""virtual racegoers"" have kept up with the fun from home, using the hashtags #SharedWithThanks and #hatsfromhome to showcase their outfits on social media. Vicky O'Hagan, of Consett in Durham, and her mother, Dee, opted for a cleaning theme for their headwear. While Christopher Weatherstone, his mother Dawn, and sister Lucy, kept things classic in Rotherham in South Yorkshire, with a bow tie, dresses and fascinators. Ascot's organisers are encouraging racegoers to donate to four front-line charities. The National Emergencies Trust Relief Fund, NHS Charities Together, the Care Workers Charity and the Berkshire Community Foundation Coronavirus Fund, will all benefit.

""He showed great fight and he has achieved so much in helping families who struggle to feed their children. ""As a United fan I thought he was great before but now he has shown the whole country what sort of a person he is off the pitch. ""I know he visits his old school and gives presents out to the kids. He is a great role model."" We have focused on Marcus Rashford's successful campaign to help children receive free school meals throughout the summer, but what else has happened around England today? Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit About 868,000 children in England went to school last Thursday, according to the latest data published this afternoon by the Department for Education. Although this was up by a third on the previous Thursday, it still means only 9% of children were in school. When lockdown was imposed only vulnerable pupils and the children of keyworkers were allowed to go in. Schools started to re-open to children in Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 on 8 June. Figures for this week, as some Year 10 and Year 12 pupils started to go back, should be shown in next week's data release.

But the other top stories globally have been: There are fewer very happy Americans than at any point in nearly 50 years, according to a new survey. The new poll was released by theNational Opinion Research Center,externalat the University of Chicago and used data from the General Social Survey (GSS) data. It found that only 14% of Americans described themselves as very happy. In 2018, the last time the poll was conducted, it was 31%. The GSS has collected data every other year since 1972. The previous low point came in 2010 when 29% of Americans said they were very happy. Currently, 50% of people say they sometimes feel isolated, compared to 23% in 2018. The numbers are somewhat unsurprising, given the lockdowns that have separated communities and led to social isolation. The survey was conducted in May, before the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, which touched off protests across the nation and world.

BBC Sport have been previewing the plans ahead of the committee's crunch meeting on Wednesday.Read more here. The Duke of Cambridge has joked that he is looking forward to having a pint in the pub, as he praised ambulance staff for their hard work during the pandemic. In his first face-to-face meeting with the public in months, the prince told ambulance crews at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Norfolk he thought the weekly Clap for Carers - when people across the UK stood on their doorsteps to applaud the country's NHS staff and key workers - was ""powerful"". ""Everyone appreciates the NHS, we have an amazing system and many countries around the world envy what we have,"" he told them. In a lighter moment, he joked he was looking forward to being told he could go to the pub again and shared his worry for the country's waistline. ""I've done a lot of baking at home - chocolate goes down very well,"" he said. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released a new video explaining the risks of passing the coronavirus to your household pet. The video, which is spliced with cute cats and dogs around their mask-wearing owners, advises that the chance of catching Covid-19 from a pet is ""considered low"". ""But it does appear that people can give the virus to animals,"" it continues, adding that cats and ferrets are most likely to get infected. Cats should be kept indoors and dogs should be walked on a leash, according to the FDA guidance. Pets should only be allowed to interact with members of their own households. If you do become infected, the FDA advises that you find someone else to watch your pet until you are better. If that isn't possible, then you should wear a mask around your pet, and wash your hands both before and after playing with them. Allow YouTube content?

Health workers protested in French cities including Paris, Strasbourg and Nice Thousands of doctors, nurses and hospital staff in France have been protesting to demand more investment in the health system. Like in many countries, the French public expressed their significant gratitude and support to medics during the pandemic - now health workers want this to be followed with more resources. Around 18,000 people attended the protests in Paris, which ended with violent action by a small group who threw stones and overturned a car. Police made 20 arrests. Unions are asking for pay rises, a recruitment drive and more beds in hospitals, and say Covid-19 exposed the weaknesses of the French health service. President Emmanuel Macron says his government is three weeks into a consultation and has announced bonuses for staff who worked through the crisis. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Patient credits dexamethasone with saving her life We've been hearing a lot about the drug dexamethasone, which has been found in a medical trial to cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. Briton Katherine Millbank took part in the trials and credits the drug with saving her life. An emotional Mrs Millbank has been telling the BBC about her experience. A Beijing official warned the new outbreak - linked to an open air market - is ""extremely severe"" Earlier we reported that a cluster of new cases connected to a Beijing market in China is causing serious concern. Now all schools have been ordered to close in an effort to contain the outbreak. The first case, linked to a market, was recorded on Thursday and cases have been rising since then. Beijing had not seen any new cases for more than 50 days before this. Schools and universities reopened just a few weeks ago, but now classes will once again go online. Entertainment venues will also close, and people must be tested before they will be permitted to leave the capital. This video can not be played Boris Johnson thanks Marcus Rashford for school meal campaign More than a million schoolchildren in England will be able to claim free meal vouchers during the summer, the UK government has said. It followed acampaign championed by footballer Marcus Rashfordfor an existing scheme to be extended during the school holidays due to the coronavirus crisis. The government had previously insisted it would not award free school meals vouchers in England outside of term time, prompting the footballerto pen an open letterto MPs asking for the decision to be reversed. At the Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the Manchester United and England forward, 22, for his efforts. Earlier today, the head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine told MPs that requiring patients to have an appointment before attending hospital casualty departments may be necessary in the UK following the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Katherine Henderson told the Commons Health and Social Care Select
Committee that older people were those usually most in need of emergency treatment but they were also the age group most at risk from Covid-19. She said that emergency wards were used to having ""elastic walls""
and an ""infinite number of patients"" but that they now needed to know who was coming into A&E. Henderson told MPs that
NHS 111 could be the first port of call for those in urgent need who could then be given an appointment to attend hospital. She told the committee that is was ""just impossible"" to have an 80-year-old with a hip fracture left waiting in a corridor alongside a patient with suspected Covid-19.  Many restaurants and bars have remained open throughout the pandemic, with some social distancing introduced Sweden took a different approach to managing coronavirus than most countries - it avoided lockdown and kept many workplaces and social spaces open. Now there is an uptick in cases again in the Scandinavian country - a further 15,000 confirmed infections since the beginning of June, bringing the country's total to 53,000. The leading health official, Anders Tegnell, denied that it was a sign the virus was taking hold again. He put the rise down to an increase in testing. Nonetheless, he urged Swedes to minimise socialising during the upcoming midsummer celebrations. His critics accused him of arrogance for resisting a lockdown, but the country's death rate is better than some countries that introduced serious restrictions, including the UK, Spain and Italy. Nearly 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Sweden. Having been closed to the public for three months, London Zoo welcomed back its first visitors yesterday. The Zoological Society of London had warned it would face permanent closure if the government did not relax restrictions so it could allow the public back in. But the experience of visiting the zoo is now a little different to how it was before the pandemic. The attraction is only allowing 2,000 visitors to come each day, and they must have a pre-booked, timed-entry ticket. Restaurants and cafes are closed and additional hand sanitising stations and distance markers have been installed. This video can not be played Coronavirus: ZSL London Zoo reopens after lockdown The Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has confirmed that the US Open will take place in New York City's Queens borough but without any spectators. The US Tennis Association's (USTA) signature Grand Slam event is due to run from 31 August to 13 September. In a tweet, Cuomo said that organisers would ""take extraordinary precautions to protect players and staff, including robust testing, additional cleaning, extra locker room space, and dedicated housing & transportation"". Some players have already expressed concerns about playing in the tournament. The US Open is normally the fourth and final Grand Slam, but will be only the second this year. The French Open could now start just one week after the end of the US. Wimbledon was cancelled for the first time since 1945. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked
if the UK had banned the export of dexamethasone at today's Downing Street briefing. Itâs a cheap and widely
available drug which a trial at Oxford University has shown can save the lives
of patients who are severely ill with Covid-19 and need oxygen treatment. The prime minister said he wasnât
aware of the ban. On 24 April, dexamethasone,
in the form of tablets and capsules,was added to a list of medicines that cannot be exported from the UK or hoarded,external. And today dexamethasone, in
the form of oral solutions and injections, was also added to the list. According to the governmentâs
website, âexporting a medicine on the list is considered a breach of regulation
43(2) of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and a contraventionâ¦ may lead to
regulatory action by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA), which could include immediate suspension of the wholesale dealer
licence"". Thereâs more detail on the trial of dexamethasone here. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked whether the rules on attendance at funerals in England would be relaxed. At the moment the only mourners
allowed to attend are members of the deceased personâs household and close
family members or close friends if family members are unable to attend. Numbers must be kept low enough to
allow everybody to stay two metres apart. Someone to conduct the service, a
funeral director and other staff may also attend. The guidance for England says that
mourners who are self-isolating for 14 days but do not have symptoms should be
helped to attend, as should those in vulnerable groups who are shielding.
Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus should not attend. In Scotland the advice is slightly
different, with those self-isolating or shielding encouraged to seriously consider
not attending. In Wales, those allowed to attend the
funeral are the person organising it, people who have been invited and any
carers, with numbers again limited by the requirements of social distancing. The
guidance for Northern Ireland includes a limit of 10 mourners and stresses that
those who are self-isolating should not mix with other people attending. Reality Check The prime minister said at the Downing Street briefing that he
only became aware âtodayâ of footballer Marcus Rashfordâs campaign to make the
government change its mind on not extending free school meal vouchers in
England over the summer. The government has now
relented and says it will continue to run the scheme during the summer holiday and
Boris Johnson has congratulated the player. Marcus Rashford first raised his concerns on Twitter on 10 June when he
asked âAnybody know who I can talk to about the government food voucher
scheme?â Labour has also
been campaigning on the issue and sent a letter about it to Education
Secretary Gavin Williamson on 8 June. It was also raised in the House of
Commons on 9 June. In England, about
1.3 million children claimed free school meals in 2019, or about 15% of
state-educated pupils. Extending the scheme over the summer will cost around Â£120m. Thereâs more detail on how it will work and on whatâs happening across the UK in this piece.   Helen CattPolitical correspondent A bit of good news was what the government
really needed, as it faces pressure from its own backbenchers (and today, a
public questioner) on social distancing requirements and after its high profile U-turn on school meal vouchers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his weekly appearance
at the Downing Street briefing to deliver news about an unquestionably positive
development. He was very keen to point up the UK
expertise behind what he called the ""biggest breakthrough yet"" in
treating coronavirus. The scientists at today's press conference also seemed upbeat - excited
even - highlighting that the drug dexamethasone which could save the life of one in eight patients who experience serious breathing
problems is widely available and cheap. There was one note of caution in the
optimistic tone though - having a treatment doesn't necessarily mean less
stringent conditions for all of us if there is a second wave of the virus. And when it comes to that two-metre social
distancing rule, there does seem to be a hint of more wiggle room opening up, but Boris Johnson's message is still ""watch this space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson led todayâs government press conference. He was accompanied by the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford.

As our live page draws to a close, here are the major world events linked to coronavirus for Tuesday: The top story was really a UK story - the breakthrough in the medical world with the drug dexamethasone, which can save the lives of seriously ill coronavirus patients. But the other top stories globally have been: There are fewer very happy Americans than at any point in nearly 50 years, according to a new survey. The new poll was released by theNational Opinion Research Center,externalat the University of Chicago and used data from the General Social Survey (GSS) data. It found that only 14% of Americans described themselves as very happy. In 2018, the last time the poll was conducted, it was 31%. The GSS has collected data every other year since 1972. The previous low point came in 2010 when 29% of Americans said they were very happy. Currently, 50% of people say they sometimes feel isolated, compared to 23% in 2018. The numbers are somewhat unsurprising, given the lockdowns that have separated communities and led to social isolation. The survey was conducted in May, before the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, which touched off protests across the nation and world.

"Ex-Tory Leader William Hague says lockdown is an ""economic catastrophe"" and is calling for the two-metre distancing rule to be scrapped. Writing in the Telegraph,external, Lord Hague said lockdown was increasing inequality, social tension and debt. The hospitality industry, and some MPs and scientists, have called for the 2m (6ft) rule to be relaxed in England. No 10 has said a review into the rule will be completed ""in the coming weeks"". And Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said the government would not amend the restriction until 4 July at the earliest. He told BBC Breakfast the public would be ""rightly very unforgiving"" if the UK experienced a second spike of coronavirus caused by ""rushing"" a change in restrictions. So far England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all maintained the two-metre rule. It comes as official figures suggest the number of workers on UK payrollsdived more than 600,000 between March and May- reflecting the impact of about six weeks in lockdown. But economists say the full impact on employment will not be felt until wage support schemes end in October. âI've applied for more than 100 jobsâ Two-metre review to be completed in 'coming weeks' When will pubs, cafes and restaurants reopen? Am I exempt from quarantine? In his article, Lord Hague said the lockdown had been so ""destructive"" that it could ""only ever be allowed to happen once"". He urged the government to scrap the quarantine on international arrivals - which requires all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days - and the 2m social distancing rule. ""We can now see that it is not necessary to have a two-metre separation between people to keep the virus in retreat where it is already at a low level,"" he writes. ""We know this from the experience of countries such as Denmark, France and Germany where the recommended distance is shorter, and we should not have to spend weeks agonising over it."" He said lockdown was ""like Dunkirk - a heroic operation in itself but the result of a massive failure"". And this was a failure ""at multiple levels"" he said, adding: ""A failure by the whole world to prevent the trading of wild animals for consumption; by China to report the initial outbreak openly; by our and many other countries to prepare for this type of pandemic."" He said ""crucial lessons"" had also been learnt, including that some countries - including Germany and South Korea - ""have escaped a good deal of the brutal costs of having to pursue a tight lockdown"" after they were ""much more ambitious about testing"". Other Tory MPs have echoed Lord Hague's words. Former Tory Leader Iain Duncan-Smith has warned MPs that they were ""in danger of losing sight of what will happen, probably to the poorest in society"". Ex-defence minister Tobias Ellwood has told the Commons that halving social distancing to 1m would be ""game-changing"" and should be done now. And,in a joint article for the Telegraph,external, Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferson from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford said there was no evidence for the 2m rule. They said it was ""seriously impacting schools, pubs, restaurants and our ability to go about our daily lives"". ""Handwashing and encouragement are what we need, not formalised rules."" THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? But Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""People will be, I think rightly very unforgiving about a second spike caused by rushing from two metres to one metre, or what have you. ""So, what we're doing is - right now, properly reviewing all of the evidence and we're aware that other countries have come to different conclusions."" Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, has said: ""It is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces and the risks are associated with distance, so risk falls after 2m. ""It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is 2m or nothing - that is not what the advice has been and it is not what the advice is now.""

"Ex-Tory Leader William Hague says lockdown is an ""economic catastrophe"" and is calling for the two-metre distancing rule to be scrapped. Writing in the Telegraph,external, Lord Hague said lockdown was increasing inequality, social tension and debt. The hospitality industry, and some MPs and scientists, have called for the 2m (6ft) rule to be relaxed in England. No 10 has said a review into the rule will be completed ""in the coming weeks"". And Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said the government would not amend the restriction until 4 July at the earliest. He told BBC Breakfast the public would be ""rightly very unforgiving"" if the UK experienced a second spike of coronavirus caused by ""rushing"" a change in restrictions. So far England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all maintained the two-metre rule. It comes as official figures suggest the number of workers on UK payrollsdived more than 600,000 between March and May- reflecting the impact of about six weeks in lockdown. But economists say the full impact on employment will not be felt until wage support schemes end in October. âI've applied for more than 100 jobsâ Two-metre review to be completed in 'coming weeks' When will pubs, cafes and restaurants reopen? Am I exempt from quarantine? In his article, Lord Hague said the lockdown had been so ""destructive"" that it could ""only ever be allowed to happen once"". He urged the government to scrap the quarantine on international arrivals - which requires all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days - and the 2m social distancing rule. ""We can now see that it is not necessary to have a two-metre separation between people to keep the virus in retreat where it is already at a low level,"" he writes. ""We know this from the experience of countries such as Denmark, France and Germany where the recommended distance is shorter, and we should not have to spend weeks agonising over it."" He said lockdown was ""like Dunkirk - a heroic operation in itself but the result of a massive failure"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We tolerate a risk of our left and right hands working independently"". The government department responsible for overseas aid is to be merged with the Foreign Office (FCO), the PM has announced. Boris Johnson told MPs abolishing the separate Department for International Development (DfID) would mean aid spending better reflected UK aims. He said the ""long overdue reform"" would ensure ""maximum value"" for taxpayers. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the move would weaken UK influence, and he would re-establish DfID if elected PM. Three former prime ministers - Conservative David Cameron, and Labour's Gordon Brown and Tony Blair - have also criticised the move. Mr Cameron said it would mean ""less expertise, less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the UK overseas"". What's behind the PM's aid department decision? UK aid budget to help boost trade agenda Ministers are aiming to set up the new joint department - called the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office - by September. The move to combine the two, which have a previous history of being merged and split up again, has long been mooted in Conservative circles. Announcing the plan in the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new joint department would lend ""extra throw-weight and kilowattage"" to the UK's aims overseas. He added that it was ""outdated"" to keep the departments separate, with other developed countries already running aid as part of their foreign ministries. For too long, he said, UK aid spending had ""been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests"". However he pledged DfID's budget - which at Â£15bn last year dwarfed the Â£2.4bn spent by the FCO - would be maintained, with the UK committed to continuing to spend 0.7% of national income on aid projects. Boris Johnson has wanted to merge the Foreign Office and Department for International Development for years. He believes that it is wrong to have two arms of UK foreign policy acting independently, and wants more coherence so the UK can speak with one voice on overseas matters. But critics within the aid sector fear this merger may see more of the money focused on UK national interests and less on poverty reduction. As such, this is a politically controversial move. Some will see it as a sensible reordering of Whitehall, to ensure joined up policy and more effective aid spending, helping the most vulnerable while also promoting Britain abroad. Others will see it as a bureaucratic distraction that will potentially weaken the UK's global reputation as an aid superpower. Read more from James Landale In response, Sir Keir said there was ""no rationale"" for the merger, which he said was being made now to ""deflect attention"" from the government's handling of the Covid-19 crisis. He said DfID had proved one of the UK's ""best performing departments,"" and abolishing it represented ""the tactics of pure distraction"". ""Abolishing DfID diminishes Britain's place in the world,"" he told MPs. Asked later on Tuesday whether he would undo the merger if elected PM, he replied: ""Yes, we introduced DfID for a reason. ""This was cross-party consensus for many many years that DfID did good work. Of course it should be reinstated."" Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, who was in charge of DfID between 2010 and 2012, said abolishing the department would be a ""quite extraordinary mistake"". But fellow Conservative Jeremy Hunt, who said he had ""wrested with this issue"" as a former foreign secretary, said the merger was the ""right thing to do"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Merger plans ""intended to deflect attention"". Oxfam, which has delivered development projects using money from DfID, said the merger would harm the fight to reduce global poverty. The charity's chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah said the move was ""scarcely believable"" at a time when the world was focused on fighting coronavirus. ""This decision puts politics above the needs of the poorest people and will mean more people around the world will die unnecessarily from hunger and disease."" ""The Foreign Office may be excellent at diplomacy, but it has a patchy record of aid delivery and is not as transparent as DfID"", he said. Former Labour PM Tony Blair - who carved DfID out of the Foreign Office during his time in Downing Street - also called the move ""wrong and regressive"". ""The strategic aims of alignment with diplomacy and focus on new areas of strategic interest to Britain could be accomplished without its abolition,"" he said. His successor Gordon Brown said the decision to axe DfID was ""sad,"" adding it had been ""one of the UK's great international assets."" SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the move represented the UK ""turning its back on the world and to those most in need"". Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said that ""confusing"" aid objectives with foreign policy decisions was a ""massive step backwards"". The department now known as DfID began life under Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964 as the Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM). It was later merged with the Foreign Office under Ted Heath's Conservative government in 1970, but was re-established as a separate ministry by Mr Wilson after his return to Downing Street in 1974. It was re-merged with the Foreign Office again however after the election of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1979.

"This video can not be played Workplace antibody tests 'will reassure' staff Companies are ""nervous"" about testing employees for coronavirus antibodies, according to the director of CBI Wales. Ian Price said there were ""legitimate"" tests available that employers can use but it was important to get it right. Some businesses hope to benefit from workers being tested to see if they have already had coronavirus, so providing the assurances for more to get back to work. The Welsh Government would decide how antibody tests are rolled out in Wales. The antibody test - involving testing drops of blood - has been viewed as a potential ""game-changer"" in tackling the virus as it would help understand who has had coronavirus and whether they have immunity. Stocks of ""home-kit"" antibody tests were being prepared to go on salebut were withdrawn.,external Public health officials have also been concerned that it could lead to people breaking measures like social distancing if they thought they had already had the virus. But work is continuing on developing a reliable test which can be mass produced. It is still not clear whether having had coronavirus gives a person immunity from catching it again. What tests are available in the UK for people with symptoms? Welsh factory to produce millions of antibody tests Covid antibody test a 'positive development' Businesses said antibody tests could help them as they bring people back to work, but only if the tests are proved to be reliable. Mr Price warns that if tests are not robust it could ""lead people into a false sense of security"". ""Within a business like mine we are quite naturally socially distant,"" said Hayley Pells, owner of Avia Autos in Bridgend. ""The advantage of that is that we have been able to remain safe and operate during the pandemic. Having something like testing in place, it would enable us to track and trace and contribute to the data that is needed to fight the virus. It would also reassure our team and get us back working."" Hayley Pells said she saw buying testing kits as an extension of her current provision of PPE ""With the transmission risk of the virus, although we are putting everything in place to reduce that risk by sanitising cars that come in and out, we do have to be mindful of the people who have to make essential travel,"" she said. ""Those on the front line that are exposed to the virus who desperately need their cars to get to work. We also have people who need their cars for treatment and they may have compromised immunity. It is up to us to make sure they are safe."" She said having testing freely available would increase reassurance for workers but also to suppliers and customers. ""Operating as a small business we already invest in our PPE. I would see buying testing kits as an extension of that PPE provision. If the testing could be available at a price I could afford I would definitely consider buying those kits in."" Andy Murdoch used to be a partner in the business but now works reduced hours for his daughter Hayley's father, Andy Murdoch, works for Avia but has been keeping away from the garage due to a long-term health issue. He'd like to be tested so he can go back to work. ""If you could get tested, if there was a reliable way of saying 'yes I'm fine', every day if you like - I'm not sure how often you would need to do it. Any reassurance is going to be good. For me, I'd go in tomorrow.""

The company is part of the supply chain for the manufacturing of medical devices so its work was viewed as critical. It has brought in a series of safety measures, including mandatory hand washing when entering the building, split and staggered shifts, and temperature reading. Mark Christoffersen, director of manufacturing facilities believes tests might give the business more confidence and bring more people back into work. ""From a confidence point of view it would be really beneficial. Obviously the science has to support that, it has to be accurate. For us as a business that would be really important."" Mr Price, from CBI Wales, said it was important for companies to be clear about what they were getting into, before they started to test, ""There is some general nervousness around all these different tests that are out there at the moment. You can go on the internet and find all sorts of things. ""It does appear that there are some legitimate tests out there now that employers can use.""

As our live page draws to a close, here are the major world events linked to coronavirus for Tuesday: The top story was really a UK story - the breakthrough in the medical world with the drug dexamethasone, which can save the lives of seriously ill coronavirus patients. But the other top stories globally have been: There are fewer very happy Americans than at any point in nearly 50 years, according to a new survey. The new poll was released by theNational Opinion Research Center,externalat the University of Chicago and used data from the General Social Survey (GSS) data. It found that only 14% of Americans described themselves as very happy. In 2018, the last time the poll was conducted, it was 31%. The GSS has collected data every other year since 1972. The previous low point came in 2010 when 29% of Americans said they were very happy. Currently, 50% of people say they sometimes feel isolated, compared to 23% in 2018. The numbers are somewhat unsurprising, given the lockdowns that have separated communities and led to social isolation. The survey was conducted in May, before the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, which touched off protests across the nation and world.

The Duke of Cambridge has joked that he is looking forward to having a pint in the pub, as he praised ambulance staff for their hard work during the pandemic. In his first face-to-face meeting with the public in months, the prince told ambulance crews at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Norfolk he thought the weekly Clap for Carers - when people across the UK stood on their doorsteps to applaud the country's NHS staff and key workers - was ""powerful"". ""Everyone appreciates the NHS, we have an amazing system and many countries around the world envy what we have,"" he told them. In a lighter moment, he joked he was looking forward to being told he could go to the pub again and shared his worry for the country's waistline. ""I've done a lot of baking at home - chocolate goes down very well,"" he said. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released a new video explaining the risks of passing the coronavirus to your household pet. The video, which is spliced with cute cats and dogs around their mask-wearing owners, advises that the chance of catching Covid-19 from a pet is ""considered low"". ""But it does appear that people can give the virus to animals,"" it continues, adding that cats and ferrets are most likely to get infected. Cats should be kept indoors and dogs should be walked on a leash, according to the FDA guidance. Pets should only be allowed to interact with members of their own households. If you do become infected, the FDA advises that you find someone else to watch your pet until you are better. If that isn't possible, then you should wear a mask around your pet, and wash your hands both before and after playing with them. Allow YouTube content?

Health workers protested in French cities including Paris, Strasbourg and Nice Thousands of doctors, nurses and hospital staff in France have been protesting to demand more investment in the health system. Like in many countries, the French public expressed their significant gratitude and support to medics during the pandemic - now health workers want this to be followed with more resources. Around 18,000 people attended the protests in Paris, which ended with violent action by a small group who threw stones and overturned a car. Police made 20 arrests. Unions are asking for pay rises, a recruitment drive and more beds in hospitals, and say Covid-19 exposed the weaknesses of the French health service. President Emmanuel Macron says his government is three weeks into a consultation and has announced bonuses for staff who worked through the crisis.

Briton Katherine Millbank took part in the trials and credits the drug with saving her life. An emotional Mrs Millbank has been telling the BBC about her experience. A Beijing official warned the new outbreak - linked to an open air market - is ""extremely severe"" Earlier we reported that a cluster of new cases connected to a Beijing market in China is causing serious concern. Now all schools have been ordered to close in an effort to contain the outbreak. The first case, linked to a market, was recorded on Thursday and cases have been rising since then. Beijing had not seen any new cases for more than 50 days before this. Schools and universities reopened just a few weeks ago, but now classes will once again go online. Entertainment venues will also close, and people must be tested before they will be permitted to leave the capital. This video can not be played Boris Johnson thanks Marcus Rashford for school meal campaign More than a million schoolchildren in England will be able to claim free meal vouchers during the summer, the UK government has said. It followed acampaign championed by footballer Marcus Rashfordfor an existing scheme to be extended during the school holidays due to the coronavirus crisis. The government had previously insisted it would not award free school meals vouchers in England outside of term time, prompting the footballerto pen an open letterto MPs asking for the decision to be reversed. At the Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the Manchester United and England forward, 22, for his efforts. Earlier today, the head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine told MPs that requiring patients to have an appointment before attending hospital casualty departments may be necessary in the UK following the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Katherine Henderson told the Commons Health and Social Care Select
Committee that older people were those usually most in need of emergency treatment but they were also the age group most at risk from Covid-19. She said that emergency wards were used to having ""elastic walls""
and an ""infinite number of patients"" but that they now needed to know who was coming into A&E. Henderson told MPs that
NHS 111 could be the first port of call for those in urgent need who could then be given an appointment to attend hospital. She told the committee that is was ""just impossible"" to have an 80-year-old with a hip fracture left waiting in a corridor alongside a patient with suspected Covid-19.  Many restaurants and bars have remained open throughout the pandemic, with some social distancing introduced Sweden took a different approach to managing coronavirus than most countries - it avoided lockdown and kept many workplaces and social spaces open. Now there is an uptick in cases again in the Scandinavian country - a further 15,000 confirmed infections since the beginning of June, bringing the country's total to 53,000. The leading health official, Anders Tegnell, denied that it was a sign the virus was taking hold again. He put the rise down to an increase in testing. Nonetheless, he urged Swedes to minimise socialising during the upcoming midsummer celebrations. His critics accused him of arrogance for resisting a lockdown, but the country's death rate is better than some countries that introduced serious restrictions, including the UK, Spain and Italy. Nearly 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Sweden. Having been closed to the public for three months, London Zoo welcomed back its first visitors yesterday. The Zoological Society of London had warned it would face permanent closure if the government did not relax restrictions so it could allow the public back in. But the experience of visiting the zoo is now a little different to how it was before the pandemic. The attraction is only allowing 2,000 visitors to come each day, and they must have a pre-booked, timed-entry ticket. Restaurants and cafes are closed and additional hand sanitising stations and distance markers have been installed. This video can not be played Coronavirus: ZSL London Zoo reopens after lockdown The Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has confirmed that the US Open will take place in New York City's Queens borough but without any spectators. The US Tennis Association's (USTA) signature Grand Slam event is due to run from 31 August to 13 September. In a tweet, Cuomo said that organisers would ""take extraordinary precautions to protect players and staff, including robust testing, additional cleaning, extra locker room space, and dedicated housing & transportation"". Some players have already expressed concerns about playing in the tournament. The US Open is normally the fourth and final Grand Slam, but will be only the second this year. The French Open could now start just one week after the end of the US. Wimbledon was cancelled for the first time since 1945. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked
if the UK had banned the export of dexamethasone at today's Downing Street briefing. Itâs a cheap and widely
available drug which a trial at Oxford University has shown can save the lives
of patients who are severely ill with Covid-19 and need oxygen treatment. The prime minister said he wasnât
aware of the ban. On 24 April, dexamethasone,
in the form of tablets and capsules,was added to a list of medicines that cannot be exported from the UK or hoarded,external. And today dexamethasone, in
the form of oral solutions and injections, was also added to the list. According to the governmentâs
website, âexporting a medicine on the list is considered a breach of regulation
43(2) of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and a contraventionâ¦ may lead to
regulatory action by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA), which could include immediate suspension of the wholesale dealer
licence"". Thereâs more detail on the trial of dexamethasone here. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked whether the rules on attendance at funerals in England would be relaxed. At the moment the only mourners
allowed to attend are members of the deceased personâs household and close
family members or close friends if family members are unable to attend. Numbers must be kept low enough to
allow everybody to stay two metres apart. Someone to conduct the service, a
funeral director and other staff may also attend. The guidance for England says that
mourners who are self-isolating for 14 days but do not have symptoms should be
helped to attend, as should those in vulnerable groups who are shielding.
Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus should not attend. In Scotland the advice is slightly
different, with those self-isolating or shielding encouraged to seriously consider
not attending. In Wales, those allowed to attend the
funeral are the person organising it, people who have been invited and any
carers, with numbers again limited by the requirements of social distancing. The
guidance for Northern Ireland includes a limit of 10 mourners and stresses that
those who are self-isolating should not mix with other people attending. Reality Check The prime minister said at the Downing Street briefing that he
only became aware âtodayâ of footballer Marcus Rashfordâs campaign to make the
government change its mind on not extending free school meal vouchers in
England over the summer. The government has now
relented and says it will continue to run the scheme during the summer holiday and
Boris Johnson has congratulated the player. Marcus Rashford first raised his concerns on Twitter on 10 June when he
asked âAnybody know who I can talk to about the government food voucher
scheme?â Labour has also
been campaigning on the issue and sent a letter about it to Education
Secretary Gavin Williamson on 8 June. It was also raised in the House of
Commons on 9 June. In England, about
1.3 million children claimed free school meals in 2019, or about 15% of
state-educated pupils. Extending the scheme over the summer will cost around Â£120m. Thereâs more detail on how it will work and on whatâs happening across the UK in this piece.   Helen CattPolitical correspondent A bit of good news was what the government
really needed, as it faces pressure from its own backbenchers (and today, a
public questioner) on social distancing requirements and after its high profile U-turn on school meal vouchers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his weekly appearance
at the Downing Street briefing to deliver news about an unquestionably positive
development. He was very keen to point up the UK
expertise behind what he called the ""biggest breakthrough yet"" in
treating coronavirus. The scientists at today's press conference also seemed upbeat - excited
even - highlighting that the drug dexamethasone which could save the life of one in eight patients who experience serious breathing
problems is widely available and cheap. There was one note of caution in the
optimistic tone though - having a treatment doesn't necessarily mean less
stringent conditions for all of us if there is a second wave of the virus. And when it comes to that two-metre social
distancing rule, there does seem to be a hint of more wiggle room opening up, but Boris Johnson's message is still ""watch this space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson led todayâs government press conference. He was accompanied by the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford.

"Many of Pret's stores have already reopened with stores adapted for social distancing Bosses at restaurant and food chains including Wagamama and Pizza Hut have warned the prime minister the sector faces mass job cuts without more help. In a letter to Boris Johnson backed by 90 firms, they say that if social distancing remains they will need action on tax, rents and other support. Without more help, the sector faces ""grave damage"", the firms say. Deliveroo organised the letter, signed by its partner restaurants including Itsu and Pret A Manger. The companies, which together represent more than 1,000 outlets, praised government measures already introduced, but said more ""swift action"" was needed while two-metre separation requirements remained in place. The government has commissioned a comprehensive review into the two-metre rule, which the prime minister's official spokesman said on Monday would ""look at evidence around transmission of the virus in different environments, incidence rates and international comparisons"". Ministers havesaid the review will be completed ""in the coming weeks"". In the letter, the bosses write: ""Without government support to help restaurants to generate revenue and cover costs, tens of thousands of restaurants may be forced to permanently close their doors in the coming months. ""This crisis is far from over and the potential consequences are deeply concerning. A huge number of restaurants across the country are facing the prospect of bankruptcy."" The firms own outlets across the UK, but are likely to reopen them at different times. In Northern Ireland, restaurants and cafes can reopen from 3 July, and in England the day after. The Scottish government has outlined a phased approach to pubs and restaurants reopening but there is no date. Nor is there a date for Wales. Signatories include: Julian Metcalfe, founder and chief executive of Itsu Pano Christou, chief executive of Pret A Manger Emma Woods and Nigel Sherwood, chief executive and chief operating officer of Wagamama's Neil Manhas, general manager for Pizza Hut UK. The action called for includes slashing VAT on restaurant food and maintaining the Job Retention Scheme for restaurants while social distancing measures are in place. The chains also want ""mortgage holidays"" for landlords, so that this can be passed on in the form of lower rents, and an extension of the moratorium on evictions for as long as social distancing measures prevent restaurants from operating at full capacity. A government spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with the hospitality sector to develop safe ways for restaurants, bars and cafes to reopen as soon as we can from July. ""These businesses can continue to access our extensive package of support, including our job retention scheme which has been extended until October - meaning it will have been open for eight months and will continue to support businesses as the economy reopens and people return to work."" The spokesperson also pointed out that this was in addition to 100% business rates holidays, loans and tax deferrals. Thousands of UK jobs go in sweeping retail closures It's going to be hell after lockdown, says Wahaca Job losses 'just the tip of the iceberg' Many restaurant chains were in trouble before the coronavirus lockdown, which has only exacerbated the pressures. Last week, the owner of Frankie and Benny's, The Restaurant Group, became the latest big name to restructure, announcing 3,000 job cuts and 125 closures. A recent survey by Deliveroo found more than half of small and independent restaurants said they would have to close within three months without further support. ""Without government support to help restaurants to generate revenue and cover costs, tens of thousands of restaurants may be forced to permanently close their doors in the coming months,"" it said. The signatories pointed out that last year, customers spent Â£40bn in restaurants, supporting one million employees. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry trade body UK Hospitality, said: ""Household name brands on every High Street have been closed and many will be operating at well below capacity once lockdown ends. ""As these proposals from Deliveroo and their partner restaurants show, restaurants need urgent support from the government so that they can help rebuild economies and give people some much-needed enjoyment. Without it, some will close permanently and people's jobs will be lost.""

We'll be back tomorrow but, for now, thank you for joining us. BBC Newsbeat Georgina is a single parent with five children aged between three and 13. She lost her job as a carer during lockdown and has relied on vouchers to feed her family. She's described the U-turn over free school meals as ""amazing"" and takes the weight off her shoulders after she lost her job as a carer and had to claim benefits. ""To know that we're still going to get that money during the summer holidays is amazing,"" she told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat. ""The summer holidays were looking a little bit bleak if I'm honest. I can split money up on a weekly basis and make sure my children have got breakfast, a lunch and a dinner."" Described as the ""true jewel"" in Norwich's crown, the city's market has been on the same site since it was founded by the Normans in the 11th Century. Normally it boasts 189 stalls and plays an important part in the local economy, but then came the coronavirus lockdown and everything changed. Just over a year ago it was named the ""best large outdoor market in Britain"" but how is it coping with coronavirus restrictions - and can it survive? Stallholders have spoken to the BBC about the challenges they facein a wildly different economical climate. BBC Radio 5 Live A teenager whose family have used the safety net of food vouchers has expressed his delight that the government will fund them over the summer. Dev Sharma, a 15-year-old youth MP for Leicestershire, said the move was hugely important to him and his brother. ""It means the world to know that my mum and dad have now sufficient funds to feed [us] over six weeks,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I can now have access to a decent meal and be on the same level as my peers from more affluent backgrounds,"" he said. A shop owner has been left ""devastated"" by flooding on his first full day of trading after lockdown restrictions were eased. Dale Street in Milnrow, Rochdalewas ""completely flooded""when the River Beal rose rapidly on Monday evening. ""This can't carry on - it is the fifth flood in five years since the Boxing Day floods in 2015,"" said Philip Holt, who owns Carpet Creations. ""We're devastated but we'll dust ourselves down and reopen on Wednesday but we can't keep doing this."" Royal Ascot fans have been donning their finest threads and hats to take part in horse racing's biggest meeting from the comfort of their own homes. The coronavirus pandemic has meant the action is taking place behind closed doors with jockeys wearing face masks. However, ""virtual racegoers"" have kept up with the fun from home, using the hashtags #SharedWithThanks and #hatsfromhome to showcase their outfits on social media. Vicky O'Hagan, of Consett in Durham, and her mother, Dee, opted for a cleaning theme for their headwear. While Christopher Weatherstone, his mother Dawn, and sister Lucy, kept things classic in Rotherham in South Yorkshire, with a bow tie, dresses and fascinators. Ascot's organisers are encouraging racegoers to donate to four front-line charities. The National Emergencies Trust Relief Fund, NHS Charities Together, the Care Workers Charity and the Berkshire Community Foundation Coronavirus Fund, will all benefit. Footballer Marcus Rashford has been widely praised today for persuading the government to extend its free school meal voucher scheme in England, butwhat do the people of Wythenshawe think of their hometown hero? Christian Latimer's six-year-old daughter Mia has benefited from free schools meals during lockdown. The 27-year-old shop worker praised the footballer for his ""amazing"" campaign. ""He showed great fight and he has achieved so much in helping families who struggle to feed their children. ""As a United fan I thought he was great before but now he has shown the whole country what sort of a person he is off the pitch. ""I know he visits his old school and gives presents out to the kids. He is a great role model."" We have focused on Marcus Rashford's successful campaign to help children receive free school meals throughout the summer, but what else has happened around England today? Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit About 868,000 children in England went to school last Thursday, according to the latest data published this afternoon by the Department for Education. Although this was up by a third on the previous Thursday, it still means only 9% of children were in school. When lockdown was imposed only vulnerable pupils and the children of keyworkers were allowed to go in. Schools started to re-open to children in Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 on 8 June. Figures for this week, as some Year 10 and Year 12 pupils started to go back, should be shown in next week's data release. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent As a striker with a killer instinct in front of goal, Marcus Rashford is used to beating defences. And he's cut straight through a nervous defensive wall of Conservative ministers - leaving them wrong-footed and facing an embarrassing own goal. A number of Tory MPs had already voiced their disquiet - and how many of them really wanted to find themselves up against an England football hero, and the risk of children going hungry? The U-turn means the government will pay the extra Â£120m to extend free school meal vouchers across the six weeks of the holidays, available to 1.3 million children. It's a one-off deal for the unprecedented pressure caused by the coronavirus - with food banks warning of growing demands. But Rashford, and his 2.7 million Twitter followers, proved a tough target for the government - and he's beaten them with a fast-footed appeal directly to public opinion. BBC Radio 5 Live The government's change of heart on free school meals has been branded as ""wonderful"" by a woman relying on benefits due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sonja, from near Basingstoke, has three teenage children and has relied on benefits since finding herself out of work during lockdown. She does not start her new job until September. ""[The U-turn] takes away that worry of the six-week summer holiday and makes it so much less stressful,"" she told BBC 5live. But she added: ""I feel sad that it had to be a campaign. [The government has] been throwing money to keep everyone afloat but left behind people on universal credit and free school meals."" Katherine SellgrenBBC News The vast majority of teachers (90%) say their pupils are doing less or much less work than they would normally at this time of the year, a study finds. The report by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) says head teachers believe around a third of pupils are not engaging with set work.

"Marcus Rashford has renewed his calls for the school meal voucher scheme to be extended in England. The footballer asked others to think about struggling parents who have had their ""water turned off"" in lockdown, and whose children have gone hungry. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has been criticised for replying that ""water cannot be disconnected"". The Manchester United forward, 22, urged MPs to ""put rivalries aside"" in a Parliament debate on the subject later. Labour described Ms Coffey's comment as ""snarky"" while the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives questioned why the government has not yet U-turned on the plans. What's happening to free school meals this summer? Families react to school meal voucher row Families whose children qualify for free meals have received vouchers or parcels in lockdown. While provision is to continue through the summer in Scotland and Wales, it will stop at the end of term in England and Northern Ireland. Almost 1.3 million school children in England - accounting for 15.4% of state-educated pupils - were eligible for and claiming free school mealsaccording to the latest available data,external. Official figures for 2019 showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were getting the free meals. This video can not be played Man United's Rashford speaks about his mother's sacrifices When Ms Coffey replied to Mr Rashford's Twitter thread on the scheme, he said he was ""concerned"" she had only acknowledged his tweet about water being turned off. He urged her to help ""make a difference"". Labour deputy leaderAngela Rayner tweeted,external: ""We often couldn't afford hot water when I was growing up, I don't know if you've ever experienced poverty and being unable to pay the bills but as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions I would have expected better from you."" Ruth Davidson, an MSP and the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said she was ""baffled"" that the government had not already backtracked on the plans. ""Food security during the holidays so important. It's basic. Feed the kids,""she said on Twitter,external. The government says Â£63m is available to councils to help families. Mr Rashford urged Therese Coffey to help ""make a difference"" as work and pensions secretary In an emotional open letter to MPs posted on Monday, Mr Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. Mr Rashford, who grew up in Manchester, said his story was ""all too familiar for families in England"". The Department for Education said it would not reverse its decision - butthe England international said he would fight on, tweeting ""we aren't beaten yet"" and ""MPs, please #maketheUturn"". Hairdresser Jane Keen-Smith says she struggled to redeem the vouchers Jane Keen-Smith, a mother of four boys and a self-employed hairdresser, has seen her livelihood collapse during the lockdown. Underlying health conditions in the family - one son is severely disabled - mean she will be unable to work even once hairdressers are allowed to return next month. She told the BBC the Â£60 vouchers she receives each week make a ""massive difference"", saying the family will be ""stuck"" when they stop and she has no income. The mother from Pershore, Worcestershire, said she has had some help from friends and family - but teenage boys are ""bottomless hunger pits"" and her budget is extremely tight. ""We're basically struggling with everything"", she said, adding that having the vouchers over the summer would be ""a huge help"".

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said on Twitter that Conservatives have an opportunity to ""do the right thing"" to make sure ""children don't go hungry this summer"". But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted the government is ""not turning a blind eye"" to child poverty during the crisis, and defended its decision not to extend the voucher scheme. He told BBC Breakfast the government had been ""wrapping its arms around people in communities"" to do ""everything it possibly can"" to support them, including the Â£20bn spent on its furlough scheme and payments to local government bodies. He said No 10 had given an extra Â£63m to local authorities to help children during the pandemic, as well as a Â£129m investment ""that's already gone to families and schools as part of the process of helping children"".

Shadow education secretary Ms Long-Bailey said it was ""only right"" for the government to continue the scheme over the summer, so children don't go hungry and are in a position to start ""learning properly"" in September. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she asked ministers to ""just continue the free school meal voucher programme"" and pointing to Scotland and Wales, added: ""They are going to do this over the summer holidays for their children, so why can't the government in England do the same?"" Last week, three Conservative MPs signed a cross-party letter calling for an extension of the scheme - worth Â£15 for each child per week in England - into the summer holidays in England. David Simmonds, the Conservative MP and a member of the education select committee, said Mr Rashford's letter was ""incredibly powerful"" but the free school meals scheme, although ""popular"", is a ""very blunt instrument"" and it doesn't always get to the most vulnerable children. Citing figures from the Local Government Association that show a Â£3bn shortfall in the children's social care sector, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that pressure is ""building"" in the system and that there has been a ""massive increase"" in the number of children coming into care whose needs ""must come first"". He said the government needed to address the ""significant pressure"" on the system ""so the most vulnerable children in this country - of whom there are tens of thousands - are not left behind"". Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker also gave his support to Mr Rashford,saying he was a credit to the sport and his family. He told BBC Newsnight: ""He shouldn't really be the one having to do this, but... he's doing a great job."" The former England striker said he understood ""kids wouldn't ordinarily be fed during the summer holidays"", but these are ""very difficult times"". This video can not be played Gary Lineker: Marcus Rashford credit to his sport and his family Conservative MPs will have a chance to register their unease during the Commons debate, said Newsnight's Nicholas Watt. One Tory backbencher forecast an eventual government U-turn, he added.

Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland A donation of Â£250,000 to help fund women's football in Scotland will be a weight off a lot of people's minds, according to Scotland midfielder Leanne Crichton. Edinburgh philanthropist James Anderson gave the cashafter his Â£3m contribution to the menâs game last week. The money will go to the Scottish Football Partnership Trust to help sustain the womenâs game during the COVID-19 pandemic.  At the top end of the game we have fought this hard to get there and to stay there is the most difficult part. But there are so many young girls missing football, missing their friends and facing uncertainty with their clubs and resources. I just hope the focus will be on keeping the top end of our game alive but also more importantly making sure exactly what was there for the younger generation will still be there when we get back at it again. Leanne Crichton, Scotland midfielder Professor Devi Sridhar of Edinburgh University believes schools should ""reopen as normally as possible"" in August - if the number of new cases falls to less than 20 a day. But the global public health expert warned that to achieve this testing would need to be expanded to catch all cases in the community.  Allow Twitter content?

Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked if the UK had banned the export of dexamethasone at today's Downing Street briefing. It is a cheap and widely available drug that a trial at Oxford University has shown can save the lives of patients who are severely ill with Covid-19 and need oxygen treatment. The prime minister said he wasnât aware of the ban. On 24 April, dexamethasone, in the form of tablets and capsules,was added to a list of medicines that cannot be exported from the UK or hoarded,external. And today dexamethasone, in the form of oral solutions and injections, was also added to the list. According to the governmentâs website, âexporting a medicine on the list is considered a breach of regulation 43(2) of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and a contraventionâ¦ may lead to regulatory action by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which could include immediate suspension of the wholesale dealer licence"". More than 300 airport workers in Edinburgh and Glasgow have been put on notice of imminent redundancy. The Unite trade union said Menzies Aviation has started a 45-day consultation with staff.

""Dexamethasone is a steroid drug that brings the immune system under control and that's one of the observations we made early on in this pandemic - it's not the virus that does most of the damage in people who die,"" the Naked Scientist explains. ""The virus starts the ball rolling, but it's your immune system that finishes the job."" Dr Smith suggests the discovery by an Oxford University-led team ""is really important because, for the first time, we now have something to throw at this with confidence that is also very cheap, very readily available and also makes a big difference"". He points out that it can cut the death rate by up to 30%, which he compares with the previous drug adopted in the UK - remdesivir - ""that just dented the symptoms by maybe 30% but didn't affect the mortality at all"". Partick Thistle have accepted ""an extremely generous offer"" to fund a legal challenge to their relegation from the Scottish Championship by joining Heart of Midlothian in court. The Tynecastle club announced yesterday they had taken ""necessary steps"" to start proceedings against being demoted from the Premiership after last season was cut short by the Covid-19 pandemic. Thistle previously said they could not afford the six-figure legal costs. However, an offer to fund court action means they will ""launch a joint legal challenge"". Stranraer have also been demoted to League One, while Highland League champions Brora Rangers and Lowland League counterparts Kelty Hearts missed out on a chance to win promotion to League Two.

Dozens of hospitals in Scotland, coordinated by Prof Kenneth Baillie in Edinburgh, were part of a UK-wide team effort in the trial. Dr Baillie, who is  a clinical research fellow in anaesthesia and critical care, explains patients in hospital with Covid-19 could be treated with the drug as early as this evening. Describing the finding as ""absolutely stunning"", he says: ""I don't think I've had my breath taken away by a research finding quite like this one.

"Photo-sharing app Instagram is set to overtake Twitter as a news source, research suggests. The 2020 Reuters Institute Digital News report found the use of Instagram for news had doubled since 2018. The trend is strongest among young people. It said nearly a quarter of UK 18-24-year-olds used Instagram as a source of news about coronavirus. But social media platforms were also among the least-trusted sources. Just 26% of people said they trusted social media as a source of information about the virus. A similar percentage said they trusted news that had been shared via chat apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. National governments and news organisations, by contrast, were both trusted by about 59% of respondents. Instagram is now used by more than a third of all people who answered the survey, and two-thirds of under-25s. And 11% use it for news, putting it just one point behind Twitter. ""Instagram's become very popular with younger people"", said Nic Newman, lead author of the report. ""They really respond well to stories that are told simply and well with visual images"". Stand-out visual stories in recent months have helped - climate change, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the coronavirus have all seen massive engagement on the platform. ""It's not that one necessarily replaces the other,"" Mr Newman said. ""They might use Facebook and Instagram, or might use Twitter and Instagram."" Instagram is owned by Facebook, which now reaches 85% of people each week. The company's dominance in how stories are being told ""remains incredibly important"", he added. The firm also owns WhatsApp. The coronavirus pandemic also seems to have offered a temporary reprieve to a downward trend in how much news organisations are trusted. Only 38% of people said they trusted the news most of the time. Less than half - 46% - said they trusted their favoured news source. In total, 40 countries were surveyed. Only in six of them did a majority say they could trust ""most of the news most of the time"". The case was particularly poor in the UK, where only 28% of respondents backed the statement. That figure was 12 percentage points lower than the nation's response in the 2019 report. Trump to take 'big action' against social media Social media firms fail to act on Covid-19 fake news That plummet in confidence was only matched by Chile and Hong Kong, which have both seen violent street protests - and still rank more highly than the UK, on 30% each. But things changed substantially once the coronavirus crisis hit. A slightly differently worded question in April - about the level of trust in information about the coronavirus - saw news organisations surge to a 59% trust rating, on a par with national governments. The report's authors speculate the identical levels of trust as a result of news organisations amplifying public health advice. But that sudden high has already started to fall. Trust is a precious commodity for journalists which, like all social goods, is easily destroyed, but not easily created. Maintaining trust in the era of social media gets harder every day, as conspiracy theories go viral, accuracy is too often sacrificed at the altar of virality, and the very idea of truth is so contested. This report shows a curious paradox in relation to trust. It is true that trust in what is sometimes disparagingly referred to as mainstream journalism is falling; yet the huge audiences for those outlets at the start of the pandemic are nothing if not a verdict on the public appetite for reliable, trustworthy news. In Britain, with its regulated broadcasting, there is still a lot of it about. The deeper question is whether a young audience will consume it. Reuters show the remarkable growth of Instagram as a news source, which makes Facebook's purchase of it look ever more like one of the greatest bargains in history. If, as the authors predict, Instagram overtakes Twitter next year, that might be the moment for journalists to finally realise that the latter, though their favoured platform, resembles public opinion less and less. ""What we're seeing is relatively high levels of trust - at the time of the lockdowns - in the media and national governments. But we have some polling since then, which shows that trust in the media fell 11 percentage points between April and May,"" Mr Newman said. While not officially part of the report, that recent polling suggests that the ""moment of national unity"" may have passed. Amid all this analysis of trust issues, most people - what the report calls the ""silent majority"" - prefer what they consider ""objective"" news. The authors of the report had not asked this question since 2013, since when the use of opinion and open stances on news reporting has grown. In nine countries where this was explored, all said they preferred news from sources with ""no point of view"". The strongest preference was in Germany, Japan, the UK and Denmark. These are ""all countries with strong and independent public broadcasters"", the report noted. In contrast, the US - ""where both politics and the media have become increasingly partisan over the years"" - many more people said they prefer news which shares their point of view. Newsnight 'breached BBC impartiality guidelines' Sambrook to review BBC's use of social media BBC News, which contributed data to the study, remained the most trusted news brand in the UK, with 64% trust. ""Despite the fact that the BBC has come under a lot of criticism, what we find consistently is the BBC remains, with most people, highly trusted,"" Mr Newman said. ""[It], along with broadcasters like ITV, tends to be the most trusted. ""But obviously, we have seen that eroding - particularly with a particularly vocal minority on both left and right, that in the last few years have trusted the BBC less."" The decline is particularly marked in those on the political left. Since the 2019 election, the left saw their confidence in the news dive to just 15%, the report found.

"Kayleigh Rennix has applied for more than 100 jobs during lockdown Kayleigh Rennix has never struggled to find work before. The HR manager from Essex was earning close to Â£40,000 working in the education sector before she resigned in early March, fearing her role was at risk. Since then she's applied for dozens of jobs, but has had little interest from employers. ""As my leaving date approached, coronavirus reared its ugly head. I would say I've applied for more than 100 jobs and not had many call-backs,"" she says. Kayleigh had planned to find a new job quickly and restart work in May, after a holiday in Italy. But the coronavirus pandemic put paid to those plans. Now the 34-year-old has found herself relying on benefit payments for the first time in her life, and expects to move back in with her parents when her tenancy expires later in the summer. ""My rent is Â£900 a month and my universal credit is Â£740, so it's been quite stressful. I'm really grateful for relationships with my friends and family. My dad gave me some money for some food. It's been a rollercoaster really."" Kayleigh is among the millions of unemployed people who've found themselves looking for work duringthe UK's worst economic slump on record. Claims for universal credit, the benefit for working-age people,hit a record monthly levelin the early weeks of lockdown. There are fears young people could be the worst hit. Under-30s worst hit by lockdown financial squeeze 'We feel so lost' - Young face job despair Job-hunting tips for graduates, from the Class of 2008 Twenty-one-year-old Kevon McPherson of Hitchin, Hertfordshire has been looking for work since he moved out of his foster home in December. ""I've been applying for absolutely everywhere, from dog-walking jobs to becoming a care support worker looking after the elderly,"" he says. Jobcentre staff directed Kevon to a course with youth charity the Prince's Trust, which placed him with his local fire station. Kevon McPherson had plans to become a firefighter With his mind made up that a career in firefighting was for him, Kevon was preparing to take the necessary entrance exams and begin applying for firefighting positions when the Covid-19 outbreak put everything on hold. ""The firefighters were really happy to have me. I beat the instructors at the bleep test [for fitness],"" he says. ""They said, 'Once you've done your firefighting test, come back to us.' But once the coronavirus hit, I was told we'll pick it up later. I'm a bit worried."" Marcin Mazurkiewicz, 32, had just started a new job as a groundskeeper at a holiday park in Argyll in western Scotland when the UK went into lockdown in March. Because he'd only been in the role for one and a half weeks, Marcin's employer wasn't able to put him on furlough, so he went back to stay with family in Poland. He's spent the last month looking for work on UK farms - but found very few jobs. ""In the media, they said there is a massive demand for workers like this, but that doesn't seem to be true anymore,"" he says. ""I found one job for fruit picking one day after it was posted online, and there was information saying they were not taking any more applications because it was filled immediately. Marcin Mazurkiewicz has struggled to find work on a farm Marcin was finally offered a one-month contract tree pruning in Campbeltown, which he plans to accept if he can find suitable accommodation. But he's doubtful about finding long-term work in the UK. ""I'm very worried because my life is more in the UK than Poland. I want to return to education and stay there for good."" Marcin's difficulties finding farm work come as no surprise to Russ Rogers. He started a Facebook group hoping to connect people looking for work with jobs on British farms. He contacted more than 100 farms, but has only managed to provide positions for two of the 1,000 people who have joined his group, called UK Farm Pickers Needed. ""On a daily basis I get 10-15 messages through the group from people asking for work. I have a telephone number on the page so I have text messages day after day from people, and emails, people send me their CVs. ""I've basically had to say many times there just isn't anything at the moment, and that next season starts in July and they need to try then."" While demand for farm workers has slowed, there are some industries that have rapidly ramped up recruitment during the pandemic. Supermarkets have been on a hiring spree, as demand for groceries surged. With her business struggling, Claire Leaman says working at Tesco has paid the bills It's something Claire Leaman, 43, has taken advantage of. Before the coronavirus crisis, Claire ran her own business, offering business development services to property and construction firms. As the UK went into lockdown, her business lost two major clients and Claire panicked. She took a job at Tesco in south Manchester, ensuring there was a safe distance between customers in the aisles. Then the supermarket offered her a job as a picker filling online orders, which have doubled during the pandemic. Claire says the job has paid the bills, but she plans to leave as soon as she can get her business up and running again. ""In this job you're part of everything that's happening with the pandemic. You're a key worker and I suppose that's satisfying,"" she says. ""But it has been a little bit of a worry because you're around a vast amount of people and not everybody understands social distancing, so if I'm going to get the virus, I'm going to get it here, working at Tesco."" Stay open minded- be open to the different types of jobs available. Make your CV work hard for you- keep your CV current and make sure it shows off your strengths. Ask for advice- searching for jobs can be tough at the best of times. If you're feeling overwhelmed, ask for help; whether it's a friend, relative or an expert, talking about how you're feeling can help. Keep your mind active- it's easy to lose focus when you're searching for a job, but there are lots of free courses, articles and resources available online. Get yourself a mentor- getting an online mentor can help you with all things related to your job hunt.

"Some 300,000 more UK workers have been furloughed in the past week, raising the total to 8.7 million since the start of the coronavirus crisis. That means more than a quarter of the workforce is now being supported by the Â£14bn-a-month scheme. Another 200,000 self-employed have taken up government grants, meaning 2.5 million have been handed out. Meanwhile businesses have borrowed more than Â£31bn in government-backed loans to help survive the crisis. Last week, the schemes were extended to October by Chancellor Rishi Sunak. The jobs retention scheme was introduced in March to mitigate the effects of coronavirus. It allows employees to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to Â£2,500. Some Â£17.5bn has now been claimed by more than a million firms under the scheme, up from Â£15bn last week,government figures show,external. Last Friday, the government confirmed that furloughed workers would continue to get 80% of their pay until the end of October, but by then a fifth of their salary will have to be met by employers. ""Then, after eight months of this extraordinary intervention of the government stepping in to help pay people's wages, the scheme will close,"" Rishi Sunak said. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? Furlough scheme to finish at end of October Virus-hit self-employed to receive second payment The scheme is expected to have cost a total of about Â£80bn by the time it is shut down. But Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds warned last week about job losses when the government support schemes end. ""It is concerning that there is no commitment within these plans for support to only be scaled back in step with the removal of lockdown,"" she said. The Self-Employed Income Support Scheme pays a one-off grant of up to Â£7,500 amounting to 80% of average three-month profits. The 200,000 additional claims for that in the past seven days has cost the government Â£400m, to bring the total paid out to Â£7.2bn. Last week, the government confirmed that eligible self-employed workers would receivea second three-month payment under the scheme. However, it is slightly less generous, covering 70% of the applicant's average monthly trading profits. It will also be made in a single payment, covering three months and capped at Â£2,190 a month, or Â£6,570 in total. People whose work has been affected by coronavirus will still be able to apply for the lump sum until 13 July. VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

"Photo-sharing app Instagram is set to overtake Twitter as a news source, research suggests. The 2020 Reuters Institute Digital News report found the use of Instagram for news had doubled since 2018. The trend is strongest among young people. It said nearly a quarter of UK 18-24-year-olds used Instagram as a source of news about coronavirus. But social media platforms were also among the least-trusted sources. Just 26% of people said they trusted social media as a source of information about the virus. A similar percentage said they trusted news that had been shared via chat apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. National governments and news organisations, by contrast, were both trusted by about 59% of respondents. Instagram is now used by more than a third of all people who answered the survey, and two-thirds of under-25s. And 11% use it for news, putting it just one point behind Twitter. ""Instagram's become very popular with younger people"", said Nic Newman, lead author of the report. ""They really respond well to stories that are told simply and well with visual images"". Stand-out visual stories in recent months have helped - climate change, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the coronavirus have all seen massive engagement on the platform. ""It's not that one necessarily replaces the other,"" Mr Newman said. ""They might use Facebook and Instagram, or might use Twitter and Instagram."" Instagram is owned by Facebook, which now reaches 85% of people each week. The company's dominance in how stories are being told ""remains incredibly important"", he added. The firm also owns WhatsApp. The coronavirus pandemic also seems to have offered a temporary reprieve to a downward trend in how much news organisations are trusted. Only 38% of people said they trusted the news most of the time. Less than half - 46% - said they trusted their favoured news source. In total, 40 countries were surveyed. Only in six of them did a majority say they could trust ""most of the news most of the time"". The case was particularly poor in the UK, where only 28% of respondents backed the statement. That figure was 12 percentage points lower than the nation's response in the 2019 report. Trump to take 'big action' against social media Social media firms fail to act on Covid-19 fake news That plummet in confidence was only matched by Chile and Hong Kong, which have both seen violent street protests - and still rank more highly than the UK, on 30% each. But things changed substantially once the coronavirus crisis hit. A slightly differently worded question in April - about the level of trust in information about the coronavirus - saw news organisations surge to a 59% trust rating, on a par with national governments. The report's authors speculate the identical levels of trust as a result of news organisations amplifying public health advice. But that sudden high has already started to fall. Trust is a precious commodity for journalists which, like all social goods, is easily destroyed, but not easily created. Maintaining trust in the era of social media gets harder every day, as conspiracy theories go viral, accuracy is too often sacrificed at the altar of virality, and the very idea of truth is so contested. This report shows a curious paradox in relation to trust. It is true that trust in what is sometimes disparagingly referred to as mainstream journalism is falling; yet the huge audiences for those outlets at the start of the pandemic are nothing if not a verdict on the public appetite for reliable, trustworthy news. In Britain, with its regulated broadcasting, there is still a lot of it about. The deeper question is whether a young audience will consume it. Reuters show the remarkable growth of Instagram as a news source, which makes Facebook's purchase of it look ever more like one of the greatest bargains in history. If, as the authors predict, Instagram overtakes Twitter next year, that might be the moment for journalists to finally realise that the latter, though their favoured platform, resembles public opinion less and less. ""What we're seeing is relatively high levels of trust - at the time of the lockdowns - in the media and national governments. But we have some polling since then, which shows that trust in the media fell 11 percentage points between April and May,"" Mr Newman said. While not officially part of the report, that recent polling suggests that the ""moment of national unity"" may have passed. Amid all this analysis of trust issues, most people - what the report calls the ""silent majority"" - prefer what they consider ""objective"" news. The authors of the report had not asked this question since 2013, since when the use of opinion and open stances on news reporting has grown. In nine countries where this was explored, all said they preferred news from sources with ""no point of view"". The strongest preference was in Germany, Japan, the UK and Denmark. These are ""all countries with strong and independent public broadcasters"", the report noted. In contrast, the US - ""where both politics and the media have become increasingly partisan over the years"" - many more people said they prefer news which shares their point of view. Newsnight 'breached BBC impartiality guidelines' Sambrook to review BBC's use of social media BBC News, which contributed data to the study, remained the most trusted news brand in the UK, with 64% trust. ""Despite the fact that the BBC has come under a lot of criticism, what we find consistently is the BBC remains, with most people, highly trusted,"" Mr Newman said. ""[It], along with broadcasters like ITV, tends to be the most trusted. ""But obviously, we have seen that eroding - particularly with a particularly vocal minority on both left and right, that in the last few years have trusted the BBC less."" The decline is particularly marked in those on the political left. Since the 2019 election, the left saw their confidence in the news dive to just 15%, the report found.

"Wales' first minister wants to create a National Forest running the length of the country Wales is falling behind the rest of the UK in planting trees to tackle climate change, official statistics show. About 80 hectares of new woodland were planted in 2019-20, the lowest number for a decade. Forestry experts said the figure - which amounts to just 4% of the Welsh Government's target of 2,000 hectares a year - was ""clearly disappointing"". The government said it was taking ""significant steps"" to increase tree cover. Across the UK, 13,460 hectares of new woodland were created in 2019-20, according to provisional figures compiled by government-backed forestry organisations. Plan for trees across 'length of Wales' National Trust plan prompts farm fears This breaks down to 10,860 in Scotland, 2,330 in England, 200 in Northern Ireland and 80 in Wales. More than 80% of the new planting occurred in Scotland, heralded as ""outstanding"" by the Scottish Government though it too missed its annual target. In recent years, Welsh ministers have made several attempts to boost tree-planting rates here - including the launch ofa new woodland strategy,externalin 2018. The latest goal - a personal ambition of the First Minister Mark Drakeford - isto create a National Forest, running the length and breadth of the country. Meanwhile, advisers at the Committee on Climate Change and charities such as the Woodland Trust urged increasing planting targets to beyond 5,000 hectares a year. These latest figures underline the scale of the challenge, according to Rory Francis of the Woodland Trust in Wales. This video can not be played There are more than three billion trees in UK woods ""(They're) clearly disappointing, but we do understand that the Welsh Government has recently outlined ambitious plans for a Welsh National Forest and doubled the funding for Glastir Woodland Creation grants, both of which we hope will make a real difference."" He also said a ""new land-use policyâ¦ supporting tree planting in the right places"" was needed. Plans to replace the EU's agricultural subsidies with a new scheme that will includepaying farmers to plant treesis set to be phased in from 2021 - though it is yet to be finalised. Anthony Geddes, National Manager for Wales at CONFOR - which represents the forestry industry - added the figures were ""disappointing"" but represent ""the mistakes of the past not the opportunities of the future"". Woodlands are a common sight in some of the mountainous areas such as Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons ""We know there is high demand out there to plant trees and, thanks to hard work from all parties, the funding and the processes are falling into place to respond to that demand and get planting,"" he said. Mr Geddes pointed to the fact the Welsh Government received applications for more than 7,000 hectares of new planting in 2019 and, in response, ministers committed Â£8m to the Glastir woodland creation scheme - which gives grants for managing land. He said forestry and timber already contribute 10,000 jobs and bring in Â£0.5bn to the economy annually. About 150,000 native trees will be planted at Gnoll Country Park over the next five years, creating a woodland the same size as about 100 rugby pitches A spokesman for the Welsh Government said due to ""the timing of Rural Development Programme funding, funds made available last year will support tree planting in the upcoming planting season this winter"". ""Last year we funded the planting of 1,500 hectares of trees to re-stock existing woodland,"" he added. The spokesman said the government had also ""launched a new window of the Glastir Woodland Creation scheme, with a fourfold increase in the budget to Â£8m, which could significantly contribute to funding for 2,000 hectares of new planting"". ""Work has also begun to establish a National Forest across Wales,"" he said. ""Last week we launched a new scheme to create new woodlands near local communities. We will run a number of demonstration projects this year, including a Â£2.1m community woodland scheme launched earlier this month.""

"This video can not be played Workplace antibody tests 'will reassure' staff Companies are ""nervous"" about testing employees for coronavirus antibodies, according to the director of CBI Wales. Ian Price said there were ""legitimate"" tests available that employers can use but it was important to get it right. Some businesses hope to benefit from workers being tested to see if they have already had coronavirus, so providing the assurances for more to get back to work. The Welsh Government would decide how antibody tests are rolled out in Wales. The antibody test - involving testing drops of blood - has been viewed as a potential ""game-changer"" in tackling the virus as it would help understand who has had coronavirus and whether they have immunity. Stocks of ""home-kit"" antibody tests were being prepared to go on salebut were withdrawn.,external Public health officials have also been concerned that it could lead to people breaking measures like social distancing if they thought they had already had the virus. But work is continuing on developing a reliable test which can be mass produced. It is still not clear whether having had coronavirus gives a person immunity from catching it again. What tests are available in the UK for people with symptoms? Welsh factory to produce millions of antibody tests Covid antibody test a 'positive development' Businesses said antibody tests could help them as they bring people back to work, but only if the tests are proved to be reliable. Mr Price warns that if tests are not robust it could ""lead people into a false sense of security"". ""Within a business like mine we are quite naturally socially distant,"" said Hayley Pells, owner of Avia Autos in Bridgend. ""The advantage of that is that we have been able to remain safe and operate during the pandemic. Having something like testing in place, it would enable us to track and trace and contribute to the data that is needed to fight the virus. It would also reassure our team and get us back working."" Hayley Pells said she saw buying testing kits as an extension of her current provision of PPE ""With the transmission risk of the virus, although we are putting everything in place to reduce that risk by sanitising cars that come in and out, we do have to be mindful of the people who have to make essential travel,"" she said. ""Those on the front line that are exposed to the virus who desperately need their cars to get to work. We also have people who need their cars for treatment and they may have compromised immunity. It is up to us to make sure they are safe."" She said having testing freely available would increase reassurance for workers but also to suppliers and customers. ""Operating as a small business we already invest in our PPE. I would see buying testing kits as an extension of that PPE provision. If the testing could be available at a price I could afford I would definitely consider buying those kits in."" Andy Murdoch used to be a partner in the business but now works reduced hours for his daughter Hayley's father, Andy Murdoch, works for Avia but has been keeping away from the garage due to a long-term health issue. He'd like to be tested so he can go back to work. ""If you could get tested, if there was a reliable way of saying 'yes I'm fine', every day if you like - I'm not sure how often you would need to do it. Any reassurance is going to be good. For me, I'd go in tomorrow.""

It has brought in a series of safety measures, including mandatory hand washing when entering the building, split and staggered shifts, and temperature reading. Mark Christoffersen, director of manufacturing facilities believes tests might give the business more confidence and bring more people back into work. ""From a confidence point of view it would be really beneficial. Obviously the science has to support that, it has to be accurate. For us as a business that would be really important."" Mr Price, from CBI Wales, said it was important for companies to be clear about what they were getting into, before they started to test, ""There is some general nervousness around all these different tests that are out there at the moment. You can go on the internet and find all sorts of things. ""It does appear that there are some legitimate tests out there now that employers can use.""

"What is happening with the great majority of children who are missing out on school in England? That's not a random question - and, more puzzlingly, it's not one with an answer - because at the moment no-one really knows. Some parents might see their children learning from a dazzlingly digital, interactive version of the school day, while others will see their children putting in a long hard day on Netflix, with their schoolwork a fast-receding memory. There is no consistent approach or anyone even monitoring what's offered for the more than 90% of pupils who are not back in school. Disquiet about that is rising, not least among parents considering the time lost before important exams. It feels as though the changed world of Covid-19 has become semi-permanent, but the approach for schools seems stuck in the makeshift approaches of the first lockdown days in March. If schools have to spread out classes, how will all year groups be able to return in the autumn? That worked for a while - an online academy was rapidly put together, laptops were promised for the disadvantaged and teachers put in long hours and worked through their holidays to teach pupils online and keep schools open for key workers. But speaking privately, school leaders say they felt excluded from big decisions, such as how schools would begin to return. The date 1 June had been in discussion for many weeks for a phased return, but when it was also announced that all primary years would return by the end of term, many head teachers immediately warned that with social distancing that it was never going to happen. It felt as though political announcements and the realities of classroom capacity had parted ways - and things began to drift. Instead of taking common ownership of a shared plan, teachers' and head teachers' union leaders found themselves uncertain whether there even was a plan. Summer catch-up plan pledged by PM Plan for all primary pupils to return dropped Growing calls for cut in 2m social distancing The ditching of proposals to bring back all primary children this week suddenly cast a hard cold light on how long most pupils would be out of school. The government has been performing its own balancing act - on the one hand accused by teachers' unions of risking safety by going back to school too soon, while also being under pressure from some parents and employers for not going back quickly enough. Next week it will try to extricate itself with a promise of summer clubs and catch-up classes. But no matter how big the back of the envelope on which these ideas will be written, it will still be about looking after and supporting children in a temporary way, and not regular lessons with their own teachers. How will pupils catch up on lost time for next summer's exams? But the really big decision and the most difficult question for schools is what happens in September - will pupils be able to go back in any way that resembles a regular school day? This is only 10 weeks away - less time than since the lockdown started - and there are already warnings that if schools are going to have any chance to get ready, decisions will have to be made very soon. And many parents will be worried at the prospect of more temporary timetables and online lessons stretching over the horizon. If the 2m social distance is still in place in September, perhaps only half of pupils could return at any one time, maybe not even that many. The lack of space that derailed the return of primary classes would apply to secondary years too. That would mean rotas and part-time lessons into the autumn, with all the disruption to learning and to parents wanting to get back to work. Will the return to school still be part-time in September? Even if the 2m rule is lowered to 1m, some schools warn they will struggle to accommodate all their children. There has been talk of taking over church halls and empty buildings close to schools - and it might work in some instances - but many would struggle with the safety issues of creating instant classrooms in nearby sites for hundreds of children each day. A heads' leader says it's hard enough finding teachers in regular times, so how would they hire an entire parallel staff in a few weeks? And that's before the challenges of deciding what to do about A-levels and GCSEs when such a large chunk of the year has been missed. A change on social distancing could make a difference to how many could be taught. But schools are clamouring for a strategy, and one they can help to shape rather than hearing it announced on television, that would allow them to get ready for a return to school, in whatever form that now might take. Parents brought home their children in March in a great moment of collective uncertainty. Three months later they need much clearer answers about what happens next.

"The number of workers on UK payrolls dived more than 600,000 by May compared to before lockdown, official figures suggest. The number of people claiming work-related benefits, which includes the unemployed, was up 126% to 2.8 million. The early estimates reflect the impact of around six weeks of lockdown in which large parts of the UK were shut. But economists say the full effect on employment will not be felt until wage support schemes end in October. ""The slowdown in the economy is now visibly hitting the labour market, especially in terms of hours worked,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics (ONS)."" NI unemployment more than doubles in two months Scotland's unemployment rate highest in UK Number claiming benefits in Wales doubles Seven charts on the coronavirus jobs market Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the Trades Union Congress, said the labour market was ""on red alert"". ""We need strong action now to stop lasting economic damage,"" she added. Separate figures published by HMRC on Tuesday showed that a total of 9.1 million workers are having their wages paid through the government's furlough scheme - more than a quarter of the workforce. Overall, the official UK unemployment rate for the three months to April held steady at 3.9% as the massive state wage support in place stopped job losses. Reflecting that, the ONS said the total number of weekly hours worked in the period dropped to 959.9 million - down by a record 94.2 million, or 9%, on the previous year. However, the agency said that early estimates from the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system showed that the number of payroll employees fell by 612,000, or 2.1%  in May compared to March, when lockdown was implemented. And it said there had been a record fall in job vacancies in that period to 476,000 - down 342,000 from the previous quarter - hinting at worse to come. Capital Economics economist Ruth Gregory said it was ""abundantly clear"" that the labour market had weakened dramatically. ""Some of this will surely start to filter through into the actual unemployment figures as the government's job furlough scheme is wound down from August."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, agreed: ""The furlough scheme continues to hold off the bulk of job losses, but unemployment is likely to surge in the months ahead."" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, warned that many businesses were expected to bring only part of their furloughed workforce back, while they sought to tentatively reopen after the lockdown. ""Hiring new workers is also likely to be put on hold for some time,"" she said. Kayleigh Rennix has never struggled to find work before. The HR manager from Essex was earning close to Â£40,000 working in the education sector before she resigned in March, fearing her role was at risk. Since then she's applied for dozens of jobs, but has had little interest from employers. ""As my leaving date approached, coronavirus reared its ugly head. I would say I've applied for more than 100 jobs and not had many call-backs,"" she says. Now the 34-year-old has found herself relying on benefit payments for the first time in her life, and expects to move back in with her parents when her tenancy expires later in the summer. Read more here Some economists believe unemployment could hit 10% - a rate not since since the mid-1990s - as social distancing rules remain in place and consumers curb their spending. The Institute of Employment Studies (IES), an apolitical think tank, pointed out that the number of claims for work benefits had risen 1.6 million since March - a rate faster, it says, than during the Great Depression of 1929. At the same time, it says there are eight unemployed people are chasing every job vacancy in the UK - up from just two before the crisis. ""It's clear too that this crisis is hitting many poorer areas hardest - with coastal towns and ex-industrial areas seeing particularly big increases in unemployment,"" said director Tony Wilson. The IES said among the worst hit areas of the UK were: Blackpool, where one in eight residents is claiming work related benefits Thanet in Kent, where the rate stands at one in eleven And Birmingham, where the rate is also one in eleven. The headline quarterly employment and unemployment numbers remain barely changed, as all the furloughed workers count as having jobs. The furlough scheme is working in suppressing unemployment and protecting livelihoods so far, the real test of its functioning is what happens now. The test of it will be whether those jobs remain as the taxpayer wage support is eased away. It requires the government to inject as much confidence as possible, into the minds of employers facing uncertainty and declining bank balances. But further rescue package and employment support will be required too. The balancing act with the pandemic remains as delicate as ever. As one Cabinet minister puts it - ""we need to restart the economy, without restarting the virus"". This video can not be played Restaurant chain owner: 'It's the worst news you can give as an employer' A swathe of businesses have announced job cuts as the economy has contracted sharply due to the pandemic, opting not to furlough those workers instead. Examples include: The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie and Benny's, which expects to cut up to 3,000 workers The UK's biggest builders' merchant, Travis Perkins, which plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. British Airways, which expects to cut 12,000 jobs BP, which is slashing 10,000 jobs worldwide And jet engine-maker Rolls-Royce is cutting 9,000 jobs, mainly in the UK. Bosses in sectors such as car making, aviation and hospitality have warned there could be many further cuts without additional government support. In normal times, the employment rate tells you most of what you need to know about jobs. But these are not normal times. With the furloughing scheme keeping people employed, if not working, we have to look elsewhere to get a picture of what's happening. It's like building a jigsaw, but with pieces from different boxes: surveys, payroll data, jobs advertised, three-month trends and even looking at week-on-week changes. The picture it builds is different to the headline employment figure but perhaps not surprising: Serious pressure on jobs during lockdown. Last week, the ONS revealedthe UK economy shrank by a 20.4% in April- the largest monthly contraction on record - as the country spent its first full month in lockdown. That is three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. Britain's economy is likely to slump by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy,the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned. Meanwhile, the latest furlough figures from HMRC indicate that more than a quarter of the UK workforce is having 80% of their monthly wages, up to Â£2,500, paid by the government, while they are temporarily off work. Their employer, which chooses whether or not to furlough workers, can top up the remaining 20% if it wishes. The Treasury also said there had been 2.6 million claims for support grants from the self-employed. The Prime Minister's spokesman said: ""We are seeing the impact of coronavirus on our economy, as is the case in many countries.

"Snowdonia remains out of bounds to visitors, unless they are local For the last three months large swathes of one of Britain's national park crown jewels has been shut to the public. Walkers have been barred from Snowdon and popular peaks, such as Tryfan or Cader Idris. Once flowing with visitors, summits remain forlorn, only viewed from afar by those lucky enough to live nearby. Now, those tasked with caring for the park are looking at how they can reopen. For others, it is a time to ask - can we reopen differently? They want to avoid the scenes that heralded lockdown back in March, when on the final weekend of the month, as coronavirus began to spread across the UK,roads to Snowdon and surrounding villages were crammed with cars, as visitors flocked to the beauty spots that make the park so special. There will be no Snowdonia Marathon in 2020 - it has been moved to next year BBC Wales has been told that organisers of events planned across the 823 sq miles (2,176 sq km) of park have been asked to postpone until 2021. The Snowdonia Marathon has already announced itsrace will be moved to next year. Lockdown has meant fewer visitors - and fines for those who breach the rules to travel to the region. It has also meant real pain for those relying on the park and tourism for a living - with cafes, B&Bs, hotels, restaurants and non-essential shops shut. Ready to go: Emlyn Roberts is eager to reopen his bistro in Beddgelert But coming out of lockdown too soon carries its own risks as Emlyn Roberts, owner of Bistro Hebog in Beddgelert, acknowledged: ""We've got everything in place, we're ready to go, our staff are eager. ""I'm also cautious that opening the gates to Wales too soon, too fast, could jeopardise everything. ""But I'm really keen to move on and, after all, it's a great place to do business.  The business is there, it's just a matter of waiting to see when."" ON THE BRINK:Tourism, Wales and Covid-19 WHAT'S ON AND WHAT'S GONE:Events in Wales during coronavirus CONTACT TRACING:When the phone rings - and it's you FIGURING OUT THE NUMBERS:What do the stats tell us? Elin Aaron runs the Gallt y Glyn hostel in Llanberis, a popular spot for hikers and locals. ""There's the conflict between wanting my business to be successful and to be here after the restrictions open, but also wanting to keep the community and my family safe - I've grown up in the area,"" she said. ""The balance of getting everything right - I don't envy whoever has to make the decision about when we can open, but it'd be nice to know so I can plan."" Hostel and restaurant owner Elin Aaron says there needs to be a balance for business and the area Parts of Wales' two other national parks - the Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons - have already reopened to locals.  As they look to the future, could the Snowdonia National Park Authority look at a different, more low-impact, model of tourism? John Harold thinks so. He is the director of the Snowdonia Society, a key partner of the park authority, established in 1967 by Esme Kirby and her husband Peter to protect the fragile mountain environment. ""This break, this time of people really rethinking things, gives us a chance to reset expectations,"" he said. ""Our expectations of what visitors will do and how they will behave when they're here, and visitors' expectations of what their experience will be - and that could be a positive change. ""It's a massive challenge of communication. We need to get the message out as widely as possible that - with a national park that's under pressure, doesn't have massive resources - we need everyone to play their part, be respectful and tread lightly."" Still shut - the paths to the summit of Snowdon are closed to the public Gwynedd council has confirmed to BBC Wales that they have asked event organisers in the area to postpone all events until next year. In a statement, the council said: ""Due to the unprecedented situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Gwynedd Safety Advisory Group have sent letters to all event organisers in the county. ""The message makes it clear that Gwynedd welcomes and supports events in the county, but under current conditions are encouraging organisers to postpone events which are due to take place in the next few months to ensure the safety and wellbeing of participants and local communities, as well as to avoid expenditure by event organisers during such an uncertain time. ""This is based on the current medical evidence and the likelihood that restrictions will remain in place for some time - especially regarding crowd events."" The Snowdonia National Park Authority has already indicated it will adopt a cautious approach to reopening the area. Expect only ""minor changes"" to lockdown rules in coming weeks, aimed at the local populations. Access to internationally famous locations will be some time off. Park officials said reopening Snowdonia would be ""cautious and measured and will be phased"". ""Our utmost priority has been, and remains, to protect our local communities and health services,"" it added.

"Wales' first minister wants to create a National Forest running the length of the country Wales is falling behind the rest of the UK in planting trees to tackle climate change, official statistics show. About 80 hectares of new woodland were planted in 2019-20, the lowest number for a decade. Forestry experts said the figure - which amounts to just 4% of the Welsh Government's target of 2,000 hectares a year - was ""clearly disappointing"". The government said it was taking ""significant steps"" to increase tree cover. Across the UK, 13,460 hectares of new woodland were created in 2019-20, according to provisional figures compiled by government-backed forestry organisations. Plan for trees across 'length of Wales' National Trust plan prompts farm fears This breaks down to 10,860 in Scotland, 2,330 in England, 200 in Northern Ireland and 80 in Wales. More than 80% of the new planting occurred in Scotland, heralded as ""outstanding"" by the Scottish Government though it too missed its annual target. In recent years, Welsh ministers have made several attempts to boost tree-planting rates here - including the launch ofa new woodland strategy,externalin 2018. The latest goal - a personal ambition of the First Minister Mark Drakeford - isto create a National Forest, running the length and breadth of the country. Meanwhile, advisers at the Committee on Climate Change and charities such as the Woodland Trust urged increasing planting targets to beyond 5,000 hectares a year. These latest figures underline the scale of the challenge, according to Rory Francis of the Woodland Trust in Wales. This video can not be played There are more than three billion trees in UK woods ""(They're) clearly disappointing, but we do understand that the Welsh Government has recently outlined ambitious plans for a Welsh National Forest and doubled the funding for Glastir Woodland Creation grants, both of which we hope will make a real difference."" He also said a ""new land-use policyâ¦ supporting tree planting in the right places"" was needed. Plans to replace the EU's agricultural subsidies with a new scheme that will includepaying farmers to plant treesis set to be phased in from 2021 - though it is yet to be finalised. Anthony Geddes, National Manager for Wales at CONFOR - which represents the forestry industry - added the figures were ""disappointing"" but represent ""the mistakes of the past not the opportunities of the future"". Woodlands are a common sight in some of the mountainous areas such as Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons ""We know there is high demand out there to plant trees and, thanks to hard work from all parties, the funding and the processes are falling into place to respond to that demand and get planting,"" he said. Mr Geddes pointed to the fact the Welsh Government received applications for more than 7,000 hectares of new planting in 2019 and, in response, ministers committed Â£8m to the Glastir woodland creation scheme - which gives grants for managing land. He said forestry and timber already contribute 10,000 jobs and bring in Â£0.5bn to the economy annually. About 150,000 native trees will be planted at Gnoll Country Park over the next five years, creating a woodland the same size as about 100 rugby pitches A spokesman for the Welsh Government said due to ""the timing of Rural Development Programme funding, funds made available last year will support tree planting in the upcoming planting season this winter"". ""Last year we funded the planting of 1,500 hectares of trees to re-stock existing woodland,"" he added. The spokesman said the government had also ""launched a new window of the Glastir Woodland Creation scheme, with a fourfold increase in the budget to Â£8m, which could significantly contribute to funding for 2,000 hectares of new planting"". ""Work has also begun to establish a National Forest across Wales,"" he said. ""Last week we launched a new scheme to create new woodlands near local communities. We will run a number of demonstration projects this year, including a Â£2.1m community woodland scheme launched earlier this month.""

Join us again tomorrow. And here's the round-up of coronavirus news stories in the UK. As our live page draws to a close, here are the major world events linked to coronavirus for Tuesday: The top story was really a UK story - the breakthrough in the medical world with the drug dexamethasone, which can save the lives of seriously ill coronavirus patients. But the other top stories globally have been: There are fewer very happy Americans than at any point in nearly 50 years, according to a new survey. The new poll was released by theNational Opinion Research Center,externalat the University of Chicago and used data from the General Social Survey (GSS) data. It found that only 14% of Americans described themselves as very happy. In 2018, the last time the poll was conducted, it was 31%. The GSS has collected data every other year since 1972. The previous low point came in 2010 when 29% of Americans said they were very happy. Currently, 50% of people say they sometimes feel isolated, compared to 23% in 2018. The numbers are somewhat unsurprising, given the lockdowns that have separated communities and led to social isolation. The survey was conducted in May, before the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, which touched off protests across the nation and world. London club Chelsea are 0-3 down to Bayern Munich in the Champions League last-16 European football chiefs look set to finalise plans to finish this season's Champions League and Europa League over the next 24 hours. Uefa's executive committee is expected to announce that Portugal and Germany will host a ""final eight"" knockout tournament for each competition. However, there has been disagreement about how the outstanding last-16 ties in the competitions are to be resolved. BBC Sport have been previewing the plans ahead of the committee's crunch meeting on Wednesday.Read more here. The Duke of Cambridge has joked that he is looking forward to having a pint in the pub, as he praised ambulance staff for their hard work during the pandemic. In his first face-to-face meeting with the public in months, the prince told ambulance crews at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Norfolk he thought the weekly Clap for Carers - when people across the UK stood on their doorsteps to applaud the country's NHS staff and key workers - was ""powerful"". ""Everyone appreciates the NHS, we have an amazing system and many countries around the world envy what we have,"" he told them. In a lighter moment, he joked he was looking forward to being told he could go to the pub again and shared his worry for the country's waistline. ""I've done a lot of baking at home - chocolate goes down very well,"" he said. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released a new video explaining the risks of passing the coronavirus to your household pet. The video, which is spliced with cute cats and dogs around their mask-wearing owners, advises that the chance of catching Covid-19 from a pet is ""considered low"". ""But it does appear that people can give the virus to animals,"" it continues, adding that cats and ferrets are most likely to get infected. Cats should be kept indoors and dogs should be walked on a leash, according to the FDA guidance. Pets should only be allowed to interact with members of their own households. If you do become infected, the FDA advises that you find someone else to watch your pet until you are better. If that isn't possible, then you should wear a mask around your pet, and wash your hands both before and after playing with them. Allow YouTube content?

Health workers protested in French cities including Paris, Strasbourg and Nice Thousands of doctors, nurses and hospital staff in France have been protesting to demand more investment in the health system. Like in many countries, the French public expressed their significant gratitude and support to medics during the pandemic - now health workers want this to be followed with more resources. Around 18,000 people attended the protests in Paris, which ended with violent action by a small group who threw stones and overturned a car. Police made 20 arrests. Unions are asking for pay rises, a recruitment drive and more beds in hospitals, and say Covid-19 exposed the weaknesses of the French health service. President Emmanuel Macron says his government is three weeks into a consultation and has announced bonuses for staff who worked through the crisis. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Patient credits dexamethasone with saving her life We've been hearing a lot about the drug dexamethasone, which has been found in a medical trial to cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. Briton Katherine Millbank took part in the trials and credits the drug with saving her life. An emotional Mrs Millbank has been telling the BBC about her experience. A Beijing official warned the new outbreak - linked to an open air market - is ""extremely severe"" Earlier we reported that a cluster of new cases connected to a Beijing market in China is causing serious concern. Now all schools have been ordered to close in an effort to contain the outbreak. The first case, linked to a market, was recorded on Thursday and cases have been rising since then. Beijing had not seen any new cases for more than 50 days before this. Schools and universities reopened just a few weeks ago, but now classes will once again go online. Entertainment venues will also close, and people must be tested before they will be permitted to leave the capital. This video can not be played Boris Johnson thanks Marcus Rashford for school meal campaign More than a million schoolchildren in England will be able to claim free meal vouchers during the summer, the UK government has said. It followed acampaign championed by footballer Marcus Rashfordfor an existing scheme to be extended during the school holidays due to the coronavirus crisis. The government had previously insisted it would not award free school meals vouchers in England outside of term time, prompting the footballerto pen an open letterto MPs asking for the decision to be reversed. At the Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the Manchester United and England forward, 22, for his efforts. Earlier today, the head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine told MPs that requiring patients to have an appointment before attending hospital casualty departments may be necessary in the UK following the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Katherine Henderson told the Commons Health and Social Care Select
Committee that older people were those usually most in need of emergency treatment but they were also the age group most at risk from Covid-19. She said that emergency wards were used to having ""elastic walls""
and an ""infinite number of patients"" but that they now needed to know who was coming into A&E. Henderson told MPs that
NHS 111 could be the first port of call for those in urgent need who could then be given an appointment to attend hospital. She told the committee that is was ""just impossible"" to have an 80-year-old with a hip fracture left waiting in a corridor alongside a patient with suspected Covid-19.  Many restaurants and bars have remained open throughout the pandemic, with some social distancing introduced Sweden took a different approach to managing coronavirus than most countries - it avoided lockdown and kept many workplaces and social spaces open. Now there is an uptick in cases again in the Scandinavian country - a further 15,000 confirmed infections since the beginning of June, bringing the country's total to 53,000. The leading health official, Anders Tegnell, denied that it was a sign the virus was taking hold again. He put the rise down to an increase in testing. Nonetheless, he urged Swedes to minimise socialising during the upcoming midsummer celebrations. His critics accused him of arrogance for resisting a lockdown, but the country's death rate is better than some countries that introduced serious restrictions, including the UK, Spain and Italy. Nearly 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Sweden. Having been closed to the public for three months, London Zoo welcomed back its first visitors yesterday. The Zoological Society of London had warned it would face permanent closure if the government did not relax restrictions so it could allow the public back in. But the experience of visiting the zoo is now a little different to how it was before the pandemic. The attraction is only allowing 2,000 visitors to come each day, and they must have a pre-booked, timed-entry ticket. Restaurants and cafes are closed and additional hand sanitising stations and distance markers have been installed. This video can not be played Coronavirus: ZSL London Zoo reopens after lockdown The Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has confirmed that the US Open will take place in New York City's Queens borough but without any spectators. The US Tennis Association's (USTA) signature Grand Slam event is due to run from 31 August to 13 September. In a tweet, Cuomo said that organisers would ""take extraordinary precautions to protect players and staff, including robust testing, additional cleaning, extra locker room space, and dedicated housing & transportation"". Some players have already expressed concerns about playing in the tournament. The US Open is normally the fourth and final Grand Slam, but will be only the second this year. The French Open could now start just one week after the end of the US. Wimbledon was cancelled for the first time since 1945. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked
if the UK had banned the export of dexamethasone at today's Downing Street briefing. Itâs a cheap and widely
available drug which a trial at Oxford University has shown can save the lives
of patients who are severely ill with Covid-19 and need oxygen treatment. The prime minister said he wasnât
aware of the ban. On 24 April, dexamethasone,
in the form of tablets and capsules,was added to a list of medicines that cannot be exported from the UK or hoarded,external. And today dexamethasone, in
the form of oral solutions and injections, was also added to the list. According to the governmentâs
website, âexporting a medicine on the list is considered a breach of regulation
43(2) of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and a contraventionâ¦ may lead to
regulatory action by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA), which could include immediate suspension of the wholesale dealer
licence"". Thereâs more detail on the trial of dexamethasone here. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked whether the rules on attendance at funerals in England would be relaxed. At the moment the only mourners
allowed to attend are members of the deceased personâs household and close
family members or close friends if family members are unable to attend. Numbers must be kept low enough to
allow everybody to stay two metres apart. Someone to conduct the service, a
funeral director and other staff may also attend. The guidance for England says that
mourners who are self-isolating for 14 days but do not have symptoms should be
helped to attend, as should those in vulnerable groups who are shielding.
Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus should not attend. In Scotland the advice is slightly
different, with those self-isolating or shielding encouraged to seriously consider
not attending. In Wales, those allowed to attend the
funeral are the person organising it, people who have been invited and any
carers, with numbers again limited by the requirements of social distancing. The
guidance for Northern Ireland includes a limit of 10 mourners and stresses that
those who are self-isolating should not mix with other people attending. Reality Check The prime minister said at the Downing Street briefing that he
only became aware âtodayâ of footballer Marcus Rashfordâs campaign to make the
government change its mind on not extending free school meal vouchers in
England over the summer. The government has now
relented and says it will continue to run the scheme during the summer holiday and
Boris Johnson has congratulated the player. Marcus Rashford first raised his concerns on Twitter on 10 June when he
asked âAnybody know who I can talk to about the government food voucher
scheme?â Labour has also
been campaigning on the issue and sent a letter about it to Education
Secretary Gavin Williamson on 8 June. It was also raised in the House of
Commons on 9 June. In England, about
1.3 million children claimed free school meals in 2019, or about 15% of
state-educated pupils. Extending the scheme over the summer will cost around Â£120m. Thereâs more detail on how it will work and on whatâs happening across the UK in this piece.   Helen CattPolitical correspondent A bit of good news was what the government
really needed, as it faces pressure from its own backbenchers (and today, a
public questioner) on social distancing requirements and after its high profile U-turn on school meal vouchers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his weekly appearance
at the Downing Street briefing to deliver news about an unquestionably positive
development. He was very keen to point up the UK
expertise behind what he called the ""biggest breakthrough yet"" in
treating coronavirus. The scientists at today's press conference also seemed upbeat - excited
even - highlighting that the drug dexamethasone which could save the life of one in eight patients who experience serious breathing
problems is widely available and cheap. There was one note of caution in the
optimistic tone though - having a treatment doesn't necessarily mean less
stringent conditions for all of us if there is a second wave of the virus. And when it comes to that two-metre social
distancing rule, there does seem to be a hint of more wiggle room opening up, but Boris Johnson's message is still ""watch this space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson led todayâs government press conference. He was accompanied by the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford.

"Marcus Rashford has renewed his calls for the school meal voucher scheme to be extended in England. The footballer asked others to think about struggling parents who have had their ""water turned off"" in lockdown, and whose children have gone hungry. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has been criticised for replying that ""water cannot be disconnected"". The Manchester United forward, 22, urged MPs to ""put rivalries aside"" in a Parliament debate on the subject later. Labour described Ms Coffey's comment as ""snarky"" while the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives questioned why the government has not yet U-turned on the plans. What's happening to free school meals this summer? Families react to school meal voucher row Families whose children qualify for free meals have received vouchers or parcels in lockdown. While provision is to continue through the summer in Scotland and Wales, it will stop at the end of term in England and Northern Ireland. Almost 1.3 million school children in England - accounting for 15.4% of state-educated pupils - were eligible for and claiming free school mealsaccording to the latest available data,external. Official figures for 2019 showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were getting the free meals. This video can not be played Man United's Rashford speaks about his mother's sacrifices When Ms Coffey replied to Mr Rashford's Twitter thread on the scheme, he said he was ""concerned"" she had only acknowledged his tweet about water being turned off. He urged her to help ""make a difference"". Labour deputy leaderAngela Rayner tweeted,external: ""We often couldn't afford hot water when I was growing up, I don't know if you've ever experienced poverty and being unable to pay the bills but as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions I would have expected better from you."" Ruth Davidson, an MSP and the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said she was ""baffled"" that the government had not already backtracked on the plans. ""Food security during the holidays so important. It's basic. Feed the kids,""she said on Twitter,external. The government says Â£63m is available to councils to help families. Mr Rashford urged Therese Coffey to help ""make a difference"" as work and pensions secretary In an emotional open letter to MPs posted on Monday, Mr Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. Mr Rashford, who grew up in Manchester, said his story was ""all too familiar for families in England"". The Department for Education said it would not reverse its decision - butthe England international said he would fight on, tweeting ""we aren't beaten yet"" and ""MPs, please #maketheUturn"". Hairdresser Jane Keen-Smith says she struggled to redeem the vouchers Jane Keen-Smith, a mother of four boys and a self-employed hairdresser, has seen her livelihood collapse during the lockdown. Underlying health conditions in the family - one son is severely disabled - mean she will be unable to work even once hairdressers are allowed to return next month. She told the BBC the Â£60 vouchers she receives each week make a ""massive difference"", saying the family will be ""stuck"" when they stop and she has no income. The mother from Pershore, Worcestershire, said she has had some help from friends and family - but teenage boys are ""bottomless hunger pits"" and her budget is extremely tight. ""We're basically struggling with everything"", she said, adding that having the vouchers over the summer would be ""a huge help"". Read more: Families fear being 'left with zero' During the Commons debate on the issue later, Labour will say it would be ""callous"" not to take what it will call a ""small step"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said on Twitter that Conservatives have an opportunity to ""do the right thing"" to make sure ""children don't go hungry this summer"". But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted the government is ""not turning a blind eye"" to child poverty during the crisis, and defended its decision not to extend the voucher scheme. He told BBC Breakfast the government had been ""wrapping its arms around people in communities"" to do ""everything it possibly can"" to support them, including the Â£20bn spent on its furlough scheme and payments to local government bodies. He said No 10 had given an extra Â£63m to local authorities to help children during the pandemic, as well as a Â£129m investment ""that's already gone to families and schools as part of the process of helping children"".

Shadow education secretary Ms Long-Bailey said it was ""only right"" for the government to continue the scheme over the summer, so children don't go hungry and are in a position to start ""learning properly"" in September. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she asked ministers to ""just continue the free school meal voucher programme"" and pointing to Scotland and Wales, added: ""They are going to do this over the summer holidays for their children, so why can't the government in England do the same?"" Last week, three Conservative MPs signed a cross-party letter calling for an extension of the scheme - worth Â£15 for each child per week in England - into the summer holidays in England. David Simmonds, the Conservative MP and a member of the education select committee, said Mr Rashford's letter was ""incredibly powerful"" but the free school meals scheme, although ""popular"", is a ""very blunt instrument"" and it doesn't always get to the most vulnerable children. Citing figures from the Local Government Association that show a Â£3bn shortfall in the children's social care sector, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that pressure is ""building"" in the system and that there has been a ""massive increase"" in the number of children coming into care whose needs ""must come first"". He said the government needed to address the ""significant pressure"" on the system ""so the most vulnerable children in this country - of whom there are tens of thousands - are not left behind"". Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker also gave his support to Mr Rashford,saying he was a credit to the sport and his family. He told BBC Newsnight: ""He shouldn't really be the one having to do this, but... he's doing a great job."" The former England striker said he understood ""kids wouldn't ordinarily be fed during the summer holidays"", but these are ""very difficult times"". This video can not be played Gary Lineker: Marcus Rashford credit to his sport and his family Conservative MPs will have a chance to register their unease during the Commons debate, said Newsnight's Nicholas Watt. One Tory backbencher forecast an eventual government U-turn, he added. Ministers, who say free school meals are not usually continued into the summer holidays, are planning to amend the Labour motion to highlight the steps the government has taken to help pupils from poorer backgrounds. This includes the Â£63m for local authorities to help people struggling financially as a result of coronavirus and the Holiday Activities and Food programme, which offers activities and free meals in the summer.

"Snowdonia remains out of bounds to visitors, unless they are local For the last three months large swathes of one of Britain's national park crown jewels has been shut to the public. Walkers have been barred from Snowdon and popular peaks, such as Tryfan or Cader Idris. Once flowing with visitors, summits remain forlorn, only viewed from afar by those lucky enough to live nearby. Now, those tasked with caring for the park are looking at how they can reopen. For others, it is a time to ask - can we reopen differently? They want to avoid the scenes that heralded lockdown back in March, when on the final weekend of the month, as coronavirus began to spread across the UK,roads to Snowdon and surrounding villages were crammed with cars, as visitors flocked to the beauty spots that make the park so special. There will be no Snowdonia Marathon in 2020 - it has been moved to next year BBC Wales has been told that organisers of events planned across the 823 sq miles (2,176 sq km) of park have been asked to postpone until 2021. The Snowdonia Marathon has already announced itsrace will be moved to next year. Lockdown has meant fewer visitors - and fines for those who breach the rules to travel to the region. It has also meant real pain for those relying on the park and tourism for a living - with cafes, B&Bs, hotels, restaurants and non-essential shops shut. Ready to go: Emlyn Roberts is eager to reopen his bistro in Beddgelert But coming out of lockdown too soon carries its own risks as Emlyn Roberts, owner of Bistro Hebog in Beddgelert, acknowledged: ""We've got everything in place, we're ready to go, our staff are eager. ""I'm also cautious that opening the gates to Wales too soon, too fast, could jeopardise everything. ""But I'm really keen to move on and, after all, it's a great place to do business.  The business is there, it's just a matter of waiting to see when."" ON THE BRINK:Tourism, Wales and Covid-19 WHAT'S ON AND WHAT'S GONE:Events in Wales during coronavirus CONTACT TRACING:When the phone rings - and it's you FIGURING OUT THE NUMBERS:What do the stats tell us? Elin Aaron runs the Gallt y Glyn hostel in Llanberis, a popular spot for hikers and locals. ""There's the conflict between wanting my business to be successful and to be here after the restrictions open, but also wanting to keep the community and my family safe - I've grown up in the area,"" she said. ""The balance of getting everything right - I don't envy whoever has to make the decision about when we can open, but it'd be nice to know so I can plan."" Hostel and restaurant owner Elin Aaron says there needs to be a balance for business and the area Parts of Wales' two other national parks - the Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons - have already reopened to locals.  As they look to the future, could the Snowdonia National Park Authority look at a different, more low-impact, model of tourism? John Harold thinks so. He is the director of the Snowdonia Society, a key partner of the park authority, established in 1967 by Esme Kirby and her husband Peter to protect the fragile mountain environment. ""This break, this time of people really rethinking things, gives us a chance to reset expectations,"" he said. ""Our expectations of what visitors will do and how they will behave when they're here, and visitors' expectations of what their experience will be - and that could be a positive change. ""It's a massive challenge of communication. We need to get the message out as widely as possible that - with a national park that's under pressure, doesn't have massive resources - we need everyone to play their part, be respectful and tread lightly."" Still shut - the paths to the summit of Snowdon are closed to the public Gwynedd council has confirmed to BBC Wales that they have asked event organisers in the area to postpone all events until next year. In a statement, the council said: ""Due to the unprecedented situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Gwynedd Safety Advisory Group have sent letters to all event organisers in the county. ""The message makes it clear that Gwynedd welcomes and supports events in the county, but under current conditions are encouraging organisers to postpone events which are due to take place in the next few months to ensure the safety and wellbeing of participants and local communities, as well as to avoid expenditure by event organisers during such an uncertain time. ""This is based on the current medical evidence and the likelihood that restrictions will remain in place for some time - especially regarding crowd events."" The Snowdonia National Park Authority has already indicated it will adopt a cautious approach to reopening the area. Expect only ""minor changes"" to lockdown rules in coming weeks, aimed at the local populations. Access to internationally famous locations will be some time off. Park officials said reopening Snowdonia would be ""cautious and measured and will be phased"". ""Our utmost priority has been, and remains, to protect our local communities and health services,"" it added.
