"Westeros and Great Britain may have more in common than you think The seventh season of fantasy TV drama Game of Thrones has hurtled to a close, and the burning question for fans right now is: ""Who will inherit the Iron Throne?"" The world of Westeros may be fictional, but its origins are far from imaginary. ""Medieval Britain has played an enormous impact on the series,"" creator George RR Martinonce said,external. What better way to determine the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms than by using the rules that govern the British monarchy? Who will win the Game of Thrones? We've compiled a list of contenders for the coveted Iron Throne (the seat of the kingdom's monarchy) and enlisted royal commentatorRichard Fitzwilliams,externaland medieval academics professorSarah Peverley,externaland DrGordon McKelvie,externalto weigh in on each candidate's chances. What do fans think will happen? Game of Thrones in numbers Cast emotional as they head for finale Follow the BBC's Game of Thrones coveragehere Cersei and Queen Margaret have quite a lot in common Born and bred in Westeros, Cersei is a devoted mother who married into royalty. Her late husband Robert Baratheon led a bloody rebellion and overthrew the ruling Targaryen dynasty. Her children came from an incestuous relationship with her brother Jamie (both their sons became young kings). While plotting the deaths of her rivals, Cersei lost her three children but ascended to the throne. Incest has always been taboo - the Lannisters' incestuous relationship would be frowned upon Richard Fitzwilliams:In Britain, an heir is determined by descent and parliamentary statute. Succession is also determined by the sequence of royal family members. Cersei declared herself queen without any legitimacy. Her claim rests on two things: being Robert Baratheon's widow and the mother of two dead kings. She resembles the villainous Margaret of Anjou, queen by marriage to the feeble King Henry VI. Margaret was also ruthless and highly influential. Sarah Peverley:Inheritance in the Seven Kingdoms is based on real medieval laws, often prone to contradictory interpretations. Generally speaking, thelaw of primogeniture,externalseems to govern the Iron Throne, which females can claim in the event of no male heir. Or they can act until a young king comes of age, as Cersei attempted to do. But her current claim rests solely on the power she wields. Gordon McKelvie:There have been plenty of unpopular queens with too much influence and power. Cersei seems to share their qualities. I can't think of any historical example where a king (with no children) dies and passes the crown to his mother. No one in medieval England made such a dramatic grab for power like Cersei did. Her desire for the Iron Throne is well known, but is the dragon queen entitled to it? The dragon queen's journey has been impressive, starting out as the timid daughter of Aerys Targaryen, the ""Mad King"" who was overthrown by Robert Baratheon. She went on to become an assertive ruler with a formidable army and dragons. Her ambition earned her the loyalty of many aides and allies. She fought to abolish slavery and now has her sights set on the Iron Throne, where she plans to end the vicious cycle of power politics. Like any monarch, Daenerys isn't short of titles. ""First of Her Name"" and ""Queen of the Andals"" are some names she goes by. Will she be able to avenge her family's name? Game of Thrones was inspired by the Wars of the Roses, a civil war that wreaked great havoc in England Richard Fitzwilliams:The Targaryens were the rightful rulers of Westeros before their dynasty was usurped. In this respect, Daenerys's claims certainly have validity, being in exile would not alter this. For centuries, monarchy has favoured the precedence of males over females. In 2015, an act known asSuccession to the Crown Billcame into force and this meant the eldest living child of a monarch succeeds, regardless of sex. This would have been good news for Daenerys, were it not for the fact her deceased older brother had a legitimate son.(Editor's note:Latest events have shown Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.,external) Daenerys has the support of her dragon children. The dragon we have in the UK rests on the Welsh flag, first used by Henry Tudor at the 1485 Battle of Bosworth which saw the defeat of Richard III and ended the Wars of the Roses. The flag of Wales: Parallels with House Targaryen? Sarah Peverley:Any house that previously ruled can make a relevant claim to the Iron Throne. However, the problem in Westeros is that nobody follows pre-determined laws. Daenerys's ancestor Aegon I was a conqueror. In turn, his descendants were overthrown during a rebellion incited by Robert Baratheon. If we apply these precedents, anyone able to conquer lands and hold them possesses the right to rule. In Daenerys's case, she has a legitimate ancestral claim. She also has an army, dragons and is beloved by those she liberates. This combination gives her a superior claim over others as she has the interests of the people at heart, rather than her own ambitions. Will military assets and dragons win the hearts of the common people? Gordon McKelvie:She is the last Targaryen, or at least she thinks she is. This means a Targaryen restoration was an option, though not necessarily a popular one. It was important for any monarch to be popular with their nobility as the crown needs to have people willing to fight for it in times of war. Lord Randyll Tarly's dislike for Daenerys as a foreign invader was a sentiment that would be shared by many throughout British history. Like any respected ruler, Jon Snow has led troops onto the field and fought with them in battle Now a celebrated Northern leader, Jon Snow has come a long way from being outcast as Ned Stark's bastard child. Illegitimate no more, he is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen (Daenerys's brother), rightful heir to the Iron Throne. The prince legally wed Jon's mother Lyanna Stark in a secret ceremony(Editor's note: All this he does not know yet). Blood from two of Westeros's most powerful houses signals one of the strongest claims to the throne. But would the monarchy have favoured this revelation? Many rooting for Jon think he will make an excellent (but reluctant) Westeros king Richard Fitzwilliams:As his father was Rhaegar, Jon obviously has a very strong claim. He is more entitled to the throne than Daenerys. Sarah Peverley:Being labelled the ""rightful heir"" isn't quite as clear-cut as it sounds. The Targaryens were a dynasty that ruled by right of conquest. So did the Baratheons. As Daenerys believes she is the only living Targaryen heir, we can't know for sure how she would respond to Jon's lineage. It is entirely possible that she would follow ""tradition"" and defer to him, following the lines of primogeniture. Gordon McKelvie:Now that Jon is indeed Rhaegar's legitimate son, this puts him second in line to the throne. After his father was killed in battle, Jon can be considered the next heir. Did monarchy laws overlook royal bastards like fan-favourite Gendry? Could Robert's last surviving son give others on our list a good fight? Young Gendry made his appearance as the late king's bastard child. With Baratheon blood running through his veins, fans are rooting for the talented blacksmith to uphold one of Westeros's last great houses. But is he entitled to? Richard Fitzwilliams:Compared to others on this list, Gendry won't stand a great chance. But the unexpected often happens: William the Conqueror was born a bastard but took the throne by force at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He defeated King Harold and became King of England. Like Gendry, William the Conqueror was born out of wedlock Sarah Peverley:Gendry was born out of wedlock so this makes his claim weaker than Daenerys (and possibly Jon). As a medieval rule, bastards could not inherit, especially if legitimate heirs existed. Gordon McKelvie:Gendry is a great character but the law made it unlikely he would ever become king. In England, being a bastard was always a problem so it was unlikely Gendry would fare well against a pure-blooded candidate like Daenerys. King Henry I had 24 bastard children. Some royal bastards ended up in positions of wealth and influence. Perhaps this is Gendry's fate? Treachery and deceit defined the ambitious Little Finger Here was a candidate with no royal lineage but made his desire to rule strongly known. The low-born Petyr Baelish (nicknamed Little Finger) worked his way into prominence and eventually landed in the late King Robert's court. He was a skilled manipulator, known to have played out key allies. Baelish's story was said to mirror that of Thomas Cromwell, who served as royal chief minister from 1532 to 1540. But his cunning plans soon caught up with him and now he's paid the price with his life. His story was said to have been inspired by English statesman Thomas Cromwell Richard Fitzwilliams:His chances were nil. He had no royal blood or charisma. Petyr Baelish could have risen high but it's a dangerous place to be, as Cromwell, who was later executed by King Henry VIII, eventually found. Britain is the last European country to have coronation ceremonies with imposing religious rituals. These have remained remarkably similar over the centuries. Crowning yourself would bear no legitimacy, even during the most turbulent times in history. But Baelish's schemes amounted to nothing in the end. Like Cromwell, he was executed Sarah Peverley:Little Finger could use his status to style himself as a ""man of the people"". If he gained the support of a significant number of lords, there was nothing to prevent him from trying to attain the crown. He could read others well and he made people do his bidding so he'd probably have made a very strong ruler. Gordon McKelvie:As much as I enjoy watching Petyr Baelish's schemes, it would not have worked in medieval Britain. He was similar to many unpopular courtiers, who were seen as exerting more power and influence than they deserved. When a king was replaced, it was always by someone who descended from an earlier king. So my answer for Little Finger's royal ambitions: they simply were not possible.

" A thick layer of acrid, blue smoke hovers just above the waterfront slums that skirt Lagos lagoon, filtering out sunrise and sunset. This man-made mist that clings to the rusted shack rooftops comes from the countless fish-smoking cabins that drive the slum economy. There’s an uninterrupted view of the city’s dramatic sprawl of poverty from the road bridges that carry daily commuters between the islands and the mainland. Fishing and sand-dredging boats drift to work, heading deep into the lagoon. Many of the slums’ wooden huts are on stilts, others are just basic shacks shoddily built on the unstable ground of trodden-down rubbish dumps. Nobody knows exactly how many people live in Lagos, but they all agree on one thing – Nigeria's biggest city is growing at a terrifying rate. The UN says 14 million. The Lagos State government thinks it’s nearer 21 million, as rural Nigerians are drawn by the hope of a better life to one of Africa’s few mega-cities. By 2050 Nigeria will have twice the population it has today, more than half will live in cities, and about 60% of them will be under 25. In an overcrowded neighbourhood on mainland Lagos, Muktar Abdulhamid, 36, is pressing shirts with a heavy, old-fashioned iron filled with charcoals. Abdulhamid is from a rural village in the northern state of Kano, and he’s left his wife and one-year-old child at home and come here to try to make money. Muktar Abdulhamid: Just one of many rural Nigerians drawn to Lagos “This isn’t what I intended to be doing. I want to do business – to buy and sell,” he says. “It’s not easy to leave your wife, your child, it’s lonely, but I have no choice – it’s for the future of the family.” There are few good jobs and housing is in high demand, but at least there are opportunities. Every week tens of thousands of people arrive in Lagos, heading to neighbourhoods where friends and relatives have come before – many end up in the slums. But Lagos State is planning tower blocks and transformation, reclaiming land from the sea for ambitious new developments. In a rush to transform the city, the waterfront slums are being cleared, court rulings are being ignored, and luxury apartment blocks are springing up. Can Lagos persuade wealthy investors to buy into a futuristic vision, while helping pull the poorest people out of poverty? In about 30 years Nigeria will overtake the US to become the world’s third most populated country behind China and India. It vies with South Africa for the status of the continent’s biggest economy, but it’s now in recession - beset by a drop in oil prices, and having to fund the fight against both Boko Haram Islamists and separatists targeting oil pipelines in the Niger Delta. Like everywhere else in Africa trying to break out of poverty, Nigeria hopes fast population growth will bring it a “demographic dividend” – a young workforce that can drive economic growth. If they can all be put to work. Already there’s migration north to Libya and on to Europe, and the young who are left idle and without much hope are easily radicalised by Boko Haram. It’s going to take great management, smart politics and increasing security and stability to turn rapid population growth into a positive and avoid the potential for disaster. Source: Google/ Landsat / Copernicus “Africa’s Model Megacity” flashes up in the glitzy video of beautiful sunsets and impressive artists' impressions of the big Lagos city development plan. Soaring luxury skyscrapers sit alongside a port, enterprise parks and a new city-wide transport system of train lines, ferries and bus lanes. But in the waterfront slums circling the lagoon, this vision is a threat to livelihoods, not a hope for the future. Elebiomayo Folashade was a relatively well-off woman living in a sand-slum – but now she’s angry. Pulling up her elegant blue dress, she leans down to inspect the damage done to one of her boats by security forces, and begins to cry. “They destroyed my boats and my husband’s boats and now I cannot pay the school fees, so the children have been withdrawn from school,” she says. “I am old – what am I going to do now?” Many boats with huge holes in their hulls have been hauled up and abandoned on a beach that just a year ago was busy with work. Ebute Ilaje is a place that has lived off sand-dredging for decades. Wooden boats with food-sack sails would bring sand from deep in the lagoon to sell as building material, employing thousands of people. But then the government “taskforce” came – smashing holes in their boats and threatening to burn down the slum if they continued to work. Now Folashade’s livelihood has gone – as has that of many in a community that depended on the sand-dredgers to keep the economy afloat. Many believe what’s labelled a security crackdown against crime is an excuse to drive them out. “The state government is interested in the land in all these waterfront communities... so the rich can benefit from it,” says former dredger Oladipupo Aireomiye. His fears stem from the recent clearance of Otodo Gbame slum, which went ahead despite a court order halting its destruction. Otodo Gbame, after the bulldozers went in The bulldozers came in with the taskforce, smashing tin shacks, burning anything wooden to the ground. “The police seized our documents and fired tear gas… some people fled, others were shot,” says Maxwell Hunga, who lived in Otodo Gbame. The moment you demolish a slum, naturally two or three more slums will spring up because people need somewhere to sleep “The most challenging thing we are facing is the threat of eviction that is hanging around the community’s neck,” says Samuel Akinrolabu from the Nigerian Slum and Informal Settlement Federation. “Over 40 communities are under the threat of eviction and 300,000 people would be rendered homeless eventually if this action is carried out,” he says. “But forced eviction will not make slums disappear. Rather the moment you demolish a slum, naturally two or three more slums will spring up because people need somewhere to sleep."" Klote Kakini, fisherman They have the same fears in Ago Egun, the next slum along, where the men catch fish and the women smoke them on circular wire grills. Their shacks are built on a floating rubbish dump - trodden down and compacted over the years, its paths wobble disconcertingly underfoot. Klote Kakini is an old fisherman whose father lived here before him. He is worried his family will be evicted while he’s in the boat. “When we leave to catch fish, we are afraid something will happen to our wives and children at home,” he says. “Maybe the government will send agents to demolish everything or scatter our families.” But Steve Ayorinde, the Lagos State and governor’s spokesman, says these fears are unfounded: “This is a government with a human face, this is a government that won’t just descend on helpless citizens and just bulldoze them away.” He denies they have been heavy-handed by driving people from land they have lived on for many years. “I’m not aware that there has been any community that has been living within the waterfront for generations. It’s always a convenient lie for people to tell just to demonise the government,” he says. “All over the world there will always be the need for regeneration of certain areas. It’s happened in New York, in London... and Lagos is not an exception.” He gives two examples where people were resettled and compensation was paid. “Of course at some point there will be mild resistance, but this government believes in dialogue – in engaging with people so they can see the bigger picture of what the benefits would be.” But Samuel Akinrolabu describes a different reality: “The basic reason is land-grabbing, to be honest. Lagos government has seen that the waterfront communities are prime land where they can build the five-star hotels... and people can wake up and see the ocean view.” He believes the answer to redevelopment is to leave people where they are, improve their lives in situ and create new space to house them. ""We are in an urban age and people are going to keep coming, so we are just going to have to find more creative ways to accommodate more people,” says Taibat Lawanson, associate professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Lagos. And they do keep coming - from other towns and cities, and from remote rural communities. Lagos has become Nigeria’s centre of gravity. Lagos is crowded, chaotic, and crumbling. In the slums of the old city the spirits of the dead appear to have returned to cleanse it of evil and pray for its peace and prosperity. The tall men, wrapped in white, jump and crouch, sweeping their long sticks at the crowd. Their heads are veiled and topped with brightly coloured hats, as they spin through the streets towards the palace of their “Oba” – the king of Lagos. The Eyo Festival (pronounced Ay-oh) usually marks the death of the city’s most important or influential people, but this ceremony – the first in seven years – is celebrating the 50th anniversary of Lagos State. The original spot where 15th Century Yoruba fishermen settled on Lagos Island is now an edgy, poor, densely packed neighbourhood. Degraded buildings lean into each other, appearing to sag under the weight of people packing the balconies to watch the procession. The roads are potholed, there are few schools or clinics, let alone parks or playing fields – it desperately needs a new lease of life. Lateef Shelobo, Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency “Lagos has no choice but to go up,” says Lateef Sholebo, head of Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency. “How are we going to accommodate all the population? There is no way we can continue to sprawl.”After 25 years as a city planner in Los Angeles, he has now returned home to put into practice the lessons of urban renewal he has learned. Emerging from the rusty tin rooftops and towering above the Eyo parade route is a multi-storey apartment block – a gleaming, modern show home rising from the slum. “This project is very important because it shows the people in the community how a slum area can be transformed from what it used to be to a more modern, more sustainable environment,” he says, enthusiastically. Eleven families lived on the land – they were persuaded to combine their plots and stay elsewhere while the 48-flat tower block was built. Now they have 11 modern apartments to move into – and 37 extra new homes for their neighbours. “The air-space is useless – nobody is using it. Now we are able to go vertical we can reduce the overcrowding,” says Sholebo. “If we are able to convince all the rest of the families to participate in this kind of programme I think it’s better for them, it’s better for the government – and it’s better for everybody.” But it took years to build and was hugely expensive - too expensive for the government to roll out across Lagos. The city needs to be rebuilt without moving whole communities out. That’s where Sholebo’s American experience could make the difference – using imaginative tax tricks to generate finance for the infrastructure to bring in private developers. “We have to come up with different ways, or creative ways to provide such affordable housing,” says Sholebo. But those with the money to invest are looking for better returns elsewhere. Landmark Towers From the 11th-storey penthouse of the luxury Landmark Towers there’s an amazing view of the ocean and the sprawling waterfront developments. “We are trying to create West Africa’s first one-stop shop, live, work and play destination,” explains property developer Paul Onwuanibe. The Landmark Group chief executive lives in the penthouse suite, and from the large, open terrace points out what will go where on the five-hectare, $100m development. There’s already a Hard Rock Cafe, a fine dining restaurant, and an events centre which seats 4,000 people – hugely popular for expensive weddings. Land has been cleared for a Marriott hotel, a small shopping mall, an IMAX cinema, two office blocks and two apartment buildings. Here, people can avoid the Lagos chaos of overcrowding and terrible traffic congestion – the selling point is that if you can afford to live here, you never need to leave. Onwuanibe’s five hectares are dwarfed by the massive Eko Atlantic project next door. The Eko Atlantic development Earthmovers are landscaping this vast spur of land reclaimed from the sea, roads are being built and the first few tower blocks are beginning to take shape. It’s a stark contrast from life in the slums – a symbol of the vast inequality in Lagos. “There will always remain the super-rich and there will always remain the people just simply below the poverty line, but the hope is that over the next few years you will see that gap bridged as more people get more jobs,” says Onwuanibe. “I believe in trickle-down economics – so that wealth you create actually goes through the system, so the very people that feel that they’re displaced end up getting helped.” Rural Yanoko is a long way from the sprawl and chaos of Lagos. Most women in this village have about seven children. That’s typical for the surrounding region - the countryside overlapping northern Nigeria and southern Niger. It's the area with the highest birth rate in the world. And this birth rate is helping put Nigeria well on its way to becoming the world’s third-largest country by 2050. More than half of women are married before they are 15 and having many children is considered a sign of good fortune – and they are a good source of farm labour. There’s a huge push to reduce the fertility rate, but the population here is expected to triple in the next 30 years. There’s little for people to do, and lack of opportunity drives them to the city. Muktar Abdulhamid has optimism written across his chest. The 36-year-old wears a bright Superman T-shirt while very precisely ironing shirts in the overcrowded Lagos mainland neighbourhood of Agege. It wasn’t what he intended to do when came here from Yanoko, but well-paying work is rare and it helps him get by while waiting for that big business opportunity to come along. “When I arrived I thought it would be easy, but then I realised how much harder it was to get work, but you can’t just sit here without a job,” says Muktar. “I want to buy and sell, to have a shop in Kano and make enough money to go back to school to get a Western education.” Many people in this particular Lagos neighbourhood are from northern Nigeria and speak the same language, and so it feels a little more like home. But he misses the wife and young son he left behind nine months ago when he came to make it in the big city. Back home in Yanoko it’s the rainy season - and bright green fields jump out from the stark background of burnt orange mud buildings. There are only six cars, electricity is something they had for about a week before the new power lines fell dormant, and since the only bridge collapsed four years ago, it’s been even harder to reach the nearest health centre 27km away. Seven thousand people live here - a two-hour ride on a rocky road from Kano, which is the biggest city in northern Nigeria. Muktar Abdulhamid’s family are sitting together to talk about the man who left it all to make his fortune in the city. “We don’t have money to eat, so we had to send the boy to go look for money,” says his sister Ramatu Abdulkarim. “He is getting a little bit every day, just enough to survive, thank God. Sometimes he sends us 40, 50, or 60,000 Naira,” Muktar’s sister says. That’s between $110 and $165 (£85-£125), equivalent to two months’ worth of the annual income the family makes from farming maize, rice, soya or chillies. “We use the money for the farm and for buying food and clothing for the children – he also sent money for [his wife] Ramatu. “She’s not comfortable that he’s not close to her. And he’s not happy that he’s far from her.” Ramatu Muktar, 22, nods in agreement as one-year-old Abdulhamid plays on the floor – the whole family are praying Muktar will do well and take them both to Lagos to be with him. She’s shy and says little, but Muktar’s good friend and cousin Saidu Yahaya says it’s all about having money – to improve life and plan for the unexpected. “They are making money there, but you know how things are, it’s meagre money. You have to manage the little you have for survival,” says Saidu. About 150 young men from Yanoko are also trying to get work in Lagos – and the road to town is only going to get busier. “Lagos has always had that mixed blessing of having to deal with an influx of people. Unfortunately for us in the last two or three years it has been a deluge,” says the Lagos State and Governor’s spokesman Steve Ayorinde. He says 27 or 28 of the 36 states in Nigeria are struggling to pay local government salaries and it’s harder for people to migrate abroad. “We want other people to be here – to bring ideas, to bring values, to bring innovation, but we’re just unable to deal with it endlessly,” he says. “The prosperity of Lagos, in a way, is also tied to how open it is... so visitors will always have a great role to play in Lagos if they play by the rules.” More than half the population in Lagos is already under 25, and if there was work for them to do, and the birth rate was to slow down, the economy would get a welcome boost. This is where the “demographic dividend” comes in - an opportunity to take advantage of a big and active workforce. But if enough jobs aren’t created, the country suffers from the other side of that coin. Too many unemployed young people provides a fertile recruiting ground for Islamists like Boko Haram or a market for the people-smugglers peddling dreams of wealth and a better life in Europe. So if Africa's biggest challenge is everyone's problem, what's the solution? The newly-trained staff in the glossy new Lagos factory are carefully packing phones into boxes. As production lines go it's small, but for “the first indigenous mobile, tablet, phone and computer assembly plant in Nigeria”, at least it's a start. The company, Afrione, wants to tap into the big market for devices that a fast-growing young population provides, by producing cheap phones and tablets with the tagline “Made in Nigeria”. At the moment at least 90% of the components are imported, but company director Lekan Akinjide wants to steadily decrease that by 4 or 5% a year. “What we are actually doing fundamentally is starting the process - no-one else has really tried, no one else has really invested in a factory and the training of a skilled workforce,” he says. “We've looked at China, we've looked at India, we've also looked at what people have done here and tried not to make the mistakes they have made.” China had a fast growing population. It had deep and pervasive poverty, it was a rural economy and it turned itself around in a generation, mainly through manufacturing. But the window of time to take advantage of the “demographic dividend” is short – lots of jobs are needed now – and it’s perhaps worth looking a little closer to home. There are some places in Africa where a new industrial revolution is seen as the key to putting the idle youth to work and cashing in on a growing population. Ethiopia’s economy is dwarfed by that of Nigeria, but it’s the continent’s fastest growing and is betting it all on massive infrastructure investment and an industrial revolution to transform a nation of farmers into makers. There are beautiful new six-lane highways, an electric railway line to the ocean, and vast estates of social housing are being built with government-run mortgage schemes to get the poor on the housing ladder. And Nigeria knows massive investment in infrastructure is the answer to a growing economy and to get a congested city moving. The population is even outgrowing the supply of electricity. Generators which fill the gaps are a constant background soundtrack to the city. Taibat Lawanson, planning expert Stage one of Nigeria’s first electric railway line - through Lagos - is almost finished, but it can’t start moving a quarter of a million people a day from the suburbs to the city until its own power station is up and running. “There’s a lot of new infrastructure being built, but it’s skewed and the effects are not felt by the common man,” says planning expert Taibat Lawanson. “There’s a gap between the rich and the poor.” She believes by just improving transport links between residential suburbs and downtown, the government is missing the point – new satellite cities have to be planned and built so people can work near their homes and avoid commuting. “The government has got to understand that people are going to keep coming. “The current thinking is that they need to reverse urbanisation and get people to go back to the villages and stay away, but that’s not going to work.” The luxury waterfront developer Paul Onwuanibe says inequality is everywhere, but he believes it's “a little more acute, or visible” in Lagos. “That’s just part and parcel of mega-cities, but one of the things the government would have to think of is some kind of social platform... some sort of welfare platform that catches people below a certain safety net. “As this country and this city develops, you will see the gap bridged to some extent. “There will be a lot of people that will always remain under the poverty line just because of the sheer numbers,” he says, but believes the trickle-down from a growing economy and better private sector will see more people better off. So what does Steve Ayorinde, the Lagos Governor and State spokesman, think the city will look like in 50 years? “The pride of the black race,” he answers quickly. “Where technology will drive practically everything.” He talks about making Lagos a “smart city” - but millions of people living in slums just want better education and health, somewhere to live and somewhere to work. “Just build modern houses for us - we are happy with where we are living,” says Moses Sangoloke, a long-time resident of the threatened Ago Egun fishing slum, who chairs the community development association. The government knows it needs to build. The people will keep coming. Lagos will keep growing. Built with Shorthand",Negative,2.2663073e-06
"In the early hours of Sunday, Conor McGregor will make his professional boxing debut against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas. But it's not just the boxers getting ready for the fight. Newsbeat has been to meet Janira Kremets, a Vegas ring girl, to find out what it's like to be so close to the action. ""Imagine keeping your balance, not shaking from the nerves and then holding the sign,"" she says. Janira is a model and so-called ring girl living in Las Vegas.

"Yaya Sangare with his four-year-old daughter, Deborah Three photos are all that Yaya Sangare has to remind him of the family he once had. It was nine months ago when his wife and sons drowned off the coast of Libya. ""I was holding my newborn son Kami Davide in my arms when he died,"" he says quietly, as he goes through the small album of photos on his cracked mobile phone. His wife Seri Dejezi and their other two sons - 12-year-old Eli and 14-year-old Elise - also died when their boat went down in the Mediterranean. Sitting on the steps of the Piazza Garibaldi in the Napoli heat, the 38-year-old lingers over the photo of his sons. ""These boys... I love them so much."" Yaya's two elder sons Eli, 12, and Elise, 14, both drowned when the boat they were in was lost at sea Now it is only Yaya and his four-year-old daughter, Deborah, left to pick up the pieces. She is smiling and singing, occasionally grabbing her father's hand for attention. Deborah was also on the boat that fateful night, but Yaya says they don't talk about it. ""I'll tell her one day what happened. She remembers sometimes. But one day I'll sit down and tell her all the stories, but not now. It's too hard."" Watch: The desert trek from Africa to Europe Are migrants paying price as EU targets smugglers? Originally from the Ivory Coast, Yaya left during the first civil war in 2002. Crossing the desert into Mali and then Algeria, he and his young family lived in refugee camps before making the journey to Libya, where they stayed for three months. However, Yaya had wanted to reach Europe by sea. With its islands, and exposed coastline on either side, Italy has been the main destination for refugees and migrants. Between January and August this year, 97,000 people came illegally by boat according to the UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM). But the route is often a fatal one. More than 2,000 people have died in the sea so far this year. Pope Francis has called the Mediterranean a ""vast cemetery"", but Yaya says he knew he was taking a risk coming here. Yaya's son Kami Davide, who he says died in his arms ""We wanted to leave because Libya was very difficult and I wanted to make a better life for my family in Europe,"" he says. He paid more than â¬3,000 (Â£2,766; $3,560) to traffickers to get to Sicily but like many endured violence at their hands. They smashed the top row of his teeth as they pushed him and his family on to one of 19 small rickety boats. ""When we got on, there were 154 people on my boat and we were all on top of each other. It was terrible,"" Yaya says. The boats gave way in the night - only 19 people survived from his. Three other vessels and all their passengers vanished into the dark waters. Yaya's eyes start welling up, his voice cracks, but he takes a deep breath to avoid crying in front of Deborah. ""I couldn't find my wife Dejezi and the boys, my heart hurt. I couldn't help them. Then I saw their bodies floating."" He and Deborah finally arrived in Sicily, with a small backpack of clothes. Just the two of them. There is a saying in this city: ""Vedi Napoli e poi muori"" (see Naples and die). It traces back to the times when the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies - of which Naples was the capital - was an affluent and prestigious part of the world. The meaning behind the old proverb is that once you have seen the glory of Naples, there is nothing else worth seeing, but for Yaya it is very much the opposite. ""This is a bad city. There is nothing here for us. Many things have happened here."" Yaya's wife Seri Dejezi also perished off the coast of Libya Yaya lives in a refugee centre in the city with his young daughter. They both have refugee status from the UN Refugee Agency in Liberia. But he wants to get out, and angrily recalls a story over how a man approached him to buy Deborah. ""I'll never forget it. I got approached by a man with a phone number and was told, this man wants to buy your daughter for â¬30,000. ""I go to my office (refugee reception centre) and said 'see what's happened'. I gave them the number, I told them my story. I started to cry,"" Yaya says. He adds that nothing was done and that the man was never caught. But he fears that eventually the city could destroy him and Deborah. ""I don't like the way some men look at my daughter. I worry she may be exploited into drugs and prostitution,"" he says. Libya exposed as child migrant abuse hub African migrants sold in 'slave markets' As he tells his story, there are dozens of other young men and women, of African origin, congregated on the Piazza Garibaldi. Pointing to them he says: ""I don't want to live like this. I'm fearing that I'll be left in Napoli. ""I am strong enough to work but I can't get a job. I want to keep moving and take Deborah to the US or Australia."" Last week, a Catholic priest who helps refugees urged his fellow Africans not to turn their backs on their homeland. Don Mussie Zeraisaid that people should think twice before making the perilous journey to Europe. But Yaya shakes his head when I mention this: ""I can't go back home. I don't like the politics there. Also I promised a better life for my family."" He says that he is focused on his plans and will only go back to get his mother and other family members. ""My mother is Christian. I get my strength from her and from God, and from my daughter Deborah. I do this all for Deborah."" Start of migrants' desert trek to Europe.

"Claim:It takes longer today to get from Chester to Manchester than it did in 1962. Verdict:True, but the fastest service on that route now stops in more places. The vast majority of other routes have seen improvements in journey times. The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has argued that the north of England is underserved in terms of rail infrastructure. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that it now took rail passengers longer to make the journey from Chester to Manchester than in 1962. ""We cannot continually be put at the back of the queue,"" he said. ""People here -  taxpayers - here deserve a modern transport system on a par with London."" Figures from Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) indicate that Mr Burnham is correct. Its analysis of historical train timetables show that in 1962 the fastest service from Chester to Manchester took 56 minutes, stopping at one station in between. Today it takes 60 minutes but makes seven station stops. By contrast, according to TfGM, the fastest journey from Manchester to London in 1962 was 220 minutes. It is now 124 minutes, a reduction of nearly 44%. TfGM has also looked at how other journeys to and from Manchester have fared since 1962. All of them are now faster. Andy Burnham: North 'needs transport investment now' August Bank Holiday: Where to avoid on roads and rail A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We are committed to improving trans-Pennine services, and are working with Transport for the North to cut journey times and increase capacity between the major cities of the north. "" Journey times are not the only way to measure improvement (or otherwise) on Britain's railways, or how the rate of progress differs between regions. It is important to consider the number of passengers. They made 1.7bn journeys on Britain's train network in 2016-17, 79% more than in 1962. This is often given as a reason why most of the infrastructure investments carried out today focus on increasing capacity rather than speeding up journey times. Gary Cooper, the director of planning, engineering and operations at the industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""The number of journeys has doubled in the last twenty years [after falling in the years following 1962] meaning there are more trains making more stops on a busier railway."" ""While this means journey times may not have reduced in some places, it has helped to connect more communities and drive economic growth."" But is it true that communities in the North are ""at the back of the queue"" when it comes to transport spending? Total government transport spending for England in 2011-2012 was Â£15.8bn. That covered all forms of transport. A third of it went to London, while only a quarter was spent on the North East, the North West, and the Yorkshire and Humber regions combined. By 2015-16 that had jumped to Â£24.3bn, and proportionate spending was roughly the same. No other English region comes close to receiving the amount spent on London - which includes the tube network and recently the Crossrail development. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said in an article for the Yorkshire Post,externalthat ""unprecedented investment"" has been allocated to the North between 2015 and 2021. ""We are spending Â£13bn on Northern transport in this Parliament - the largest in government history."" A breakdown of that figure reveals Â£3.8bn is earmarked explicitly for rail enhancements. Looking ahead, it appears that London will still receive the lion's share of funding. The think tankIPPR North looked at planned spending on projects,externalthat were either funded publicly or by a combination of public and private investment. They excluded projects that spanned more than one region. They found that per person, spending in London was set to be considerably higher in from 2016-17 onwards: London: Â£1,900 North West: Â£680 North East: Â£220 Yorkshire and the Humber: Â£190 Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter,external At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"The team show off their new kit and distinctive ""hashtag"" hand sign ""We're average footballers living the professional footballer dream,"" says Seb Carmichael-Brown, vice-captain of amateur side  Hashtag United. The squad is a group of mates, most of whom have day jobs off the pitch which have nothing to do with sport. And yet they have toured the US, Serbia, Ireland and Jersey, had their own kit custom-made by sportswear giant Umbro and average 700,000 views per match. They've also played at the UK's top stadiums including Wembley and the Etihad, as well as the O2 Arena and Everton's training ground. And it's all thanks to a carefully crafted presence on YouTube. Team captain Spencer Owen is a successful YouTuber Crucially, the team didn't start life as total unknowns. Captain Spencer Owen was already a successful football and gaming YouTuber in his own right, and now has nearly two million followers. ""He has always wanted to own his own football club,"" says Seb Carmichael-Brown, who is also Spencer's brother. ""But it's not viable for a 28-year-old YouTuber. So we thought, let's start his own."" Sunday league activity already has an established YouTube presence - like the Palmers FC team, who have 200,000 followers - so the brothers decided to build something a bit different. Inspired by EA video game franchise Fifa, they devised a tournament in which the team would play real matches within a fictional league, working their way from fifth to first division, where they are currently. They are promoted or relegated depending on a points system dictated by match wins - their current target is to reach 22 points in order to top their own first division. This way, Hashtag United can choose their opponents, and include teams from other big YouTube channels like Copa90 and the F2Freestylers as well as sponsored teams. It also secures occasional access to the big stadiums - sometimes through sponsored deals with, say, BT Sport, and sometimes because they play a team connected to a particularly hallowed arena. So, for example, a match against Arsenal community team Arsenal For All got them on to the pitch of the Emirates Stadium. This video can not be played Yogscast chief tells newbie YouTubers: 'Do it for love' They also work full-time on creating YouTube material. The team post a match video every two weeks but the channel is peppered with behind-the-scenes videos, fronted by Spencer, showing them travelling, setting up, chatting about forthcoming events among themselves. A six-person camera crew attends matches, and it takes four to five weeks for a tightly edited match video to find its way on to the official channels. It costs ""thousands"" to put on a match in this way, says Mr Carmichael-Brown. Although sponsorship is lucrative - the team's US tour was paid for by Coca-Cola - overheads are also large. ""Hashtag United have hit a rich vein - younger, digitally native fans alienated from the professional game who just love football,"" said social media strategist Sue Llewellyn. ""This is a classic example of keeping it real and personal - talk to your fans like you would talk to your mates.  It's all about trust these days. Younger people don't like big faceless corporates, they want a more personal, more authentic experience."" The Hashtag brand also includes four professional e-sports players. In addition to successful memorabilia and merchandise marketing (the current strip is sold out, says Mr Carmichael-Brown), Hashtag ran an X Factor-style search for a new player, which attracted 20,000 applicants, they claim, and has resulted in a couple of signings. Then there's the successful Hashtag e-sports team playing professional Fifa. Team manager Tassal Rushan was crowned regional champion in Paris during EA's FUT Championship earlier this year - a professional Fifa competition played by e-sports teams from around the world. Even the camera crew feature in the videos. The north London ground which the Hashtag football team call their regular home only has the capacity for 1,000 spectators, and the team try hard to keep match dates under wraps. ""We are primarily making videos for YouTube rather than creating live events,"" says Mr Carmichael-Brown. Facebook introduces new video service Amazon launches YouTube rival ""A lot of our games go out four to five weeks later. If we have a big crowd, they'll all have their phones, and the results will leak."" However, people do try to figure out the venue, he admits, and will turn up on the off-chance that they might catch Hashtag United in action. ""We have recently thought about ways we might move towards a model where all the games are open,"" he said. Perhaps that will form part of the next chapter in the life of Hashtag United - planning is well under way as the team races to the top of its self-created Division One. Mr Carmichael-Brown is tight-lipped but says the announcement will be made ""in the coming months"". Strong, fast, tall, athletic player. Joined: three months ago, via the Academy series Workman, warrior, very good with both feet Joined: at the start Very fast - and the team's second top goalscorer Joined: at the start. ""It'll be hugely important for them to stay real - in other words stay true to their roots and not end up in the elite player position of being spoilt by money,"" said Sue Llewellyn. ""They will also need to be agile in such a fast-moving space, keep innovating and finding new ways to engage their fans."" That said, social media and sport are a natural partnership, she adds. ""Sports fans are passionate about their game. It's a basic human need to belong and to want to feel we matter. ""Being part of a digital tribe fulfils that need and it brings people together wherever they are in the world and whatever physical skill level they have.""

"Members of Somali band, Waaberi, take to the stage in 1970s Mogadishu The discovery of thousands of lost recordings from Somalia's golden era of music is a timely reminder of the country's remarkable hybrid sounds, writes BBC Somali's Yasmin Ahmed. A newly released compilation, Sweet As Broken Dates: Lost Somali Tapes from the Horn of Africa, features some of the recovered audio. Over the last few decades, Somalia has become a symbol of poverty and anarchy. But while recent Hollywood blockbusters Captain Philips and Black Hawk Down have depicted civil war and modern piracy in Somalia, people who lived in the capital, Mogadishu, in the early 1970s will tell you a very different story. Whitewashed coral houses, cafes and restaurants with Moorish arches graced the streets of Mogadishu. Men sported afros and flared trousers, while women dressed in their colourful baatis (a classic cotton dress) and diracs (loose-fitting dress) with their heads uncovered. Evidence of centuries of cross-cultural trade and migrating nomadic tribes can be seen in the architecture, and this cultural influence also explains the remarkable hybrid sound of Somali music. Now Somalis around the world can relive these rich memories of Mogadishu through an archive of more than 10,000 tapes which music producer Vik Sohonie was given access to by the Red Sea Cultural Foundation in Hargeisa, capital of the self-declared republic of Somaliland. Funk, rock, jazz and Bollywood influences feature in the rich and varied recordings. The tapes take us back to a time of relative economic and political stability in Somalia. Although the country was under military rule, the arts - particularly music - flourished and the period became known as the golden age. Bars and nightclubs were a part of everyday life in 1970s Mogadishu Mogadishu was home to popular hotels Al-Uruba and Jazeera, where young fans would flock to the dancefloor to hear groups like Iftiin and Dur Dur perform. Somalia's music industry was effectively nationalised under authoritarian leader General Siad Barre, who brought most industries under state control in the hopes of ridding the country of clan-based politics. During this period, record companies could not release music to the market. Mogadishu features a wide variety of architectural styles The National Theatre was a revered forum where music groups produced remarkable music, but the performers became attractive propaganda tools for General Barre's message. Theatre companies known as bands, notably Iftiin Band and Waaberi Band, expressed nationalism in their lyrics and style. One song, the Waaberi Band's Oktoobar waa tee, waa tumaa? (What is October, which one is it?) became a hit after the Barre-led military junta came into power on 21 October 1969. The song recounts various key Somali historical events which have taken place during that month. Schoolchildren across the country recited the anthem, which was also performed on the streets by military marching bands and frequently played on state-run Radio Mogadishu: Oktoobar waa tee? Waa tumaa? What is October, what is it? Waa taa yadii. It is ours. Hadii ay tahay teenii taariikh ma leedahay oo maxaa lagu tilmaamaa? If it ours, does it have history and how is it marked? Waxaa lagu tilmaamaa maalinti dhagax tuur Oktoobar. It marks the ""stone-throwing"" 1949 October uprising. Waxaa lagu tilmaamaa markaan caalan taagnay Oktoobar. And October marks the month our flag was created. Waxaa lagu tilmaamaa towraddeena dhalatay 21 Oktoobar It marks the 21st of October, the day the revolution started. ""When I look back, I sometimes break into tears,"" says celebrated singer Maryan Mursal. ""I'm welling up right now as I picture what Mogadishu was like in the 70s."" Before her successful solo career, Mursal won a nationwide talent competition called Tartanka heesaha hirgalay (The Singing Competition) and performed with the Waaberi Band. ""We had bars in Mogadishu and five nightclubs. We travelled from city to city and performed in hotels and bars. Those were the golden years."" Star singer Hibo Nuura performed pro-Barre songs in the 1970s but later spoke out against the regime Mursal, like many other performers in bands like Waaberi band, Shareero and Dur Dur, fled Somalia after decades of war and now lives in the diaspora. ""Dhaanto"", an ancient Somali folk song and dance, was historically played without instruments, with hand-clapping and foot-stamping used as rhythmic accompaniment. Nomadic tribes would take their camels into their ranch at night and venture out to compete with each other. This folk style was enhanced throughout the 20th Century and again by the likes of the Sharero band and Khadija Qalanjo in the 1980s. This video can not be played The Sharero band, featuring Faadumo Qaasim, perform Qays iyo Layla (Romeo and Juliet) The new sounds bustles with an electrifying synthesis of different musical instruments, and shares rhythms and characteristics with reggae. Somali musicians of that time debate whether dhaanto preceded reggae and dub. ""Over the years, different cultures and ancient traditions have influenced and shaped music,'' says Abdinasir Aideed, a bass player for dhaanto artist Danan Hargeysa. ""Dhaanto and reggae are very similar and share the same rhythm.'' This period was a time when society began to accept female artists, when the melodiousness of their voices was likened to the sweetness of dates. In Mogadishu's prominent nightclubs, female artists attracted more followers and drew more crowds than their male counterparts. ""They used to call us all kinds of nicknames before the 1970s. Some women used to hide,"" 70s star singer Khadra Daahir told the BBC. This video can not be played Khadra Daahir on Somalia's 'miraculous' 70s arts scene ""People said we were dead, lost and a disgrace to our people,"" she recalls. But Daahir says that society's perception of women transformed within a decade. ""It was a miraculous era. During the 70s, people became open-minded, they got used to women singing, dancing and performing. ""They realised it's part of Somali culture and people started to admire us."" But Daahir was no stranger to unconventional careers. Before her success in music, she was an athlete and basketball player, competing in regional and national competitions. After decades of trauma, Somalia is now going through a process of cultural and political healing. Under a national recovery plan, the National Theatre is being rebuilt, having been destroyed during the conflict and a restoration of the arts is under way. What Somalia's National Theatre used to look like Funk, pop and reggae may not be musical genres that people associate with Somali music. For Somalis today, the golden age is not the thing of the past but a symbol of hope for the future.

"Paul, and his fellow jurors, Julie, Anne-Marie and Emma - who did not want to be fully identified - spoke to the BBC about their long spell in court Two years ago, four ordinary people were brought together by a letter requiring them to report for jury service. They, and eight others, became the longest-serving jurors in UK criminal history. The experience of sitting in silence for long periods and the responsibility of following a complex fraud trial has affected them all deeply and left some of them struggling to adapt to their normal lives. However, the four agree that despite those struggles, they are glad to have sat on the jury. It is rare for jurors to discuss their experiences and they are barred by law from talking about what went on in the jury room. But Julie, Anne-Marie, Paul and Emma have agreed to talk about their 20 months in the courtroom. In order to protect their identity, we are only using their first names and only Paul agreed to be photographed from the front. Edwin McLaren (right) with his wife Lorraine were charged with property fraud The jurors first met when the trial of Edwin McLaren and his wife Lorraine for property fraud began at the High Court in Glasgow in September 2015. It was a complex case with 29 charges and the jurors were told it would last up to six months. When it finally finished on 16 May this year, the court had sat for 320 days over 20 months. Guilty verdicts were returned on McLaren, who was said to be the brains behind the scheme, and he was jailed for 11 years. His wife Lorraine was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. The trial is thought to have cost about Â£7.5m. Over its course, the jury was reduced from the original 15 for a Scottish criminal trial to 12, the lowest number it can operate on. Two found guilty of fraud after UK's longest criminal trial Couple jailed after UK's longest criminal trial Victim says: ""Fraudster was pure scum' Should there be juries in fraud cases? The trial took place at the High Court in Glasgow According to her fellow jurors, Julie was the liveliest in the initial stages. But after nearly two years sitting on the jury, she has found it hard to slot back into her old life. The 37-year-old returned to her job in a travel agency when the case finished, but quickly found herself struggling. Julie says: ""I went back and did two days training and then I went two days into the shop. I've never been back since.  I've not given it up yet. ""I am going through the doctor and trying to get back into it. I'm still struggling. I just felt like I could not even hold a conversation."" Julie describes herself as a ""people person"" and says she got to know everybody at the court, including the lawyers and the admin staff. The other jurors says she was the ""cheeriest"" of them all when they started out, but she now finds joining conversations difficult. ""You were sitting in a room listening to evidence but you didn't communicate. I'm really struggling with communication now."" Julie adds: ""There should be more psychological support made available for jurors who sit through long trials. ""The judge did a great closing speech and he couldn't have thanked us any more but it was 'thank you and goodbye',"" she says. ""That was hard, because we were like - 'what do we do now?' ""We've got the counselling number, but that also goes out to people who have sat on a jury for two days or a week. ""I just think that for that length of case there should be more support, with one-to-one counselling sessions, even before we left the court."" ""We got a letter at the start saying it was going to last six months,"" says Paul. ""We didn't think it would go for that long."" But the complex trial and its many charges dragged on well past its expected finish date. ""I thought it was going to last forever,"" Paul says. ""It just kept on going."" Paul, a 51-year-old civil servant, also says he has had trouble going back to work. ""I've had to be retrained,"" he says. ""I'm still not into the swing of things yet. I'm not talking much when I go to work. ""I think I was always talking before this trial, and now I am just sitting at my seat not really saying much."" For the first few weeks after the trial finished, Paul says he was surprised to find he missed it. He found himself walking down to the High Court building in Glasgow and going into the nearby shops. Despite his difficulties, Paul defends the principle of trial by jury. ""I think they should be tried by lay people - normal people - but I think 20 months is far too long for a trial,"" he says. Emma worked in a fast food restaurant before she sat on the jury, and while she was away missed out on the chance of getting promoted to assistant manager. However, since the trial finished the 26-year-old has decided to leave her job and take a different path. She says: ""While I was on the jury, I had time to reflect and I'm actually going to college now to study social sciences."" Emma says she suffered emotionally during the trial and was glad of the support from her fellow jurors. She says: ""I felt lost at times."" ""We've been such a support to each other, we got each other through it."" Like Julie, she thinks there should have been more support offered. ""There was nothing there for us,"" she says. ""We couldn't speak to anybody about it. I think there should have been somebody there with us because of how long it was."" The length of the trial was almost unprecedented, but it was the fact that no-one had any idea how long it would last that had the worst effect. ""That was one of the problems for us all,"" Emma says. ""We couldn't look forward to it finishing because we never knew. We could never see the end of the tunnel."" Anne-Marie, the oldest of the jurors to speak to the BBC, has also struggled with returning to her work as a civil servant after the trial. The 57-year-old says: ""I've worked in the same place for 40 years, but I feel as if it is alien to me."" Like all the others she feels the experience of having ""our lives taken over for 20 months"" has changed her. She says: ""It was a totally different way of life for 20 months, and then the day it finished you are back to what is supposed to be normal and it is difficult to adjust. ""Nobody realises the impact it has on everybody's lives."" For Anne-Marie, the hardest thing was no longer being part of a group of 12 who had spent so much time together for 20 months. ""Sometimes you are in that room together for hours on end. The jury are never told what is happening. ""Even when we were sat on the jury if someone needed the toilet we all went. We did everything together."" ""The routine of going in every morning, and it's the same people in the same room, and you leave at night and you know it will be the same tomorrow. ""To be on my own now at work, it just feels strange. I've worked there for many years but I don't feel I belong there at the moment."" Anne-Marie said she had been back at work for nine weeks but was still retraining. She says: ""Everyone is very nice. It is nothing to do with work, it is just me personally. I don't feel I belong there any more."" During the lengthy trial, three of the jury dropped out, leaving the final 12 knowing that the trial would collapse if any of them gave up. Anne-Marie says: ""My husband was quite ill for part of it and they did give me time off for hospital appointments, but you felt you didn't want to ask because we wanted to be there, we wanted it to carry on, we wanted to get to a conclusion because we'd all gone so far. ""We wanted to see it to the end. It was an added responsibility when it went to 12."" Anne-Marie and the others all agree that lessons could be learned from their experiences for any future long trial. But she says: ""There will never be lessons learned because they won't come back and ask us.""

"Graham's doctor suggested he join a local walking group in Stockport two years ago. Graham Ward was 60 when he was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes. It came after decades of eating and drinking too much in a high-stress, sedentary job: ""It was an explosion waiting to happen,"" he said. For Graham, whose wife had become increasingly disabled through multiple sclerosis, the diagnosis was a wake-up call. ""I need to be able to help her - and I need to be around for longer,"" he said. Graham is not alone in his diagnosis. Public Health England estimates that 42% of 45- to 64-year-olds have a long-term health condition such as diabetes or heart disease. This week,it urged middle-aged people to walk more often and more briskly. It is encouraging those between the ages of 40 and 60 to start doing regular brisk walks of just 10 minutes a day. One in five middle-aged people is physically inactive, engaging in less than 30 minutes of exercise a week, it says. To help, the government agency is promoting a free app -Active 10,external- which can monitor the amount of brisk walking an individual does and provide tips on how to incorporate more of it into the daily routine. When he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2015, Graham, pictured here with his wife, weighed 18 stone When Graham was diagnosed as a diabetic, he realised he needed to make changes: ""My clothes were getting tighter, and I was hearing how being overweight could affect my life and health in other ways,"" he said. Diabetes has been linked to other issues such as heart disease, stroke and kidney disease, causing a reduction in one's life expectancy. He said beforehand he had managed to turn a blind eye to this. ""When someone is in front of you telling you it's you, there's nowhere to hide,"" he said. ""They're not talking about the other millions of people out there."" Graham's doctor suggested he should join a local walking group in Stockport. ""I started and I was a bit nervous. With a couple of hills, it was more walking than I'd been doing,"" he said. He was talked into the 1.9 mile walk by the group leader. ""After the first time, I overcame all those fears."" He invested in a pair of new shoes and gradually increased his walks to reach five miles. Over a period of months, Graham graduated from walking three kilometres to eight kilometres ""It was a very quick improvement, once you realise after the first one or two that you don't become immediately breathless and that you can walk further from home than you thought,"" said Graham. ""I moved on from walking with that group, to walking by myself, walking further distances and the pounds started falling off me."" He used a pedometer to make sure he was reaching the recommended 10,000 steps a day. Now he does about 15,000 steps and has lost 50lb. ""My trousers were falling off me. I had to throw away all the clothes I owned,"" he said. Graham said the benefits were not only physical. ""I'm fitter, healthier, more confident.  When you start walking you see things in your area that you haven't seen before, such as discovering canal towpaths."" His advice to others is not to be ""disappointed if it doesn't happen in the first few weeks"". Now, he and his wife diet and swim together. ""When I'm playing with my grandchildren now, it's them that get tired before me,"" Graham said.

"The new Queensferry Crossing will open on Wednesday 30 August The Queensferry Crossing has opened to traffic for the first time, kicking off a week of events to celebrate the completion of the new Â£1.35bn bridge over the river Forth. The man behind the building project, Michael Martin, said the new crossing was ""one of the world's great bridges"". The new 1.7 miles (2.7km) publicly-funded crossing is the biggest infrastructure project in Scotland in a generation and will replace the Forth Road Bridge as the main road route between Edinburgh and Fife, carrying 24 million vehicles a year. The existing road bridge, built in 1964 and dogged by maintenance problems, will continued to be used by cycles, pedestrians and eventually buses. The iconic 19th Century Forth Bridge , which carries the railway over the river, lies just a mile away. Saturday 2 & Sunday 3 September About 50,000 members of the public, who were given tickets in a ballot, will get a ""once in a lifetime"" chance to walk over the new bridge on Saturday and Sunday. Monday 4 September The Queen will officially open the Queensferry Crossing. The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will bless the bridge, and the Queen will cut a ribbon on the south side. Tuesday 5 September A further 10,000 local people and school children will be given the opportunity to walk the bridge. Thursday 7 September The bridge will re-open to traffic, with no pedestrian access. The initial speed limit will be 40mph but after work has been completed to adapt the Forth Road Bridge public transport will be switched back to the old bridge and the Queensferry Crossing will become a 70mph motorway. Jim McTaggart takes his 1940 Piper Cub over the Forth Rail Bridge, the Forth Road Bridge and the new Queensferry Crossing The current Forth Road Bridge has been beset by problems since corrosion was found in its steel cables more than a decade ago. The decision to replace it was taken in 2007, with construction of the new crossing beginning in September 2011. Two years ago, the Forth Road Bridge was forced to close completely for three weeks while engineers repaired a serious defect in the metalwork, again underlining the need for the new bridge. The Queensferry Crossing, the longest three-tower, cable-stayed bridge in the world, will take the vast bulk of the current load and unlike the existing bridge it is expected to remain open in all weathers. Designers say3.5m-high wind shields have been placed along each side of the bridge, which have been tested against the stormiest of conditions. The other Forth bridge - 50 years of the remarkable road crossing Transport Scotland project director David Climie told BBC Scotland: ""We expect the wind shields to almost entirely eliminate the need for closures during the frequent periods of high winds in the Forth estuary, apart from in exceptional circumstances. ""This will increase the resilience of what will be the main crossing over the Forth estuary in future."" This video can not be played Engineers proud of 'state-of-the-art' bridge Mike Glover, who has managed the bridge project for the decade since it was first approved, told the BBC the crossing would last at least 120 years because its design would make it easy to maintain. The civil engineer said there were two main reasons for predicting such longevity. ""The first is that the exterior of the bridge is a continuous structure - it is a box - which means the level of maintenance that is required is very minimal, unlike the trusses on the current suspension bridge,"" Mr Glover said. ""The second is because the individual cables that make up the cable-stay bridge each one can be replaced without the stability of the bridge being in doubt. ""Whereas with the suspension bridge any problem with that suspension cable means that the bridge would have to be closed."" The deck of the new bridge will have two lanes in each direction as well as hard shoulders to ensure that breakdowns do not cause congestion. Designers claim this will also allow buses to be moved from the Forth Road Bridge in high winds or other dangerous weather conditions. As the new bridge will be a designated motorway, it means learner drivers and motorbikes under 50cc will not be allowed on it. Mr Glover told the BBC that travelling across the new bridge would be much smoother than the current one, because it only has two joints on the whole deck. ""That means the whole road surface is continuous, no bumps, no disruption, just silence,"" he says. ""The existing road bridge is made up of sections which are 60ft long and therefore you have in excess of 100 individual joins, which causes the bumps as you go across it. ""Not only is it uncomfortable for motorists but actually it causes a lot of fatigue damage in the bridge itself."" This video can not be played The new Â£1.35bn Queensferry Crossing comes to life in multi-colour. In the early stages of planning the bridge it was suggested it would cost Â£2bn but by the time the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors (FCBC) group began building in 2011 the price range was Â£1.45bn to Â£1.6bn. Two years later the Scottish government announced the range had been lowered to Â£1.4bn - Â£1.45bn. John Swinney, the finance secretary at the time, said the lower cost was a result of ""successful management"" and the ""delivery of key milestones"". Mr Swinney also announced the new bridge, which has been completely publicly funded, would be toll-free like all other road bridges in Scotland. The projected cost of the new bridge was reduced again in October 2014 when the upper limit was lowered by Â£50m to Â£1.4bn. Nicola Sturgeon, who was then deputy first minister, said the project would be completed by the end of 2016. The final cost of the bridge is said to be Â£1.35bn, well within budget, but the opening date has slipped by nine months, mainly due to the weather. The bridge's technical director Mike Glover said the weather in the Firth of Forth had been ""particularly unkind"", especially at the point when they were 200m in the air attaching cables. More than 15,000 people have been involved in the project since the inception of plans for a new bridge in 2007. The structure is 207m above high tide (683ft), equivalent to about 48 double decker buses stacked on top of each other. It is 50m (25%) higher than the existing Forth Road Bridge The steel required for the bridge deck weighs a total of 35,000 tonnes - equivalent to almost 200 Boeing 747s The combined steel required for North and South viaducts weighs 7,000 tonnes - enough to make another 23 Kelpies. The bridge has windshielding to almost entirely eliminate the need for closures during the frequent periods of high winds in the Forth estuary Cables can be replaced with more ease than on the Forth Road Bridge - it can be done as part of normal maintenance works without closing the bridge. The foundations of the bridge are large caisson - circular steel structures - sunk into the mud of the estuary to bedrock level. The south caisson is the height of the Statue of Liberty. It is 35m in diameter and when it was constructed it was 50m in height. At the southern tower they poured 16,000 cubic metres of concrete over a period of 15 days continuously from barges on the river. Members of the public will get the chance to walk across the bridge before its official opening Once it is fully operational there will be no pedestrian access to the bridge, instead people will be able to walk across the existing Forth Road Bridge. However, an online ballot was held to select 50,000 people to walk across the new crossing on the weekend of Saturday 2 and Sunday 3 September. The ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity attracted applications from more than 226,000 people, mainly from Scotland. About 5,180 people entered have postcodes from elsewhere in the UK and the remaining 437 are from the rest of the world, including the United States, India and one single entrant from Slovakia. In addition to this, a further 10,000 people from local schools and community groups on both sides of the Forth will be able to walk on the bridge on Tuesday 5 September, the day after its official opening by the Queen. The Queen formally opened the Forth Road Bridge in 1964 The Queen will open the bridge on Monday 4 September, exactly 53 years after she opened the Forth Road Bridge. It has also been announced that she will be accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh,in his first official appearance alongside the Queen since retiring from solo engagements. Other events on the day will include a welcome address by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and a blessing by the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Scotland's Makar, Jackie Kay, will read a poem specially commissioned for the occasion and there will be live music performances.

"This video can not be played The two drivers of the lorries have been arrested Six men and two women have died in a crash involving a minibus and two lorries on the M1 near Milton Keynes. All of those who died were travelling in the minibus, which was from the Nottingham area. A five-year-old girl, a woman and a man are being treated in hospital with life-threatening injuries, while another woman has serious injuries. The two lorry drivers have been arrested, one of them on suspicion of driving while over the alcohol limit. Both men are being questioned on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and are in police custody. The crash happened on the southbound M1 at Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire just before 03:15 BST. South Central Ambulance Service said those injured in the collision were taken to hospitals in Milton Keynes, Coventry and Birmingham. Police said some of those involved in the collision were visiting the UK from India. The road was closed for many hours while the vehicles involved were recovered All eight people who died were passengers on the minibus, police said The crash happened on the southbound carriageway of the M1 at Newport Pagnell near Milton Keynes The vehicles were all travelling in the same direction between junctions 15 and 14, police said. Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes Fire and Rescue Service said it had sent six crews as well as three search and rescue vehicles to the scene.

"According to the Mail on Sunday,external, the prime minister has launched an outspoken war on fat cat bosses - executives whose salaries outstrip the performance of their companies. Writing in the paper, Theresa May accuses them of damaging ""the social fabric"" and emboldening those on the far left who ""advocate state control of industry"". She proposes that if one in five shareholders complain about an executive's pay deal they should be named in a public register - with the risk that investors will take their money elsewhere. But the Mail says the measures are a slimmed down version of wider curbs promised by Mrs May in the past. It claims that Chancellor Philip Hammond vetoed putting workers' representatives on boards. And the prime minister is criticised by one of her own MPs, George Freeman, who accuses her of ""flirting with anti-capitalism"". The lead in the Sunday Times is also concerned with fat cats,external- this time in the education sector. Former Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw and Lord Adonis, who used to be a Labour schools minister, are calling for ministers to impose limits on the money earned by academy bosses. The paper says more than 100 of them are receiving more than Â£150,000, the salary paid to the prime minister. And it points out that some of these are overseeing schools where children performed poorly in GCSEs and A-levels. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Photos of the horrific crash on the M1 can be found in many of the papers, including theDaily Star Sunday,externalwhich shows the flattened wreckage of the minibus.

The Observer believes Labour's new Brexit policy,externalcould transform the debate. It says the party's election manifesto pledge - to retain the benefits of the single market while promising to end freedom of movement - lacked clarity. The paper welcomes Labour's new promise to keep the UK in the single market and customs union during a transitional period, arguing this is the only short-term position that makes sense. It says it is now down to moderate, pragmatic Conservative MPs to rally behind Labour to bring realism to the Brexit process. The Sun on Sunday blames EU negotiators,externalfor a stalemate in the Brexit negotiations. It says it is clear they are determined to make the talks all about Britain's exit bill, before adding that as anyone in any divorce will testify you cannot agree the settlement until you have worked out the terms. It thinks Mrs May needs to bang some heads together by making a strong speech warning Brussels will not get a blank cheque from the UK. The Sunday Express focuses on the background,externalof one of the latest contestants on the Great British Bake Off.

"Police said the elderly woman's attacker spoke with a local accent An 88-year-old woman suffered a ""brutal and sustained assault"" by a man as she slept in her bed, police have said. She was woken up at about 00:30 BST on Saturday at her home in Chorley, Lancashire, to find the man assaulting her and demanding money. The attacker pulled her from the bed and continued the assault before ransacking her house. A 35-year-old man from Chorley has been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary. The victim is being treated at Wigan Hospital for non life-threatening injuries, police said. After her attacker ran off, she managed to crawl to a neighbour's house in Aspen Gardens and police were called. Det Insp Warren Atkinson, of Lancashire Police, said: ""This was a brutal and sustained assault on an elderly lady in her own home. ""The level of gratuitous violence used on this vulnerable woman simply beggars belief and it is a miracle she was not more seriously injured."" Police arrested the man following an ""incredible response"" from the public to an appeal for information.

Police in Truro said they ""strongly disagree"" with the tweet. Sgt Tangye apologised earlier this month for another tweet, ofa film of a 140mph police chase. Off-duty Sgt Tangye,winner of the Police Twitter Awards in 2016,external, wrote: ""Addicted to drugs? I'm fed up with being your keeper. You knew the risks.

Sgt Tangye told BBC News the tweets were his views, not the force's, and he was referring to drug addicts who refused to get help. ""Some are quite criminal and create merry hell and they are destroying a lot of towns and cities,"" he said. ""They should accept help but some are feeding on other victims and creating other victims around them. ""I am a very 'people person' but I see the same names time and time again destroying areas.""

Devon and Cornwall Police said in a statement that ""social media interaction"" by officers with the public ""is vital"" and ""there has been, and no doubt in the future will be examples of posts and subjects discussed, some of which can be controversial"". It added: ""The issue of addiction is hugely complex; understanding and tackling this is something that takes the resources and efforts of a number of public bodies and not just the police."" And it said despite ""personal frustrations"" from officers seeing the negative effects of addiction, ""we as a force will always expect our officers to work with and support those who need our help, and to signpost those in need of specialist care towards the appropriate body"". The BBC approached a number of drugs charities but none wanted to comment. However, a former addict who is now a volunteer at the Narcotics Anonymous helpline said his family's ""tough love"" helped him recover. ""I was one of those troublemakers,"" he said. ""Most drug addicts are in denial and for years I did not think I had a problem. ""It was only when my family stopped enabling me, stopped putting a roof over my head, that I accepted responsibility that it was my problem and I did something about it.

"Aldi has apologised after customers in some Midlands stores were charged twice for purchases made this month. The company said a ""processing error"" led to a number of its customers at ""some"" stores in the Midlands being charged a second time on Thursday for purchases made on 4 and 7 August. Some 4% of all transactions made in the UK on those dates were affected by the technical fault, Aldi said. All affected customers were reimbursed within 24 hours, the supermarket added. When asked if customers would be refunded for any overdraft fees they might have incurred, a spokesman for the company said it was advising customers to contact their bank.

"The alcohol content of Carling - one of the most popular lagers in the UK - is weaker than advertised, it has emerged. Carling advertises the lager as 4% alcohol by volume (ABV) but it has been brewed at 3.7% since 2012, its US owners Molson Coors have said. ABV was reduced in order to cut tax on Carling products, the firm said during a hearing brought by HMRC. Molson Coors said beer was allowed to have a natural variation of 0.5%, and said customers had not been misled. There is no suggestion Molson Coors has broken any laws. Beer brewed in the UK is subject to excise duty decided by its alcoholic strength - meaning stronger products pay higher rates of tax. According todocuments from the tax tribunal,external- held in February and March this year - HMRC argued Carling had underpaid tax by more than Â£50m between 1 September 2012 and 31 January 2015. It claimed the owners of Carling should have paid tax according to the 4% alcohol strength stated on cans, bottles and other products. However, the firm successfully argued the actual strength of the lager meant it was right to pay less tax. Giving evidence to the tribunal, Philip Rutherford, vice president of tax for Molson Coors Europe, argued Carling it should pay tax on ""the actual ABV of the beer"" rather than the one stated on the label. According to the papers, Mr Rutherford told the tribunal the ""key driver"" behind the decision not to change the labelling on Carling products was to stop retailers - including supermarkets and pub chains - demanding ""a slice"" of the savings. The tribunal found in favour of Molson Coors. According to EU laws relating to the labelling of alcohol, products are allowed an ABV tolerance of +0.5% or -0.5% on products between 1.2% and 5.5% ABV. Molson Coors said Carling customers have not been misled. ""As a major brand, the trust of our consumers is paramount. We abide by all legal requirements in the brewing and labelling of Carling,"" it said in a statement. ""The natural process of brewing means all batches of Carling vary fractionally in alcohol content - the variation range for Carling is less than a quarter of 1% (0.23%). ""It is completely normal for consumable products to have a slight variation. For example, the allowed variation for wine is 1%.""

"After the queues came the recriminations. When supermarket Lidl offered boxes of budget booze, bargain hunters arrived early, lining up across the country in their hundreds, in search of cheap prosecco to toast the bank holiday weekend. But with limited supply and purchase restrictions in place, many intrepid fizz-hunters were left empty-handed and feeling flat. And cross. Some were very cross indeed. Allow Twitter content?

Shoppers claimed stores had sold out as early as 8am, with many complaining that stock was too limited. Many reported that just 20 cases of prosecco were made available to each store with some feeling short changed as a result. ""Misleading of Lidl to promote all month and never mention [the sale was] limited to just twenty cases of cheap prosecco per store,"" one social media user commented, reflecting the mood of many. A spokesperson for Lidl said the deal had been limited ""to ensure as many customers as possible"" could benefit from the offer. ""We have, however, experienced unprecedented demand and sincerely apologise to anyone that hasn't been able to take advantage of the offer on this occasion.""

"Hannah Gadsby and John Robins both win Â£10,000 prize money Two separate acts have been named joint winners of the Edinburgh Comedy Awards for the first time in the history of the city's Fringe festival. Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby's show Nanette shares the Best Comedy Award with British stand-up John Robins' The Darkness of Robins. The winners saw off competition from seven other nominees, including Ahir Shah, Sophie Willan and Spencer Jones. The comedians will each receive Â£10,000 in prize money. Mr Robins' show focused on the end of his relationship with fellow comedian Sara Pascoe, while Ms Gadsby said Nanette would be her last outing as a stand-up. Awards director Nica Burns said the decision to have two winners was ""fitting that in the 70th anniversary year of the Fringe something extraordinary has happened"". He added: ""Both shows, which could not be more different, were hotly debated and fiercely fought for. ""Comedy has many possibilities and audiences [have] very different funny bones. These two incredibly talented winners make you laugh and touch your heart. ""And yes, they will both receive Â£10,000 each so it's been an expensive year. In the 37 years of the lastminute.com Edinburgh Comedy Awards this has never happened before and it is unlikely it will ever happen again.""

"This video can not be played The BBC's James Cook found a scene of devastation in Rockport Texas will be hit by ""catastrophic and life-threatening flooding"", the US National Hurricane Center has warned, as Tropical Storm Harvey moves inland. Harvey battered the coast as a category four hurricane - the biggest to strike the US mainland in 13 years. It has now been downgraded. Some residents are feared to be trapped in collapsed buildings and there have been widespread power outages. Torrential rains are expected for days. One person has died in a house fire. The victim, in the city of Rockport, was found after the storm moved inland, officials said. Up to 40in (101cm) of rain could fall in some areas of the middle and upper Texas coast,the hurricane center (NHC) warned,external. Several places are already reported to have received well over 10in. Coastal areas will also be flooded by storm surges during high tide, the NHC said. In pictures: Harvey batters Texas The storm slammed into Texas with winds of up to 130mph Earlier, Harvey made a double landfall: north-east of the city of Corpus Christi initially late on Friday local time, then just north of Rockport a few hours later. When the storm struck close to Corpus Christi it had winds of up to 130mph (215km/h), but by 18:00 GMT its sustained winds had dropped to 70mph - therefore becoming a tropical storm. It was moving at an extremely low speed - 2mph. Texas Governor Greg Abbott told a news conference that there had been 20in of rain in Corpus Christi and 16in in Houston - but another 20-30in was expected on top of that. Utility companies say nearly 300,000 customers are without electricity. The BBC's James Cook was in Corpus Christi when the hurricane hit. Although the wind was screeching all night, he says, in the morning there was no sign of any serious structural damage there. President Donald Trump has freed up federal aid for the worst-affected areas and Governor Abbott praised the administration for ""stepping up"". In a teleconference with cabinet members Mr Trump ""emphasised his expectations that all departments and agencies stay fully engaged and positioned to support his number one priority of saving lives"", the White House said. At least 18 people have been rescued from vessels in distress by Coast Guard helicopters, the Associated Press reports. ABC Newshas tweeted,externala video of four people being rescued off the coast of Port Aransas. Rockport, normally home to about 10,000 people, appears to have been the hardest hit town. The roof of a housing centre for elderly people there collapsed, trapping people, 10 of whom were later taken to a county jail for treatment, according to local TV station KIII. Emergency services said a school, a hotel and other buildings had also suffered structural damage. Rockport residents had been told to leave Several light planes were badly damaged at Rockport Airport Before the storm arrived, Mayor Patrick Rios had a stark warning for anyone who refused to leave town: ""We're suggesting if people are going to stay here, mark their arm with a Sharpie pen with their name and Social Security number."" When the storm struck near Rockport, wind speeds were 125mph. Authorities have not been able to inspect the full extent of the damage. This video can not be played Tornadoes caused much damage as the hurricane made landfall Travis Pettis, a reporter with the Caller Times newspaper in Corpus Christi, told the BBC that strong winds when the storm arrived made the rain feel like ""needles"". ""It was pretty crazy out there. The winds, I don't know what [speed] they topped at but you could barely even walk,"" he said. Trees came down in the city and power supplies were cut, but thousands of residents had heeded warnings and boarded up their homes before fleeing. This video can not be played Weather in the area for the week ahead: 'It just rains and rains and rains' Port Aransas, a city on Mustang Island, near Corpus Christi, is also reported to have extensive damage. Local media reports say a search and rescue operation is under way at a trailer park. Mr Abbott said it was obvious Texas was confronting a ""very major disaster"" and more than 1,800 military personnel will help with the clean-up. Animated guide: Hurricanes,external What is storm surge? Harvey is the first major storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. It is forecast to meander across south-east Texas until Wednesday. Oil-rich Houston, the fourth biggest city in the US, could face up to 20in of rain over the coming days. Residents there should ""not be complacent"" and should stay at home and ""ride out the storm"", Francisco Sanchez, a spokesman for Harris County's emergency management office, told the BBC.

"A man arrested outside Buckingham Palace on Friday night was brandishing a 4ft sword as he repeatedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"", police say. Dean Haydon, head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, said the man drove at a police vehicle before stopping and being confronted by three officers. CS gas was used to ""quickly"" restrain the 26-year-old, from the Luton area, who is now in custody, Cdr Haydon said. The three unarmed Westminster police officers received minor injuries. Two of them were taken to hospital after receiving cuts to their hands and forearms. Prime Minister Theresa Maytweeted,externalto praise the officers for acting ""quickly and bravely"", and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan thanked the officers for ""ensuring that not a single member of the public was injured"". Counter-terror police are investigating after the man was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and assault, and under the Terrorism Act. No members of the Royal Family were in Buckingham Palace, which is the Queen's official London residence, at the time. The incident happened outside the Mall roundabout near Spur Road - which runs along the corner of the palace grounds - at about 20:35 BST on Friday, police said. This video can not be played Video captures the police arriving on the scene A man drove a blue Toyota Prius into a restricted area near the palace and ""deliberately drove at a marked police vehicle and stopped in front of it"", Cdr Haydon said. When police confronted the man, he reached for a 4ft (122cm) sword in the passenger footwell of the car. Cdr Haydon said the struggle was ""quickly brought under control"" and that they are treating it as an isolated incident. ""It was quickly declared a terrorist incident last night,"" he said. The Met is now investigating the suspect's background and is carrying out searches in the Luton area.

"Simon Jay has been starring in Trumpageddon In Edinburgh, this is the final hectic weekend of the annual Festival Fringe. There have been 3,400 shows - some of which have delighted critics and some which definitely did not. In comedy, a rich theme has been the state of America and of the US presidency. But is satirising President Trump the definition of pointlessness? At the start of last year, comedian Simon Jay needed to decide on the show he'd work on for the 2016 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. ""This was 20 months ago so Donald Trump wasn't even Republican nominee - but I sensed comedy in him so I decided to take a punt and go for a Trump show,"" he says. ""But I think even last August the Edinburgh audience was mainly seeing Trump as a bit of a no-hoper. A year later I'm back with a show about a president."" It's probably safe to say few of the comedians satirising President Trump at Edinburgh this year have been fans of his style or his politics. But they accept that the first months of his presidency have provided huge amounts of material. In Trumpageddon, a deeply orange Jay invites his audience to a rally. The president deals peremptorily with questions then - as Jay admits - ""tends to get a bit handsy"" with women in the audience. President Trump has been a popular subject of satire since his election ""Standing on stage, I can see some people get really frightened by him. I've watched lots of his rallies online and they're big showman experiences. ""They're loud and silly and bizarre and in some ways it's like a stand-up experience already. In the 1970s, Trump could have been the American Bernard Manning."" Jay says the impersonation aspect is important but it's only part of the show. ""I use my real hair and a lot of make-up. There are some obvious things like wearing a blue suit and the strange o-shapes he makes with his fingers. ""When the audience submit questions they can be silly and crude - but Americans in particular also ask intelligent questions about energy policy or big business. ""So I need to know enough about Trump to give informed answers, alongside all the jokes. The audience knows I'm the puppeteer but they want to hear from the real Donald Trump too."" The other person in Edinburgh who's playing President Trump for an entire show is Cambridge student Jack Bolton. Trump'd is a comedy musical set in a future America where Arnold Schwarzenegger has become Vice-President. ""I think President Trump is the joke that never goes stale,"" Bolton says. ""Our story isn't dealing directly with events of 2017 but every week there are developments keeping him in the news: people want to hear about him. So he's box-office."" Jack Bolton outside a covfefe stall (Trump invented the word in a mis-typed tweet earlier this year) Adam Woolf is one of the show's writers. ""We're not trying to change people's view of him,"" he says. ""In the States people have already formed their opinions of him and that's probably largely true in Edinburgh too. Basically we're just making fun of him, we're not going to bring him down."" Jack Bolton spends part of each day in costume distributing flyers for the show to tourists on Edinburgh's Royal Mile. ""I do sometimes encounter very pro-Trump Republicans and, to be fair, most take my impersonation in their stride,"" Bolton says. ""I think even his supporters recognise he has flaws in his personality."" ""I admit I enjoyed seeing Simon Jay as Trump in our rival show in Edinburgh. It's very different because we have songs and dances but I think Trump lends himself to improv too. He's a rich source of comedy."" Unlike Jay, Jack Bolton wears a blond wig in the role. He says Alec Baldwin on Saturday Night Live has been a big influence on his portrayal. Woolf says, as a writer, it's the psychological traits he tried to capture. ""Trump always has to portray himself as a winner and repeatedly points out that he's a winner - so you build that into the script,"" Woolf explains. ""He is capable of totally dismissing the facts of any criticism made of him, which even now surprises me."" Matt Forde also impersonates Boris Johnson in his Edinburgh show Already well-known from appearances on mainstream TV, Matt Forde's show in Edinburgh is called A Show Hastily Rewritten in Light of Recent Events - Again. It's not all about Trump but, he says: ""It's an hour of stand-up about the mad chaos which has descended on the world - so there's a lot of him."" ""I find Trump in some ways a despicable individual but you have to admit he's exceptionally entertaining. ""So you can have fun with the voice and physically what he does with his shoulders and his mouth.  But there's a twin-track because you're trying to expose his politics too."" ""Another impersonation who's been a winner for me is Boris Johnson and there's a certain parallel between them. They both have constructed personas which are designed to distract. ""Both men have inherently comedic linguistic tics and bits of body language which are in part deliberate. But they're very powerful individuals - you have to extract the comedy they offer but also keep them under scrutiny."" Forde adds: ""For someone like me in Edinburgh there's a sweet spot where you say something that makes the audience laugh about a politician but it's also a point well-made with some truth behind it."" Geoff Norcott styles himself as ""the UK's only declared Conservative comedian"" At 40, Geoff Norcott is creating a niche for himself as Britain's best-known right-wing comic. He acknowledges the label is a simplification, ""but it creates a very useful dynamic with the audience"". His show at Edinburgh is called Right Leaning But Well Meaning. So will Geoff be the stand-up who stands up for Trump? ""Politics in Britain and in America are very different. I'm seen here as a Tory but in America I think I could be on one wing of the Democrats,"" he says. ""If I do start building more Trump into my act, probably it will be talking about the media's demonization of people who voted for him. ""I don't think I would do material expressly defending Donald Trump but it annoys me when voters are seen as having had malevolence in their heart. Poor Americans in particular look at Trump and genuinely see something that appeals to them. Norcott continues: ""I'm a satirist and satire has to be directed above all at people who wield power and influence - which can be different from being in political power.  It would be interesting to find comedy that's explicitly pro-Trump and I imagine in America you will find it. There are blue-collar comics there who will have very different opinions from most people performing at Edinburgh. ""There's comedy in the high-minded elitism of those who are so quick to criticise Trump-voters. As a performer, I have to watch Trump carefully because he's the US president and has huge power. ""But I also keep an eye on the cultural overlords who don't approve of him and are continually telling me to think the same things. Satire isn't all one way.""

"Can the many thorny Brexit issues be resolved by the March 2019 deadline? Before the Brexit talks and politicians' soundbites come the off-the-record briefings. So, after more work to map out the UK's exit from the EU, how will the third round of talks go? Not well, say both sides, cautioning against any big breakthroughs at the session starting on Monday. EU officials speak of a ""big gap"", unlikely to be closed any time soon. The UK predicts highly technical talks, with progress coming in later sessions. The British want to broaden the discussion to include a possible post-Brexit relationship, while the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier wants the focus to remain on his priority issues: citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligations and the Irish border. On the first, EU officials insist that theEuropean Court of Justiceis the only way to protect and enforce the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit. The British say no other country would accept a foreign court having such a role. There could be progress on less controversial elements, such as social security and the recognition of professional qualifications. Brexit: All you need to know May says UK leaving EU court jurisdiction - BBC News Italian doctor given month to leave UK Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? The UK accuses Mr Barnier of ""massively over-egging"" his demands for money. That view is shared in private by at least one other member state. A British legal analysis of the so-called Brexit bill will be on the table at the talks, along with a discussion about the UK's share in the European Investment Bank. This video can not be played Why the fuss about the European Court of Justice? The EU has welcomed the UK's acceptance that it has financial obligations - but wants details of what the UK is, and is not, willing to pay for. The Irish border is becoming emotive. A senior EU source described the UK position paper on the subject as ""magical thinking"" and cautioned against the peace process being used as ""a bargaining chip"". The chief negotiators: UK Brexit Secretary David Davis (L) and the EU's Michel Barnier There is the potential for agreement in some highly technical areas, such as legal co-operation and the transfer of nuclear material. British civil servants are proud of the flurry of papers they have produced on the future relationship between the UK and EU, in areas such as customs. Diplomats from the 27 other member states have read them with interest, but describe them as aspirations, not detailed policy proposals. However, EU negotiators have interpreted the documents as an attempt to subvert the EU's timetable. The EU aims to settle withdrawal-related issues before discussing co-operation on trade and security. ""There are sensitive political issues that need to be dealt with early, so as not to leave them open at the end, because that increases the risk of failure rather than managing it,"" warned one EU official. And while there are frequent reminders that the clock is ticking, another EU source said: ""We have not encountered a situation where lack of time prevents us from advancing, it's been a lack of substance."" Events in the UK are also being noticed. The letters threatening EU nationals with deportation sent in error by the Home Office have been discussed in Brussels, with hints that it calls into question the UK's ability to handle the technicalities of Brexit.

"It is an annoyance familiar to many drivers: you are cruising along, listening to a song or sports match, when suddenly... ""Here's your latest traffic and travel update!"" Radio traffic alerts, which interrupt a CD, tape or radio station when there is an update, are likely to sound in themillions of cars taking to UK roads for the bank holiday. Drivers have relied on alerts since the late 1980s, but may also now use modern alternatives to avoid jams - including sat-navs, mapping apps or smart motorway signs. So is the era of the ""traffic and travel update"" coming to an end? The alerts - which can be turned off quite easily in a car radio's settings - are sent via the Radio Data System (RDS) standard. RDS is a communications code in the FM signal which can be embedded into a BBC or commercial local radio broadcast. It allows a vehicle's radio to temporarily turn to a station for the duration of a travel announcement, before switching back again. They can also be indiscriminate - you might pick up alerts from several different local radio stations if you are at a high point and get a signal, for example. ""They can be annoying,"" says the AA's Ian Crowder. ""Sometimes the alert comes on and there's a load of banter from the previous speaker before they get round to the traffic update. ""I'd urge local ratio stations to stick to the traffic reports."" But Mr Crowder says that - while annoying to some - they can be ""invaluable"". And David Bizley, the RAC's chief engineer, says drivers are surprisingly enthusiastic about radio. About 72% of motorists get information about incidents and delays via the radio, according to the RAC's research. ""It appears radio is still king,"" Mr Bizley says, even though ""motorists have the likes of variable message signs and live traffic information on their sat-navs."" He adds: ""I am surprised by the high level of dependence on the radio to find out about traffic problems."" The motoring group surveyed 1,700 drivers and found just 47% use road signs and 36% their sat-nav. Bob Pishue is an economist at Inrix, the firm which provides traffic reports to most local radio stations in the UK, as well as to sat-navs and smartphone apps. ""Radio alerts are still useful for people who don't use smartphones, but we are seeing people switch,"" he says. Unlike a radio DJ announcing a traffic jam, sat-navs and smartphone apps will work out a new route for you. ""Not only can the apps route you to avoid congestion and road works but also do things like real-time parking,"" says Mr Pishue. He says navigation technology no longer has a reputation for being clunky to use, or unreliable. ""The data is getting better all the time,"" he says. In a sign the technology is now commonplace, learner driverswill have to be able to follow directions from a sat-navas part of changes to driving tests from December. Mr Pishue, however, says not everyone has - or may want - a navigation unit in their car. ""We supply traffic data all over the place, and we see a future for radio alerts,"" he says. And if technology fails, drivers can always use road signs to avoid a traffic bottleneck. As well as old-fashioned diversion signs, Highways England says it has installed electronic signs on hundreds of miles of its ""smart"" motorways, which display real-time traffic data. They can alert drivers to trafÂ­fic jams and hazÂ­ards up ahead, and are present on about 240 miles (386 km) of UK motorway. The AA's Ian Crowder warned that the signs could be ignored. ""I have concerns about how drivers react,"" he says. ""If it says congestion ahead but you can't actually see it, you don't know whether you can trust this information, especially if no one else is slowing down."" A Highways England spokesperson says: ""We give drivers as much real-time information as possible to help them with their journeys, both before they set out and while they are on the road."" Highways England nevertheless still recommends drivers tune into local radio travel bulletins. Whether they are useful, or an annoying interruption to your bank holiday soundtrack, perhaps it is not yet the end of the road for radio alerts.

"Mo Tanweer was due to become deputy head of Eton in September but has now left the college A teacher at Eton College breached exam security after pupils inadvertently got confidential information before sitting a paper, the college said. Mo Tanweer, who was head of economics and was due to become deputy head in September, has now left. The incident involved ""pre-U"" exams - an alternative to A-Levels offered at a number of British independent schools. The college said it meant pupils who sat the economics exam were awarded ""assessed marks"". In a letter to parents, headmaster Simon Henderson said the teacher had sent an email containing practice questions to three other teachers in the department, which were deemed to be ""confidential"". Mr Tanweer, was the principal examiner for pre-U economics at Cambridge International Examinations (CIE), which set the paper, Mr Henderson said, but it is not clear if he personally devised questions. The breach was revealed following an investigation by CIE into maladministration. It decided it could not accept the marks of any candidate at Eton for this paper as a result, Mr Henderson said. They were given an ""assessed mark"" instead, a procedure in which a candidate is ""missing"" a mark for an acceptable reason. Eton College said it had co-operated fully and it ""deeply regrets that this incident occurred"", adding that pupils had done nothing wrong. Mr Henderson also said it would write to all the UK universities where the exam candidates had offers to ""explain the situation"".

"Lee Evans was found dead the day after Essex Police were refused the loan of thermal imaging cameras by Essex Fire Service A missing man was found dead a day after Essex Fire Service refused to lend police thermal imaging kit to help them find him, it has emerged. The request was made by Essex Police on 13 August to help their search for 23-year-old Lee Evans, who went missing from Stanford-le-Hope. His body was found in Orsett the following day. Essex Fire Service said the refusal to lend police the cameras was the result of a ""misunderstanding"". The fire service uses high end ultra-portable thermal imaging cameras which help officers see in the dark and through thick smoke to find people in need. Each device costs thousands of pounds. It is understood Essex Police periodically asks for help or equipment in dealing with missing people searches. But the request for the thermal imaging kit to help find Mr Evans was refused, the BBC learned. Mr Evans was subsequently found hanged in woodland in Orsett. An inquest has been opened and will be heard in November. Essex Police said it had ""assigned"" an officer to investigate the ""circumstances around the request for thermal imaging equipment, and that request being declined"". ""Learning from that has been shared with the fire service,"" he said. A spokeswoman for the fire service said: ""There has been a recent policy change within Essex fire service, where the search for missing persons is beyond the national role map for firefighters. ""However, this recent policy change was never intended to deny the use of our vehicles and equipment to assist with police incidents such as this. ""This misunderstanding has subsequently been remedied."" Alan Chin-Shaw, secretary of the Essex branch of the FBU, said: ""If there is a piece of kit there that the police obviously need then it surprises me that they don't just get five or six units (imaging cameras) and keep them in the main police stations."" He said while he had no objection to police borrowing kit from the fire service, ""they should not be taken off operational fire appliances"".

Tom Price said that healthcare providers had to be ""flexible"" in helping those impacted by the storm A public health emergency has been declared in Texas in response to Hurricane Harvey. US Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said that ""necessary measures"" were being taken to ""provide immediate assistance"" to those affected by the storm.

Hurricane Katrina was a category three storm when it struck New Orleans in 2005 Harvey, that made landfall as a category four hurricane but is now a tropical storm, was the most powerful hurricane to make landfall in the US for 13 years, sinceCharleyhit Florida in August 2004.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott says that emergency services are focusing on search and rescue operations as the storm threatens to deliver up to 3ft (0.9m) of rainfall. Mr Abbott said that several searches had taken place on Saturday and would continue in the coming days despite sustained winds and torrential rain. Rescue efforts are currently focused on supporting evacuees from the Corpus Christi area, Mr Abbott said, although this area is likely to expand. About 1,000 rescuers have so far been assigned to operations. The commander of the coastguard in southeast Texas, Tony Hahn, has warned that his teams will be watching for potential chemical and crude oil spills in the area in the coming days. He said that Corpus Christi is the third largest petrochemical port in the US and that there was a risk that spills could occur as a result of possible flooding, AP news agency reports.

Tom Price said that healthcare providers had to be ""flexible"" in helping those impacted by the storm A public health emergency has been declared in Texas in response to Hurricane Harvey. US Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said that ""necessary measures"" were being taken to ""provide immediate assistance"" to those affected by the storm. In a statement,externalreleased on Saturday, Mr Price said that his office recognised the ""gravity of the situation"" and measures were being put in place that would allow ""flexibility"" to health service providers caring for those in need of medical attention.

Mr Price added that hospitals would be able to ""waive certain documentation requirements"" in order to provide care where needed. Hurricane Katrina was a category three storm when it struck New Orleans in 2005 Harvey, that made landfall as a category four hurricane but is now a tropical storm, was the most powerful hurricane to make landfall in the US for 13 years, sinceCharleyhit Florida in August 2004. Across the Atlantic, Charley killed 15 people and destroyed more than $16bn of property (in 2004 currency). Harvey is only thefourth hurricane in 48 years,externalthat has been category four or higher on reaching land. But it is not yet clear whether the damage will be on the scale of category fiveAndrew, that struck Florida 25 years ago this week, or ofKatrina(which was a category three when it devastated New Orleans). This map shows the latest projections for its route through southern Texas over the next few days.

"Members and supporters of the Angry Soldiers' Wives group pictured at the protest Several hundred women married to French soldiers are holding a demonstration in Paris to denounce the ""deplorable working conditions"" in the army. The protest was organised by the group Angry Soldiers' Wives, which has nearly 5,200 members. Mercedes CrÃ©pin, who helped set it up, said some troops on anti-terror duty were being housed in damp hangars infested with cockroaches and lice. Around 500 people were expected to join the protest,Le Figaro reported,external. After the Islamist attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the French government deployed more than 7,000 soldiers to guard prominent public places and events. French news sitesreported on Saturday,externalthat one soldier linked to the operation had shot himself dead on Friday night. Man held after car rams Paris soldiers French military head quits over cuts The military wives have several concerns - among them, the lack of support for the families of soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). ""We feel completely helpless, we do not know how to cope with the condition, how to support our men,"" said Ms CrÃ©pin, whose husband has PTSD after serving in Afghanistan. ""We want to show our discomfort, our anxiety and our anger,"" she told TV channel France 3. Ms CrÃ©pin also raised the plight of soldiers' widows, saying some are obliged to leave military housing within two to three months of losing their husbands, and get little help from the army. The army payment system is a further source of grievance. The software has reportedly left families in debt after troops were mistakenly overpaid, then asked to pay back the surplus. The demonstrators are protesting over budget cuts and conditions in the army French troops have been repeatedly targeted by attackers in recent months The Angry Soldiers' Wives demo followsa march by a similar group, Angry Police Wives, at the end of April. The wives and partners of police officers took to the streets of Paris to protest after the killing of an officer on the Champs Elysees.

"This video can not be played Parts of the central Texas coast have been battered by hurricane winds Hurricane Harvey has slammed into Texas with initial winds of up to 130mph (215km/h) battering coastal areas. The biggest storm to hit the US mainland in 13 years is moving slowly, with 16.43in (42cm) of rain reported in one area. Catastrophic flooding is expected, though Harvey's winds were downgraded from category four to category one. Some residents are feared trapped in collapsed buildings and there have been widespread power cuts. More than 200,000 customers are without electricity, utility companies say. After freeing up federal aid for the worst-affected areas, President Donald Trump praised emergency services in a tweet, saying: ""You are doing a great job - the world is watching! Be safe."" Live updates from Texas With Texas Governor Greg Abbott warning of record flooding in multiple regions, Harvey made a double landfall: north-east of the city of Corpus Christi initially, then just north of Rockport a few hours later. Rockport, normally home to about 10,000 people, appears to have been the hardest hit. Emergency services there say a number of buildings have suffered structural damage. Pictures posted on social media show collapsed trees and houses. By BBC's James Cook, Corpus Christi Harvey was pretty ferocious when it came ashore, with screeching wind all night. We saw a reasonable amount of damage being caused by debris flying through the air. There's no sign though of any serious structural damage in the immediate vicinity here in Corpus Christi. But the main concern is for the town of Rockport, where the eye of the storm came ashore. There is concern there about a number of buildings, in particular a shelter for the elderly from where people had apparently not been evacuated. When Harvey struck close to Corpus Christi, around 22:00 local time on Friday (03:00 GMT Saturday), it had winds of up to 130mph. Travis Pettis, a reporter with the Caller Times newspaper, told the BBC that strong winds when the storm arrived made the rain feel like ""needles"". In pictures: Harvey batters Texas ""It was pretty crazy out there. The winds, I don't know what [speed] they topped at but you could barely even walk,"" he said. A house that caught fire in Corpus Christi was burnt out by Saturday morning Trees came down in the city and power supplies were cut, but thousands of residents had heeded warnings and boarded up their homes before fleeing. When the storm struck again near Rockport, wind speeds had fallen slightly to 125mph. ""Right now we're still hunkered down and can't go anywhere,"" Steve Sims, Rockport's volunteer fire chief, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""We've heard rumours of 1,000 different things, we can't confirm anything because we haven't seen anything. We know we've got a lot of problems, but we don't know what yet."" This video can not be played Wind-whipped flames engulf buildings in Texas Rockport Mayor Patrick Rios said people were trapped in a housing centre for elderly people, where the roof had collapsed and rescue teams were unable to gain access, according to CBS. He had a stark warning for anyone who refused to leave town: ""We're suggesting if people are going to stay here, mark their arm with a Sharpie pen with their name and Social Security number."" At 09:00 local time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that sustained winds had fallen to a maximum of 75mph. If they drop further, Harvey will be classified as a tropical storm. Governor Abbot said it was obvious Texas was confronting a ""very major disaster"", and more than 1,000 National Guardsmen would help with the disaster relief operation. Harvey is the first major storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. It is forecast to meander across south-east Texas until Wednesday. The NHC has stressed the danger of life-threatening floods as rising water moves inland from the coastline. Meteorologists have warned Harvey could continue to dump rain until the middle of next week Oil-rich Houston, the fourth biggest city in the US, could face up to 20in of rain over the coming days. Residents there should ""not be complacent"" and should stay at home and ""ride out the storm"", Francisco Sanchez, a spokesman for Harris County's emergency management office, told the BBC. ""The most severe weather is yet to come"" in the Houston area, he said. Mr Trump is likely to visit Texas early next week, the White House said. The storm is the strongest to hit the US since Charley in August 2004 and the most powerful to hit Texas since Hurricane Carla in 1961, which killed 34 people, according to the Houston Chronicle. Animated guide: Hurricanes,external What is storm surge? Harvey has severely hampered Gulf of Mexico oil production and air travel. About 45% of US oil refining takes place on the Gulf of Mexico coast, and Corpus Christi is an important port for the industry. Crude oil production has slowed by about 20% to prepare for the storm, and fears Harvey could lead to a shortfall in fuel have helped drive up prices.

"Joe Arpaio appeared at Donald Trump's campaign rallies during his presidential bid US President Donald Trump has pardoned ex-Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had been convicted of criminal contempt. Mr Arpaio, 85, was found guilty after he defied a court order to stop traffic patrols targeting suspected immigrants. He was due to be sentenced in October. The president had hinted at the pardon  at a rally in Phoenix on Tuesday. Thanking the president, Mr Arpaio said his conviction was ""a political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department"". ""Thank you.... for seeing my conviction for what it is,""tweeted Mr Arpaio,external. ""I'm not going away,"" he said, while declining to say whether he would run for sheriff again. Mr Trump has frequently praised the former sheriff, who is known for his controversial hard-line stance on immigration. Who is Joe Arpaio? Arizona sheriff 'profiled' Hispanics What Trump's Phoenix rally taught us Mr Arpaio appeared on the campaign trail with Mr Trump in 2016 - describing him as ""the law-and-order candidate"". In a statement announcing the pardon, his first, Mr Trump said: ""Arpaio's life and career, which began at the age of 18 when he enlisted in the military after the outbreak of the Korean War, exemplify selfless public service. ""Throughout his time as sheriff, Arpaio continued his life's work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration. ""Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now 85 years old, and after more than 50 years of admirable service to our nation, he is a worthy candidate for a  presidential pardon."" Joe Arpaio, who styled himself as ""America's toughest sheriff"", rose to national prominence for his sweeps of undocumented immigrants in Hispanic communities, and for detaining Spanish-speakers under suspicion of being undocumented migrants. In July 2017, he was found guilty of violating a 2011 order to stop detaining migrants. The decision to pardon the former policeman was condemned by Democrats and civil rights groups. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said it was ""disheartening that [the president] set the bar so very low for his first pardon"". Greg Stanton, the mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, called the move a slap in the face for the Latino community and those who had been victimised. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Arpaio, born in Springfield, Massachusetts, could have faced six months in jail at his sentencing in October. He served in the US military before he became a police officer - where he quickly acquired a reputation for his anti-immigration stance and tough enforcement tactics. The former sheriff lost a bid for re-election in Arizona's Maricopa County in November 2016, after 24 years in office. Mr Arpaio famously forced the prisoners to wear pink underwear and socks and old-fashioned black-and-white striped prison jumpsuits. The inmates lived outdoors while enduring sweltering Arizona desert temperatures. He also revived chain gangs, including a voluntary one for female prisoners.

"North Korea has tested a number of missiles in recent months North Korea has fired three short-range ballistic missiles, the US military says. They were launched from a site in the North Korean province of Gangwon and flew for about 250km (150 miles), officials in South Korea said. Since firing an intercontinental ballistic weapon last month, Pyongyang has threatened to aim missiles at the US Pacific territory of Guam. But this latest test did not threaten the US or Guam, the US military said. North Korean missile tests often come in response to South Korean military exercises involving the US. Thousands of US and South Korean troops are currently taking part in joint military drills, which are mainly largely computer-simulated exercises. The projectiles were launched at 06:49 on Saturday (21:49 GMT Friday), South Korea's defence ministry said. The US military initially reported that two of the missiles had failed but, according to its later assessment, one appears to have blown up almost immediately while two flew about 250km (155 miles) in a north-easterly direction. The launches were spread over a period of 30 minutes, an official said. The South Korean defence ministry said: ""The military is keeping a tight surveillance over the North to cope with further provocations."" The two Koreas are technically still at war as the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice. Read more: Is the new missile test a game-changer? Can the US defend itself against North Korea?

However, that's exactly where former international star Gill Burns is based ahead of Saturday'sWomen's Rugby World Cupfinal at Belfast's Kingspan stadium. Due to a last-minute hiccup in camping arrangements, the rugby royal had to make alternative sleeping plans, but she is very much at home in her sporty surroundings.

Gill Burns began playing rugby in 1987 and was part of the England team who won the World Cup in 1994 ""It was then time to do a frantic search on the internet and I found Malone Rugby Club, contacted the president, Patrick Baird, and he saved the day. ""There are seven of us, and we were happy enough to camp outside under canvas, but he said why not stay inside because there's bad weather coming in? ""Looking at thethunder and lightningon Wednesday, I'm glad we did!"" Travelling with other former international players, Ms Burns, who is originally from Prescot, Merseyside, said ""glamping"" at Malone Rugby Club was a ""real treat"".

Ms Burns is confident her national team can win the World Cup final against New Zealand on Saturday ""We flew to countries like New Zealand to play and we had to pay our own way. ""You bought your own shirt, you paid your own hotel accommodation - we didn't have the money our male counterparts had.

""New Zealand have looked fantastic up to this point, and England have had some hard games, but they've played some canny rugby,"" she said. ""We're going to have a very fresh side for the final, so it's going to be a close game, but I think England are going to do it."" Having been involved in the sport for 30 years, the 53-year-old said she had seen ""massive changes in the game"". ""When I started playing women's rugby in England it was in its infancy,"" she said.

"Protesters rallied outside a US army career centre in New York in June US President Donald Trump has signed a memo reinstating a ban on transgender people serving in the military, which was lifted under Barack Obama. The memo also halts the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active personnel. But Mr Trump left Defence Secretary Jim Mattis to decide whether to retain existing transgender recruits. The ban, justified on grounds of cost and disruption, faces a legal challenge by transgender rights activists. ""This policy is a shameful slap in the face to people who put their lives on the line everyday to defend our country...""  said Jennifer Levi, an official at Glad (GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders), in astatement,external. ""We are moving quickly with our plaintiffs to see that a court puts a stop to this latest demonstration of President Trump playing politics with people's lives."" Between 4,000 and 10,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are believed to be transgender. Transgender troops react to ban Why does the US military buy so much Viagra? The secret life of a transgender airman After the Obama administration announced last year that they would be allowed to serve openly in the military, many active duty members came out. The memo was widely anticipated followingtweets Mr Trump made about the issue last month. Mr Trump directed the military to ""return to the longstanding policy and practice on military service by transgender individuals prior to June 2016"". He suggested that his predecessor in the White House had not thought through whether the policy would ""hinder military effectiveness and lethality, [or] disrupt unit cohesion"". This video can not be played Riley Dosh explains why she wants to defend her country He said he had done the Pentagon a ""great favor"" by banning transgender troops, saying the issue had been ""complicated"" and ""confusing"" for the military. The Obama-era policy had included a provision for the military to provide medical help for service members wanting to change gender. In his memo, Mr Trump directed the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to stop using government funds for sex-reassignment procedures unless it was necessary to ""protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex"".

It reports that the number of those in the independent sector taking Btec vocational qualifications has doubled in the past four years. Julian Thomas, master at Wellington College, tells the paper that spiralling university fees have led to ""greater questioning of whether or not university is the right route for everyone"". In an editorial,external, the paper welcomes the move and says the significant rise in students taking vocational exams instead of A-levels signifies that ""change is in the air"". But it warns that for the country that built the Spitfire, Britain is still a ""technical education laggard"". Both theTimes,externaland theFT Weekend,externalcarry reports that British Airways has criticised the Home Office over the long delays faced by some air travellers at passport control in UK airports. The Times says the airline claimed that at Heathrow's Terminal 5, two-thirds of the electronic gates that are supposed to speed up passport checks were routinely closed. The Daily Mirror,external, which also has the story, sums it up in the headline ""borderline farce"".

George Freeman criticises the party's failure to champion business and warns that ministers must back ""insurgent capitalism"" and convince a new generation of its benefits.

""Eton rocked by scandal of leaked exams,""says the Guardian on its front page,external. It reports that a deputy head teacher at the school has left amid allegations that he circulated questions from a forthcoming economics exam to other teachers before a test for sixth-formers.

"Killer Sammi Ozone said Nicholas Daher had a 'devil face' A man who stabbed his father-in-law to death after ""seeing the devil"" has been jailed for eight years. Syrian businessman Nicholas Daher, 85, was attacked in Letchworth on 4 January. Sammi Ozone, 60, said ""I've just saved my children from the devil"" after stabbing his wife Samur's father in the kitchen of their Whitethorn Lane home. He wascleared of murderon grounds of diminished responsibility but admitted the killing. Luton Crown Court was told Ozone finally ""flipped"" while his father-in-law was in the UK to visit his family. After attacking his victim, he then stabbed himself and was rushed to Lister Hospital in Stevenage. Nicholas Daher was stabbed to death by his son-in-law at the latter's home in Whitethorn Lane There, from his hospital bed, he asked an officer who was guarding him: ""Is the devil alive? I didn't mean to do it. I saw the devil in front of me."" He later told police his father-in-law had a devil face. He said: ""He was evil. He was mad. He laughed at every step in our life."" Sentencing Ozone earlier, Judge Michael Kay QC said he accepted Mr Daher could be ""dismissive"" about his son-in-law's efforts to provide for his daughter and grandchildren. ""He was critical of your business skills,"" he said, adding that as a former military man, Mr Daher had a ""sharpness"" to his manner which could make Ozone feel very small. Judge Kay said it was not clear if Ozone had believed he was seeing a ""mixture"" of the devil and Mr Daher or a figure he thought was the devil. The judge added it was agreed that Ozone had been suffering from a ""clinical depressive disorder"" that had resulted in a psychotic episode during which he had stabbed his father-in-law.

"As many as 40,000 householders sought help from Citizens Advice last year on home improvement jobs, mostly for shoddy workmanship. Roofing and fitted kitchens were the worst offenders, attracting nearly 5,000 complaints each. In one case, a builder failed to finish work on the roof, leading to thousands of pounds' worth of water damage. In another typical example, a kitchen contractor disappeared, leaving no doors on the cupboards. The top five building jobs which caused problems were: Roofing - 4,971 cases Fitted kitchens - 4,766 cases Fitted windows and doors - 3,879 cases Plumbers - 3,210 cases Driveways, patios and decking - 3,116 cases ""People trying to improve their homes are finding them in a worse state than before they started,"" said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice.

"This video can not be played Police cordon off the street where troops were attacked A man has been shot dead after attacking soldiers with a machete in Brussels, in what prosecutors are treating as a terror attack. The Somali attacker, aged 30, died in hospital. One of the soldiers suffered a hand injury. Photographs show the street cordoned off with police and troops in the area. Soldiers have become a familiar sight on the streets of the Belgian capital since terror attacks which killed more than 30 people last year. The attack took place on Boulevard Emile Jacqmain in the centre of the city. Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said the attacker had not been ""known for terrorist activities"" but had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"" in Arabic) during the assault. The man attacked two soldiers with a large knife in the centre of Brussels The area on Boulevard Emile Jacqmain has been cordoned off by police Witness Ryan MacDonaldâwrote,externalon Twitter that he had heard the sound of a gunshot before seeing a ""heavy police presence outside"".

Earlier reports spoke of two soldiers being injured in Friday's attack but only one was confirmed to have been wounded. The attacker was born in 1987. He came to Belgium in 2004 and was granted asylum after five years, followed by citizenship in 2015, prosecutors say. He had been living in the city of Bruges. Not known for any terror-related activities, he was charged with assault and battery in February. No details were given. A fake firearm and two copies of the Koran were found among his possessions. The presence of soldiers on the streets of Brussels is part of a large-scale security operation designed to reassure the public in the wake of terrorist attacks in the city in March 2016 in which 32 people were killed. Brussels marks bomb attacks anniversary In June,a soldier shot dead a man who had tried to bomb a Brussels train station.

"Schools which struggled with new GCSE exams and saw grades dip as a result will be looked upon sympathetically by education officials, it is understood. Heads' leader Malcolm Trobe said it was understood at ""ministerial level"" that caution was required before rushing to judge schools on these results alone. GCSE results dropped slightly in Englandafter pupils sat new, tougher exams in English and maths. Mr Trobe said schools' widely differing results now needed to be digested. He said the union of which he is the deputy general secretary, the Association of School and College Leaders, had been holding talks at the highest level about judging the ability of schools to cope with the new exams. It had had ""extensive discussions"" with the Department for Education, including Nick Gibb the schools minister and chief inspector of schools Amanda Spielman, ""related to the variations you might get in English and maths"", he said. ""There's an understanding at ministerial level that there will be some individual variations, school by school, as a consequence of that and that this needs to be taken into account in any decisions about school performance."" These variations in results, which are referred to by exam boards as ""centre volatility"", are often hidden by the averages and statistics published at a national level. In England, schools are held to account for their performance in school league tables, in which their exam results are published. Those falling below a certain level in terms of results and progress can become candidates for intervention for improvement. One governor, who did not wish to be named, at a school in a deprived part of northern England, said the school had received very disappointing GCSE results in English literature after a number of years in which results had been improving. Under pressure: Candidates have been sitting some new, tougher exams in England and Wales There were numerous other schools nearby that were keeping very quiet about the issue, he added. Earlier this year, the Education Secretary Justine Greening wrote to the then chair of the parliamentary education select committee, Ian Carmichael, saying that the government's GCSE plan was to raise education standards. ""The new GCSEs are more challenging and will provide stronger qualifications for our children,"" Ms Greening said. ""I am clear that these are the right reforms, and we must implement them in a way that is fair to all children, enabling them to achieve their potential whilst also holding schools to account at an ambitious level."" But she also stressed, in the letter, that school performance should be judged on a range of measures. This might include progress in a number of GCSE subjects, attainment, and ""destination"" measures in performance tables, rather than just GCSEs in English and maths. She added that the main measure by which schools are judged will continue to be Progress 8. That is a measure of pupils' progress across their eight best GCSEs, not just the key subjects alone.

"This video can not be played Parts of the central Texas coast have been battered by hurricane winds Hurricane Harvey has slammed into Texas with initial winds of up to 130mph (215km/h) battering coastal areas. The biggest storm to hit the US mainland in 13 years is moving slowly, with 16.43in (42cm) of rain reported in one area. Catastrophic flooding is expected, though Harvey's winds were downgraded from category four to category one. Some residents are feared trapped in collapsed buildings and there have been widespread power cuts. More than 200,000 customers are without electricity, utility companies say. After freeing up federal aid for the worst-affected areas, President Donald Trump praised emergency services in a tweet, saying: ""You are doing a great job - the world is watching! Be safe."" Live updates from Texas With Texas Governor Greg Abbott warning of record flooding in multiple regions, Harvey made a double landfall: north-east of the city of Corpus Christi initially, then just north of Rockport a few hours later. Rockport, normally home to about 10,000 people, appears to have been the hardest hit. Emergency services there say a number of buildings have suffered structural damage. Pictures posted on social media show collapsed trees and houses. By BBC's James Cook, Corpus Christi Harvey was pretty ferocious when it came ashore, with screeching wind all night. We saw a reasonable amount of damage being caused by debris flying through the air. There's no sign though of any serious structural damage in the immediate vicinity here in Corpus Christi. But the main concern is for the town of Rockport, where the eye of the storm came ashore. There is concern there about a number of buildings, in particular a shelter for the elderly from where people had apparently not been evacuated. When Harvey struck close to Corpus Christi, around 22:00 local time on Friday (03:00 GMT Saturday), it had winds of up to 130mph. Travis Pettis, a reporter with the Caller Times newspaper, told the BBC that strong winds when the storm arrived made the rain feel like ""needles"". In pictures: Harvey batters Texas ""It was pretty crazy out there. The winds, I don't know what [speed] they topped at but you could barely even walk,"" he said. A house that caught fire in Corpus Christi was burnt out by Saturday morning Trees came down in the city and power supplies were cut, but thousands of residents had heeded warnings and boarded up their homes before fleeing. When the storm struck again near Rockport, wind speeds had fallen slightly to 125mph. ""Right now we're still hunkered down and can't go anywhere,"" Steve Sims, Rockport's volunteer fire chief, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""We've heard rumours of 1,000 different things, we can't confirm anything because we haven't seen anything. We know we've got a lot of problems, but we don't know what yet."" This video can not be played Wind-whipped flames engulf buildings in Texas Rockport Mayor Patrick Rios said people were trapped in a housing centre for elderly people, where the roof had collapsed and rescue teams were unable to gain access, according to CBS. He had a stark warning for anyone who refused to leave town: ""We're suggesting if people are going to stay here, mark their arm with a Sharpie pen with their name and Social Security number."" At 09:00 local time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that sustained winds had fallen to a maximum of 75mph. If they drop further, Harvey will be classified as a tropical storm. Governor Abbot said it was obvious Texas was confronting a ""very major disaster"", and more than 1,000 National Guardsmen would help with the disaster relief operation. Harvey is the first major storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. It is forecast to meander across south-east Texas until Wednesday. The NHC has stressed the danger of life-threatening floods as rising water moves inland from the coastline. Meteorologists have warned Harvey could continue to dump rain until the middle of next week Oil-rich Houston, the fourth biggest city in the US, could face up to 20in of rain over the coming days. Residents there should ""not be complacent"" and should stay at home and ""ride out the storm"", Francisco Sanchez, a spokesman for Harris County's emergency management office, told the BBC. ""The most severe weather is yet to come"" in the Houston area, he said. Mr Trump is likely to visit Texas early next week, the White House said. The storm is the strongest to hit the US since Charley in August 2004 and the most powerful to hit Texas since Hurricane Carla in 1961, which killed 34 people, according to the Houston Chronicle. Animated guide: Hurricanes,external What is storm surge? Harvey has severely hampered Gulf of Mexico oil production and air travel. About 45% of US oil refining takes place on the Gulf of Mexico coast, and Corpus Christi is an important port for the industry. Crude oil production has slowed by about 20% to prepare for the storm, and fears Harvey could lead to a shortfall in fuel have helped drive up prices.

"This video can not be played Bank holiday engineering works Rail passengers travelling this bank holiday weekend are being warned to expect major disruption. Main stations in London, and services to Wales and the north of England, will be affected by engineering work. It is being described as Network Rail's biggest August bank holiday engineering project, costing Â£130m and involving 17,000 staff. On the roads, part of the M1 southbound has reopened following a serious incident. Eight people have died and four people have been taken to hospital after acrash involving a minibus and two lorriesnear Newport Pagnell, police said. August Bank Holiday travel guide August train delays and how to avoid them A spokeswoman for Network Rail said on Saturday that the works were ""going to plan"" and that the travel warnings remained in place. Euston, one of the major stations in London, will be closed completely on Saturday and Sunday. Work will also take place at Waterloo, London Bridge, Liverpool Street and Paddington. The so-called great north rail project will see disruption in the Midlands, Wales and across northern England. The aim is to reduce overcrowding and offer faster and more frequent services in the future. Virgin Trains said it expected services to be very busy on the East Coast Main Line because of the closure of Euston and the Edinburgh festivals coming to an end. And for its the West Coast route, a spokesman said: ""We are advising customers to avoid travelling on our west coast route on Saturday or Sunday unless necessary."" Network Rail admitted there was never an ideal time to carry out engineering work but said up to 50% fewer passengers travelled on bank holidays. Waterloo has already been affected by work to lengthen platforms to increase capacity. A Network Rail spokeswoman said: ""We apologise to our passengers for the added disruption to their journeys and thank them for their patience."" Travel trade organisation Abta estimated that 2.1 million British holidaymakers would travel abroad over the weekend, with Spain, Turkey and Greece among the most popular destinations. Coach operator National Express is putting on an extra 4,000 seats on routes affected by the Euston and Waterloo works. The AA warned of congestion on the roads as people avoid problems on the railways. Have your been affected by bank holiday travel disruption? Let us know about your experiences.

"It is an annoyance familiar to many drivers: you are cruising along, listening to a song or sports match, when suddenly... ""Here's your latest traffic and travel update!"" Radio traffic alerts, which interrupt a CD, tape or radio station when there is an update, are likely to sound in themillions of cars taking to UK roads for the bank holiday. Drivers have relied on alerts since the late 1980s, but may also now use modern alternatives to avoid jams - including sat-navs, mapping apps or smart motorway signs. So is the era of the ""traffic and travel update"" coming to an end? The alerts - which can be turned off quite easily in a car radio's settings - are sent via the Radio Data System (RDS) standard. RDS is a communications code in the FM signal which can be embedded into a BBC or commercial local radio broadcast. It allows a vehicle's radio to temporarily turn to a station for the duration of a travel announcement, before switching back again. They can also be indiscriminate - you might pick up alerts from several different local radio stations if you are at a high point and get a signal, for example. ""They can be annoying,"" says the AA's Ian Crowder. ""Sometimes the alert comes on and there's a load of banter from the previous speaker before they get round to the traffic update. ""I'd urge local ratio stations to stick to the traffic reports."" But Mr Crowder says that - while annoying to some - they can be ""invaluable"". And David Bizley, the RAC's chief engineer, says drivers are surprisingly enthusiastic about radio. About 72% of motorists get information about incidents and delays via the radio, according to the RAC's research. ""It appears radio is still king,"" Mr Bizley says, even though ""motorists have the likes of variable message signs and live traffic information on their sat-navs."" He adds: ""I am surprised by the high level of dependence on the radio to find out about traffic problems."" The motoring group surveyed 1,700 drivers and found just 47% use road signs and 36% their sat-nav. Bob Pishue is an economist at Inrix, the firm which provides traffic reports to most local radio stations in the UK, as well as to sat-navs and smartphone apps. ""Radio alerts are still useful for people who don't use smartphones, but we are seeing people switch,"" he says. Unlike a radio DJ announcing a traffic jam, sat-navs and smartphone apps will work out a new route for you. ""Not only can the apps route you to avoid congestion and road works but also do things like real-time parking,"" says Mr Pishue. He says navigation technology no longer has a reputation for being clunky to use, or unreliable. ""The data is getting better all the time,"" he says. In a sign the technology is now commonplace, learner driverswill have to be able to follow directions from a sat-navas part of changes to driving tests from December. Mr Pishue, however, says not everyone has - or may want - a navigation unit in their car. ""We supply traffic data all over the place, and we see a future for radio alerts,"" he says. And if technology fails, drivers can always use road signs to avoid a traffic bottleneck. As well as old-fashioned diversion signs, Highways England says it has installed electronic signs on hundreds of miles of its ""smart"" motorways, which display real-time traffic data. They can alert drivers to trafÂ­fic jams and hazÂ­ards up ahead, and are present on about 240 miles (386 km) of UK motorway. The AA's Ian Crowder warned that the signs could be ignored. ""I have concerns about how drivers react,"" he says. ""If it says congestion ahead but you can't actually see it, you don't know whether you can trust this information, especially if no one else is slowing down."" A Highways England spokesperson says: ""We give drivers as much real-time information as possible to help them with their journeys, both before they set out and while they are on the road."" Highways England nevertheless still recommends drivers tune into local radio travel bulletins. Whether they are useful, or an annoying interruption to your bank holiday soundtrack, perhaps it is not yet the end of the road for radio alerts.
