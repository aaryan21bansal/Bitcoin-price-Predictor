"A Scottish newspaper's TV listing of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration has caught people's attention both in the UK and the US. The Sunday Herald TV critic Damien Lovereimagined the ceremony,externalas a return of the classic science fiction series The Twilight Zone. President Trump: The Inauguration 4pm, BBC One/ STV ""After a long absence, The Twilight Zone returns with one of the most ambitious, expensive and controversial productions in broadcast history. Sci-fi writers have dabbled often with alternative history stories - among the most common is the ""What If The Nazis Had Won The Second World War"" setting - but this huge interactive virtual reality project, which will unfold on TV, in the press, and on Twitter over the next four years, sets out to build an ongoing alternative present. The story begins in a nightmarish version of 2017 in which huge sections of the US electorate have somehow been duped into voting to make Donald Trump president. It sounds far-fetched, and it is, but as it goes on it becomes more and more chillingly plausible. Today's feature-length opener concentrates on the gaudy inauguration of President Trump, and the stirrings of protest and despair surrounding the ceremony, while pundits speculate gravely on what lies ahead. It's a flawed piece, but a disturbing glimpse of the horrors we could stumble into, if we're not careful.""

"Dimitri Payet has scored five goals so far this season West Ham have rejected a second bid from Marseille for France forward Dimitri Payet. The improved offer from the Ligue 1 side - reported to be Â£1m higher than an initial Â£19m bid - was turned down by Hammers chairman David Sullivan. He is said to be taking a tough stance and refusing to be bullied into a quick sale, with the club having no financial need to sell. Manager Slaven Bilicsays Payet, 29, no longer wants to play for the club. Payet is not training with the first team and will continue to work with the under-23s. The Premier League club said they would prefer Payet to apologise to supporters and return to first-team training. Listen: 'It's not about the money' French journalist Julien Laurens on 5 live's Monday Night Club In 2011, when he was at Saint-Etienne, he wanted to go to Paris St-Germain, which was his dream move. He tried everything again to force them to sell him. The club stood their ground - he had to go with the reserves, they fined him. In the end, he had to come back and he apologised and said: 'I have made a mistake, I'm young.' He is a very stubborn man and at the time it didn't work out for him, but he really believes this time it will happen for him. Eighteen months ago Payet did not want to leave Marseille. They forced him to leave in a way, because they had to sell him to balance their books. He never really settled in England. His family are not settled, the children are not happy at school, his wife is not happy. They all went back to France and are already looking at new schools there. The main issue for him has always been the family. They were not happy and that was impacting on him as a person and as a player. Payet will take a cut out to go back to Marseille, it is not about the money. He is not going to China. Marseille have already reached an agreement to go back, now it is between the clubs. Marseille's second offer is clearly way below what West Ham want, but at least they are opening the door. Three days ago they said they would never sell him, now they say they would sell him if they receive Â£30-35m pounds. I expect Marseille to go back with a better bid and still believe they will sell at some point. Former Hammers striker Dean Ashton, who wasforced to retire at the age of 26,externalthrough injury, said Payet's refusal to play was ""disgusting"". ""I can't play anymore and to see the way Payet is acting, I can't tell you how angry it makes me,"" Ashton, 33,told Talksport.,external ""West Ham love him, they absolutely adore him - they wouldn't dream to think he would go and do this. He is so many kids' favourite player. ""It is disgusting what he is doing in refusing to play."" Payet, who signed from Marseille for Â£10.7m in June 2015, excelled in his first season with the London club, scoring 12 goals and earning a nomination for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award. In February 2016 he signed a new contract running until the summer of 2021. MOTD2 Extra pundit Alan Shearer says West Ham should hold out for the biggest transfer fee they can get for Payet. ""It is quite clear Dimitri Payet is refusing to play for the club,"" he said on Sunday's programme. ""You have to get as much as you can and sell him. The dressing room is far more important."" Mark Schwarzer, the former Chelsea, Fulham and Middlesbrough goalkeeper, added on the programme: ""Payet is a commodity - you have to get as much money for him. Then they can bring in players to improve the team."" Payet does not want to play, says Bilic Bilic angry with Payet's refusal to play.

"An Afghan woman made famous by a 1985 National Geographic cover has spoken exclusively to the BBC of her hope for a new beginning, after being deported from Pakistan. Sharbat Gula now lives with her five-year-old son and three daughters in Kabul, where she says she wants to live a normal life after years of tragedy and hardship. Her portrait as a 10-year-old became an iconic image of Afghan refugees fleeing war. The only time she has spoken to the media before now, her family says, was for a 2002 documentary after Steve McCurry, who took her original photo, tracked her down in Pakistan and found out who she was. Sharbat Gula had no idea that her face had been famous around the world for almost 17 years. Afghan 'green-eyed girl' deported Afghanistan's looming refugee disaster Like many Afghans, she sought refuge in Pakistan and lived there for 35 years - but she was imprisoned and deported last autumn for obtaining Pakistani identity papers ""illegally"". ""We had a good time there, had good neighbours, lived among our own Pashtun brothers. But I didn't expect that the Pakistani government would treat me like this at the end,"" Sharbat Gula told me at her temporary residence in Kabul. Her case highlighted the arbitrary arrest and forced deportation of Afghan refugees in the current spat between the two countries. It has beenillegal for non-Pakistanis to have IDs,externalsince they were first issued in the 1970s, but the law was often not enforced. Now sick and frail in her mid-40s, Sharbat Gula's haunting eyes are still piercing, full of both fear and hope. She says she had already sold her house in Pakistan because she feared arrest there for ""not having proper documents to stay"". Two days before a planned move back to Afghanistan, her house was raided late in the evening and she was taken to prison. Sharbat Gula was sentenced to 15 days in prison Pakistan's government has ordered all two million Afghan refugees on its soil to leave. Sharbat Gula believes the Pakistani authorities wanted to arrest her before she left. ""I told the police that I have made this ID card for only two things - to educate my children and sell my house - which were not possible to do without the ID card."" She served a 15-day prison sentence, the first week in prison and the second in hospital where she was treated for hepatitis C. ""This was the hardest and worst incident in my life."" Realising the reputational damage, Pakistan later offered to let her stay - but she refused. ""I told them that I am going to my country. I said: 'You allowed me here for 35 years, but at the end treated me like this.' It is enough."" Her husband and eldest daughter died in Peshawar and are buried there. ""If I wanted to go back, it will be just to offer prayer at the graves of my husband and daughter who are buried in front of the house we lived in."" The ""Afghan Girl"" picture was taken by Steve McCurry in 1984 in a refugee camp near Peshawar, when Sharbat Gula was studying in a tent school. Published in 1985, it became one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed. For years she was unaware of her celebrity. ""When my brother showed me the picture, I recognised myself and told him that yes, this is my photo."" How did she feel? ""I became very surprised [because] I didn't like media and taking photos from childhood. At first, I was concerned about the publicity of my photo but when I found out that I have been the cause of support/help for many people/refugees, then I became happy."" Sharbat Gula has now returned to Afghanistan, where the government promised her a house in Kabul None of Sharbat Gula's six children - another daughter died too at an early age and is buried in Peshawar - share the colour of her eyes. But her brother, Kashar Khan, does, and the eyes of one of her three sisters were also green. She says her maternal grandmother had eyes of a similar colour. Sharbat Gula was a child living with her family in Kot district of eastern Nangarhar province when Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan in 1979. ""There was war between Russians and Afghanistan - that is why we left. A lot of damage/destruction was done."" Her mother died of appendicitis in the village when she was eight. Like hundreds of thousands of other Afghans, her family (her father, four sisters and one brother) migrated to Pakistan and started living in a tent in a refugee camp called Kacha Garahi, on the outskirts of Peshawar. She was married at 13. But her husband, Rahmat Gul, was later diagnosed with hepatitis C and died about five years ago.  Her eldest daughter also died of hepatitis three years ago, aged 22, leaving a two-month-old daughter. Sharbat Gula met President Ashraf Ghani in the presidential palace on her return, and later former President Hamid Karzai. ""They gave me respect, warmly welcomed me. I thank them. May God treat them well."" Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani received her at the presidential palace The government has promised to support her financially and buy her a house in Kabul. ""I hope the government will fulfil all its promises,"" she told me. Kot district is a stronghold of militants linked to the so-called Islamic State group, so she can't go home to her village. Her green-eyed brother and hundreds of others have fled the area, fearing IS brutality. ""We cannot even visit our village now because of insecurity and don't have a shelter in Jalalabad. Our life is a struggle from one hardship to another,"" he says. But Sharbat Gula's priority is to stay in her country, get better and see her children be educated and live happy lives. ""I want to establish a charity or a hospital to treat all poor, orphans and widows,"" she says. ""I would like peace to come to this country, so that people don't become homeless. May God fix this country.""

"The question of whether Russia's leader Vladimir Putin has got material with which he could blackmail Donald Trump is for now unknowable and misses the point by a country mile: the two men think alike. Mr Trump's belief in American traditionalism and dislike of scrutiny echo the Kremlin's tune: nation, power and aversion to criticism are the new (and very Russian) world order. You could call this mindset Trumputinism. The echo between the Kremlin and Trump Tower is strong, getting louder and very, very good news for Mr Putin. As Trump signalled to Michael Gove on Monday,,externala new nuclear arms reduction deal seems to be in the offing linked to a review of sanctions against Russia. The dog that did not bark in the night is Mr Trump's peculiar absence of criticism of Mr Putin, for example, on the Russian hacking of American democracy, his land-grab of Crimea and his role in the continuing war in Eastern Ukraine. What is odd is that Mr Trump, in his tweets, favours the Russia line over, say, the CIA and the rest of the American intelligence community. But why on earth criticise the world leader with whom you most agree? Three men have egged along Trumputinism: Nigel Farage, who is clear that the European Union is a far bigger danger to world peace than Russia; his friend, Steve Bannon, who is now Mr Trump's chief strategist; and a Russian ""penseur"", Alexander Dugin. With his long hair and iconic Slavic looks, Mr Dugin is variously described as ""Putin's Brain"" or ""Putin's Rasputin"". Alexander Dugin is described as ""Putin's Brain"" He has his own pro-Kremlin TV show which pumps out Russian Orthodox supremacy in a curious mixture of Goebbels-style rhetoric and Songs of Praise. Mr Dugin is widely believed to have the ear of the Kremlin. He is also under Western sanctions for the ferocity of his statements in favour of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has cost 10,000 lives to date. Messrs Farage, Bannon and Dugin are all united that the greatest danger for Western civilisation lies in Islamist extremism. Mr Bannon aired his views in a right-wing mindfest on the fringes of the Vatican in 2014. He claimed that so-called Islamic State has a Twitter account ""about turning the United States into a 'river of blood'"". ""Trust me, that is going to come to Europe,"" he added. ""On top of that we're now, I believe, at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism."" The danger is that in allying yourself with the Kremlin in the way they fight ""Islamist fascism"" in say, Aleppo, you end up siding with what some have called ""Russian fascism"" or, at least, abandoning democratic values and the rules of war and, in so doing, become a recruiting sergeant for ISIS. It is a risk on which Mr Dugin does not seem willing to reflect. My interview with him in Moscow did not end well. Dugin posted a critical blog entry after walking out of his interview with John Sweeney First, he dismissed the chances that the Russians hacked American democracy as ""strictly zero"". I asked him about the depth of Mr Putin's commitment to democracy. ""Please be careful,"" he responded. ""You could not teach us democracy because you try to impose to every people, every state, every society, their Western, American or so-called American system of values without askingâ¦and it is absolutely racist; you are racist."" Too many of Mr Putin's critics end up dead - around 20 since he took power in 2000. I have met and admired three: Anna Politkovskaya, Natasha Estemirova and Boris Nemtsov. Boris Nemtsov was murdered close to the Kremlin in 2015 Mr Nemtsov was shot just outside the Kremlin's walls. I asked Mr Dugin what his death told us about Russian democracy. ""If you are engaged in Wikileaks you can be murdered,"" he countered. I then invited Mr Dugin to list the American journalists who have died under Barack Obama. Mr Dugin did not oblige but told me that ours was a ""completely stupid kind of conversation"" and walked out of the interview. Later, he posted a blog to his 20,000 followers, illustrated with my photograph and accusing me of manufacturing ""fake news"" and calling me ""an utter cretin... a globalist swine"". Such is the language of the new world order. A few days later I watched the press conference when Mr Trump closed down a question from a CNN reporter by accusing him of manufacturing ""fake news"". Under Trumputinism, the echo between Russia and America is getting louder by the day. Panorama: The Kremlin Candidate?

"The number of people treated within four hours at A&E departments recovered in the second week of January, BBC Newsnight has learned. But while performance has improved since the first week in January, it remains way below its target of 95%. Leaked data covering last week puts the national figure at 82.4% with only five hospitals meeting the 95% standard. NHS England said they were doing ""everything [they] can to ensure the best care possible is being delivered."" While the national figure remains low, it does show an improvement onthe first week in January, which is usually the health service's hardest week. An earlier exclusive report by BBC News had revealed that, in that first week, 79.6% of patients were seen within four hours and only one hospital met the 95% target. The new analysis by NHS Improvement, which oversees foundation and NHS trusts, reveals a general pattern of gradual improvement since the low of January 3, when the daily A&E rate reached a low of 75.8%.  Over this weekend, the service managed to see more than 85% of patients inside the four-hour waiting target. A spokesman for NHS Improvement said: ""In the past few days, we've seen a real improvement in how quickly patients are being seen and discharged from accident and emergency departments - including to social care. But we know the pressures facing our hospitals will continue over the remaining weeks of winter and we're working hard to ensure they have the support they need to offer patients quick, safe, quality care."" It measures the point at which a patient arrives at A&E to when they are admitted, discharged or transferred elsewhere It applies to all patients from those with life-threatening emergencies to minor ailments Hospitals are meant to achieve the four-hour target in 95% of cases The last time it was met was July 2015 The leak also reveals that, in the second week of January, 14,700 people who had been admitted to a hospital were left waiting for more than four hours to find a bed. Of these, 140 people endured so-called ""trolley waits"" of more than 12 hours. While these figures are well down on the first week in January, they remain historically high - up by 3,000 on the equivalent week two years ago. There are further signs of vulnerability: for the week covered by the data, which runs 9 to 15 January, the number of beds in use remained an exceptionally high 95.3%, with 4.9% of the service's beds occupied because patients were stuck in hospitals awaiting transfer to another care provider (a so-called ""delayed transfer of care""). This is well above the preferred rate of bed use. A large number ofstudies of hospital management,externalhave demonstrated how, when there are few spare hospital beds, even very modest further reductions in the number of free beds can dramatically increase the likelihood of any given patient being caught in a hospital backlog, which can lead to significant delays in care. That high utilisation rate is why, in addition to the elevated rate of trolley waits, there were 177 cancelled operations. That figure is much higher than the previous week, but is likely to be distorted because of the Bank Holiday. The rate at which operations was being cancelled also fell during the week. The strain on the service will have been eased because of the expected fall in traffic over the second week of the year, with average daily A&E attendances dropping from 50,993 in the first week of the year to 47,195 in the second. A spokesperson for NHS England added: ""We started planning for winter this year earlier than ever before and will continue to do everything we can to ensure the best care possible is being delivered.""

"Does it help? On the face of it, on some of the front pages at least, it seems a slam dunk. Before Theresa May gives an important speech  on Tuesday outlining her plan for the tortuous process of taking us out of the European Union, there has been abig thumbs-up for Brexit(literally- in the picture he had taken with Michael Gove) from the most powerful individual in the world. On top of that, Donald Trump, who'll be in charge from Friday, breezily promises a trade deal with the United States that can be sorted out without further ado. Since the social and diplomatic embarrassments of Nigel Farage's freelance trips to Trump Tower, Number 10 seems to have worked to get the president-elect on board, and his comments in his Times interview to former cabinet minister Michael Gove seem to illustrate success - with the groundwork prepared for a visit between Mr Trump and Mrs May soon after the inauguration. Mr Trump repeated his wholehearted support for the idea of the UK leaving the European Union, and his comments to the Times suggested he would be in the UK's corner. No prime minister would want to make an enemy of an American president, so who wouldn't want an endorsement like this? But, as officials in Brussels and leaders around the EU seek to stick together before getting down to business with the talks with the UK, the government may also be wary about being seen to be cosying up too closely to President Trump. Mrs May shares some of his analysis of many voters' disillusionment with what she describes as the ""privileged few"". But the similarities don't run deep, and for voters, Mr Trump appals as much as he inspires. For some in Brussels, Mr Trump's support for Brexit may only harden them against the UK.  Diplomacy is a sensitive and complicated business, not used to the brashness of this billionaire. The European Commission has already piled in to say that it's not possible to make any agreements before the UK has left the EU. Even Downing Street said today it would ""abide by our obligations"" and committed only to early conversations. The president-elect's straightforward promise that a trade deal can be done with Mrs May without delay may come to haunt them both.

"Donald Trump has railed against fake news ""It is the customary fate of new truths,"" wrote TH Huxley, in one of my favourite quotes, ""to begin as heresies, and end as superstitions."" Fake news is nothing new, depending on what you mean by it. But during the past year - specifically during Donald Trump's election - it has become a cancer in the body politic, growing from an isolated but malignant tumour into a raging, mortal threat. No hack can witness this without alarm. As a BBC journalist I am required to be politically impartial; but as my distinguished colleague Nick Robinsonhas argued,external, I am under no obligation to be impartial about democracy (as against tyranny, for example). Nor am I under any obligation to be impartial about truth, as against lies. The possibility of truth is a necessary condition for democracy. Fake news is an assault on truth. Therefore it behoves all right-thinking journalists to combat fake news. First of all, what is fake news? Fake news is of three kinds. First, false information deliberately circulated by those who have scant regard for the truth but hope to advance particular (often extreme) political causes and make money out of online traffic. Second, false information that is circulated by journalists who do not realise it is false. Freddie Starr: The subject of one of the most famous newspaper headlines All unintended errors of fact in the history of journalism, from hoaxes to exaggerated headlines - Freddie Starr never ate a hamster - fall into this category. That is why I say fake news is nothing new: in fact it is as old as journalism, if not older. The point about this kind of fake news is it often contains at least a scintilla of truth. Third, news that causes Donald Trump discomfort. At his press conference last week, the president-elect targeted CNN, conflating that organisation with Buzzfeed. CNN says it had corroborated accusations about Mr Trump that it published; whereas Buzzfeed published a dossier that contained allegations that hadn't been corroborated. Mr Trump was discomfited by CNN; therefore he described it as fake news. The first kind of fake news - deliberate lies - has been energised by the viral power of social media. The Pope didn't back Mr Trump; nor did Denzel Washington. But millions may have believed one or both those propositions, and their originators got rich on the lie. The third kind of fake news isn't really fake at all. It's simply news that some people don't like to acknowledge, and wish to silence. But if you believe that the media should be free to scrutinise the use and abuse of power, and so hold power to account, the silencing of legitimate questions through the abusive epithet ""fake news"" is clearly anti-democratic. The first two kinds of fake news are, to varying degrees, hostile to the democratic process. A useful distinction would describe the second as false news rather than fake news. But with the third kind, it is the use of the term ""fake news"", rather than what it is describing, that is dangerous. Pope Francis was reported to have backed Donald Trump's presidency campaign The first kind spreads deceit and pollutes the well of civility on which strong societies must draw. The second - false news - damages trust in the media. In the third instance, use of the term ""fake news"" numbs scrutiny and also pollutes that well of civility. All proper journalists reside in the zone between truth and falsehood. Some try harder than others to resist the magnetic pull - and it can be very strong at times - of the latter. Most, if they have any self-worth, steer clear of the outright lies that make up that first kind of fake news. Many big media organisations recognise fake news is dangerous and are acting against it. Facebook, after initially expressing scepticism about the influence of fake news in the presidential election, has started taking itvery seriously indeed. The BBC is boostingReality Check,external, a fact-checking service that will work with Facebook. Several years ago Channel 4 News launchedFact Check,external, which fulfilled a similar role. These are all pleasing, practical measures. But there is a deeper philosophical issue at stake, concerning the role of truth in our society. No society can conduct the informed conversation necessary for civility, the resolution of disputes, or the judicious exercise of power and law if there is no agreement on basic facts. You cannot choose how to go forward if you cannot agree what just happened. Therefore it is necessary to agree that there are facts, or true propositions. In the West today, largely but not solely because of the advent of digital media, the truth is more vulnerable than it has been for a long time. This is partly because whereas falsity comes by degrees, truth is absolute; and therefore anything that chips away at its granite surface leaves a big dent. It is also because, as I wrote in thelast editorial of the Independent newspaper,external(now solely online), the truth is hard, expensive and boring. Whereas lies are easy, cheap and thrilling. Finding out the real story takes time and effort. Time and effort cost money. Once you've found the real story, you have to verify it: that's what makes it true. But verification also takes time and effort. And sometimes, the thrilling tip-off you received turns out to be no more than that. It would be amazing if the Moon were made of cheese, or Elvis Presley still lived. But it isn't, and he doesn't. Fake news of the second kind - the sort of exaggerations and errors that are inevitable in journalism, and which I call false news - will always be with us. But fake news of the first kind has to be combated, and use of the term to silence scrutiny deserves the same harsh treatment. You cannot conduct either of these battles, however, unless you have the preliminary belief that truth is not only possible, but vital. And where might that come from? I'd suggest you start with the philosophersBertrand Russell,external,AJ Ayer,external, andSimon Blackburn,external.

"The claim:The UK and USA can quickly negotiate a trade deal Reality Check verdict:The earliest we could possibly get a deal is 2019, when the UK leaves the EU under the government's current timetable. The complexities of the process mean a trade deal with the US could take considerably longer. In an interview with the Times, Donald Trump has promised a quick trade deal with post-Brexit Britain. The president-elect said: ""We're going to work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly."" How quickly depends what you mean by quickly and what kind of deal you want, because EU treaties prohibit the UK from conducting formal negotiations while it is still a member of the EU. Also, remember that this is the same Donald Trump who has attacked American companies that use NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, to build cars in Mexico and sell them in the USA, and has criticised a proposed pan-Pacific trade deal as the ""rape of our country"". He is also opposed to TTIP, the current talks between the USA and EU to reach a trade deal. But given he seems all in favour of a free trade deal with the UK, how long will it take and what will it involve? Even the easiest trade deal between perfectly willing partners would take years and we won't even be able to begin formal negotiations until we leave the EU, probably in two years. We will be able to have unofficial talks though, as the prime minister's spokesman put it on Monday: ""When she [Theresa May] visits the States she can have an early discussion, but we will abide by our obligations while in the EU."" Technically therefore, the quickest we would be able to get a deal is by 2019, but it is very unlikely to be that quick, not least because the deal the UK ends up doing with the EU would have an impact on the deal it gets with the US. The first part of any negotiations would be relatively easy. Tariffs, which are taxes on goods entering a country, are already quite low between the USA and the EU: they average 3%. A free-trade deal would aim to bring them all down to zero, but it is non-tariff barriers that are the real problem. This covers everything from bank regulations and car safety standards to animal welfare and environmental protection. The easiest deal would be for the USA to accept all our standards and regulations and for us to accept all theirs. But this is where it can get messy. For instance, the UK has much stricter rules on food standards, GM crops and hormones in farm animals. Just letting American food into the UK could undermine those standards and put British farmers at a disadvantage. Then there is the thorny issue of the NHS; do we open it up to competition from US medical companies or do we seek to protect it? Negotiating an optout for the NHS is perfectly possible, but it would take time and America might ask for something else in return. The EU and the USA agreed to start negotiating a trade deal in 2011, and those talks have become bogged down because of a whole host of such issues, including how to resolve disputes once a deal is signed. The UK should be a quicker and nimbler negotiator than the EU, which has 27 governments to keep on board, but that doesn't mean the issues are any less controversial.

"Ambassadors from other EU countries were invited to hear Theresa May's speech With her Brexit speech, Theresa May has for the first time revealed some key details about her approach to negotiations with the EU. Here's what we know now: What it is:The single market aims to make it easy for EU nations to trade with one another. It allows free movement of goods, workers, services and capital around the EU, without any tariffs, pretty much as if it was all one country. While it remains in the EU, the UK is a full member of the single market, and much of the Brexit debate has been about what will happen when it leaves. Some non-EU countries - such as Norway - have arrangements with the EU that allow them to be part of the single market if they meet certain conditions. UK government position:Having previously not publicly committed either way, Theresa May confirmed the UK cannot remain a member of the single market after it leaves the EU. She said this was because, as European leaders have stressed, the UK would have to accept EU rules and regulations and be bound by the European Court of Justice. Instead, she said, the UK will push for a new ""comprehensive free trade agreement"", giving it ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Theresa May said ""elements"" of the single market could remain for financial services The deal might contain ""elements"" of the current arrangements, she said, singling out the the motor trade and financial services as examples. What it is:A customs union is an arrangement between countries who agree not to impose tariffs on each other's goods. They also agree to impose common external tariffs on goods from countries outside their customs union. Setting common external tariffs is what distinguishes a customs union from a free trade area, where members are able to set their own tariffs on goods from the rest of the world. As an EU member, the UK is currently part of its customs union. What we know:The PM specified that the UK will leave the EU customs union, saying elements of it (the Common Commercial Policy and the Common External Tariff) prevented the UK from striking trade deals around the world. At the same time, she said she wanted the UK ""to have a customs union agreement with the EU"". She added: ""Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the customs union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position."" The 28 member states are in the EU customs union, but the EU also has separate customs union agreements - which vary in scope, for example in relation to the type of goods covered, with a number of other countries. The government has made clear that there will be restrictions to EU migration as a result of the referendum. This was reiterated by Mrs May in her speech, saying: ""The message from the public before and during the referendum campaign was clear: Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. And that is what we will deliver."" But the precise model to be used has not yet been confirmed. During the referendum campaign, Vote Leave called for a ""points-based"" system, similar to that used in Australia. But this model, which would involve applications being accepted on the basis of skills, has been rejected by Mrs May, who says it would not give sufficient control to the government. An alternative, which Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said is under consideration, is to require migrants to have a work permit before coming to work in the UK, with ministers able to prioritise different sectors. The government has said all possibilities are being considered. The fate of EU citizens currently living in the UK and of UK citizens living in the rest of the EU has become another pressing question. The government has repeatedly stated that the UK could not make commitments on the right of EU citizens to remain in the UK without securing a reciprocal deal for British citizens living abroad in Europe. ""I have said on many occasions that I expect to be able to, and wish to be able to, guarantee their status here in the UK, but we do need reciprocity - we need to have care and concern for UK citizens who are living in the European Union,"" Mrs May told MPs last month. In her speech, she said many countries wanted a deal, but ""one or two others do not"", and called for a resolution as soon as possible. Mrs May confirmed: ""l will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament, before it comes into force."" After her speech, Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs the UK would be leaving the EU whatever the outcome of the vote. The government will also be forced to consult Parliament before starting negotiations if it loses the legal challenge over Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The prime minister has been clear the UK will no longer be bound by the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice, which ensures the application of EU legislation, after Brexit. ""We are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,"" she told the Conservative Party conference. ""That's not going to happen."" There has been much talk of an interim deal between the UK and the EU before the final terms are agreed. But different versions of what this could mean have been put forward. In her speech, Mrs May said there would be no ""unlimited transitional status"", which would leave the UK in ""some kind of permanent political purgatory"". However, she proposed a ""phased process of implementation"" after a deal has been reached, to allow each element of the deal to be introduced. As it will not be in the single market, the UK will not pay ""huge sums"" to EU budgets, Theresa May said. In some circumstances it may have to make an ""appropriate contribution"" to be part of European schemes, she said. ""But the principle is clear: the days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end."" The PM gave her strongest warning yet to her opposite numbers ahead of the negotiations, saying a ""punitive deal that punishes Britain"" would be ""an act of calamitous self-harm for the countries of Europe"" and would ""not be the act of a friend"". She added that ""no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain"". There was another warning for the EU in the PM's speech, as she told leaders to ""respect difference"", rather than ""trying to hold things together by force, tightening a vice-like grip that ends up crushing into tiny pieces the very things you want to protect"". The government had already set itself a Brexit deadline - Theresa May will give notice of the UK's departure from the EU under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty before the end of March. This allows two years for the negotiations to be completed before the UK leaves. The government has insisted neither a pending Supreme Court judgement nor the political upheaval in Northern Ireland will delay its timetable. What will happen to EU funding currently given to projects and different regions across the UK? We know that during negotiations with the EU, all rights and obligations from EU membership will continue as normal. This means that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget and that all projects in the UK that currently benefit from EU funding will continue to do so while the UK remains a member of the EU. In August, the Treasury said it would guarantee to back EU-funded projects signed before the Autumn Statement (23 November). Agricultural funding now provided by the EU will also continue until 2020. In October, Chancellor Philip Hammond told the Conservative Party conference the Treasury would guarantee payments for multi-year EU funding secured before Brexit after Britain left the EU.

"It's only gone and done it again. Like an unworldly maiden, sterling has fallen into a swoon after reports suggested that Theresa May was aiming for a hard Brexit. That means the prime minister is prepared to swap the UK's free movement of goods and services with Europe in return for controls over immigration. Yet the government has been consistent in implying that Mrs May wants a ""red line"" on border controls. It's impossible to know how deep that line will be, let alone any other plans for the thousands of issues affected by Brexit - so why does the pound keep falling given the message has largely stayed the same? After all, the only real surprise was the vote for Brexit itself. Amid the shock and mass confusion the pound fell 10% to $1.34, its biggest slide. Uncertainty about policy or the health of the economy always spooks the markets, which do not like surprises. Sterling is now trading at about $1.20 - the level it fell to during the ""flash crash"" of October 7. That, in thin overnight trading, was said to have been partly sparked by a newspaper headline about ""hard Brexit"". Currency dealers - and the rest of us - hope that Theresa May's speech on Brexit on Tuesday will finally shed some light on the way ahead and help sterling to a less febrile state. Meanwhile here, a range of experts give their views on why the pound seems to be living in Groundhog Day. Kathleen Brooks, research director, City Index Some have wondered why the foreign exchange market continues to be ""shocked"" by news about a hard Brexit; after all the UK's exit from the single market has always been on the cards and is not a new concept. I would argue that the 'Brexit theme as bad news for the pound' is such an ingrained trend at this stage that it really doesn't matter what Mrs May says or fails to say on Tuesday. Instead, it's all about market dynamics, and right now the balance of market participants are shorting the pound. It's a bit like a tipping point - once a trend gets critical mass, then news headlines can have big impacts, as they generate another wave of selling. Tuesday's speech in London could trigger a ""material drop"" in the value of the pound, according to one of the PM's aides, but is Mrs May calling the market's bluff? There is an outside chance that her speech, if it includes details on what will replace single market access, could actually benefit the pound next week. Brexit certainty could prove to be the pound's tonic. Jordan Rochester, foreign exchange strategist, Nomura Imagine you're dealing with a Remain voter in five stages of Brexit grief - the market is in that state of mind and it flips from emotional anger and denial to acceptance. It tends to forget the direction of domestic politics and, in any case never fully prices something in until it is 100% certain. We all have known about Theresa May's two ""red lines"" - immigration and sovereignty - but the market has been hoping she will soften her views. The big question the market is asking is what level of access to the EU the UK will get: will she go for the customs union, as Turkey has, or a full clean break? If the prime minister confirms on Tuesday a ""hard Brexit"", the market pricing of that scenario will be much firmer - about 90% to 100% priced in. Even so, sterling will still fall. As Bank of England governor Mark Carney says, we rely on the kindness of strangers to pay our debt in the imbalance of the current account and the trade balance in goods. For the UK to remain attractive to foreign investors it needs higher yields [higher interest rates] and or a lower currency - we will argue it will probably need a mixture of them both. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst, CMC Markets It has been apparent for some time that if the UK wants to control immigration and its laws it would have to step out of the single market and customs union; Theresa May said as much last October. But the markets have nothing else better to do than focus on the value of the pound at the moment. The last two weekends have been about what Theresa May will say on Tuesday and I'm surprised at how moderate the movement was this time: every time the pound has faced these headlines before it has thrown up its breakfast. The markets are pricing in bad news in case - but how much of a hard Brexit is priced in? We could even see a bounce upwards if the market gets information it likes. We haven't been able to sustain the move below $1.20 and considering the lurid headlines that's a surprise. Half of the decline is in any case down to dollar strength, with expectations of higher interest rates there and rising inflation. Dominic Bunning, foreign exchange strategist, HSBC Since the referendum there has not been a clear sign of what type of relationship the government is trying to pursue. The kind of phrase we've heard - ""we want the best possible deal"" - tells us nothing. For a long period of time, the market was still of the belief the government would try to maintain some sort of membership of the single market. We're only partly priced in, as the plans have not been fully communicated. But we're getting the sense now we will not stay in the single market and now even the customs union; the market now seems to be expecting a fully hard Brexit. So sterling could still rise if we get a softer deal. But equally, in the very short time, it could even go down to $1.10 if it is a ""diamond hard"" Brexit.

"The question of whether Russia's leader Vladimir Putin has got material with which he could blackmail Donald Trump is for now unknowable and misses the point by a country mile: the two men think alike. Mr Trump's belief in American traditionalism and dislike of scrutiny echo the Kremlin's tune: nation, power and aversion to criticism are the new (and very Russian) world order. You could call this mindset Trumputinism. The echo between the Kremlin and Trump Tower is strong, getting louder and very, very good news for Mr Putin. As Trump signalled to Michael Gove on Monday,,externala new nuclear arms reduction deal seems to be in the offing linked to a review of sanctions against Russia. The dog that did not bark in the night is Mr Trump's peculiar absence of criticism of Mr Putin, for example, on the Russian hacking of American democracy, his land-grab of Crimea and his role in the continuing war in Eastern Ukraine. What is odd is that Mr Trump, in his tweets, favours the Russia line over, say, the CIA and the rest of the American intelligence community. But why on earth criticise the world leader with whom you most agree? Three men have egged along Trumputinism: Nigel Farage, who is clear that the European Union is a far bigger danger to world peace than Russia; his friend, Steve Bannon, who is now Mr Trump's chief strategist; and a Russian ""penseur"", Alexander Dugin. With his long hair and iconic Slavic looks, Mr Dugin is variously described as ""Putin's Brain"" or ""Putin's Rasputin"". Alexander Dugin is described as ""Putin's Brain"" He has his own pro-Kremlin TV show which pumps out Russian Orthodox supremacy in a curious mixture of Goebbels-style rhetoric and Songs of Praise. Mr Dugin is widely believed to have the ear of the Kremlin. He is also under Western sanctions for the ferocity of his statements in favour of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has cost 10,000 lives to date. Messrs Farage, Bannon and Dugin are all united that the greatest danger for Western civilisation lies in Islamist extremism. Mr Bannon aired his views in a right-wing mindfest on the fringes of the Vatican in 2014. He claimed that so-called Islamic State has a Twitter account ""about turning the United States into a 'river of blood'"". ""Trust me, that is going to come to Europe,"" he added. ""On top of that we're now, I believe, at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism."" The danger is that in allying yourself with the Kremlin in the way they fight ""Islamist fascism"" in say, Aleppo, you end up siding with what some have called ""Russian fascism"" or, at least, abandoning democratic values and the rules of war and, in so doing, become a recruiting sergeant for ISIS. It is a risk on which Mr Dugin does not seem willing to reflect. My interview with him in Moscow did not end well. Dugin posted a critical blog entry after walking out of his interview with John Sweeney First, he dismissed the chances that the Russians hacked American democracy as ""strictly zero"". I asked him about the depth of Mr Putin's commitment to democracy. ""Please be careful,"" he responded. ""You could not teach us democracy because you try to impose to every people, every state, every society, their Western, American or so-called American system of values without askingâ¦and it is absolutely racist; you are racist."" Too many of Mr Putin's critics end up dead - around 20 since he took power in 2000. I have met and admired three: Anna Politkovskaya, Natasha Estemirova and Boris Nemtsov. Boris Nemtsov was murdered close to the Kremlin in 2015 Mr Nemtsov was shot just outside the Kremlin's walls. I asked Mr Dugin what his death told us about Russian democracy. ""If you are engaged in Wikileaks you can be murdered,"" he countered. I then invited Mr Dugin to list the American journalists who have died under Barack Obama. Mr Dugin did not oblige but told me that ours was a ""completely stupid kind of conversation"" and walked out of the interview. Later, he posted a blog to his 20,000 followers, illustrated with my photograph and accusing me of manufacturing ""fake news"" and calling me ""an utter cretin... a globalist swine"". Such is the language of the new world order. A few days later I watched the press conference when Mr Trump closed down a question from a CNN reporter by accusing him of manufacturing ""fake news"". Under Trumputinism, the echo between Russia and America is getting louder by the day. Panorama: The Kremlin Candidate?

"Nearly 20 years ago, poor families in Coahuila state in Mexico were offered an unusual handout from a social programme called Piso Firme. It was not a place at school, a vaccination, food, or even money. It was $150 (Â£118) worth of ready-mixed concrete. Workers would drive concrete mixers through poor neighbourhoods, stop outside a home, and pour the porridge-like mixture through the door, right into the living room. They showed the occupants how to spread and smooth the gloop, and made sure they knew how long to leave it to dry. Then they drove off to the next house. Piso Firme means ""firm floor"", andwhen economists studied the programme,external, they found that the ready-mixed concrete dramatically improved children's education. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources andlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Previously, the floors were made of dirt, which let parasitic worms thrive, spreading diseases that stunted kids' growth and made them miss school. Concrete floors are much easier to keep clean. So the kids were healthier, and their test scores improved. Economists also found that parents in the programme's households became happier, less stressed and less prone to depression. That seems to be $150 well spent. Beyond the poor neighbourhoods of Coahuila state, concrete often has a less wonderful reputation. It has become a byword for ecological carelessness: concrete is made of sand, water and cement, and cement takes a lot of energy to produce. The production process also releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. That might not be such a problem in itself - after all, steel production needs a lot more energy - except that the world consumes absolutely vast quantities of concrete: five tonnes, per person, per year. As a result, the cement industry emits as much greenhouse gas as aviation. Architecturally, concrete implies lazy, soulless structures: ugly office blocks for provincial bureaucrats, multi-storey car parks with stairwells that smell of urine. Portsmouth's Tricorn Centre was regularly described as the UK's ugliest building, before its demolition Yet it can also be shaped into forms that many people find beautiful - think of the Sydney Opera House or Oscar Niemeyer's Brasilia cathedral. Perhaps it is no surprise that concrete can evoke such confusing emotions. The very nature of the stuff feels hard to pin down. ""Is it stone? Yes and no,"" opined the great American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1927. ""Is it plaster? Yes and no. Is it brick or tile? Yes and no. Is it cast iron? Yes and no."" However, the fact that it is a great building material has been recognised for millennia - perhaps even since the dawn of human civilization. There is a theory that the very first settlements, the first time that humans gathered together outside their kinship groups - nearly 12,000 years ago at Gobekli Tepe in southern Turkey - was because someone had figured out how to make cement, and therefore concrete. Oscar Niemeyer's Brasilia Cathedral was constructed from 16 concrete columns, each weighing 90 tonnes It was certainly being used over 8,000 years ago by desert traders to make secret underground cisterns, some of which still exist in modern day Jordan and Syria. The Mycenaeans used it over 3,000 years ago to make tombs you can see in the Peloponnese in Greece. The Romans were also serious about the stuff. Using a naturally occurring cement from volcanic ash deposits at Puteoli, near Pompeii and Mount Vesuvius, they built their aqueducts and their bathhouses with concrete. Walk into the Pantheon in Rome, a building that will soon celebrate its 1,900th birthday. Gaze up at what was the largest dome on the planet for centuries, arguably until 1881. You're looking at concrete. It is shockingly modern. Many Roman brick buildings are long gone - but not because the bricks themselves have decayed. They've been taken apart, cannibalised for parts. Roman bricks can be used to make modern buildings. But the concrete Pantheon? One of the reasons it has survived for so long is because the solid concrete structure is absolutely useless for any other purpose. Bricks can be reused, concrete cannot. It can only be reduced to rubble. And the chances of it becoming rubble depend on how well it is made. Bad concrete - too much sand, too little cement - is a death-trap in an earthquake. But well-made concrete is waterproof, storm proof, fireproof, strong and cheap. How Rudolph Diesel's engine changed the world The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart How fertiliser helped feed the world That is the fundamental contradiction of concrete: incredibly flexible during construction, utterly inflexible afterwards. In the hands of an architect or a structural engineer, concrete is a remarkable material. You can pour it into a mould, set it to be slim and stiff and strong in almost any shape you like. It can be dyed, or grey, it can be rough or polished smooth like marble. But the moment the building is finished, the flexibility ends: cured concrete is a stubborn, unyielding material. Perhaps that is why the material has become so associated with arrogant architects and autocratic clients - people who believe that their visions are eternal, rather than likely to need deconstructing and reconstructing as circumstances change. In a million years, when our steel has rusted and our wood has rotted, concrete will remain. But many of the concrete structures we're building today will be useless within decades. That's because, over a century ago, there was a revolutionary improvement in concrete - but it's an improvement with a fatal flaw. In 1867, a French gardener, Joseph Monier, was unhappy with the available range of flower pots, and devised concrete pots, reinforced with a steel mesh. Well-made reinforced concrete is much stronger and more practical Less than 20 years later, the elegant idea of pre-stressing the steel was patented. This allowed engineers to use much less of it, and less concrete too. Reinforced concrete is much stronger and more practical than the unreinforced stuff. It can span larger gaps, allowing concrete to soar in the form of bridges and skyscrapers. But if cheaply made, it can rot from the inside as water gradually seeps in through tiny cracks, and rusts the steel. This process is currently destroying infrastructure across the United States. In 20 or 30 years' time, China will be next. China poured more concrete in the three years after 2008 than the United States poured during the entire 20th Century, and nobody thinks that it was all made to exacting standards. There are many schemes to make concrete last longer, including special treatments to prevent water getting through to the steel. There is""self-healing"" concrete, full of bacteria that secrete limestone, which re-seals any cracks. And""self-cleaning"" concrete, infused with titanium dioxide, breaks down smog, keeping the concrete sparkling white. The concrete sails of Rome's Dives in Misecordia church include titanium dioxide Improved versions of the technology may even give us street surfaces that can clean up cars' exhaust fumes. Researchers are trying to make concrete with less energy use and fewer carbon emissions. The environmental rewards for success will be high. Yet ultimately, there are many more things we could be doing with the simple, trusted technology we already have. Hundreds of millions of people around the world live in dirt-floor houses. Their lives could be improved with a programme like Piso Firme. Other studies have shown large gains from laying concrete roads in rural Bangladesh - improving school attendance, agricultural productivity and boosting farm workers' wages. Perhaps concrete serves us best when we use it simply.

"Former football coach Barry Bennell has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sexual assault against a boy under 16. The former youth coach at Crewe Alexandra denied the eight counts when he appeared at Chester Crown Court. The charges all relate to allegations of abuse between 1981 and 1986. Mr Bennell, 63, wearing a blue polo neck shirt and appearing via videolink from HMP Woodhill, in Milton Keynes, answered ""not guilty"" to all the charges as they were put to him. The ex-coach, who also worked at Manchester City, Stoke City and junior teams in north-west England and the Midlands, was remanded into custody until 20 March.

"Bottas signs his new Mercedes contract alongside team boss Toto Wolff Valtteri Bottas has succeeded retired world champion Nico Rosberg as Lewis Hamilton's team-mate at Mercedes. The move, expected since December,also sees Brazilian Felipe Massa come out of retirement to replace the 27-year-old Finn at Williams. Bottas has signed a one-year deal with the option for more, while Rosberg moves into an ambassadorial role. Mercedes' young driver Pascal Wehrlein, passed over in favour of Bottas, joins the Swiss Sauber team. Bottas faces challenge of his life at Mercedes Bottas 'expects equal treatment' Rosberg's shock retirement, announced just five days after he wrapped up his maiden world title, was a ""challenging situation for the team to handle"", according to Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. ""Sometimes in life, unexpected circumstances provide interesting opportunities,"" he added. ""Nico's decision in December was a big surprise. ""But weathering the storm makes you more resilient and we see this as another opportunity for the team to grow. ""I think Valtteri fits very well in our team, as a driver he's very fast, and he has also the heart in the right place. ""He shares our values and passion, and he's modest and humble and he's hard working."" For Bottas, the move is the opportunity of a lifetime. He has been in F1 for four seasons and has shown well at Williams alongside first Pastor Maldonado and then Massa. Bottas becomes just the fourth driver to compete for Mercedes in F1 since their return to the sport in 2010, following Nico Rosberg, Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher ""It's very exciting times for me,"" said Bottas, whose best F1 results so far are two second places, at the British and German grands prix in 2014. ""I think it's going to take a while to understand that this is really happening. ""It's definitely another dream come true, to race in another team with such great history - especially in the recent years, which have been so impressive. ""I think with Lewis we are going to be a strong pair together. I really respect him as a driver and a person. ""I'm sure we are going to be close, and we're going to be both pushing each forward. I'm sure we can work as a team."" Wolff has said he will end his ties with the personal management of Bottas' career now the driver is under his employment. Massa, 35, announced his retirement at the end of last season but quit F1 only because he knew he was not wanted at Williams and there was no other good seat available to him. A winner of 11 grands prix, he said: ""Given the turn of events over the winter, I wish Valtteri all the best at Mercedes. ""In turn, when I was offered the chance to help Williams with their 2017 F1 campaign, it felt like the right thing to do."" Williams deputy team principal Claire Williams said: ""With Valtteri having a unique opportunity to join the constructors' champions, we have been working hard to ensure that an agreement could be made with Mercedes. ""Felipe has always been a much-loved member of the Williams family, and having the opportunity to work with him again is something we all look forward to. ""He was always going to race somewhere in 2017, as he has not lost that competitive spirit, and it was important that we had a strong replacement in order for us to let Valtteri go. ""Felipe rejoining us provides stability, experience and talent to help lead us forward. He is a great asset for us."" Massa, who has signed a one-year deal, is an experienced and known quantity for Williams, who needed a driver over 25 to partner the 18-year-old Canadian rookie Lance Stroll as a result of their title sponsor, drinks giant Martini. In 2006, Massa became the first Brazilian since Ayrton Senna to win the Brazilian Grand Prix Mercedes Formula 1 boss Wolff negotiated a deal to release Bottas from Williams because he believed Wehrlein was not yet ready for promotion. He turned to Sauber, who use engines from Mercedes' rivals Ferrari, to find a seat for the German to continue his development in F1. Wehrlein will partner Swede Marcus Ericsson in what will be his second season in the sport. The 22-year-old drove for Manor in his debut season last year but theBritish team are in administrationand their participation in F1 in 2017 is in serious doubt. Pascal Wehrlein drove for Manor last season Sauber team boss Monisha Kaltenborn said Wehrlein had shown ""talent throughout his career"". She added: ""Last year, in his rookie Formula 1 season, he proved his potential by scoring one point in the Austrian Grand Prix. ""There is surely more to come from Pascal, and we want to give him the chance to further grow and learn at the pinnacle of motorsport."" Wehrlein, whose move is likely to have been facilitated by financial support from Mercedes for Sauber, added: ""It is a new challenge in a new team, and I am really excited and looking forward to this new adventure. ""Our objective is to establish ourselves in the midfield and to score points on a regular basis.""

"This video can not be played Cilla Black's son, Robert Willis, said the sculpture ""captured the joy that she had"" A life-size bronze statue of Cilla Black has been unveiled outside Liverpool's Cavern Club as the venue celebrates its 60th anniversary. The club, credited with launching the career of The Beatles, opened its doors on 16 January 1957 as a jazz cellar. Crowds gathered in Mathew Street to see the sculpture which shows a young Cilla performing one of her early songs. The TV celebrity and 1960s singing star,who died in 2015, started work as a cloakroom attendant at the club. Crowds filled Matthew Street in Liverpool city centre for the celebrations It was commissioned by Black's sons Robert, Ben and Jack Willis, who said they backed the idea after being moved by the response from the city following their mother's death. Robert Willis said they wanted to ""donate it as a small gesture of gratitude to this great city for their wonderful outpouring of love and affection for our mother"", adding that he was ""thrilled"" with the statue. His mother would have been ""very flattered, proud and honoured"", he said. One of the sculptors, Andy Edwards from Stoke-on-Trent, said ""it's the story of the birth of that period in Liverpool's musical culture"" and it was important the city remembered her. Cilla Black first worked at The Cavern as a cloakroom girl before going on to launch a hugely successful singing career of her own The Beatles played hundreds of gigs at The Cavern Club between 1961 and 1963. The unveiling was one of a programme of special events taking place on Monday to mark 60 years of the Cavern, which became synonymous with Merseybeat and The Beatles. The Cavern was demolished in 1973 to make way for a shopping centre but reopened 10 years later on part of the same site using reclaimed bricks from the original building. The Beatles played at the Cavern Club almost 300 times Cavern director John Keats said the club had remained relevant and people were ""constantly surprised at who has played [here]"". John Lennon's half sister, Julia Baird, said the role it played in the Liverpool's musical history should not be underestimated and she thought Lennon ""would have loved"" to be part of the celebrations. ""The Beatles didn't launch The Cavern - The Cavern launched The Beatles,"" she said. The club's owner, Dave Jones, said: ""This venue has to be protected for ever... it has to remain here.""

"Gavin D'Souza and his daughter Katelyn Working fathers are frequently reducing their hours or taking on a less stressful role in order to balance their work and family lives,a new study has found,external. According to the charity Working Families, a third of fathers they surveyed said they would take a pay cut in order to be more involved in their children's lives and as many againsaid they felt burnt out trying to juggle work and parental responsibilities. BBC audiences have been sharing their experiences about how they cope. ""I worked as a sound engineer for six or seven days-a-week for ten years, with no specific work times, no overtime and no extra pay. That's just how the industry works. ""On top of that I had to get home early so my wife Kim could go to work in the evenings, she had to work so we could pay the rent on the house. ""A couple of months ago I had to quit my job because I was asked to to work evenings too, and evenings are the only time I get with my family. ""I quickly got another job but things are even worse. This new job has no holidays and no regular working hours at all. ""I have had numerous opportunities to work abroad but I declined them so I could be a part of my daughter's life as she grows up. ""I've decided to quit my new job, and today after just two months I'm leaving. ""Now I'm looking to start a business where I can spend more time with  my family."" Dan Shuttleworth and his son Louis Jessica: ""My husband and I made the decision when our son was born that I should work full time and he would work part time and be the stay-at-home parent. This is because, as a woman, I get far more rights as a working mother than he would as a working father. ""I am entitled to flexible working and have more legal rights. I work 36 hours a week and he works between 16 and 18, split over a Friday afternoon and Sunday afternoon which means we are at home together on a Saturday and our son only has to go to a nursery for one afternoon a week. ""It's been eight months and it's working so far. Dan is happy because he is at home with our son and also has a job so he feels like he is contributing to our income and Louis (our son) is happy because he has a parent at home during the week. ""We earn enough to get by and get no help from the state with our son other than child benefit."" ""In my role, it's really hard to find a healthy work-life-balance. In a lot of companies you will get benefits, such as salary increase based on the effort you invest into your job. If you are not focused on your career, then you will get no increase or not the amount that would be needed. ""If you are focused just on your career you will miss beautiful moments with your child. ""If you would like to spend more time taking care of your child, you have to work hard. Then it becomes a circle, like an infinite loop, that you cannot close. ""Some people advise to either not work that hard or to move to another company, but this is nonsense. Why? Because your family needs money. More money comes from higher appreciation at work. This comes from more hard work. However, it will also reduce the time you have for your family. ""In addition, the parental leave we have here in Hungary is near to nothing. We get two days of parental leave per year per child, which is not enough. Salary increases are also not a trend here, at least not in my case."" Working fathers get 'wage bonus' Work-life balance: What does it mean for men? Do men get paid more than women? Six ways to tackle the gender pay gap ""I jumped off the career ladder about five or six years ago - a decision taken with my wife to effectively swap roles; she'd worked part-time since the first of our two sons was born. ""She wanted to get back to her career, and I was painfully aware of missing out on being around my boys. We had enough cash to fall back on that my not working for a while wouldn't cause problems and then I started working part-time from home as a writer. ""There are a lot of unexpected barriers and challenges when you're a stay-at-home dad - they almost all boil down to other people's attitudes. ""It's important to accept that balance comes at a cost."" ""When the time came that I wanted to get back to work I met some almost hostile responses. Many people struggled to accept that a man would want to spend more time at home with his kids for a while. ""I asked a few of them 'would you be so negative in the face of a woman returning to work after a prolonged child-related career break?' The answer was always 'no' and was often followed by an uncomfortable acceptance that they were regarding me differently solely because of my gender. ""It's a real eye-opener into tacit acceptance of gender-defined roles in society. That's something facing both men and women and it needs to change. ""These days I work as a copywriter for a marketing agency. I spend three days in the office and two days at home. It feels like a good balance. But it's important to accept that balance comes at a cost. ""I earn about a third less than I did about six years ago and half what I might be earning had I stayed on the career ladder. But it's definitely been worth it."" ""Nearly three years ago I changed jobs. I took a pay cut purely for the reason of getting a better work-life balance and importantly to spend more time with my two kids. It is a move that I have not regretted. ""Previously the stress levels I was working under were making me ill. The previous job also was further away from home, so I was spending between three-and-a-half to four hours travelling every day. ""My wife and I both still work full time - we could not afford the mortgage otherwise. Life is still a struggle, but we get by. ""Family is so much more important than a career."" ""The family have breakfast together every morning now. I can now see that my kids leave home to get on the bus to school before I travel to work. I work one day a week from home and that also is invaluable. ""It means I can help with things like getting the kids to and from after-school activities - both my children are members of the local swimming club and train for around 10 hours a week. ""Family is so much more important than a career. My new employer, Virgin Media, has been good to me."" ""I have struggled with this for many years, choosing to be paid at 80% while working 100%. I forego a larger salary for the right to look my colleagues in the eye when I'm leaving early two afternoons a week to meet the school bus. ""Yet as a manager, my commitment and my ability to manage has been called into question a few times. 'Why don't you get an au pair?' I've been asked. Or 'why don't you ask your wife to work less?' ""As a man, I know the expectations on men can be tough when we want to step out of a stereotype."" ""I think this is a very important area for the UK to improve. My daughter was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Canadian law is much more even-handed. ""At the time my wife was self-employed and so I was able to take our entire allocation of parental leave. This allowed me to be there full time for my daughter for the first eight months of her life. ""I also had the great fortune to be working for a very enlightened employer whose policy topped up my state allowance to 95% of my salary. Graham Bevan found parental law in Canada more even-handed ""To say this was the most important and precious time of my life is an understatement. It allowed my wife and I to fully share the role of parenting and I feel we are much stronger as a family as a result. ""As a middle manager I was the first man to take advantage of this at my job and contrary to complaining and worrying about how they would cope, my bosses were more concerned with baby showers. I felt totally supported. ""What did the employer get out of this?

All intangible I know, but as an employer, if you go to bat for your employees, they will do the same for you."" ""Living and working in the Middle East has posed even larger issues with work-life balance. ""With the constant drive to meet deadlines, as well as meeting client expectations, work-life balance is generally not taken into account by bosses. ""Due to ensuring that the clients are kept happy and that revenue is maximised, it is rare that I and a lot of others in this part of the world are allowed to take more than two weeks leave at a time, even though by law we are entitled to four weeks a year paid vacation. ""Due to the excessive client expectations, six-day working weeks are the norm so getting time to spend with your family is far and few between, to the extent that I will pull a sickie if I know my kid, wife or both have an impromptu day off (my wife is a teacher and my kid is in nursery).

"Serge Godin remembers the event that gave him the drive and determination to succeed in life - watching his father's sawmill burn down. He was 17 in Canada at the time, the year was 1966, and as his dad's business was uninsured, the family lost everything. One of nine children brought up in rural Quebec, Mr Godin, along with his siblings, suddenly had to earn money to help his parents pay the bills and keep a roof over the family's heads. So Mr Godin worked at a supermarket in the evenings after school, and then at a dry cleaner's on Saturdays. Ambitious to run his own company, in his 20s he used savings of C$5,000 ($3,800; Â£3,100) to start a computer business that he called Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique (CGI). In English, this translates as Information Systems and Management Consultants. Today CGI Group is a global IT systems giant that enjoys annual revenues of C$10bn, while Mr Godin's personal fortune is estimated at $1.5bn. Now 67 years old and the firm's chairman, he says: ""I didn't want to go back to the situation when we lost everything. That's probably what prompted me to build CGI."" After gaining a computer science degree from Laval University in Quebec City, and a few years working for two companies, Mr Godin launched CGI in 1976, when he was 26. In typical computer industry start-up fashion, he began the business from his garage. After a few months on his own, a friend joined the business, and in its first year, CGI generated revenues of C$138,000. Mr Godin is little known outside of Canada, but often features in Canadian papers From that modest start, CGI has grown steadily ever since, fuelled by no fewer than 81 acquisitions, as Mr Godin has continued to follow a policy of ambitious growth. In the company's most recent large takeover, it bought its European rival Logica for C$2.7bn in 2012. This more than doubled CGI's workforce, which rose overnight from 31,000 to 68,000. Today its business clients include companies such as miner Rio Tinto, tyre-maker Michelin, airline group Air France-KLM and London's Heathrow Airport. CGI also does work for 22 of the world's largest banks, and has no fewer than 2,000 government contracts around the world. Mr Godin, who reduced his daily workload in 2006 when he switched from chief executive to chairman, says the business has not given up on fast growth. ""We think we can double the size of the company [again] within five to 10 years,"" he says. It hasn't all been plain sailing for Montreal-based CGI in recent years, however. Back in 2013, it made headlines for all the wrong reasons, when it was blamed for technical problems that plagued the launch of the US government website where people on low or no income could apply for the new ""Obamacare"" health insurance. CGI has a glitzy headquarters in Montreal CGI had a central role in building the website, but Mr Godin said at the time that the company ""ended up in the eye of a storm"" between the two main US political parties. Looking back, he says: ""We stayed and finished the work. ""We were portrayed by the press as being the system integrator, but we were not. We were one of 52 companies involved in the project. ""We didn't fight this in the press, because we have a code of ethics and we never criticise our clients."" While the issue could not have been pleasant at the time, Mr Godin and CGI have always insisted that there was no long-term reputational damage. In terms of how CGI is run on a day-to-day basis, Mr Godin says he views it as a big family and that he has to keep everyone happy. ""At CGI we have a dream, and this dream is centred on the core of our business - our people,"" he says. The company floated on the Montreal Stock Exchange in 1986 ""They are the ones who take the elevator to come to work every day, and we have to make sure they will come back and will like working here. ""As employers, we have rights, but we also have duties towards our employees."" One way in which CGI tries to look after its staff is encouraging them to become shareholders. And for every share that an employee buys, the company will buy him or her the same amount. Mr Godin says: ""This idea of sharing is important to me, because I come from a big family."" Robert Young, technology analyst at research group Canaccord Genuity, says: ""Serge Godin is well regarded as the builder of a company with a strong culture and customer relationships. ""There is a discipline he has baked into the business that is evident in the strong financial controls, and rigorous approach to [what is known as] the 'CGI management foundation' - a set of proven processes and methods that define CGI engagements."" When not continuing to help lead CGI, Mr Godin focuses on his charity work. In 2000, he set up a charitable foundation called Jeunesse-Vie or Youth Life, which aims to help disadvantaged children across Canada through alleviating poverty and improving their education and health. So far, he has given it more than C$60m. Having already been inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame, last year he was also recognised for his business and charity work when he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, one of the country's highest civilian honours. Mr Godin says: ""When you have the chance to have a successful business, it is your duty to give back."" He adds: ""My origins remind me that it is important to help.""

"Donald Trump has given his first UK interview since being elected US president, speaking to Conservative MP and Times writer Michael Gove. Here are a selection key quotes, and some of the reaction to them. ""I'm a big fan of the UK, uh, we're gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly - good for both sides."" Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnsonsays: ""It's great to hear that from President-elect Donald Trump. Clearly it will have to be a deal that's very much in the interest of both sides, but I have no doubt that it will be."" The Financial Times's Shawn Donnan argues,externalthat Mr Trump and Theresa May could be in for a ""rude awakening"", with any deal potentially taking years and some UK economic sectors, such as farming, questioning whether the terms of US-UK free trade would benefit them. Theresa May's spokeswomansays: ""We welcome the commitment to have a deal quickly and it highlights one of the opportunities of leaving the EU. We welcome the enthusiasm and energy the president-elect is showing."" ""Basically [the EU is] a vehicle for Germany. That's why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out and you were there and you guys wrote it â put it on the front page: 'Trump said that Brexit is gonna happen'."" TheGuardian's Jonathan Freedland,externalwrites that Mr Trump gave ""the Brexiteers just enough to keep them happy"", adding that, when asked directly about a trade deal, Mr Gove was given a ""non-answer: 'I think you're doing great!'"" TheDaily Telegraph says,external: ""The comments in The Times newspaper will be a boost for Mrs May, who is preparing a major speech on Tuesday to set out her plans for Brexit."" ""It's obsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror."" ""And the other thing is the countries aren't paying their fair share so we're supposed to protect countries but a lot of these countries aren't paying what they're supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States. With that being said, Nato is very important to me."" Conservative MPMichael Fabricant tweets,external: ""#Trump is NOT anti #Nato. However, like the #UK, he believes more countries like the #UK should pay their fair whack into Nato."" German foreign minister Frank Walter Steinmeiersays: ""His comments have caused worry and concern even here in Brussels. I've just had a conversation with the Secretary-General of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, who has expressed concern at the comments made by Donald Trump that Nato is obsolete. This is in contradiction with what the incoming American defence minister said in his hearing in Washington only some days ago and we have to see what will be the consequences for American policy."" Nicholas Burns, professor of the practice of diplomacy and international relations at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government,tweets,external: ""Europe is our largest trade partner, largest investor in our economy and strongest ally-NATO. And Trump just declared it obsolete?"" ""Well, I'll be there - we'll be there soon - I would say we'll be here for a little while but and it looks like she'll be here first. How is she doing over there, by the way?"" Guardian political editorHeather Stewart writes,external: ""Michael Gove's latest excursion into controversy, pipping the prime minister - and her Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson - to a personal meeting with Donald Trump, is just the latest in a series of headaches created for May by the powerful figures she dispatched to the back benches."" Theresa May's spokeswomansays: ""We have already established good relations with the president-elect. The prime minister has spoken on the phone, her team has gone out there for discussions, the foreign secretary has had discussions."" She adds: ""If the British press succeeds in interviewing world leaders, we should be proud."" ""Well, I start off trusting both [Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel} - but let's see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all."" The Independent,externalsays: ""President-elect Donald Trump has avoided saying who he trusts more - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a long-time US-ally, or Russian President Vladimir Putin."" Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council, says: ""If Donald Trump's administration is interested we will be ready to resume full-format consultations with our American partners through the Russian Federation's Security Council.""

"Nearly 20 years ago, poor families in Coahuila state in Mexico were offered an unusual handout from a social programme called Piso Firme. It was not a place at school, a vaccination, food, or even money. It was $150 (Â£118) worth of ready-mixed concrete. Workers would drive concrete mixers through poor neighbourhoods, stop outside a home, and pour the porridge-like mixture through the door, right into the living room. They showed the occupants how to spread and smooth the gloop, and made sure they knew how long to leave it to dry. Then they drove off to the next house. Piso Firme means ""firm floor"", andwhen economists studied the programme,external, they found that the ready-mixed concrete dramatically improved children's education. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources andlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Previously, the floors were made of dirt, which let parasitic worms thrive, spreading diseases that stunted kids' growth and made them miss school. Concrete floors are much easier to keep clean. So the kids were healthier, and their test scores improved. Economists also found that parents in the programme's households became happier, less stressed and less prone to depression. That seems to be $150 well spent. Beyond the poor neighbourhoods of Coahuila state, concrete often has a less wonderful reputation. It has become a byword for ecological carelessness: concrete is made of sand, water and cement, and cement takes a lot of energy to produce. The production process also releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. That might not be such a problem in itself - after all, steel production needs a lot more energy - except that the world consumes absolutely vast quantities of concrete: five tonnes, per person, per year. As a result, the cement industry emits as much greenhouse gas as aviation. Architecturally, concrete implies lazy, soulless structures: ugly office blocks for provincial bureaucrats, multi-storey car parks with stairwells that smell of urine. Portsmouth's Tricorn Centre was regularly described as the UK's ugliest building, before its demolition Yet it can also be shaped into forms that many people find beautiful - think of the Sydney Opera House or Oscar Niemeyer's Brasilia cathedral. Perhaps it is no surprise that concrete can evoke such confusing emotions. The very nature of the stuff feels hard to pin down. ""Is it stone? Yes and no,"" opined the great American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1927. ""Is it plaster? Yes and no. Is it brick or tile? Yes and no. Is it cast iron? Yes and no."" However, the fact that it is a great building material has been recognised for millennia - perhaps even since the dawn of human civilization. There is a theory that the very first settlements, the first time that humans gathered together outside their kinship groups - nearly 12,000 years ago at Gobekli Tepe in southern Turkey - was because someone had figured out how to make cement, and therefore concrete. Oscar Niemeyer's Brasilia Cathedral was constructed from 16 concrete columns, each weighing 90 tonnes It was certainly being used over 8,000 years ago by desert traders to make secret underground cisterns, some of which still exist in modern day Jordan and Syria. The Mycenaeans used it over 3,000 years ago to make tombs you can see in the Peloponnese in Greece. The Romans were also serious about the stuff. Using a naturally occurring cement from volcanic ash deposits at Puteoli, near Pompeii and Mount Vesuvius, they built their aqueducts and their bathhouses with concrete. Walk into the Pantheon in Rome, a building that will soon celebrate its 1,900th birthday. Gaze up at what was the largest dome on the planet for centuries, arguably until 1881. You're looking at concrete. It is shockingly modern. Many Roman brick buildings are long gone - but not because the bricks themselves have decayed. They've been taken apart, cannibalised for parts. Roman bricks can be used to make modern buildings. But the concrete Pantheon? One of the reasons it has survived for so long is because the solid concrete structure is absolutely useless for any other purpose. Bricks can be reused, concrete cannot. It can only be reduced to rubble. And the chances of it becoming rubble depend on how well it is made. Bad concrete - too much sand, too little cement - is a death-trap in an earthquake. But well-made concrete is waterproof, storm proof, fireproof, strong and cheap. How Rudolph Diesel's engine changed the world The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart How fertiliser helped feed the world That is the fundamental contradiction of concrete: incredibly flexible during construction, utterly inflexible afterwards. In the hands of an architect or a structural engineer, concrete is a remarkable material. You can pour it into a mould, set it to be slim and stiff and strong in almost any shape you like. It can be dyed, or grey, it can be rough or polished smooth like marble. But the moment the building is finished, the flexibility ends: cured concrete is a stubborn, unyielding material. Perhaps that is why the material has become so associated with arrogant architects and autocratic clients - people who believe that their visions are eternal, rather than likely to need deconstructing and reconstructing as circumstances change. In a million years, when our steel has rusted and our wood has rotted, concrete will remain. But many of the concrete structures we're building today will be useless within decades. That's because, over a century ago, there was a revolutionary improvement in concrete - but it's an improvement with a fatal flaw. In 1867, a French gardener, Joseph Monier, was unhappy with the available range of flower pots, and devised concrete pots, reinforced with a steel mesh. Well-made reinforced concrete is much stronger and more practical Less than 20 years later, the elegant idea of pre-stressing the steel was patented. This allowed engineers to use much less of it, and less concrete too. Reinforced concrete is much stronger and more practical than the unreinforced stuff. It can span larger gaps, allowing concrete to soar in the form of bridges and skyscrapers. But if cheaply made, it can rot from the inside as water gradually seeps in through tiny cracks, and rusts the steel. This process is currently destroying infrastructure across the United States. In 20 or 30 years' time, China will be next. China poured more concrete in the three years after 2008 than the United States poured during the entire 20th Century, and nobody thinks that it was all made to exacting standards. There are many schemes to make concrete last longer, including special treatments to prevent water getting through to the steel. There is""self-healing"" concrete, full of bacteria that secrete limestone, which re-seals any cracks. And""self-cleaning"" concrete, infused with titanium dioxide, breaks down smog, keeping the concrete sparkling white. The concrete sails of Rome's Dives in Misecordia church include titanium dioxide Improved versions of the technology may even give us street surfaces that can clean up cars' exhaust fumes. Researchers are trying to make concrete with less energy use and fewer carbon emissions. The environmental rewards for success will be high. Yet ultimately, there are many more things we could be doing with the simple, trusted technology we already have. Hundreds of millions of people around the world live in dirt-floor houses. Their lives could be improved with a programme like Piso Firme. Other studies have shown large gains from laying concrete roads in rural Bangladesh - improving school attendance, agricultural productivity and boosting farm workers' wages. Perhaps concrete serves us best when we use it simply.

"This video can not be played The Davos summit... in numbers Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, and the rise of populism have left the world's ""liberal elites"" reeling. Can Davos, their ideological habitat, survive? It's all too easy to take a swipe at ""Davos"" - the annual Alpine pilgrimage of the so-called global elite, during which they underline the urgency of tackling climate change to the hum of private jet traffic, pledge to alleviate food poverty while snacking on caviar canapes, and commit to reducing inequality while being waited on hand-and-foot by an army of service staff at exclusive dinner parties. But beyond the often jarring contrasts, the World Economic Forum (or ze WEF, as locals call it), has always been able to point to its role in oiling the wheels of a socially progressive, pro-globalisation alliance - safe in the knowledge that, to a greater or lesser extent, it was in harmony with the tide of history. Then came 2016. At the beginning of the year, when Donald Trump was still one of many potential US presidential candidates, and a date for Britain's referendum on EU membership had yet to be set, Davos regulars were remarkably sanguine. Few Davos delegates last year predicted Donald Trump's election victory The WEF's annual Global Risks Report, in which it tries to predict future crises, made little mention of anti-establishment forces and WPP's Sir Martin Sorrell reassured delegates that Hillary Clinton would emerge victorious, regardless of whom she ran against. European leaders seemed confident that their institutions would survive the challenges posed by an influx of refugees, murderous attacks on capital cities and rising nationalist sentiment. Soundbites dismissing populist movements were easy to come by. Fast forward 12 months, and the WEF crowd is comparatively muted. Trump, China and Brexit to dominate Davos Vaswani: Why is Xi Jinping going to Davos? Davos coverage in full With the notable exception of billionaire George Soros, few are going out of their way to condemn the incoming US president, even as his daily pronouncements signal that the world's most important economy is moving further and further away from the Davos model. Perhaps no image sums up the new world order as well as that of a seemingly despondent Klaus Schwab, the respected German academic who is the driving force behind WEF, being ushered through the lobby of Trump Tower last month. The World Economic Forum's Klaus Schwab at Trump Tower last month But Mr Schwab's visit is also indicative of the WEF's strength, in particular its ability to spread the Davos gospel by running a very broad church, both politically and geographically. Indeed, the likes of Donald Trump have long been invited to the meeting (though he has yet to attend), and when controversial figures, such as Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, descend on the Swiss resort, they are hardly put in the stocks. What's more, as organisers are keen to point out, Davos has always been about more than just the US and Europe, and Indian, Chinese and African attendees have been put centre stage for years. Chinese President Xi Jinping toasts Swiss President Doris Leuthard ahead of Davos Much is being made of the fact that Xi Jinping is to becomethe first Chinese president to attend WEFwhen he opens the forum this week, and that Davos is welcoming a bigger trade delegation from the country than ever before - a signal, perhaps, that a more inward-looking US leaves a void for other global powers to fill. But a Chinese delegation was first invited to the annual meeting in 1979, and although he has stayed away in recent years, Russian President Vladimir Putin has drawn crowds on the mountain more than once. And as the geopolitical map changes, the WEF's softly-softly approach - in which very little is mandated and everything is up for polite discussion - may yet lead the Davos tribe out of ideological isolation, even if it doesn't manage to keep their annual champagne consumption out of the headlines.

"Owning a car for many Ethiopians - even those with ready cash to spend in one of the world's fastest-growing economies - remains a pipe dream. ""I have been saving for nearly four years now, and I still can't afford to buy even the cheapest vehicle here,"" a frustrated Girma Desalegn tells me. He has been shopping around for a whole week in capital, Addis Ababa, and has still not found an affordable car. He is looking to buy a second-hand car imported from the Gulf states or Europe - but even they are prohibitively expensive because the government classifies cars as luxury goods. This means even if a vehicle is second hand, it will be hit with import taxes of up to 200%. ""I have a budget of $15,000 (Â£12,300) and had expected that with that I could buy a decent family car. ""I don't want to buy the Toyota Vitz,"" he says pointing to a row of small hatchbacks that have now become popular on Ethiopian roads. These cost about $16,000 inEthiopia; in neighbouring Kenya the same car costs not more than $8,000. It seems little wonder that Ethiopia has the world's lowest rate of car ownership, with only two cars per 1,000 inhabitants, according to a 2014 Deloitte report. Henok Demessew, who has been running a car import and sales business in the capital, blames taxation. ""If it was not for that, we would have been able to import better cars either from Europe or America. But in order to make any profits we have to sell cars at such high prices. ""On top of the cost of shipping the cars from say from Dubai via Djibouti, we have to deal with multiple taxes to the government, making this one of the toughest businesses to be in, even though it's seen as lucrative."" The Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority says both commercial and private vehicles imported into the country can be subjected to five different types of taxes. However, despite the heavy tax burden there is a rise in the numbers of car imports. In 2016, government records show that 110,000 cars were imported to Ethiopia, an increase of more than 50% on the previous two years. Vehicles to be used for public transport are exempt from some import taxes Kasaye Ayele, a tariff officer at the customs authority, says there is some discretion. ""Vehicles that are imported to be used for public transport - we collect a much lower tax of 10% and not all five taxes are applied,"" he explains. ""But for private cars we check the engine capacity and if the capacity is big, we collect anything between 60% and 100% [of taxes due]."" Once all taxes are added to an imported car's price tag, it could cost nearly three times more than the retail price in its country of origin. But Mr Kasaye defends the taxation policy, saying it was fair and staggered. He cites examples of discounts given for buying second-hand cars. In a bid to encourage people to buy cheaper, locally made cars, the Ethiopian government has given incentives such as tax breaks to foreign car manufacturers to set up and assemble new vehicles in the country. Currently Ethiopia produces 8,000 commercial and private vehicles for the local market a year - something the government admits is way below the country's potential. Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn has often pointed out plans for Ethiopia to become a leading manufacturer and exporter of locally made cars. At least half a dozen car assembly plants, mostly Chinese, have been set up in Ethiopia. One of them is Lifan Motors, which was set up nearly seven years ago. One of its cheapest saloon models costs about $20,000 new. It has a plant on the outskirts of the Addis Ababa which assembles about 1,000 cars a year - way below its capacity. For the company's deputy manager, Ma Qun, this is down to a lack of confidence in the local market from consumers. Those who can afford imported brands, will choose them over local cars - despite the high taxes charged on used cars, he says. ""We are not satisfied. Our factory's capacity is about 5,000 a year but we sell just 1,000 units. ""It's because the policy doesn't restrict second-hand cars. So there aren't really many incentives for us to compete. ""We are waiting to see if there will be a change in the policy."" For many Ethiopian car buyers it comes down to value for money. ""We often prefer imported cars because we believe they are much better than the Chinese assembled here,"" one prospective buyer said. ""On top of that, people don't trust cars assembled locally because what we import from China are not up to a standard quality."" Another pointed out concerns about spare parts for locally assembled cars. ""Those you usually find around here are not genuine. That is the major reason people prefer Japanese cars."" But the government is highly unlikely to change its luxury tax on foreign cars. So for people like Mr Girma, who wants a big, reliable car for his family, it remains a Catch-22 situation and his search will continue. Ethiopia's industrial boom.

"The iconic billboard lights at Piccadilly Circus have been switched off for renovations and will stay off until autumn. The billboard, which has displayed electrical advertisements for more than a century, went dark at 08:30 GMT for work to take place. It is the first time since World War Two the lights have gone off, except for power cuts and special events. A temporary advertising banner will replace the lights. This video can not be played A history of how the lights have changed at Piccadilly Circus A permanent single screen will be unveiled in autumn to replace the current six screens. As well as being an advertising board, it will be able to provide live video streaming and give updates about events such as the weather and sports results. Ros Morgan, chief executive of the Heart of London business alliance, said the new screen would ""bring visitors an enhanced entertainment experience"". About 100 million people are estimated to pass through Piccadilly Circus each year. The lights, seen here on VE Day, were switched off for a decade during and just after World War Two The new display will boast one of the highest resolution LED displays of its size in the world The lights have previously gone out in 1939 to comply with World War Two blackouts. They were not switched back on until 1949. Since then, they have only been turned off as a mark of respect, including during the funerals of Winston Churchill and Princess Diana, and in support of environmental campaigns. The occasional power cut and the imposed three-day week in the 1970s have also plunged Piccadilly Circus into darkness. Coca-Cola has a 62-year residency on the Piccadilly Circus display The occasional power cut, like this one in June 2007, has also turned off the illuminations The new display, which will be the same size as the current space, will be shared by six advertisers. Coca-Cola has been advertising in Piccadilly Circus since 1954 and will continue its residency, while Samsung will also have a spot. Vasiliki Arvaniti, portfolio manager at Land Securities, said the new screen would offer brands ""pioneering new ways to connect"" with people.

"A third of MPs in the Indian parliament faced criminal charges Why do India's political parties field candidates with criminal charges? Why do the voters favour them despite their tainted past? Political scientist Milan Vaishnav has been studying links between crime and democracy in India for many years now. His upcoming book When Crime Pays offers some intriguing insights into what is a disturbing feature of India's electoral democracy. The good news is that the general election is a thriving, gargantuan exercise: 554 million voters queued up at more than 900,000 stations to cast their ballots in the last edition in 2014. The fortunes of 8,250 candidates representing 464 political parties were at stake. The bad news is that a third (34%) of 543 MPs who were elected faced criminal charges, up from 30% in 2009 and 24% in 2004. Some of the charges were of minor nature or politically motivated. But more than 20% of the new MPs faced serious charges such as attempted murder, assaulting public officials, and theft. Now, India's general elections are not exactly a cakewalk. The Indian politicians facing criminal charges Why do many India MPs have criminal records? Politics and the barrel of the gun,external Over time, they have become fiercely competitive: 464 parties were in the fray in 2014, up from 55 in the first election in 1952. The average margin of victory was 9.7% in 2009, the thinnest since the first election. At 15%, the average margin of victory was fatter in the landslide 2014 polls, but even this was vastly lower than, say, the average margin of victory in the 2012 US Congressional elections (32%) and the 2010 general election in Britain (18%). India's elections are fiercely competitive Almost all parties in India, led by the ruling BJP and the main opposition Congress, field tainted candidates. Why do they do so? For one, says Dr Vaishnav, ""a key factor motivating parties to select candidates with serious criminal records comes down to cold, hard cash"". The rising cost of elections and a shadowy election financing system where parties and candidates under-report collections and expenses means that parties prefer ""self-financing candidates who do not represent a drain on the finite party coffers but instead contribute 'rents' to the party"". Many of these candidates have criminal records. There are three million political positions in India's three-tier democracy; each election requires considerable resources. Many parties are like personal fiefs run by dominant personalities and dynasts, and lacking inner-party democracy - conditions, which help ""opportunistic candidates with deep pockets"". ""Wealthy, self financing candidates are not only attractive to parties but they are also likely to be more electorally competitive. Contesting elections is an expensive proposition in most parts of the world, a candidate's wealth is a good proxy for his or her electoral vitality,"" says Dr Vaishnav, who is senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Political parties also nominate candidates with criminal backgrounds to stand for election because, simply put, they win. During his research, Dr Vaishnav studied all candidates who stood in the last three general elections. He separated them into candidates with clean records and candidates with criminal records, and found that the latter had an 18% chance of winning their next election whereas the ""clean"" candidates had only a 6% chance. Many Indians vote on lines on identity and religion He did a similar calculation for candidates contesting state elections between 2003 and 2009, and found a ""large winning advantage for candidates who have cases pending against them"". Politics also offers a lucrative career  - a 2013 study showed that the average wealth of sitting legislators increased 222% during just one term in office. The officially declared average wealth of re-contesting candidates - including losers and winners - was $264,000 (Â£216,110) in 2004 and $618,000 in 2013, an increase of 134%. Now why do Indians vote for criminal candidates? Is it because many of the voters are illiterate, ignorant, or simply, ill-informed? Dr Vaishnav doesn't believe so. Candidates with criminal records don't mask their reputation. Earlier this month, a candidate belonging to the ruling party in northern Uttar Pradesh state reportedly boasted to a party worker that he was the""biggest criminal"",external. Increasing information through media and rising awareness hasn't led to a shrinking of tainted candidates. Dr Vaishnav believes reasonably well-informed voters support criminal candidates in constituencies where social divisions driven by caste and/or religion are sharp and the government is failing to carry out its functions - delivering services, dispensing justice, or providing security - in an impartial manner. ""There is space here for a criminal candidate to present himself as a Robin Hood-like figure,"" says Dr Vaishnav. Prime Minister Modi has called for state funding of elections Clearly, crime and politics will remain inextricably intertwined as long as India doesn't make its election financing system transparent, parties become more democratic and the state begins to deliver ample services and justice. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has suggestedstate funding of polls,externalto help clean up campaign financing.  Earlier this month, he said people had theright to know where the BJP got its funds,externalfrom. Some 14% of the candidates his BJP party fielded in the last elections had faced serious charges. (More than 10% of the candidates recruited by the Congress faced charges). But no party is walking the talk yet.

"Oscar (right) is now one of three Brazilians at Shanghai SIPG Chinese Super League clubs will only be allowed to play three non-Chinese players per game in their next season - which begins in March. A rule change has reduced the number of foreigners allowed in a move which could slow down the wave of big-money signings from Europe. Chelsea striker Diego Costa has been linked with a move to China that would beworth Â£30m a year.,external A statement said,externalthe new measures will address ""irrational investments"". This video can not be played Everyone's talking about Diego Costa Previously the rule was ""4+1"" - four foreigners of any nationality plus one Asian player in a matchday squad. Teams will now also be required to name two Chinese players aged under 23 in their matchday squads, with at least one in the starting XI, with the Chinese Football Association also looking into ""signature fees and other illegal activities"" in recent transfers. Chelsea midfielders OscarandJohn Mikel Obihave already moved to China this month, while former Manchester United and Manchester City forward Carlos Tevez reportedly became the world's highest-paid player when he joinedShanghai Shenhua last month. Shenhua would be one club hit by the new rules as they have six non-Chinese players in their squad, including Tevez, former Chelsea forward Demba Ba and ex-Newcastle striker Obafemi Martins. Costa has been linked with a move to Tianjin Quanjian, who signedBelgium midfielder Axel Witselfor a salary of more than Â£15m a year this month. Listen: 'China replicating Premier League 20 years ago' BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonell Chinese teams have been paying reportedly exorbitant sums to lure international stars like Carlos Tevez and Axel Witsel. Now, the new rules will especially affect players from the Asian region - like Australians and Koreans - who were able to be chosen on top of the previous international count of four.

"Johanna and Scott Watkins pictured together before she became severely allergic to her husband Twenty-nine-year-old Johanna Watkins from Minnesota cannot kiss her husband Scott, or even spend time in the same room as him. She suffers from Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, a rare disorder of the immune system, which means she is allergic to almost everything, including her husband's scent. Johanna and Scott Watkins's date nights are very different from other couples. ""Scott and I will try to watch a show together. We can't be in the room together, because I'm allergic to him, but he will be three floors below me in a room on his laptop and I will be on mine and we'll watch the show at the same time and then text about it as we're watching it,"" says Johanna. Johanna lives in an attic room all by herself with sealed windows and doors, and air filters to purify the air. She has a severe form of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) in which the cells that are meant to protect her from outside threats mutate and start attacking her body instead. On their wedding day the couple were unaware Johanna's condition would become so severe The symptoms and severity of the disease can vary from patient to patient, but it makes Johanna allergic to virtually everything and can trigger life-threatening anaphylactic shock. Before she married her husband Scott in 2013 Johanna did not expect her condition to become so severe. She worked as a teacher and the couple used to love hiking together. Even then she struggled with unusual rashes, irritable bowel syndrome and migraines, but these ailments became much worse after the couple married. ""There were times three and four years ago, before we got the diagnosis, that if I was extra close to my wife, specifically if my face was close to Johanna's face, she would cough,"" says Scott. But it was only last year that the couple realised they had become unable to physically share their life together. ""We had noticed that when Scott would come in [to the room] I would start feeling worse and worse. My normal daily symptoms would just be aggravated,"" says Johanna. ""And then at one point he went to get his haircut and came back in the room and within two minutes I had started my anaphylactic symptoms and he had to leave."" A week later Scott tried to see his wife again, but the same thing happened, and they realised their lives would have to change dramatically. ""It was this horrible reality that it wasn't going to work,"" says Johanna. ""I was now reacting strongly to my husband. Before this I had reacted to my parents, to many, many other people, but it was horrific when it became Scott."" Find out more Listen to Johanna and Scott's interviewon Outlook, on the BBC World Service Get the Outlook podcastfor more extraordinary real-life stories The treatment and medication that is usually given to MCAS sufferers does not help Johanna, so at the moment the couple do not know when - if ever - their situation will change. ""There's not an easy way around this problem. I want to keep Johanna safe and me going to see her compromises her safety,"" says Scott. ""One of the ways I can take care of her now is by not going to see her. I'm not going to endanger her life. We're absolutely committed to one another and we're going to wait as long as it takes to see if there is some kind of healing."" Doctors are trying different treatments, but none so far have helped. ""They don't know if I will get well, and so we hope and we pray that I will,"" says Johanna. ""I have had anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening allergic reaction, more times than we can keep track of. My life could end quickly. Life is frail - it can end."" But Scott will be part of her life for as long as it continues, she says. ""On our wedding day we made vows to each other that till death do us part. No matter what life brought. ""I can tell you that even if I have this until I'm 90 years old, I would be committed to my husband with that vow and still love him."" Johanna and Scott are no longer able to hold each other's hands Scott says they do sometimes get angry and frustrated about their situation. ""I've had to release a lot of what I expected for myself and I've had to accept what has been given to us,"" says Scott. He adds: ""Johanna and I are good at talking, we talk a lot, we try to communicate a lot, so one thing that we've found that's helpful is just bringing each other into what's going on in our lives as best we can because we're not able to be together."" Scott works full-time as a teacher and then returns home every evening to cook Johanna's food. ""It's one of the ways that I can care for her, and every other day for the past year I've had one of my dear friends come and they help [me] cook for Johanna,"" he says. ""She can only eat two meals, so she's been eating the same two meals for over a year."" Johanna can only tolerate 15 different foods, including spices, so she eats either beef chuck roast (beef stew) with organic celery, carrot and parsnip or organic lamb with turmeric, cinnamon and cucumber. Johanna has not responded to any treatment so far, including four rounds of chemotherapy The couple are currently living in the family home of their friends, the Olsons, while their own home is renovated to make it a safe living space for Johanna. The Olson family have given up using all scented products and do not cook in their house at all. ""I have had severe reactions to someone smoking a cigarette down the block,"" says Johanna. ""I have had severe reactions to the pizza place that's a mile down the street, and all my windows are closed and sealed in the room with special filters. ""But just if the wind blows it on the right direction that day and I get even a whiff I can have a severe reaction. The house is quite large and I'm at the top level, and if an onion were to be cut in the kitchen I have had a severe reaction."" Johanna has not left the attic room for more than a year, except to visit the hospital in an emergency or to see her doctor. Every morning she listens to a playlist of songs and then might write or answer an email to a friend, or video-call her young nieces. The only people she does not have a life-threatening reaction to are her siblings, who help take care of her. Before they enter her room, they have to avoid eating strongly spiced food, shower with a special soap and strip down to their underwear. As soon as they walk in, they put on masks and special clothes that have never left Johanna's room. Despite all these precautions, Johanna's symptoms still become worse after their visit. ""I think growing up in America, it's common for us to just think, 'Oh OK if there's a disease there'll be a medical solution, it will be fixed and I'll move on with my life,'"" says Johanna. ""So being diagnosed and becoming this ill, [there was] definitely a grieving process that I went through."" But the fact that Scott is downstairs in the same house and that she can talk to him on the phone is a huge comfort, says Johanna. ""I have many gifts in my life, many blessings that I have to be thankful for,"" she says. ""And that reminds me to not become selfish and just make it all about me.""

"The two world leaders may have more in common than meets the eye At first glance, few people have less in common than Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President-elect Donald Trump. Mr Trudeau is a favourite of global progressives, who see himas a bastion against rising tide of anti-immigrantand protectionist sentiment and who campaigned on appealing to people's ""better angels"". Mr Trump won the US election riding that anti-trade and anti-globalisation wave, and as a political outsider who is free with his insults. The relationship between the North American neighbours is a vital one and depends in part on the Republican and Liberal leaders finding common ground, despite differences in personality and policy. Here are five areas where Mr Trudeau and Mr Trump are somewhat simpatico. Justin Trudeau surprised opponents with his 2015 win. 1. Theypulled off unexpected election victories after being discounted by rivals and pundits. Pollsters in both countries failed to predict Mr Trudeau and Mr Trump's upsets, and both party leaders were seen as celebrity lightweights by rivals. It is a similarity not lost on Mr Trudeau. In a 16 December interview with a Montreal radio show host, the prime minister revealed he touched on that ""common ground"" during his congratulatory phone call to Mr Trump following the US election. ""He and I had a conversation about being knocked around by the media because, present company excluded, that's the experience that I'd had for years of people just slamming me and saying 'he'd never become prime minister,'"" Mr Trudeau said. 2. They embrace politics in the social media age. The prime minister and the president-elect both use social media for their political ends. Mr Trudeau and his team know a charming photo opportunity of the photogenic prime minister, fromshirtless selfiesto yoga poses, can go viral and bolster his popularity at home and abroad. He has leveraged social media as a tool to sell his brand of progressive cool to the world. While Mr Trudeau has a healthy Twitter following for a world leader, with nearly 2.4m followers (and over 830,000 on Instagram), his influence on the platform is dwarfed by Mr Trump's 19.7m followers. A prolific tweeter, Mr Trump  wields his influential account toattack opponents,drive the news, andpressure US manufacturersto bend to his agenda. He has, however, promised to be more restrained in his Twitter antics after being sworn-in 20 January. Justin Trudeau says he avoids negative politics 3. Theypromised to change the way politics is done. Mr Trump vowed during the campaign he would ""drain the swamp"", a catch-all promise for his supporters who see of Washington as a cesspool of lobbyists, corruption, and waste. During the 2015 Canadian election, Mr Trudeau said his predecessor, former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, ""turned Ottawa into a partisan swamp"" during his near decade in power. Mr Trudeau promised to put an end to partisanship and patronage in Ottawa, to usher in a more transparent and receptive government, and to make question period respectful again. The two have faced critics who say those promises were quick tofall by the wayside. Donald Trump said he would 'Make America great Again' 4. They harkened tothepast in their pitch to voters. The two politicians pressed some very powerful nostalgia buttons as they campaigned to lead their countries. Mr Trump's inescapable campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"", borrowed from former US president Ronald Reagan's 1980 race, looked back to a time when voters felt there was more prosperity and opportunity in the United States and when their nation garnered respect on the world stage. Mr Trudeau was more subtle, though his campaign was woven through with a thread of nostalgia, from a promise to recommit troops to overseas peacekeeping efforts to a foreign policy return to when Canadians thought the world saw the country as its good neighbour. After winning the election, Mr Trudeau and his MPs made ""Canada is back"" one of their favourite catchphrases. Pierre Elliott Trudeau, right, Justin Trudeau's father, with former US President Ronald Reagan 5. They followed in their fathers' footsteps. Fred Trump, the first New York real estate magnate in the Trump family, started a million dollar residential real estate business in Brooklyn and Queens. The Donald learned the business from his father, switching from building low-income housing in New York City's outer-boroughs to luxury towers in downtown Manhattan. Justin Trudeau grew up surrounded by politics and was once toasted by former US President Richard Nixon, who predicted the young boy would one day become prime minister like his father Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Trudeau  senior served as in that role from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984, becoming one of Canada's most recognisable leaders.

"The RSPCA discovered a snake trapped in a loft was a child's cuddly toy - not like the real one pictured here The RSPCA was called out to catch a stray snake in a loft which turned out to be a child's cuddly toy. A welfare officer made the discovery at a property in Surrey after being contacted by a distressed homeowner in December. It is a one of a string of calls made to the animal welfare charity where people have mistaken objects for living creatures. The RSPCA is urging the public to double check before raising the alarm. Other call outs include a report in November that an owl had been sitting on a roof for more than four days and appeared unable to move. Inspectors discovered that the creature was in fact made out of plastic. A month later animal collection officer Alan Farr was asked by a homeowner to help find a trapped bird which was making a ""peeping noise"" in her loft. ""After searching around and unable to find the mystery bird, I then went into her front room and found a smoke alarm beeping after the battery had gone flat,"" he revealed. This plastic toy was mistaken for a live crocodile Others include: A call made about an escaped tortoise in a garden which turned out to be made of stone A welfare officer was called to help a collapsed horse but instead found only a pile of hay A caller told the RSPCA a cat was stuck in the cavity of a wall after hearing a noise. It turned out to be coming from a computer game in a nearby bedroom An officer was dispatched to help a bird tangled in an aerial which was revealed to be a kite - attached to the aerial to deter wild birds The RSPCA was called to reports of an animal stuck under a floorboard making a ""yowling noise"" - which it discovered was a rose brush scraping on a window A collection officer went out torescue a baby crocodile on the side of a road which was in fact made out of plastic. The charity's 24-hour cruelty line received 1,153,744 calls in 2016, 3% more than the previous year. It has urged the public to make sure they have a genuine problem before getting in touch. RSPCA spokesman Dermot Murphy said: ""We know that people mean well and most of these calls are not made in malice, and although we would like to be able to help everyone, we simply haven't got the staff to personally investigate each and every issue that the public brings to us. ""We must prioritise to make sure we get to the animals most in need.""

"Bill Lucas will spend his birthday on Monday with his family An evening whisky is the key to a long life, according to Britain's oldest living Olympian on his 100th birthday. Bill Lucas said a glass of wine or sherry before lunch also kept him strong. Mr Lucas, also the country's oldest living Bomber Command pilot, competed in the 5,000m track event at the 1948 London Olympic Games. He celebrated his birthday at a party organised by his athletics club, Belgrave Harriers. Bill Lucas was joined at his 100th birthday at the Belgrave Harriers club by fellow Olympians Snowy Brooks, Paskar Owor and John Bicourt A member of the Belgrave Harriers club for 81 years, Mr Lucas said his call-up to the RAF deprived him of a chance of an Olympic medal. The decorated pilot, who lives in Cowfold, West Sussex, ran his 1948 heat in 14 minutes 30.6 seconds - 20 seconds off that required to qualify for the final. He said: ""I spent six years in the service and I had done very little training and I'd missed 1940 and 1944, where I might well have got a medal or something like that... but Hitler deprived me of those, so I went and bombed them instead."" This video can not be played Watch: Archive report about the opening of the 1948 Games The1948 Olympic Games took place in London,externalas Europe continued to emerge from the shadow of World War II. Dubbed ""the Austerity Olympics"", the Games were greeted enthusiastically by thousands who attended the opening ceremony and watched the torch being carried into Wembley Stadium by British athlete John Mark. When Mr Lucas competed for Great Britain, aged 32, he had already flown 81 missions over Germany. He trained for the 1948 Games while working full-time in insurance and living off rations in the post-war era. Bill Lucas was joined by his wife Sheena for his birthday celebrations Belgrave Harriers presented Mr Lucas with a 172-year-old bottle of Madeira wine at the party in Wimbledon, south-west London, on Sunday. The party was the father-of-two's first outing since Christmas after he was cut out of a car following an accident in November. He said the celebration was ""absolutely marvellous"". Mr Lucas will spend his birthday on Monday with his family. His wife Sheena, 87, said: ""I'm immensely proud - I love him dearly and we have a wonderful life together.""

"The iconic billboard lights at Piccadilly Circus have been switched off for renovations and will stay off until autumn. The billboard, which has displayed electrical advertisements for more than a century, went dark at 08:30 GMT for work to take place. It is the first time since World War Two the lights have gone off, except for power cuts and special events. A temporary advertising banner will replace the lights. This video can not be played A history of how the lights have changed at Piccadilly Circus A permanent single screen will be unveiled in autumn to replace the current six screens. As well as being an advertising board, it will be able to provide live video streaming and give updates about events such as the weather and sports results. Ros Morgan, chief executive of the Heart of London business alliance, said the new screen would ""bring visitors an enhanced entertainment experience"". About 100 million people are estimated to pass through Piccadilly Circus each year. The lights, seen here on VE Day, were switched off for a decade during and just after World War Two The new display will boast one of the highest resolution LED displays of its size in the world The lights have previously gone out in 1939 to comply with World War Two blackouts. They were not switched back on until 1949. Since then, they have only been turned off as a mark of respect, including during the funerals of Winston Churchill and Princess Diana, and in support of environmental campaigns. The occasional power cut and the imposed three-day week in the 1970s have also plunged Piccadilly Circus into darkness. Coca-Cola has a 62-year residency on the Piccadilly Circus display The occasional power cut, like this one in June 2007, has also turned off the illuminations The new display, which will be the same size as the current space, will be shared by six advertisers. Coca-Cola has been advertising in Piccadilly Circus since 1954 and will continue its residency, while Samsung will also have a spot.

"Theresa May is to appear in a spread in glossy fashion magazine US Vogue, Downing Street has confirmed. The prime minister - who is known for her love of fashion, especially eye-catching shoes - posed for the renowned portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz. ""The long-planned shoot for US Vogue will come out in April,"" a No 10 spokesman said. The magazine's editor, British-born Anna Wintour, was made a dame in the New Year Honours. Mrs May chose a lifetime's subscription to Vogue magazine as her luxury item when she appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs programme. Stranded alone on a desert island, Mrs May says she would chose a lifetime subscription to Vogue to keep her company Her choice of expensive, chocolate-coloured leather trousers- which retail for Â£995 - for a previous magazine spread angered former education secretary Nicky Morgan, who said she had never spent that much on anything except her wedding dress. According to the Press Association, Downing Street sources denied reports the Vogue feature was connected to a planned visit to the US for the PM's first meeting with Donald Trump. US photographer Annie Leibovitz has previously shot Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton for the publication. Margaret Thatcher, the UK's only other female leader, was photographed four times for British Vogue.

"Bill Lucas will spend his birthday on Monday with his family An evening whisky is the key to a long life, according to Britain's oldest living Olympian on his 100th birthday. Bill Lucas said a glass of wine or sherry before lunch also kept him strong. Mr Lucas, also the country's oldest living Bomber Command pilot, competed in the 5,000m track event at the 1948 London Olympic Games. He celebrated his birthday at a party organised by his athletics club, Belgrave Harriers. Bill Lucas was joined at his 100th birthday at the Belgrave Harriers club by fellow Olympians Snowy Brooks, Paskar Owor and John Bicourt A member of the Belgrave Harriers club for 81 years, Mr Lucas said his call-up to the RAF deprived him of a chance of an Olympic medal. The decorated pilot, who lives in Cowfold, West Sussex, ran his 1948 heat in 14 minutes 30.6 seconds - 20 seconds off that required to qualify for the final. He said: ""I spent six years in the service and I had done very little training and I'd missed 1940 and 1944, where I might well have got a medal or something like that... but Hitler deprived me of those, so I went and bombed them instead."" This video can not be played Watch: Archive report about the opening of the 1948 Games The1948 Olympic Games took place in London,externalas Europe continued to emerge from the shadow of World War II. Dubbed ""the Austerity Olympics"", the Games were greeted enthusiastically by thousands who attended the opening ceremony and watched the torch being carried into Wembley Stadium by British athlete John Mark. When Mr Lucas competed for Great Britain, aged 32, he had already flown 81 missions over Germany. He trained for the 1948 Games while working full-time in insurance and living off rations in the post-war era. Bill Lucas was joined by his wife Sheena for his birthday celebrations Belgrave Harriers presented Mr Lucas with a 172-year-old bottle of Madeira wine at the party in Wimbledon, south-west London, on Sunday. The party was the father-of-two's first outing since Christmas after he was cut out of a car following an accident in November. He said the celebration was ""absolutely marvellous"". Mr Lucas will spend his birthday on Monday with his family. His wife Sheena, 87, said: ""I'm immensely proud - I love him dearly and we have a wonderful life together.""

"The City of London is braced for the chill winds of regulation Financial institutions across the UK are gearing up for one of the most far-reaching regulatory shake-ups they have ever faced. There's a five-letter acronym regularly muttered in the City of London, which leads to some rubbing of chins, looks of bewilderment and groans about the workload. The acronym in question is Mifid 2, the name of a rather technical, complex and, yes, dull-sounding piece of financial legislation from the EU. It stands for the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Mifid 2 means big changes for banks across Europe over the next year. ""It's a complete system change, very detailed,"" says Anthony Browne, who runs the British Bankers' Association (BBA). ""It is changing their IT systems, changing the way their whole systems operate right from the front end and the information the traders put in to the back end and information they provide to clients; it's also the documentation they provide for their clients, and information they give to regulators themselves."" The rules run to more than 1,000 pages. The new rulebook - or perhaps rule ""tome"", more accurately - is the EU's response to the financial crisis. A decade on from that scarring experience, the European Commission predicts the law will be transformative for markets. Despite the Brexit vote, the City still has to abide by the new EU regulations Many banks back the new rules, saying they will help avoid a rerun of 2007-08 by bringing in more transparency and giving investors greater protection. Some companies, though, say they are too tough and have already led to job losses. ""It is the unintended consequences that could be the problem here,"" says Julian Allen-Ellis from the EFMA financial markets trade body. ""The operational cost of both buy-side and sell-side setting up for this new regulation could mean profitability is impacted and that ultimately impacts the person on the street with their pension and their portfolio."" So why Mifid 2? It's the sequel to Mifid 1, which has been in force since November 2007 That made it easier and cheaper to buy investments across the EU, by allowing investment firms to operate across borders more easily But the financial crash exposed some of its weaknesses So the European Commission now wants to make financial markets ""more efficient, resilient and transparent"" and to ""strengthen the protection of investors"" The new regulations come into force in 2018 A recent survey of the City by PA Consulting suggested two out of five companies were not prepared enough to implement the new rules. They'd better get a move on. The sprawling regulations come into force in January 2018. There are some who argue that these complex EU rules could be a big help to the City after Brexit, because they contain something called ""equivalence"". That allows financial companies from outside the EU to do business inside it, as long as their home country has the same standards of regulation. The City is wary of what Mifid 2 will usher in ""Potentially this could be a way through the mire,"" says David Biggin, an adviser at PA Consulting. ""For a lot of the companies talking about relocating, actually this rule might allow some light at the end of the tunnel. It's a technocratic decision rather than a political decision. It is a way forward."" However, not everyone thinks ""equivalence"" will save the City's bacon if it finds itself with less favourable access to the EU than it has today. ""The main drawback is it can be withdrawn unilaterally at any time,"" warns the BBA's Anthony Browne. He has other concerns too. ""This would be a political process done at a time when the UK is negotiating its divorce arrangements from the EU, and when it's thinking about negotiating a trade deal with the EU. The chance we would get agreement on equivalence, to come in the day the UK leaves the EU, seems hopeful at best."" The experience of some countries already outside the EU seem to bear that fear out. Several have already applied for ""equivalence"" status under previous financial rules. Guernsey is one of them. The Crown dependency has beefed up its laws, and they have been judged as technically the same as the EU's by an EU regulator, no less. Guernsey is now waiting for the European Commission to give it the final nod - and has been for two years. ""The technical decision was made. Now it's become a political decision,"" says Christopher Jehan from the Guernsey Investment Fund Association. ""That political decision is effectively the roadblock for us,"" he says. ""They're using whatever reason they have for anything else going on in the world as a delaying tactic."" Guernsey's experience does not bode well for those in the UK who think these new complex EU rules will help the City after Brexit. But Mifid 2 is already bringing about big regulatory change in the City, the scale of which it has rarely seen.

"This video can not be played The Davos summit... in numbers Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, and the rise of populism have left the world's ""liberal elites"" reeling. Can Davos, their ideological habitat, survive? It's all too easy to take a swipe at ""Davos"" - the annual Alpine pilgrimage of the so-called global elite, during which they underline the urgency of tackling climate change to the hum of private jet traffic, pledge to alleviate food poverty while snacking on caviar canapes, and commit to reducing inequality while being waited on hand-and-foot by an army of service staff at exclusive dinner parties. But beyond the often jarring contrasts, the World Economic Forum (or ze WEF, as locals call it), has always been able to point to its role in oiling the wheels of a socially progressive, pro-globalisation alliance - safe in the knowledge that, to a greater or lesser extent, it was in harmony with the tide of history. Then came 2016. At the beginning of the year, when Donald Trump was still one of many potential US presidential candidates, and a date for Britain's referendum on EU membership had yet to be set, Davos regulars were remarkably sanguine. Few Davos delegates last year predicted Donald Trump's election victory The WEF's annual Global Risks Report, in which it tries to predict future crises, made little mention of anti-establishment forces and WPP's Sir Martin Sorrell reassured delegates that Hillary Clinton would emerge victorious, regardless of whom she ran against. European leaders seemed confident that their institutions would survive the challenges posed by an influx of refugees, murderous attacks on capital cities and rising nationalist sentiment. Soundbites dismissing populist movements were easy to come by. Fast forward 12 months, and the WEF crowd is comparatively muted. Trump, China and Brexit to dominate Davos Vaswani: Why is Xi Jinping going to Davos? Davos coverage in full With the notable exception of billionaire George Soros, few are going out of their way to condemn the incoming US president, even as his daily pronouncements signal that the world's most important economy is moving further and further away from the Davos model. Perhaps no image sums up the new world order as well as that of a seemingly despondent Klaus Schwab, the respected German academic who is the driving force behind WEF, being ushered through the lobby of Trump Tower last month. The World Economic Forum's Klaus Schwab at Trump Tower last month But Mr Schwab's visit is also indicative of the WEF's strength, in particular its ability to spread the Davos gospel by running a very broad church, both politically and geographically. Indeed, the likes of Donald Trump have long been invited to the meeting (though he has yet to attend), and when controversial figures, such as Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, descend on the Swiss resort, they are hardly put in the stocks. What's more, as organisers are keen to point out, Davos has always been about more than just the US and Europe, and Indian, Chinese and African attendees have been put centre stage for years. Chinese President Xi Jinping toasts Swiss President Doris Leuthard ahead of Davos Much is being made of the fact that Xi Jinping is to becomethe first Chinese president to attend WEFwhen he opens the forum this week, and that Davos is welcoming a bigger trade delegation from the country than ever before - a signal, perhaps, that a more inward-looking US leaves a void for other global powers to fill. But a Chinese delegation was first invited to the annual meeting in 1979, and although he has stayed away in recent years, Russian President Vladimir Putin has drawn crowds on the mountain more than once. And as the geopolitical map changes, the WEF's softly-softly approach - in which very little is mandated and everything is up for polite discussion - may yet lead the Davos tribe out of ideological isolation, even if it doesn't manage to keep their annual champagne consumption out of the headlines. Trump, China and Brexit to dominate Davos Eight people 'as rich as poorest half' Why is Xi Jinping going to Davos? What is Davos and why should I care?

"This video can not be played How BlaBlaCar created a global transport network with empty car seats A rail strike is a strange time to realise that your start-up is going to be a success but that was the moment that the founders of BlaBlaCar knew that their company was going to take off. BlaBlaCar is the French online ride-sharing company that pairs people travelling between cities with drivers who have empty seats in their car. When it was set up in 2006, founders Nicolas Brusson and Frederic Mazzella found it difficult to persuade customers or investors of the idea. ""People thought we were crazy. At the beginning they would say, 'it's interesting but you're doing hitchhiking online and no-one's going to do that,'"" Mr Brusson says. BlaBlaCar's global headquarters occupy three floors of the ""#Cloud"" building in Paris The popularity and success of BlaBlaCar today is likely to make any investor who turned them down 10 years ago cry into their cornflakes. Mr Brusson confirms to the BBC that the latest round of funding values the company at more than Â£1.2bn ($1.5bn; â¬1.4bn). The company makes its money by taking a percentage of the cost of the journeys taken by its 35 million members in 22 countries. It says four million people use BlaBlaCar every month. The company's big break came in 2007 when the French train network was shut down by a strike and passengers were looking for alternative ways of travelling. BlaBlaCar saw a massive boost, not only in its usage but also to its profile as media companies lined up to cover the strike-busting solution. ""It was the first time I realised it was very useful,"" Mr Brusson says. ""After this spike the passenger numbers went down but to a much higher level than before, a lot of people came back."" The ash cloud rising from a volcano on Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull glacier grounded planes across Europe in 2010 Today one in five adults in France are members of BlaBlaCar. ""We didn't wait to be successful in one market before moving into another,"" Mr Brusson says. ""If we were going to work in France we could work across Europe."" In 2009 it went into Spain, while a year later an explosion of ash from a volcano on Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull glacier grounded planes across Europe, giving BlaBlaCar the second ""fortunate, unfortunate"" event, which boosted its popularity again. The company began to grow across Europe, either by moving in or acquiring competitors. ""We are a French company,"" says Cyrielle Callot, Blablacar's head of growth, ""but our main language is English."" A screen in the BlaBlaCar office shows journeys being taken by users on the platform across Europe It has an office in London but the main hub is in the very chic ""#Cloud"" building in Paris - BlaBlaCar takes up the first three floors, while Facebook is a close neighbour. These two offices link up a global staff of 550 employees who stretch across Europe from Portugal to Russia, the Ukraine and Turkey, and since 2014 they have expanded into India, Brazil and Mexico. Some countries have taken off more than others, Russia and India in particular have seen what the company describes as ""phenomenal growth"", the UK has reportedly seen slower growth. One evening in Paris we watched as three female BlaBlaCar passengers got into the cars of drivers they had never met. ""I always choose a driver who has his picture on the site and good reviews from former travellers,"" says one of the women, Lucienne Nault. Lucienne Nault is a regular BlaBlaCar user Ms Nault had just been dropped off in Paris having travelled from Brussels, and was waiting for her second BlaBlaCar driver to pick her up on her way home to the Loire Valley. ""I make sure when I travel there are always other passengers,"" she says. ""After all, in a train one sits next to perfect strangers."" Jessica Ekholm, research director for Gartner, the information technology research company, sees the trust issue as one of the company's biggest ongoing challenges. ""Trust is paramount,"" she says. ""You need to know who's driving you. Is this a good driver? They have their scoring, but can you really trust it? Can you trust the people who have recommended them? Who else is going to be travelling in the car?"" ""We collect a lot of information,"" says BlaBla Car's Cyrielle Callot in response. ""Name, age, gender, profession. More and more we ask people to Facebook Connect. We have peer-to-peer ratings, so whenever you're going to be using Blablacar as a driver or a passenger, each person is going to rate the other. And we have a feature called Ladies Only, so that they can choose rides where only women are travelling."" BlaBlaCar hopes to avoid many of the issues faced by the ride-hailing app Uber. Drivers on the BlaBlaCar platform can only charge for the cost of the journey. Nicolas Brusson, co-founder of BlaBlaCar, says the company sticks closer to the ethos of the ""sharing economy"" than Uber or Airbnb They do not have to change their insurance or pay tax on the money they receive from passengers as they are technically not making a profit. Mr Brusson says that companies like Uber and Airbnb have strayed from the original ethos of the sharing economy, as they are offering a business service to consumers, not a sharing service between one consumer and another. He claims that the ""global transport network"" BlaBlaCar has built has been based on the insight that the average car occupancy in most countries in the world is around 1.5 seats per car. ""The biggest mode of travel all over Europe and all over the world is the car, "" he says. ""When you think of the volume of the available seats you have in cars and the fact that they're not occupied, it's absurd, it's like running an airline company with your aircraft three-quarters empty.""

"Liisa Ronkainen likes the idea that she will continue to receive the basic income even if she finds a job ""I was so surprised when I got the letter, and a bit sceptical too,"" says Liisa Ronkainen, one of 2,000 Finns chosen for a government experiment to provide unemployed people with a basic income. Out of work for half a year, Liisa, 26 and from Helsinki, has been looking for a job without success. ""While I'm unemployed I will only get â¬36 more per month with the basic income. I've always been positive about the idea, though, so it was nice to be one of those who were chosen."" Basic income has frequently been suggested as a way of cutting welfare bureaucracy as well as poverty. But one of the main reasons why Finland's social insurance agency Kela is trying out the monthly tax-free payment of â¬560 (Â£490; $600) is to see whether providing a basic income will make the unemployed more eager to go into short-term jobs. Finland has some 213,000 unemployed, a higher rate than its Nordic neighbours, and a working population of 2,413,000. Short-term contracts here have steadily become a key feature of Finland's labour market. The benefit system in many cases provides people with little incentive to go into low-income jobs because welfare is generally cut back if you start earning. ""Every single euro that a person earns diminishes his or her social benefits,"" says Olli Kangas, head of society relations at Kela. ""In some cases an unemployed person is afraid of losing their benefits in the future, if he or she receives a temporary employment."" Olli Kangas sees the two-year trial as merely the start of Finland's experience of basic income The idea behind the basic income experiment is that any earnings would be a supplement; â¬560 a month may not sound much but it is a start. ""The government wants to see if it's possible to eliminate at least the worst disincentives to work,"" says Mr Kangas. Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejectedpaying all adults a basic income in June 2016 Four Dutch cities - Groningen, Tilburg, Utrecht and Wageningen - are to take part in a trial The Canadian province of Ontario will hold its own experiment Scottish councils in Fife and Glasgow may also stage a trial Randomly selected from Finland's unemployed, the 2,000 taking part in the experiment were all receiving the lowest rate of unemployment benefit. After tax, it was little different from the â¬560 they now receive monthly in basic income. The difference is that they will receive it without filling in a form and irrespective of whether they get a job or not over the next two years. For Liisa Ronkainen, already looking for work for several months, it is certainly an attractive idea. ""Now that I will get a salary in addition to the basic income I might try even harder,"" she suggests. And there was a similar message from another of the participants, Juha Jarvinen, who has been out of work for five years but now hopes to start a new business. ""For my part, the basic income will mean I can escape enslavement and feel that I am a functioning citizen again,"" he told Finnish public broadcaster YLE. The trial has aroused interest worldwide, because it will answer the burning questions about how people out of work will respond to the idea of a basic income. Some might decide to acquire more education or change their career, to make themselves more attractive to the labour market. Others might seek to start a business. But there is always the chance that it could be used as an excuse to take it easy and work as little as possible. None of those chosen was given a chance to say no, so the outcome of the project will not be slanted. And no-one will receive less money than before. As for cutting red tape, the prime objective behind the pilot, there will be a partial improvement for those taking part. Those selected for the trial by Kela are aged 25 to 58 Most of those involved receive additional social benefits in the form of housing benefit or a higher unemployment benefit because they have children. The form procedure to get these will remain unchanged during the experiment. But for Finnish authorities bureaucracy will diminish considerably. If any of the 2,000 start studying, get a job or lose a job or even develop a long-term illness, they will not have to pass the information on. Their basic income will not change. Why do Finnish pupils succeed with less homework? Postal service starts befriending scheme Police chief jailed for drug smuggling As the experiment takes hold, researchers will watch how the chosen group fare in comparison with the rest of the country's unemployed. They have already suggested expanding the experiment, either to increase the number of unemployed people taking part or to widen it to other groups in society. The Finnish centre-right government of Prime Minister Juha Sipila has provided â¬20m to the project and the research group says most of the money will remain untouched until the start of 2018. ""This is just a start,"" says Olli Kangas. ""In 2018 we would like to start something better."" As for the cost of the experiment, that depends on how many of the 2,000 will find work. The basic income will initially be covered by the money that would have been paid out in unemployment benefit anyway. Costs will only start to build up when people get a job.

"The Voice UK judges popped to the pub during a break in filming - they popped to the Rovers Return, to be precise, from ITV soap opera Coronation Street, which is filmed near The Voice in Manchester. Beverley Callard (left), who plays Rovers landlady Liz McDonald, showed international pop superstar will.i.am and Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson how to pull a pint. Amy Adams became the latest celebrity to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The US actress, who was Bafta-nominated this week for sci-fi film Arrival, attended its unveiling with mother Kathryn Adams, husband Darren and daughter Aviana. David Walliams and Rochelle Humes joined the voice cast of Teletubbies. They will each lend their voices to the trumpet, which pops out of the ground at the beginning of every episode and announces: ""Time for Teletubbies"". Spanish singer Enrique Iglesias (left) was joined by Cuban performer Descemer Bueno on the top of a bus as they filmed a video in Old Havana. Queen Latifah attended a party thrown by US TV network Fox - home of her new music-based series Star - as part of the Television Critics Association's winter press tour in Pasadena, California. Images from a new production of La Cage aux Folles were released picturing Adrian Zmed and EastEnders' John Partridge. The show continues its UK tour next week at Norwich's Theatre Royal. Moonlight triumphed in the closely-fought battle for best film drama at the Golden Globes in Los Angeles. It held off competition from the critically-lauded Manchester By The Sea. Both films were put in the shade, however, by La La Land - which won all seven of the awards it was nominated for. La La Land's stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone flew to London after the Golden Globes ceremony and attended a screening of the film at the Ham Yard Hotel ahead of its release in UK cinemas this weekend. This man was one of many Presley impersonators who took the ""Elvis Train"" from Sydney's Central Station to the Australian town of Parkes for its annual celebration of the US singer and actor. Six years later than scheduled, the Elbphilharmonie concert hall in Hamburg finally opened its doors to the paying public. Conductor Thomas Hengelbrock waved the baton at its opening night concert. Dominic Cooper and Sophie Turner announced the nominations for this year's Baftas at an early-morning ceremony in London, with La La Land leading the field. Together with the Oscars and the Golden Globes, the Baftas are one of the key ceremonies of the film awards season and have categories dedicated to British films and talent.

" Monday 16th January 2017 This time last year, we publishedan articlewith a similar title to this one, and also featuring six episodes ofSoul Music- the long-runningRadio 4series that examines a song or piece of music that's had a powerful emotional impact on musicians and listeners alike. Perhaps because it was the week of so-called Blue Monday - theadmittedly suspectidea that the third Monday in January is the most depressing day of the year - the article captured your imaginations. It was widely shared from the social media accounts ofBBC Music,Radio 4,Radio 2and6 Music, with hundreds of you telling us which songs make you cry, and for what reasons. We read your comments and were moved by them, so here are six more episodes of Soul Music - all on pieces of music that you told us you find solace in at difficult times. [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: Bridge Over Troubled Water In your comments last year, two songs were mentioned more than any others -Johnny Cash's 2002 cover ofNine Inch Nails' Hurt, which has yet to be have an episode of Soul Music made about it, andSimon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water from 1970. What is it about the latter that affects us so profoundly? Paul Gambaccini places the song in its historical context - along with songs like The Beatles' Let It Be, it seemed to mark the end of the youthful idealism of the 1960s - and looks at how the song is about both vulnerability (""When you're weary, feeling small,"" it begins) and security (""I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough""). Bridge Over Troubled Water Simon & Garfunkel [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face gets the instant sound-off button,"" Radio 2 listener Jane told us, the suggestion being that she can't help but sob if she hears it. The 1957 folk song about first love, first borns and loss was written byEwan MacCollforPeggy Seeger, who later became his wife, and then became an international Grammy-winning hit forRoberta Flackin 1972. In the above episode, Peggy and Ewan's biographer Ben Harker explain its history before we hear two extraordinarily moving stories about what the song means to two people. [WATCH] Peggy sings the song in 1990, shortly after Ewan had died [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: Shipbuilding Another track that was repeatedly mentioned in your lists of songs that make you weep was 1982's Shipbuilding, written byElvis Costelloand Clive Langer forRobert Wyatt. ""Every time,"" said 6 Music listener Sian, and we perfectly understand why. The mix of tenderness, nostalgia and political ire is hugely effective. On hand in this episode to place the song in context of the early 1980s and, specifically, the Falklands War is MP Alan Johnson, who tells us it makes him cry, and Clive Langer. Philosopher Richard Ashcroft says it's a kind of secular hymn adding, ""If you don't like the song, it's going to be hard for me to be your friend, because I think it's so important and so moving."" Shipbuilding Robert Wyatt BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: (Something Inside) So Strong ""Always gets me,"" said Radio 4 listener Claire about the 1984Labi Siffreclassic (Something Inside) So Strong, a song that Labi reveals here was inspired by two things - watching a TV documentary on apartheid in South Africa and by the oppression he had experienced as a gay man. The episode begins with Pete Churchill, musical director of The Choir With No Name in Birmingham, made up of homeless singers, explaining how the song is about ""the strength of the human spirit, not being defeated, carrying on and having pride"". We also find out that Nelson Mandela was a fan of the song and that Labi sang it to help him ""reconstruct"" himself after the death of his partner of almost 50 years in 2013. (Something Inside) So Strong Labi Siffre [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: You'll Never Walk Alone TheRodgersandHammersteinsong You'll Never Walk Alone from 1945 musical Carousel ended the first-ever series of Soul Music in January 2001 and was a pick for a tear-jerker from many of you. In this fascinating discussion of the song, presented by composer Carl Davis, it's spoken of as being ""a humanist anthem with this message to walk on through the wind, to walk on through the storm"" and a kind of hymn that's ""almost as if it's always existed"". Famously, it became an anthem for fans of Liverpool FC afterGerry & The Pacemakershad a hit with the song in 1963. ""When I go to the match and they [the fans] sing Walk Alone,"" says Gerry Marsden, ""I still get goose pimples - it's a wonderful feeling."" You'll Never Walk Alone Gerry & The Pacemakers [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: Spiegel im Spiegel Finally, not a song but a piece of modern classical music - Estonia composerArvo Pärt's Spiegel im Spiegel from 1978 - which 6 Music listener Sam called ""a pure masterpiece of two emotions chasing each other"". It's a sparse, tranquil piece for piano and violin that conjures up deep emotions - a seemingly simple composition, but as violinistTasmin Littlesays here, it's very hard to perform because the playing has to be perfect, or the mood is lost. And it's a piece that appeals to people who wouldn't necessarily call themselves classical music fans. The episode begins with a mother explaining how her daughter had introduced her to Spiegel im Spiegel; a week later, the daughter was killed in the 1998 Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland and the piece profoundly moved her family and friends when played at the funeral.
