"The review will help to determine whether there is any risk to the criminal justice process More than 30 criminal investigations including 21 sex attacks are being reviewed after a forensic scientist apparently botched examinations. Scotland Yard said a member of staff from its Forensic Services allegedly failed to carry out tests and lied to investigators about progress. A total of 33 inquiries between 2012 and 2017 are affected - 21 rapes and sexual assaults and 12 violent and drug-related crimes and burglaries. An internal review is under way. All the work of the scientist, who was suspended on 26 March, has been audited and the Met said it is ""satisfied that there are no other instances of undeclared casework"". All victims in the affected cases have been contacted, where it has been deemed appropriate to do so, police said. A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: ""In the case of the investigations into rape and sexual assaults, victims have been contacted by a sexual offences investigative techniques officer."" The review comes amid a national crisis in forensic services following the closure of the publicly ownedForensic Science Service in 2012. Techniques including analysis of DNA, fingerprints and digital evidence play a major role in a range of criminal investigations and the move forced police forces to either bring the services in-house or use private providers. One firm, Key Forensic Services, collapsed in January, potentially affecting thousands of cases. Another, Randox Testing Services, was hit by claims of manipulation of results. Around 10,000 cases - three-quarters of which were drug-driving and the rest violent crime, sexual offences and unexplained deaths - were affected across 42 police forces.

"A report by Amnesty International found the Met Police's Gang Violence Matrix tracked a disproportionate number of minorities The data watchdog is investigating the Met Police's gangs database following accusations it is ""not fit for purpose"". A report by Amnesty International found the force's Gang Violence Matrix was ""racially discriminatory"" and breaches human rights law. The database, set up in the wake of the2011 London Riots,holds information on about 3,800 persons of interest. The Met Police said the matrix helped ""prevent young lives being lost"". The report found the matrix tracked a disproportionate number of minorities, as well as 1,500 people who police had assessed as posing no danger of committing violence. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) confirmed it was ""in contact with the Metropolitan Police Service as part of an investigation into their use of a gangs database"". The Met's Gang Violence Matrix was set up in 2012 in response to the London riots Figures from July 2016 showed 78% of the people listed were black. Police figures show 27% of those prosecuted for youth violence are black. About 13% of London's population is black. The matrix uses various intelligence including history of violent crime, entries on social media and information from bodies including local councils to identify gang members. They are then given a score assessing the risk they posed. Around 40% of those on the list have a ""harm score"" of zero, the report found. Those with a zero score may be in custody and therefore not currently offending. Being on the matrix could affect access to housing, education and job centre services, the report claimed. The Met Police said the matrix was used ""to reduce gang-related violence and prevent young lives being lost"" The charity's UK director, Kate Allen, said: ""There is clearly a huge problem with knife crime violence at the moment in London, but the gangs matrix is not the answer. ""The entire system is racially discriminatory, stigmatising young black men for the type of music they listen to or their social media behaviour, and perpetuating racial bias with potential impacts in all sorts of areas of their lives. Individuals identified on the matrix are offered support to divert them away from both offending and becoming a victim of violence, Scotland Yard said. The Met said it was working with Tottenham MP David Lammy, Amnesty International and the ICO to ""help understand the approach taken"". It is understood that officers in Manchester and Birmingham gather similar information on gang links. Have you been affected by any of the issues raised in this article?

"This video can not be played ""I have achieved everything I was told I wouldn't"" A young man who was bullied over his appearance is using his terrible experience to help others avoid it. Rory McGuire's birthmark saw him tormented and abused from an early age and despite surviving more than 20 operations, the abuse he has endured has been far more damaging and painful. The 24-year-old is now fronting a campaign to encourage victims of abuse over facial differences to report these hate crimes to police. He says any hate crime is unacceptable. At the age of six, Rory felt he was ""different"". The vascular birthmark which covered his lip earned abuse from an early age. Despite countless bouts of surgery to correct it, the abuse meant that at one point he hoped that he wouldn't wake up from the operating table. Some of the abuse Rory McGuire was subjected to as a child He had accepted that nothing would change. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams Programme: ""It was at its worst point in my late teens, I said to myself: 'This is it - this is how life is going to be and I just have to deal with it.' ""It was heartbreaking. I thought I would just have to deal with comments, stares and laughs for the rest of my life. ""My close friends didn't realise the extent of it. My mum and dad saw it affecting my confidence but there were a lot of things I didn't tell them. ""Anywhere I went in public I knew I was going to get stares or laughs or comments and I heard people turning to their friends and saying things and it was just constant."" It was only after countless corrective surgeries and from blogging his experience of relentless abuse that Rory gained enough confidence to stand up and try to prevent anyone else from feeling the same. Rory, from Ayr, supports theChanging Faces,externalcampaign for those with facial disfigurement to report abuse as a hate crime. Rory has had many corrective surgeries but is still subjected to bullying He said: ""I am happy to be the face of a campaign that is all about making a difference and stop other people having the experience I had when I was younger. ""If I can help as many people as I can then that is my goal. ""For me, none of it is acceptable and if someone is being put down to the point they just can't cope with it any more then they should feel there is help out there."" Rory tells heartbreaking stories of being frequently laughed at, mocked and stared at as a child and into his teens. He says people thought it was okay to call him awful names and compare him to film and TV characters. He recalls being cornered by a group of people who would compete to see who could call him the most offensive names. He suffered the double whammy of being left out when other children didn't want him to be a part of something and missing out because he was too shy to try to become involved with other children. Now he is encouraging everyone to stand up to hate crimes. ""It is absolutely unacceptable that people have to go through prejudice for reasons that are outwith their control. I want to promote the fact they can be reported and you can get help for them rather than bottling up these feelings which can be hard to deal with."" Rory after one of his surgeries A survey by Changing Faces of 800 people with a disfigurement found that a third had been a victim of a hate crime because of how they look, but hardly any of them reported it to police. The charity's Rob Murray said: ""We found out part of the reason was a lack of faith in the police, and resources. People see it as part of life."" Insp Claire Miller from Police Scotland said: ""Hate crime is any crime which is perceived by the victim or any other person to be motivated by malice and ill will towards a social group. ""It can be vandalism, anti-social behaviour or physical assault and none of those should be tolerated. ""We take hate crime very seriously. Victims or witnesses of hate crime should report it to us.""

"Some ethnic minority alcohol support services have seen an increase in inquiries following a BBC survey suggesting that, despite Sikhism forbidding drinking, 27% of UK Sikhs had a family member with a problem. They reported a rise in contacts from both alcoholics and volunteers. Nottingham's Bac-In has seen an almost sixfold increase in website hits. And UK Punjabi services the First Step Foundation and the Shanti Project have also seen an increase in interest. Sohan Sahota, of Bac-In said: ""Average website hits are around 2,000 a month. We've had over 11,500 hits since the article."" Jaz Rai, director of the First Step Foundation, which works with UK Punjabis across England, said it had doubled the size of its weekly support group and was planning a women-only meeting to address the increased demand. The Shanti Project, which works to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham, has also seen an increase. Tina, a British Punjabi mother-of-two, contacted the BBC after readingits coverage of the issue. The reports resonated very strongly with her own experiences, she said. Her husband - a heavy drinker - had been emotionally abusive towards her, Tina said, trying to convince her that she was going mad, and taking out loans in her name to finance his drinking after losing his job as a plumber. ""There's so much going on in Asian families that no-one addresses,"" she said. ""I just want our culture to open up. ""People need to wake up and realise that alcohol is poison,"" she said. ""I don't want my kids to go through what I went through. I don't want my daughter to think that it's normal."" Sharing stories about addiction can play a key role in the path to recovery, according to Alcoholics Anonymous. Recovering alcoholic Sanjay Bhandari told the BBC: ""The thing that resonated most with me was to hear other people's stories. ""What they experienced, what it was like, and how things got better gave me hope and inspiration, 'Well I can do that.'"" The BBC's coverage sparked a discussion on social media, involving Sikh MPs, support services, and people directly affected by the issue. Allow Twitter content?

Talking about the issue openly was a good first step towards challenging cultural norms and tackling the problem head on, said Jasvir Singh,on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day programme.

"Drinking lots of cranberry juice is no way to fix a urine infection, say new draft guidelines from health body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Althoughsome studies have claimed it may help, NICE says there is not enough good evidence to recommend it. Instead, people should drink plenty of water or fluids and take painkillers. They can also speak to their doctor who might prescribe antibiotics, but these drugs will not always be necessary. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria. Sometimes the body can fight a mild infection alone without medication. When antibiotics are needed, the shortest course that is likely to be effective should be prescribed to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance, says NICE. It might be more appropriate to get a back-up prescription to be used only if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours or if they worsen rapidly or significantly at any time. Signs and symptoms of a UTI include: pain, burning or stinging when you urinate needing to urinate more often or urgently than normal dark, cloudy or smelly urine pain in the lower abdomen feeling generally unwell, achy, sick and tired Prof Mark Baker, director for the centre of guidelines at NICE, said: ""We recognise that the majority of UTIs will require antibiotic treatment, but we need to be smarter with our use of these medicines. ""Our new guidance will help healthcare professionals to optimise their use of antibiotics. ""This will help to protect these vital medicines and ensure that no one experiences side effects from a treatment they do not need."" A consultation on the draft guidelines for England will close on 5 June.

"Hand car washes and nail bars have been identified as sectors at risk of labour exploitation Firms which exploit staff could face higher financial penalties and increased risk of prosecution under recommendations to the government. A report by a government-backed body has made 37 recommendations including that big companies should put more pressure on their suppliers. The report is by Labour Market Enforcement (LME), set up last year to oversee a crackdown on exploitation. It also recommends a pilot scheme to licence hand car washes and nail bars. Sir David Metcalf, head of LME, also called for action to enforce holiday pay, and said leading companies should be named and shamed if they fail to correct any non-compliance in their supply chains. He said: ""This strategy sets out how we can toughen up enforcement activity to protect vulnerable workers and ensure that good, compliant firms are not undercut by unscrupulous competitors. ""It's important the government has the necessary powers to crack down on bad bosses who exploit and steal from their workers - that includes bigger penalties to put employers off breaking the law."" The main recommendations include: Bigger financial penalties for employers and pursuit of more prosecutions Making it the law that employers provide a statement of rights for employees and a payslip for all workers Make leading brands jointly responsible for non-compliance in their supply chains More resources to the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate to enforce current regulations Piloting licencing of hand car washes and nail bars, which have been identified as sectors at risk of exploitation Tackle ""phoenixing"" - the practice of directors dissolving their companies to avoid paying workers tribunal awards The government will respond officially to the report later in the year. However, business minister Andrew Griffiths said: ""We will not accept illegal behaviour from bosses who exploit their workers and cheat the competition which is why we are already cracking down on irresponsible company directors and boosting protections for workers. ""We will enforce holiday pay and give new rights for every worker to get a payslip and a list of their rights when they start a job."" Unions also called on the government to crack down hard on exploitation. Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said: ""The government needs to put its money where its mouth is with enough resources to make its threats a reality for bad bosses. ""Ministers could also show they are serious about standing up for workers by calling time on the insecurity currently endured by around one million working people and ban the use of exploitative zero-hours contracts.""

"Argentina's president spoke on television in an address to the nation Argentina is to start talks about a financing deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday amid reports it is seeking $30bn (Â£22bn). Finance minister Nicolas Dujovne is due to fly to the IMF's Washington offices. After recent turmoil that saw interest rates hit 40%, President Mauricio Macri said IMF aid would ""strengthen growth"" and help avoid crises of the past. The talks come 17 years after Argentina defaulted on its debts and 12 years since it severed ties with IMF. Mr Macri said in an address to the nation on Tuesday: ""Just a few minutes ago I spoke with (IMF) director Christine Lagarde, and she confirmed we would start working on an agreement."" ""This will allow us to strengthen our program of growth and development, giving us greater support to face this new global scenario and avoid crises like the ones we have had in our history,"" he said. Local media and Bloomberg reported that Argentina was seeking $30bn, although the government declined to comment. The peso has lost a quarter of its value in the past year amid President Macri's pro-market reforms. Last week the central bankraised interest rates from 33.25% to 40%. Many people still blame IMF austerity requirements for policies that led to a financial and economic meltdown in 2001 to 2002 that left millions of middle class Argentines in poverty. Argentina eventually defaulted on its debts. And although its last IMF loan was paid down in 2006, the country severed ties with the Washington-based body. Mr Macri said Argentina was suffering as a result of high oil prices and the expectation that US interest rates would rise in the coming months. Describing Argentina as a ""valued member"" of the IMF, Ms Lagarde said: ""Discussions have been initiated on how we can work together to strengthen the Argentine economy and these will be pursued in short order."" Argentina is in the middle of a pro-market economic reform programme as Mr Macri seeks to reverse years of protectionism and high government spending under his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Inflation, a perennial problem in Argentina, was at 25% in 2017, behind Venezuela as the highest in Latin America. This year, the central bank has set an inflation target of 15% and has said it will continue to act to enforce it. Last week's rate rise to 40% was the third increase in eight days in an attempt to boost the peso. News of the new talks may be controversial in some quarters. Many people in Argentina still blame the IMF for the policies that led to the 2001 financial and economic crisis. The country defaulted on $80bn (Â£59bn) of sovereign debt - the biggest in history. Millions of middle class Argentines were plunged into poverty as a result. However, Mr Macri said the new negotiations with the IMF would give the country ""greater support to face this new global scenario and avoid crises like the ones we have had in our history"". Markets reacted positively to the news, with both local shares and the peso recovering some ground. Miguel Kiguel, a former Argentine finance official who runs local consultancy Econviews, tweeted: ""An IMF line of credit is the least expensive option for growth in Argentina."" Argentina has had a turbulent relationship with the IMF. In 2013 the country was censured by the Fund over the inflation and economic growth data published by the administration of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. It was a step in a process that could ultimately have led to Argentina's expulsion from the IMF. Earlier, many had blamed the IMF for contributing to a financial and economic crisis that came to a head around the end of 2001, which set back living standards severely. Relations have improved under the current president, Mauricio Macri, whose approach to economic policy was much more consistent with that favoured at the IMF. The prospect of a new IMF loan will test that improvement. It will come with economic policy conditions, including almost certainly spending cuts and tax rises, which are likely to aggravate political strains in Argentina.

"The new unit will take over the work of the Historical Enquiries Team Cabinet ministers have raised concerns over plans to introduce a new body that would investigate unsolved killings from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Introducing a new ""Historical Investigations Unit"" was a major part of the 2014 Stormont House agreement. It was agreed then to create a new independent body to deal with killings where there had been no prosecutions. But several ministers told colleagues on Tuesday that the proposal was unacceptable in its current form. In what has been described as a ""spat"", Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is understood to have raised concerns that military veterans might not have enough protections under the proposed system. Another minister who expressed worries said there had not been a huge argument, but that it had been made clear to the government that it had to do more to make sure that former military personnel weren't unfairly targeted, or dragged through the courts. No 'amnesty' in NIO legacy document New police unit to investigate past One cabinet source told the BBC: ""This has got catastrophe written all over it for the government and will carry very little sympathy with the majority of the British public who won't be able to get their heads round us not getting behind our veterans."" But others familiar with the process said that the new HIU would ""end the current witch hunt"" where veterans and former police officers are already hit disproportionately, providing a new system that is fair, independent and proportionate. Figures obtained by the BBC challenge the claim that investigations areunfairly focused on the security forces. The defence secretary is understood to have raised objections It is hoped the proposed unit would be able to investigate terrorist killings more vigorously than under the current piecemeal system. The plan was also included in the Tories' Northern Irish election manifesto. A source said: ""We want to find a way forward and we believe that the right way is to consult on this. Leaving the status quo as it exists is to let down our armed forces, as the current system it hits our armed forces disproportionately."" They suggested the idea of providing a statute of limitation for veterans would be legally impossible. A Number 10 source said it was hoped the consultation would be carried out ""expeditiously"" although they would not be drawn on a date. The Northern Ireland Office has circulated a draft consultation document on ""legacy"" matters to the main Stormont parties. It is understood the draft does not contain a controversial suggestion for a so-called statute of limitations. It would have prevented the prosecution of former soldiers for offences connected to the Troubles.

"Debbie Abrahams has been sacked from Labour's frontbench amid a probe into claims of workplace bullying. The shadow work and pensions secretary was suspended earlier this year pending the outcome of an internal inquiry. Labour said following a ""thorough investigation"", Ms Abrahams had been referred to the disputes panel of the ruling National Executive Committee. But the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth said the probe was ""neither thorough, fair, nor independent"". When the allegations surfaced in March, the 57-year old said they were ""spurious"" and she had not ruled out legal action against the party. In a statement on Tuesday, she said she ""strongly refutes"" the bullying claims and would continue to play an active role from the backbenches. On Tuesday, a Labour spokesman said Ms Abrahams had been ""relieved of her post as shadow work and pensions secretary"". ""After a thorough party investigation into allegations of workplace bullying, Debbie Abrahams has been referred to the NEC disputes committee,"" they added. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said he understood the announcement followed an HR investigation into allegations of bullying by an unspecified number of staff. The BBC understands the investigation upheld complaints and found that Ms Abrahams engaged in a pattern of bullying behaviour towards her staff employed by the Labour Party. Margaret Greenwood, who took over temporarily from Ms Abrahams in March, will continue in the role.

"The House of Lords has backed calls for the UK to effectively remain in the EU's single market after Brexit. An amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill obliging the UK to stay in the European Economic Area after it leaves the EU in 2019 was backed by 245 votes to 218. This was despite neither the government nor the Labour leadership backing it. Ministers warned that staying in the EEA would not give the UK ""control of our borders or our laws"" and the issue will now return to the Commons. Pro-EU MPs said they were hopeful of getting the Commons support needed to prevent the changes being overturned. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But to do so they will have to defeat the two largest parties if Labour maintains its opposition to the amendment in the Commons. Labour urged its peers to abstain in Tuesday's vote on EEA membership - an arrangement which would see the UK retain full access to the EU's internal market of 300 million consumers in return for making financial contributions and accepting most EU laws. Under what is known as the ""Norway model"" - Norway is one of three countries outside the EU which is an existing EEA member - free movement laws would also apply, so EU citizens can move to all EEA countries to work and live. Live: Lords votes on EU Withdrawal Bill MPs urge free trade area after Brexit Johnson: No 10's customs plans 'crazy' Supporters of the ""Norway-style"" plan think keeping the maximum-possible access to the single market should be the top priority - but critics say it would mean the UK would still be subject to EU laws after Brexit, but with no say in how they are made. Please upgrade your browser Before the EEA vote, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told Labour rebels that their idea to keep the UK in the single market would ""not work"" and a ""British bespoke deal"" was needed instead. But Labour's Lord Alli, who signed the amendment, said continued EEA membership was vital for protecting service sectors such as retail, tourism, transport, communications, financial services and aerospace. He accused the party leadership, which supports maintaining a customs union with the EU after Brexit and hopes to replicate the benefits of the single market, of ""complete cowardice"" by ordering peers to abstain. ""The customs union only will benefit our European neighbours in their imports,"" he said. ""Without an EEA equivalent it will damage our profitable export business and therefore the jobs and livelihoods of many thousands of people."" This video can not be played Can the House of Lords stop the Brexit Bill? More than 80 Labour peers defied the party whip by voting for the amendment, while among those Conservative rebels backing the amendment were former party chairman Lord Patten and former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine. But Brexit minister Lord Callanan said it would not satisfy the British public's desire, as expressed in the Brexit referendum, for more ""direct control"" over how the country is run. ""On borders it would mean that we would have to continue to accept all four freedoms of the single market, including freedom of movement,"" he said. ""On laws it would mean the UK having to implement new EU legislation over which in future we will have little influence and, of course, we will have no vote."" The government's Brexit bill also suffered a series of other defeats at the hands of peers. The Lords voted to remove the exact date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - from the wording of the EU Withdrawal Bill by 311 votes to 233. And an amendment which means the UK could continue to participate in EU agencies after Brexit was backed by 298 votes to 227. The government is expected to seek to reverse a number of the Lords amendments when the bill returns to the Commons.

Follow more updates on theBBC News website. Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent Some fear that Trump may have brought a new and catastrophic regional war in the Middle East that much closer. An imperfect deal that was working The deal was not perfect. It did not cover a range of worrying Iranian activities from its missile programme to its regional behaviour. At worst you could say that it simply delayed a potential crisis. The inconvenient truth for Donald Trump is that, as far as it goes, the nuclear deal was working. Dangerous path ahead A battle will now be under way in Tehran, and who wins out will determine if the agreement can be saved. Even those who agree with Mr Trump's actions are left with fundamental questions to answer. Where is the ""Plan B""? How is Iran now to be contained? Read the full story here Former Vice-President Joe Biden called Trump's decision ""a profound mistake"", saying it will only isolate the US while allowing Iran to gain ""international sympathy while doing nothing to reduce its harmful activities"". Biden cautioned that the ""unnecessary crisis"" could lead to war with Iran. ""Talk of a 'better deal' is an illusion. It took years of sanctions pressure, painstaking diplomacy, and the full support of the international community to achieve that goal. We have none of that in place today."" ""President Trumpâs decision will do the opposite of what he says he intends. It will free up Iranâs path to a nuclear weapon...and it puts us at odds with our closest European allies."" This video can not be played President Rouhani: 'Iran will wait and see how others react' President Hassan Rouhani has responded to the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement by saying the country is on standby to resume uranium enrichment, but that he will allow a few weeks for dialogue with the remaining parties first.

The American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby group, called for bipartisan support to ensure Iran will never ""acquire a nuclear weapons capability or realise its dangerous regional ambitions"". The lobby group described the original deal as ""critically flawed"", and said Trump's decision provides a new way to address the shortcomings of the deal after ""the international communityâs inability"" to do so. ""We must once again use the tools of American diplomacy and economic pressure to fix the dealâs shortcomings and counter Iranâs malign activities."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Shredding the Obama legacy Since his inauguration, Mr Trump has taken aim at practically every one of his predecessor's signature achievements. A pivot to Netanyahu Trump's shift to a more vehemently anti-deal view tracks closely with his full-throated support of Benjamin Netanyahu and the hardline Israeli side of Middle East peace negotiations, after earlier suggesting he could be an impartial ""deal-maker"" in the region. New faces in the room Where once the president may have been counselled to be cautious in abandoning US commitments to Iran, this time his instincts - an innate distrust of multilateralism in general and Iran in particular - appear to have been enthusiastically supported. After 15 months Mr Trump has built a foreign policy team that is largely on the same page - his page. Read the full story here.  Yevgeny Serebrennikov, first deputy head of the defence and security
committee in the Russian Upper House of Parliament,
told the RIA news agency that Trump's decision puts the Korean peace process in doubt. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to arrive in North Korea soon to help further pave the way for forthcoming talks with the isolated regime. Vladimir Chizhov, Russian envoy to the
European Union, separately told RIA that Russia will continue efforts to keep the Iran nuclear deal
functioning. Obama visited Tokyo in March, where he met the Japanese Prime Minister Former US President Barack Obama has just released a lengthy statement, calling Trump's decision ""a serious mistake"", and defending the agreement his administration helped negotiate. ""Without the JCPOA, the United
States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed
Iran or another war in the Middle East,"" warns Obama. He says the deal ""is working"", despite assessments by the current White House. Obama calls it a ""model for what diplomacy can accomplish - its inspections and
verification regime is precisely what the United States should be working to
put in place with North Korea"". ""Indeed, at a time when we
are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from
the JCPOA risks losing a deal that accomplishes - with Iran - the very outcome
that we are pursuing with the North Koreans."" Here's his full statement: Israeli forces in the Golan Heights are on high alert after the US withdrawal announcement Israeli forces in the Golan Heights remain on high alert after its military noted ""irregular activity of Iranian forces in Syria"". Local authorities have been instructed to ""unlock and ready [bomb] shelters,"" Reuters reports. The initial announcement came moments before Trump's speech. After Trump's address, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said: ""For months now, Iran has been transferring lethal weaponry to its forces in Syria, with the purpose of striking at Israel...

Paul DanaharBBC Washington bureau chief If they drank
champagne in Saudi Arabia they would have been clinking glasses in Riyadh over
President Trumpâs decision to pull out of the nuclear deal with Tehran. It
means Saudi's biggest regional rival gets a financial kicking and Saudi Arabia
gets to cash the cheque because the move is bound to spike oil prices. The
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu also has reasons to celebrate. He was widely
derided last week by EU diplomats for a presentation in which he claimed his agents
had stolen new evidence showing Iranian duplicity. It was old news on a new
wrapper but Trump not only bought it, he cited it as proof he was right to
leave the agreement. Ironically the only other players in the Middle East whoâll
be super happy with Trumpâs move are those in Iran who chant: ""Death to America."" The hardliners hated the deal and theyâll use its collapse to undermine the
more moderate forces in the country who'd championed it. Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office in March UK Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron emphasised their ""continuing commitment"" to the deal in a joint statement. ""We encourage Iran to show restraint in response to the decision by the US; Iran must continue to meet its own obligations under the deal, co-operating fully and in a timely manner."" EU High Representative/Vice President Federica Mogherini said in a statement as long as Iran remained committed, the EU would also continue ""full and effective implementation"" of the deal.

"Britain has ""no intention of walking away"" from the Iran nuclear deal despite the United States pulling out, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says. Mr Johnson told MPs the UK would ""strive to preserve the gains"" made by the international agreement. The 2015 deal curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of UN, US and EU sanctions. US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday he will pull out, describing it as ""defective at its core"". Labour accused the president of a ""reckless, senseless and immoral act of diplomatic sabotage"". But some Conservative MPs - including former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon - backed Mr Trump's stance. Other signatories to the agreement - the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - say they remain committed to it. Iran has said it will try to salvage the agreement, but would restart uranium enrichment if it could not. Simon Jack: Iran sanctions threaten North Sea deal Why did Trump ditch the deal? Iran nuclear deal: Key details Is there a Plan B? Mr Johnson - who had travelled to the United States in a last-minute attempt to persuade the Trump administration not to ditch the deal - told MPs the responsibility was now on the president to set out how he plans to secure a new settlement. ""Britain stands ready to support that task, but in the meantime we will strive to preserve the gains made by the [agreement]"", he added. The foreign secretary said while the UK shared US concerns about Iran, the ""painfully negotiated"" agreement was effective and had increased the amount of time it would take Tehran to develop nuclear weapons. A watchdog has reported nine times that Iran had complied with the terms of the agreement, he added. Mr Johnson also said the government would do its utmost to protect UK commercial interests in Iran from US sanctions. Iran sanctions threaten North Sea deal Sir Michael Fallon - who was UK defence secretary when the deal was signed - said the US president was right in his criticism of the ""rather flimsy agreement"" which he said ""should never have been called comprehensive"". ""Far from constraining Iranian behaviour, it has enabled the Iranian regime to use its new financial freedom to interfere in Syria, in Iraq, above all in Yemen and to sponsor Houthi attacks on our friends in Saudi Arabia,"" he said. Mr Johnson said he did ""not recall him making these points"" at the time and disagreed with his views. Another former minister, Robert Halfon, said the UK should support the US instead of ""appeasing"" Iran, and Andrew Percy condemned Iran's ""increasingly malign and dangerous influence"". After speaking to each other on Tuesday evening, Mrs May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron made clear they would not let the agreement - officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) - collapse. In a joint statement, they said they regretted President Trump's decision. ""Our governments remain committed to ensuring the agreement is upheld, and will work with all the remaining parties to the deal to ensure this remains the case including through ensuring the continuing economic benefits to the Iranian people that are linked to the agreement,"" they wrote. ""After engaging with the US Administration in a thorough manner over the past months, we call on the US to do everything possible to preserve the gains for nuclear non-proliferation brought about by the JCPoA, by allowing for a continued enforcement of its main elements."" The UK's Middle East Minister Alistair Burt said the UK would be seeking to ""de-escalate"" the situation, ""no matter how difficult that is in a tricky region"". In his address on Tuesday, President Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known - a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"". He said he would work to find a ""real, comprehensive, and lasting"" deal that tackled not only the Iranian nuclear programme but its ballistic missile tests and activities across the Middle East. This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out Mr Trump also said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. The US Treasury said the sanctions would target industries mentioned in the deal, including Iran's oil sector, aircraft manufacturers exporting to Iran and Iranian government attempts to buy US dollar banknotes. Major European and US companies are likely to be hit. Some exemptions are due to be negotiated but it is not yet clear what. US National Security Adviser John Bolton is reported as saying that European companies doing business in Iran will have to stop doing so within six months or face US sanctions. Has Iran's economy been better off under the deal? Analysis by the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal represents a failure of British and European diplomacy. They were unable to persuade the US president to change his mind. But it also marks the start of the next and perhaps harder task of trying to hold what is left of the agreement together. All three countries have promised to stay in the deal, known by its acronym the JCPoA. All three countries have promised to work with the remaining signatories to uphold the agreement. The key question will be how far the UK and other European countries are ready and able to go to protect their banks and firms from US sanctions if they do business with Iran. A failure of British and European diplomacy The shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Washington's decision risked plunging the Middle East into ""deeper destruction, chaos and conflict"". ""If the nuclear deal is torn up, we not only destroy that platform for future progress, we risk triggering a rapid nuclear arms race in the Middle East, we risk the hardline theocrats seizing all the reins of power in Tehran, and we risk the descent into an unimaginable conflict with Iran,"" she said. Ms Thornberry told the BBC she would have taken a ""different approach"" towards Mr Trump, describing the US president as a ""bully"" that she would ""stand up to"". ""Boris Johnson was complacent, and what he did was too little too late,"" she said, warning of the US ""trampling on our business"" with sanctions on UK firms that trade in Iran. The SNP's Stephen Gethins said President Trump's ""deeply reckless"" move had undermined the importance of the democratic process. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the government had ""discovered the limits of sycophancy"" in dealing with the US president, calling for safeguards for industry affected by US sanctions.

An imperfect deal that was working The deal was not perfect. It did not cover a range of worrying Iranian activities from its missile programme to its regional behaviour.

Biden cautioned that the ""unnecessary crisis"" could lead to war with Iran. ""Talk of a 'better deal' is an illusion. It took years of sanctions pressure, painstaking diplomacy, and the full support of the international community to achieve that goal. We have none of that in place today.""

The American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby group, called for bipartisan support to ensure Iran will never ""acquire a nuclear weapons capability or realise its dangerous regional ambitions"". The lobby group described the original deal as ""critically flawed"", and said Trump's decision provides a new way to address the shortcomings of the deal after ""the international communityâs inability"" to do so. ""We must once again use the tools of American diplomacy and economic pressure to fix the dealâs shortcomings and counter Iranâs malign activities."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Shredding the Obama legacy Since his inauguration, Mr Trump has taken aim at practically every one of his predecessor's signature achievements. A pivot to Netanyahu Trump's shift to a more vehemently anti-deal view tracks closely with his full-throated support of Benjamin Netanyahu and the hardline Israeli side of Middle East peace negotiations, after earlier suggesting he could be an impartial ""deal-maker"" in the region. New faces in the room Where once the president may have been counselled to be cautious in abandoning US commitments to Iran, this time his instincts - an innate distrust of multilateralism in general and Iran in particular - appear to have been enthusiastically supported. After 15 months Mr Trump has built a foreign policy team that is largely on the same page - his page. Read the full story here.  Yevgeny Serebrennikov, first deputy head of the defence and security
committee in the Russian Upper House of Parliament,
told the RIA news agency that Trump's decision puts the Korean peace process in doubt. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to arrive in North Korea soon to help further pave the way for forthcoming talks with the isolated regime. Vladimir Chizhov, Russian envoy to the
European Union, separately told RIA that Russia will continue efforts to keep the Iran nuclear deal
functioning. Obama visited Tokyo in March, where he met the Japanese Prime Minister Former US President Barack Obama has just released a lengthy statement, calling Trump's decision ""a serious mistake"", and defending the agreement his administration helped negotiate. ""Without the JCPOA, the United
States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed
Iran or another war in the Middle East,"" warns Obama. He says the deal ""is working"", despite assessments by the current White House. Obama calls it a ""model for what diplomacy can accomplish - its inspections and
verification regime is precisely what the United States should be working to
put in place with North Korea"". ""Indeed, at a time when we
are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from
the JCPOA risks losing a deal that accomplishes - with Iran - the very outcome
that we are pursuing with the North Koreans."" Here's his full statement: Israeli forces in the Golan Heights are on high alert after the US withdrawal announcement Israeli forces in the Golan Heights remain on high alert after its military noted ""irregular activity of Iranian forces in Syria"". Local authorities have been instructed to ""unlock and ready [bomb] shelters,"" Reuters reports. The initial announcement came moments before Trump's speech. After Trump's address, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said: ""For months now, Iran has been transferring lethal weaponry to its forces in Syria, with the purpose of striking at Israel...

Paul DanaharBBC Washington bureau chief If they drank
champagne in Saudi Arabia they would have been clinking glasses in Riyadh over
President Trumpâs decision to pull out of the nuclear deal with Tehran. It
means Saudi's biggest regional rival gets a financial kicking and Saudi Arabia
gets to cash the cheque because the move is bound to spike oil prices. The
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu also has reasons to celebrate. He was widely
derided last week by EU diplomats for a presentation in which he claimed his agents
had stolen new evidence showing Iranian duplicity. It was old news on a new
wrapper but Trump not only bought it, he cited it as proof he was right to
leave the agreement. Ironically the only other players in the Middle East whoâll
be super happy with Trumpâs move are those in Iran who chant: ""Death to America."" The hardliners hated the deal and theyâll use its collapse to undermine the
more moderate forces in the country who'd championed it. Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office in March UK Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron emphasised their ""continuing commitment"" to the deal in a joint statement. ""We encourage Iran to show restraint in response to the decision by the US; Iran must continue to meet its own obligations under the deal, co-operating fully and in a timely manner."" EU High Representative/Vice President Federica Mogherini said in a statement as long as Iran remained committed, the EU would also continue ""full and effective implementation"" of the deal. To Iran's citizens, Mogherini said: ""Do not let anyone dismantle this agreement. It is one of the biggest achievements diplomacy has ever delivered.""

"Debbie Abrahams has been sacked from Labour's frontbench amid a probe into claims of workplace bullying. The shadow work and pensions secretary was suspended earlier this year pending the outcome of an internal inquiry. Labour said following a ""thorough investigation"", Ms Abrahams had been referred to the disputes panel of the ruling National Executive Committee. But the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth said the probe was ""neither thorough, fair, nor independent"". When the allegations surfaced in March, the 57-year old said they were ""spurious"" and she had not ruled out legal action against the party. In a statement on Tuesday, she said she ""strongly refutes"" the bullying claims and would continue to play an active role from the backbenches. On Tuesday, a Labour spokesman said Ms Abrahams had been ""relieved of her post as shadow work and pensions secretary"". ""After a thorough party investigation into allegations of workplace bullying, Debbie Abrahams has been referred to the NEC disputes committee,"" they added. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said he understood the announcement followed an HR investigation into allegations of bullying by an unspecified number of staff. The BBC understands the investigation upheld complaints and found that Ms Abrahams engaged in a pattern of bullying behaviour towards her staff employed by the Labour Party. Margaret Greenwood, who took over temporarily from Ms Abrahams in March, will continue in the role.

"Prosecutors said Moseley, 50, fired the shotgun but handed it to his son saying: ""Tell them you've done it."" A father who pressured his 14-year-old son into taking the blame for a murder he had committed has been jailed. Matthew Moseley, 50, shot Lee Holt in the chest when he tried to get into his home last October. After he fired the shotgun, Moseley handed it to his son, saying: ""Tell them you've done it."" Moseley, who had denied murder, was given a life sentence at Preston Crown Court and ordered to serve at least 26 years in jail. Jurors heard Mr Holt had gone to confront Moseley at his home in Oswaldtwistle, near Accrington, amid a long-running dispute between the men's children. Moseley opened his front door and fired a Beretta semi-automatic shotgun at Mr Holt, the jury was told. His son made a fake confession and Moseley stayed silent as the teenager was arrested and led away in handcuffs. Despite the boy changing his account, Moseley maintained his innocence and said he had knocked the gun from his son's hands. In a covert recording of a prison van conversation, Moseley said to his son: ""You are a minor. You can't go to any jail. ""Self-defence for you and you didn't know what you were doing. Me, different ball game. And that is the way we have got to go with this."" Passing sentence, Mr Justice Simon Bryan told Moseley there was ""no possible justification"" for his actions, nor any suggestion he acted in self-defence. Lee Holt had gone to confront Moseley about an argument between the men's sons ""How any father could do that to their son is difficult enough to comprehend but what is truly incomprehensible is the cynical way in which you sought to manipulate, and pressurise, your son into accepting responsibility for the shooting and death of Lee Holt. ""You allowed your son to be arrested and questioned on suspicion of murder when all along you knew you had shot [him]. ""Your continual denial of guilt resulted in him having to give evidence against his own father and members of Lee Holt's family having to relive the terrible events of the night in question."" Richard Littler, defending, said his client was a hard-working family man who reacted in a ""bizarre fashion"" in the heat of the moment when there was ""kicking, banging and threats"" made at his front door. Moseley used a Beretta semi-automatic shotgun to kill Lee Holt Det Ch Insp Jill Johnston from Lancashire Police said Moseley's sentence was ""nothing less than he deserves"". There were ""no winners"" in the case, she said, as the Holt family ""lost a dearly loved father, son, partner, brother and uncle"", while Moseley's son must ""try and build a life for himself knowing his dad is in prison after trying to blame him"".

"This video can not be played UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres tells US not to withdraw from nuclear deal with Iran UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged Donald Trump not to walk away from an international deal designed to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Guterres said there was a real risk of war if the 2015 agreement was not preserved. Mr Trump has been a strong critic of the accord, in which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. The US president has until 12 May to decide whether to stick with the deal. Mr Guterres told the BBC that the Iran agreement was an ""important diplomatic victory"" and should be maintained. ""We should not scrap it unless we have a good alternative,"" he said, adding: ""We face dangerous times."" Could the Iran nuclear deal collapse? It comes just days after Israel revealed ""secret nuclear files"" accusing Iran of having covertly pursued nuclear weapons. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the files provided proof that the Obama-era nuclear deal was ""built on lies"". European allies France, the UK and Germany meanwhile have agreed that pursuing the current nuclear deal with Iran is the best way to stop it developing nuclear weapons. In 2015 Tehran signed a deal with the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain agreeing to limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions. Under the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is committed to slashing the number of its centrifuges, which are machines used to enrich uranium. It is also meant to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium drastically and not enrich remaining uranium to the level needed to produce nuclear weapons. Iran nuclear agreement: Key details The number of centrifuges installed at Iran's Natanz and Fordo sites was cut drastically soon after the deal while tonnes of low-enriched uranium were shipped to Russia. Furthermore, monitors from the IAEA have been able to carry out snap inspections at Iranian nuclear sites. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed what he said were pages of material that proved Iran had covertly pursued nuclear weapons. Speaking in English from Israel's defence ministry in Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu showed off what he said were ""exact copies"" of documents obtained by Israeli intelligence from a secret storage facility in Tehran. This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive There were, he said, 55,000 pages of evidence and a further 55,000 files on 183 CDs relating to a secret nuclear weapons programme, dubbed Project Amad. The project, he said, had had the explicit goal of producing five warheads, each with the yield of 10 kilotonnes of TNT. He said Tehran had continued to pursue what he described as nuclear weapons knowledge after the project was shuttered in 2003. He said this was evidence that Iran had lied about its nuclear ambitions before the deal was signed in 2015. Tension between the long-standing enemies has grown steadily since Iran built up its military presence in Syria, which lies to the north-east of Israel. Mr Trump has frequently voiced his opposition to the ""insane"" deal, which he has described as the ""worst ever"". He has warned that the US would withdraw completely on 12 May - the next deadline for waiving sanctions - unless European signatories to the deal and Congress addressed his concerns. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal He is unhappy that the deal only limited Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period and had failed to stop the development of ballistic missiles. He also said it had handed Iran a $100bn (Â£72bn) windfall that it used ""as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression"" across the Middle East. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has questioned the legitimacy of efforts by the US and France to change the nuclear deal with his country. Mr Rouhani has said that Mr Trump has no ""right"" to renegotiate the seven-party agreement. How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians He has said Iran ""will not accept any restrictions beyond its commitments"" to comply with international rules in the years ahead. Mr Rouhani has also accused Mr Trump of ""maliciously violating"" the nuclear agreement. Iran maintains that the missiles it has tested are not designed to carry nuclear warheads and insists its nuclear programme is a peaceful one for energy purposes.

Read the full story here Former Vice-President Joe Biden called Trump's decision ""a profound mistake"", saying it will only isolate the US while allowing Iran to gain ""international sympathy while doing nothing to reduce its harmful activities"". Biden cautioned that the ""unnecessary crisis"" could lead to war with Iran. ""Talk of a 'better deal' is an illusion. It took years of sanctions pressure, painstaking diplomacy, and the full support of the international community to achieve that goal. We have none of that in place today."" ""President Trumpâs decision will do the opposite of what he says he intends. It will free up Iranâs path to a nuclear weapon...and it puts us at odds with our closest European allies."" This video can not be played President Rouhani: 'Iran will wait and see how others react' President Hassan Rouhani has responded to the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement by saying the country is on standby to resume uranium enrichment, but that he will allow a few weeks for dialogue with the remaining parties first.

The American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby group, called for bipartisan support to ensure Iran will never ""acquire a nuclear weapons capability or realise its dangerous regional ambitions"". The lobby group described the original deal as ""critically flawed"", and said Trump's decision provides a new way to address the shortcomings of the deal after ""the international communityâs inability"" to do so. ""We must once again use the tools of American diplomacy and economic pressure to fix the dealâs shortcomings and counter Iranâs malign activities."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Shredding the Obama legacy Since his inauguration, Mr Trump has taken aim at practically every one of his predecessor's signature achievements. A pivot to Netanyahu Trump's shift to a more vehemently anti-deal view tracks closely with his full-throated support of Benjamin Netanyahu and the hardline Israeli side of Middle East peace negotiations, after earlier suggesting he could be an impartial ""deal-maker"" in the region. New faces in the room Where once the president may have been counselled to be cautious in abandoning US commitments to Iran, this time his instincts - an innate distrust of multilateralism in general and Iran in particular - appear to have been enthusiastically supported. After 15 months Mr Trump has built a foreign policy team that is largely on the same page - his page. Read the full story here.  Yevgeny Serebrennikov, first deputy head of the defence and security
committee in the Russian Upper House of Parliament,
told the RIA news agency that Trump's decision puts the Korean peace process in doubt. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to arrive in North Korea soon to help further pave the way for forthcoming talks with the isolated regime. Vladimir Chizhov, Russian envoy to the
European Union, separately told RIA that Russia will continue efforts to keep the Iran nuclear deal
functioning. Obama visited Tokyo in March, where he met the Japanese Prime Minister Former US President Barack Obama has just released a lengthy statement, calling Trump's decision ""a serious mistake"", and defending the agreement his administration helped negotiate. ""Without the JCPOA, the United
States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed
Iran or another war in the Middle East,"" warns Obama. He says the deal ""is working"", despite assessments by the current White House. Obama calls it a ""model for what diplomacy can accomplish - its inspections and
verification regime is precisely what the United States should be working to
put in place with North Korea"". ""Indeed, at a time when we
are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from
the JCPOA risks losing a deal that accomplishes - with Iran - the very outcome
that we are pursuing with the North Koreans."" Here's his full statement: Israeli forces in the Golan Heights are on high alert after the US withdrawal announcement Israeli forces in the Golan Heights remain on high alert after its military noted ""irregular activity of Iranian forces in Syria"". Local authorities have been instructed to ""unlock and ready [bomb] shelters,"" Reuters reports. The initial announcement came moments before Trump's speech. After Trump's address, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said: ""For months now, Iran has been transferring lethal weaponry to its forces in Syria, with the purpose of striking at Israel... We will respond mightily to any attack on our territory."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Paul DanaharBBC Washington bureau chief If they drank
champagne in Saudi Arabia they would have been clinking glasses in Riyadh over
President Trumpâs decision to pull out of the nuclear deal with Tehran. It
means Saudi's biggest regional rival gets a financial kicking and Saudi Arabia
gets to cash the cheque because the move is bound to spike oil prices. The
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu also has reasons to celebrate. He was widely
derided last week by EU diplomats for a presentation in which he claimed his agents
had stolen new evidence showing Iranian duplicity. It was old news on a new
wrapper but Trump not only bought it, he cited it as proof he was right to
leave the agreement. Ironically the only other players in the Middle East whoâll
be super happy with Trumpâs move are those in Iran who chant: ""Death to America."" The hardliners hated the deal and theyâll use its collapse to undermine the
more moderate forces in the country who'd championed it. Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office in March UK Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron emphasised their ""continuing commitment"" to the deal in a joint statement. ""We encourage Iran to show restraint in response to the decision by the US; Iran must continue to meet its own obligations under the deal, co-operating fully and in a timely manner."" EU High Representative/Vice President Federica Mogherini said in a statement as long as Iran remained committed, the EU would also continue ""full and effective implementation"" of the deal. To Iran's citizens, Mogherini said: ""Do not let anyone dismantle this agreement. It is one of the biggest achievements diplomacy has ever delivered.""

"Boris Johnson has described one of No 10's proposals for a post-Brexit customs arrangement as ""crazy"". A ""customs partnership"", thought to be favoured by the PM, would involve the UK collecting import tariffs on behalf of the EU, Mr Johnson said. In a Daily Mail interview,external, the foreign secretary said it would limit the UK's ability to do post-Brexit trade deals. No 10 said the idea was still on the table after ministers failed to agree a customs plan last week. It also disputed the suggestion the UK would be collecting tariffs ""on behalf of the EU"" - saying that the money collected would stay in the UK although there would be an annual assessment of what the UK needed to pay the EU for tariffs collected on goods which had later moved on to the EU. The newspaper quotes the foreign secretary as saying a customs partnership would create ""a whole new web of bureaucracy"". ""If you have a new customs partnership, you have a crazy system whereby you end up collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU at the UK frontier,"" he said. Reality Check: The government's customs options UK-EU customs partnership 'still on table' Why is the customs union so important? May requests 'revised' customs proposals ""If the EU decides to impose punitive tariffs on something the UK wants to bring in cheaply there's nothing you can do. ""That's not taking back control of your trade policy, it's not taking back control of your laws, it's not taking back control of your borders and it's actually not taking back control of your money either, because tariffs would get paid centrally back to Brussels."" This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? His comments were made during a trip to the US and he said a trade deal with America could not be achieved if the UK remained ""in the lunar pull of Brussels"". He added that Americans wanted to see ""a confident free-trading Britain able to do its own deals"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg In normal times - when did we last have them? - if a cabinet minister publicly criticised the government of the day's policy in such colourful terms, they would be out - either by their own volition, or a P45 swiftly despatched from Downing Street. This is a policy that Boris Johnson discussed, along with his colleagues, at that Chequers away day in February, and then by (literally) giving the thumbs up to the prime minister's Mansion House speech in March that included the customs partnership as a potential proposal. What his supporters say is that the policy was not agreed then and not discussed in proper detail - so by staking his claim that the idea is ""crazy"", he is not bound by collective responsibility. This is an idea floating around rather than pinned-down government policy, they say. The word is appallingly overused in politics but, let's put it in capitals, it is UNPRECEDENTED for a senior member of the government to pour such scorn on their government's own plan, one, they themselves signed up to not so long ago - not withstanding his team's belief that he is perfectly entitled to criticise a plan before there has been an official government decision to back it. Read more from Laura At the weekend Mr Johnson's cabinet colleague Business Secretary Greg Clark said anything other than a close customs arrangement would risk thousands of jobs. The government's preferred option of a customs partnership has already faced heavy criticism from other Brexiteers  - Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has described it as ""completely cretinous"". On Twitter, Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson had ""hit the nail on the head"" with his Daily Mail interview. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said adopting the model, which has not been tried before, would ""go against everything I know about government"" and jeopardise the UK's ability to strike trade deals with other countries. The idea was also criticised from the other side of the Brexit debate. Labour MP Rupa Huq - part of the campaign for another vote on the UK's EU membership - said it would create a ""bureaucratic nightmare"", adding that the best way to preserve jobs was to stay in the customs union and single market. A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. No 10 says an annual payment would be made to balance the value of the tariffs collected by the UK for goods which ended up in the EU and the value of the goods which came via the EU but ended up in the UK Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""Yet again this Tory government is demonstrating to the Europeans who are negotiating with them that they are internally divided."" Former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve said Mr Johnson's decision to speak out was ""regrettable"", telling BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I don't think he is in any way inhibited by normal propriety in government."" Mrs May's official spokesman said that the issue was not discussed at Tuesday's regular cabinet meeting in 10 Downing Street, which Mr Johnson attended after returning from a visit to the US. The spokesman said Mrs May had confidence in the foreign secretary, adding, in relation to the two customs options: ""Following last week's sub-committee meeting, it was agreed that there are unresolved issues in relation to both models and that further work is needed.

"This video can not be played Watch: Google's voice assistant in action Google has unveiled artificial intelligence software that books appointments over the phone on behalf of users by conducting voice-based conversations on their behalf. Chief executive Sundar Pichai said that Google Duplex would launch as an ""experiment"" over the coming weeks. The facility was unveiled at the firm's annual IO developers conference. Experts have said that if it works it could give the firm a major advantage over rival virtual assistants. Google chief Sundar Pichai opened the developers conference in Mountain View, California Pre-recorded demonstrations played back to the audience featured the software first booking a haircut and then making a restaurant reservation by speaking to two human employees. One of the cases involved Google Assistant coping with a worker who seemed confused by straightforward questions. The computer-generated voice sounded much more natural than the virtual helper had done in the past and included ""ums"" and other sounds typically produced in human speech. At no point did it identify itself as a machine. ""Done correctly, it will save time for people and generate a lot of value for businesses,"" suggested Mr Pichai. Would you hang up on Google's AI? Google Assistant calls to make bookings Amazon Alexa to reward kids who say: 'Please' He added that initially, the software would be used to call businesses to confirm their holiday opening times, and would then automatically update the information on the pages Google provides about them. The Google Assistant's voice-booking facility will only have a limited set of feature when it first launches ""Hard to believe this was real,"" commented Ben Bajaran, an analyst at the consultancy Creative Strategies after the demo. ""You cannot underestimate the value consumers will see in these voice assistants. ""Apple cannot fall too far behind because this is the kind of thing I can see people switching platforms for."" Other experts, however, remarked that people would have to be convinced to trust the software if it is to be widely adopted. Google also announced a new version of its News tool. A Full Coverage feature will let users delve deeper into stories of their choice, providing headlines from different ""trusted"" sources, Q&As, social media posts and relevant timelines among other information. Unlike many of firm's services, the content will not be personalised. ""Having a productive conversation or debate requires everyone to have access to the same information,""Google said in blog that provides more detail,external. Allow Twitter content?

The Google IO event comes a week after Facebook held its own developers conference under the shadow of a data privacy scandal, which has prompted wider questions about the amount of personal information being gathered and processed by the tech industry. Mr Pichai did not refer to the controversy directly, but briefly addressed consumers' concerns. ""There are very real and important questions being raised about the impact of these advances and the role they will play in our lives,"" he said towards the beginning of his presentation. ""So, we know the path ahead needs to be navigated carefully and deliberately, and we feel a deep sense of responsibility to get this right."" The firm dedicated a section of its opening presentation to what it referred to as Digital Wellbeing technologies. These included the ability to schedule screen breaks on YouTube to encourage young users to avoid spending too long on the app at a time. Parents also gain the ability to schedule when internet connectivity should be paused to some or all of the devices being used in a home. Android will soon allow users to see how much time they are spending within different apps And Android is to gain a new app dashboard that provides details about how much time users have spent using different services over the course of a day. ""We are delighted that Google has heard the call from stressed-out parents to create ways to limit and control their kids tech use and to find a better balance in their own digital lives,"" Stephen Balkam, chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute, told the BBC. We've reached a tipping point in our use of computers, a time when the number of apps trying to get our attention with notifications and updates is making us many of us feel overwhelmed. That wasn't a mistake - many apps were aggressively designed to attract and lock in our attention. But maybe not for much longer. Much of Google's focus at IO this year is about what it dubbed Jomo - the ""joy of missing out"". This is to be welcomed. Any move to reduce screen-time - particularly of youngsters - seems a good idea. But you have to question whether the same companies that got us into this mess can save us from it. Google's business is still about attention - and the company knows full well that the addictive nature of  YouTube won't be affected by a prompt saying ""take a break"". That said, therapists often say that acknowledgment is the first stage of recovery, and Google's moves in the area could be appreciated by many. Other announcements included: Gmail will be able to automatically complete sentences by adding several words at a time based on information collected about the user Google Photos will propose Suggested Actions, including sending copies of an image to people it recognises in a shot, colourising black-and-white pictures, and converting photos of documents into PDFs Google Assistant gains six new voices, can be made to encourage children to use the word ""please"", and can handle follow-up requests without the need to say ""hey Google"" each time Google's smart speakers can now support more natural conversations Android continues to dominate the handset market. Google's operating system powered 85.9% of all smartphones sold last year, according to research firm Gartner, marking a 1.1% gain on 2016. Furthermore, it accounted for four out of every five mobile app downloads, according to analytics firm App Annie. Google's own Play Store drove two out of every five smartphone and tablet app installations. Apple will host its own developers conference on 4 June.

"President Donald Trump has ended the United States's participation in a landmark nuclear deal with Iran and begun reimposing sanctions. The 2015 accord - his predecessor Barack Obama's signature foreign policy achievement - saw Iran limit its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),externalwas agreed by Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany (the P5+1). Iran limited its sensitive nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief It sets limits to Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel, but also nuclear weapons - until 2031 and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium until 2026. Iran also agreed to modify a heavy-water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. The deal was endorsed bySecurity Council resolution 2231,externaland its implementation began on January 2016, after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) certified that Iran had fulfilled its key commitments. Iran nuclear deal: Key details In a televised address in May,the president denounced the JCPOA as a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"".,external Rather than protecting the US and its allies, it had placed ""very weak limits on the regime's nuclear activity and no limits at all on its other malign behaviour, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen and other places all around the world"", he said. This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out Mr Trump also said intelligence documents published by Israel in April had proven that ""at the heart of the Iran deal is a fiction that Iran only desired a peaceful nuclear energy programme"". Iranian officials have consistently insisted their intentions are peaceful. The president added that the accord's so-called ""sunset clauses"" - under which key limits on Iran's nuclear programme will start to expire - were ""totally unacceptable""; that it did not deal with Iran's development of ballistic missiles; and that its mechanism for inspections and verification was not strong enough. Three reasons behind Trump ditching Iran deal The president vowed to ""find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution"" that would ""include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iran's ballistic missile programme, to stop its terrorist activities worldwide, and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East"". ""Iran's leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal, they refuse and that's fine,"" he said. ""But the fact is, they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people."" This video can not be played US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? In August, he signed an executive order that reimposed sanctions,externaltargeting the Iranian government's purchase of US dollars, Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals, and its automotive sector. In November, a second batch of potentially more damaging sanctions will be reinstated on Iran's port operators, and the energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors. Also affected are Iran's petroleum-related transactions, and transactions by foreign financial institutions with the Central Bank of Iran.

He demanded that Iran: Declare to the IAEA a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear programme, and permanently and verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity. Stop uranium enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing Provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites End its proliferation of ballistic missiles and stop launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems Release all US citizens detained on spurious charges. End its support to Middle Eastern terrorist groups Respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi government and permit the disarming and demobilization of Iraqi Shia militias End its military support for the Yemen's rebel Houthi movement Withdraw all forces under Iranian command from Syria End support for the Taleban and other militant groups in Afghanistan, and cease harbouring senior al-Qaeda leaders End the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force's support for terrorists outside Iran End its threatening behaviour against neighbouring countries, including Israel In July, Mr Trump told a news conference that he would ""certainly meet"" his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, to discuss a new deal. He also said there would be ""no preconditions"", but the White House later insisted that the Iranian government would first have to ""change its behaviour in the ways we've identified"". Mr Rouhani insisted there could be no talks as long as the US was reneging on its commitments under the JCPOA. This video can not be played President Rouhani on US decision: 'Iran will wait and see how others react' President Rouhani declared in May that the US had ""officially undermined its commitment to an international treaty"". But he stressed that the deal could survive if other parties continued to honour their commitments,external. If that was not possible, he warned, Iran would step up uranium enrichment and restart other curbed nuclear activities. When the US reinstated the first batch of economic sanctions, Mr Rouhani accused the Trump administration of pursuing ""psychological warfare"" intended to ""sow division among Iranians"". The US will reimpose sanctions on Iran's central bank, intended to target its oil exports The foreign ministers of Germany, the UK and France meanwhile released ajoint statement along with the European Union's foreign policy chief saying the nuclear deal was working,externaland remained ""crucial for the security of Europe, the [Middle East], and the entire world"". They also unveiled a ""blocking statute"",externalintended to mitigate the impact of the US sanctions on European firms doing legitimate business with Iran. However, a senior US official said it was ""not particularly concerned"" by the move. The EU previously insisted that it is ""not in the hands of any single country"" to terminate a deal that has been endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution. IAEA inspectors have certified that Iran is fulfilling its nuclear-related commitments The IAEA has said it has the ""world's most robust verification regime in place in Iran"",external, and itsinspectors have certified 10 times since 2016 that Iran is fulfilling its nuclear-related commitments,externalunder the JCPOA. However, the watchdog has recorded several technical violations. For instance,Iran has twice exceeded its heavy-water production cap,external. In both cases, Iran shipped the excess out of the country. The IAEA has also said its inspectors were granted access to all locations they needed to visit in 2017. However, they did not seek to enter any military sites, which Iranian officials declared off-limits -a move the US said raised doubts over Iranian compliance,external. The US and European powers also say Iran has carried out ballistic missile tests in violation of resolution 2231. It ""calls upon"" Iran not to ""undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons"". Iran denies that it has tested such missiles. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Iran of violating the JCPOA by failing to declare to the IAEA that it had sought to build a nuclear weapon. This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive In April, he presented Iranian files obtained by Israeli intelligence, which he said proved Iran had lied when denying the existence of a secret nuclear weapons programme before 2003,external. Israel itself is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal, though it has neither confirmed nor denied this.

"Boris Johnson has described one of No 10's proposals for a post-Brexit customs arrangement as ""crazy"". A ""customs partnership"", thought to be favoured by the PM, would involve the UK collecting import tariffs on behalf of the EU, Mr Johnson said. In a Daily Mail interview,external, the foreign secretary said it would limit the UK's ability to do post-Brexit trade deals. No 10 said the idea was still on the table after ministers failed to agree a customs plan last week. It also disputed the suggestion the UK would be collecting tariffs ""on behalf of the EU"" - saying that the money collected would stay in the UK although there would be an annual assessment of what the UK needed to pay the EU for tariffs collected on goods which had later moved on to the EU. The newspaper quotes the foreign secretary as saying a customs partnership would create ""a whole new web of bureaucracy"". ""If you have a new customs partnership, you have a crazy system whereby you end up collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU at the UK frontier,"" he said. Reality Check: The government's customs options UK-EU customs partnership 'still on table' Why is the customs union so important? May requests 'revised' customs proposals ""If the EU decides to impose punitive tariffs on something the UK wants to bring in cheaply there's nothing you can do. ""That's not taking back control of your trade policy, it's not taking back control of your laws, it's not taking back control of your borders and it's actually not taking back control of your money either, because tariffs would get paid centrally back to Brussels."" This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? His comments were made during a trip to the US and he said a trade deal with America could not be achieved if the UK remained ""in the lunar pull of Brussels"". He added that Americans wanted to see ""a confident free-trading Britain able to do its own deals"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg In normal times - when did we last have them? - if a cabinet minister publicly criticised the government of the day's policy in such colourful terms, they would be out - either by their own volition, or a P45 swiftly despatched from Downing Street. This is a policy that Boris Johnson discussed, along with his colleagues, at that Chequers away day in February, and then by (literally) giving the thumbs up to the prime minister's Mansion House speech in March that included the customs partnership as a potential proposal. What his supporters say is that the policy was not agreed then and not discussed in proper detail - so by staking his claim that the idea is ""crazy"", he is not bound by collective responsibility. This is an idea floating around rather than pinned-down government policy, they say. The word is appallingly overused in politics but, let's put it in capitals, it is UNPRECEDENTED for a senior member of the government to pour such scorn on their government's own plan, one, they themselves signed up to not so long ago - not withstanding his team's belief that he is perfectly entitled to criticise a plan before there has been an official government decision to back it. Read more from Laura At the weekend Mr Johnson's cabinet colleague Business Secretary Greg Clark said anything other than a close customs arrangement would risk thousands of jobs. The government's preferred option of a customs partnership has already faced heavy criticism from other Brexiteers  - Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has described it as ""completely cretinous"". On Twitter, Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson had ""hit the nail on the head"" with his Daily Mail interview. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said adopting the model, which has not been tried before, would ""go against everything I know about government"" and jeopardise the UK's ability to strike trade deals with other countries. The idea was also criticised from the other side of the Brexit debate. Labour MP Rupa Huq - part of the campaign for another vote on the UK's EU membership - said it would create a ""bureaucratic nightmare"", adding that the best way to preserve jobs was to stay in the customs union and single market. A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. No 10 says an annual payment would be made to balance the value of the tariffs collected by the UK for goods which ended up in the EU and the value of the goods which came via the EU but ended up in the UK Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""Yet again this Tory government is demonstrating to the Europeans who are negotiating with them that they are internally divided."" Former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve said Mr Johnson's decision to speak out was ""regrettable"", telling BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I don't think he is in any way inhibited by normal propriety in government."" Mrs May's official spokesman said that the issue was not discussed at Tuesday's regular cabinet meeting in 10 Downing Street, which Mr Johnson attended after returning from a visit to the US. The spokesman said Mrs May had confidence in the foreign secretary, adding, in relation to the two customs options: ""Following last week's sub-committee meeting, it was agreed that there are unresolved issues in relation to both models and that further work is needed. ""The prime minister asked officials to take forward that work as a priority."" Please upgrade your browser Reality Check: Why is the customs union so important?

"Drinking lots of cranberry juice is no way to fix a urine infection, say new draft guidelines from health body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Althoughsome studies have claimed it may help, NICE says there is not enough good evidence to recommend it. Instead, people should drink plenty of water or fluids and take painkillers. They can also speak to their doctor who might prescribe antibiotics, but these drugs will not always be necessary. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria. Sometimes the body can fight a mild infection alone without medication. When antibiotics are needed, the shortest course that is likely to be effective should be prescribed to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance, says NICE. It might be more appropriate to get a back-up prescription to be used only if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours or if they worsen rapidly or significantly at any time. Signs and symptoms of a UTI include: pain, burning or stinging when you urinate needing to urinate more often or urgently than normal dark, cloudy or smelly urine pain in the lower abdomen feeling generally unwell, achy, sick and tired Prof Mark Baker, director for the centre of guidelines at NICE, said: ""We recognise that the majority of UTIs will require antibiotic treatment, but we need to be smarter with our use of these medicines. ""Our new guidance will help healthcare professionals to optimise their use of antibiotics. ""This will help to protect these vital medicines and ensure that no one experiences side effects from a treatment they do not need.""

"This video can not be played Inter-generational fairness: One family, three voices A Â£10,000 payment should be given to the young and pensioners taxed more, a new report into inter-generational fairness in the UK suggests. The research and policy organisation, the Resolution Foundation, says these radical moves are needed to better fund the NHS and maintain social cohesion. Its chairman, Lord Willetts, said the contract between young and old had ""broken down"". Without action, young people would become ""increasingly angry"", he said. The Resolution Foundation says its goal is to improve outcomes for people on low and modest incomes. Give Â£10,000 to all young adults at the age of 25, funded by a new ""lifetime receipts tax"" that would replace inheritance tax Scrap council tax and replace it with a new property tax targeting wealthier homeowners Use the proceeds from property tax reform to halve stamp duty for first-time buyers and increase public funding for social care Make earnings of those above state pension age subject to National Insurance contributions What can you get for Â£10,000? Lord Willetts, the former universities minister under David Cameron, argued that young people were being locked out of the housing market and older people were worried about the demands of healthcare. Lord Willetts was speaking as the Resolution Foundation, which he heads,published a report calling for tax changes,externalto help heal the growing economic tensions between the generations. The foundation's Intergenerational Commission report calls for an NHS ""levy"" of Â£2.3bn paid for by increased national insurance contributions by those over the age of 65. It says that all young people should receive a Â£10,000 windfall at the age of 25 to help pay for a deposit on a home, start a business or improve their education or skills. The report proposes that this money be raised by abolishing inheritance tax and replacing it with a lifetime limit for recipients of Â£125,000 before taxes kick in. The commission estimates this would raise Â£5bn. ""We've got a very serious problem of ensuring there's a fair deal across the generations,"" Lord Willetts told me. ""Older people are worried about a properly funded healthcare system, people in middle age still haven't been able to buy their own home, and for younger people their pay is no better than it was 10 or 15 years ago. ""So the different generations in the UK all face different pressures. ""But we can tackle them, we can do something about it."" This video can not be played Lord Willetts says there is a divide between older and younger people The report calls for the scrapping of the council tax system, replacing it with a new property tax which would raise more money from wealthier homeowners. The proceeds would be used to halve stamp duty for first-time buyers. The cross-party commission, which included input from the heads of the CBI business lobby group and the Trades Union Congress, also demands more secure tenancies for renters. Millennials - people born between 1981 and 2000 - are half as likely as baby boomers - born between 1946 and 1965 - to own their own home by 30. Lord Willetts said that a lot of the problems had been created by political inertia by a series of governments. ""I think we still care about it,"" Lord Willetts said. ""We still feel the obligations that generations have to each other, and families are incredibly important in discharging those obligations. ""But when you look at public policy, sadly when it comes to a properly funded healthcare system, houses available so that people can achieve their goal of owner-occupation and a fair deal in pay for younger people - in all those ways, that contract between the generations has not been maintained. ""That contract has broken down. Families are doing their best, the bank of mum and dad helping out the kids, younger people caring about their grandparents, but when you look at public policy, there are older people worried about their social care, there are people of middle age who still aren't owner-occupiers, and that's what they want to be, and there are younger people whose pay is no higher than it was 10 or 15 years ago, so there's a problem in public policy."" New research produced by the Resolution Foundation revealed that young people are earning less today than the generation before them was earning at the same age. It showed that home ownership levels are far lower. And a poll undertaken for the Intergenerational Commission also suggested people were more pessimistic in Britain about the chances of the next generation having ""better lives"" than the one before it - compared with almost any other country. I asked Lord Willetts whether any government would have the stomach for increasing taxes on pensioners, for example, given that Theresa May was unable to push through a tax increase for the self-employed last year because of a public and Parliamentary backlash. ""There's no avoiding the pressures for more spending on healthcare and social care, the question is how we meet those pressures,"" he replied. ""Extra borrowing is unfair on the younger generation. ""Extra taxes on the working population - when especially younger workers have not really seen any increase in their pay - will be very unfair. ""It so happens that the older people who will benefit most from extra spending on health care have got some resources, so at low rates, it's reasonable to expect them to contribute. ""It is better than any of the alternatives."" Read more from Kamal Ahmed here The foundation also suggests that wealthier people should contribute privately to a social insurance system to help pay for social care in older age. The system would mirror elements of compulsory health insurance policies in Germany. ""We do think that there needs to be some element of private payment into social care costs when people can afford it,"" Lord Willetts said. ""But we're absolutely clear there should be a limit on those contributions, so that people don't face a very large bill that could wipe out their wealth. ""There should be an upper limit on it, and everybody should expect some contribution from the state. ""We want everything to be fair and affordable."" What can you get for Â£10,000?

An imperfect deal that was working The deal was not perfect. It did not cover a range of worrying Iranian activities from its missile programme to its regional behaviour. At worst you could say that it simply delayed a potential crisis. The inconvenient truth for Donald Trump is that, as far as it goes, the nuclear deal was working. Dangerous path ahead A battle will now be under way in Tehran, and who wins out will determine if the agreement can be saved.

It took years of sanctions pressure, painstaking diplomacy, and the full support of the international community to achieve that goal. We have none of that in place today.""

The American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby group, called for bipartisan support to ensure Iran will never ""acquire a nuclear weapons capability or realise its dangerous regional ambitions"". The lobby group described the original deal as ""critically flawed"", and said Trump's decision provides a new way to address the shortcomings of the deal after ""the international communityâs inability"" to do so. ""We must once again use the tools of American diplomacy and economic pressure to fix the dealâs shortcomings and counter Iranâs malign activities."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Shredding the Obama legacy Since his inauguration, Mr Trump has taken aim at practically every one of his predecessor's signature achievements. A pivot to Netanyahu Trump's shift to a more vehemently anti-deal view tracks closely with his full-throated support of Benjamin Netanyahu and the hardline Israeli side of Middle East peace negotiations, after earlier suggesting he could be an impartial ""deal-maker"" in the region. New faces in the room Where once the president may have been counselled to be cautious in abandoning US commitments to Iran, this time his instincts - an innate distrust of multilateralism in general and Iran in particular - appear to have been enthusiastically supported. After 15 months Mr Trump has built a foreign policy team that is largely on the same page - his page. Read the full story here.  Yevgeny Serebrennikov, first deputy head of the defence and security
committee in the Russian Upper House of Parliament,
told the RIA news agency that Trump's decision puts the Korean peace process in doubt. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to arrive in North Korea soon to help further pave the way for forthcoming talks with the isolated regime. Vladimir Chizhov, Russian envoy to the
European Union, separately told RIA that Russia will continue efforts to keep the Iran nuclear deal
functioning. Obama visited Tokyo in March, where he met the Japanese Prime Minister Former US President Barack Obama has just released a lengthy statement, calling Trump's decision ""a serious mistake"", and defending the agreement his administration helped negotiate. ""Without the JCPOA, the United
States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed
Iran or another war in the Middle East,"" warns Obama. He says the deal ""is working"", despite assessments by the current White House. Obama calls it a ""model for what diplomacy can accomplish - its inspections and
verification regime is precisely what the United States should be working to
put in place with North Korea"". ""Indeed, at a time when we
are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from
the JCPOA risks losing a deal that accomplishes - with Iran - the very outcome
that we are pursuing with the North Koreans."" Here's his full statement: Israeli forces in the Golan Heights are on high alert after the US withdrawal announcement Israeli forces in the Golan Heights remain on high alert after its military noted ""irregular activity of Iranian forces in Syria"".

Paul DanaharBBC Washington bureau chief If they drank
champagne in Saudi Arabia they would have been clinking glasses in Riyadh over
President Trumpâs decision to pull out of the nuclear deal with Tehran. It
means Saudi's biggest regional rival gets a financial kicking and Saudi Arabia
gets to cash the cheque because the move is bound to spike oil prices. The
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu also has reasons to celebrate. He was widely
derided last week by EU diplomats for a presentation in which he claimed his agents
had stolen new evidence showing Iranian duplicity. It was old news on a new
wrapper but Trump not only bought it, he cited it as proof he was right to
leave the agreement. Ironically the only other players in the Middle East whoâll
be super happy with Trumpâs move are those in Iran who chant: ""Death to America."" The hardliners hated the deal and theyâll use its collapse to undermine the
more moderate forces in the country who'd championed it. Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office in March UK Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron emphasised their ""continuing commitment"" to the deal in a joint statement. ""We encourage Iran to show restraint in response to the decision by the US; Iran must continue to meet its own obligations under the deal, co-operating fully and in a timely manner."" EU High Representative/Vice President Federica Mogherini said in a statement as long as Iran remained committed, the EU would also continue ""full and effective implementation"" of the deal. To Iran's citizens, Mogherini said: ""Do not let anyone dismantle this agreement. It is one of the biggest achievements diplomacy has ever delivered.""

"This video can not be played Inter-generational fairness: One family, three voices A Â£10,000 payment should be given to the young and pensioners taxed more, a new report into inter-generational fairness in the UK suggests. The research and policy organisation, the Resolution Foundation, says these radical moves are needed to better fund the NHS and maintain social cohesion. Its chairman, Lord Willetts, said the contract between young and old had ""broken down"". Without action, young people would become ""increasingly angry"", he said. The Resolution Foundation says its goal is to improve outcomes for people on low and modest incomes. Give Â£10,000 to all young adults at the age of 25, funded by a new ""lifetime receipts tax"" that would replace inheritance tax Scrap council tax and replace it with a new property tax targeting wealthier homeowners Use the proceeds from property tax reform to halve stamp duty for first-time buyers and increase public funding for social care Make earnings of those above state pension age subject to National Insurance contributions What can you get for Â£10,000? Lord Willetts, the former universities minister under David Cameron, argued that young people were being locked out of the housing market and older people were worried about the demands of healthcare. Lord Willetts was speaking as the Resolution Foundation, which he heads,published a report calling for tax changes,externalto help heal the growing economic tensions between the generations. The foundation's Intergenerational Commission report calls for an NHS ""levy"" of Â£2.3bn paid for by increased national insurance contributions by those over the age of 65. It says that all young people should receive a Â£10,000 windfall at the age of 25 to help pay for a deposit on a home, start a business or improve their education or skills. The report proposes that this money be raised by abolishing inheritance tax and replacing it with a lifetime limit for recipients of Â£125,000 before taxes kick in. The commission estimates this would raise Â£5bn. ""We've got a very serious problem of ensuring there's a fair deal across the generations,"" Lord Willetts told me. ""Older people are worried about a properly funded healthcare system, people in middle age still haven't been able to buy their own home, and for younger people their pay is no better than it was 10 or 15 years ago. ""So the different generations in the UK all face different pressures. ""But we can tackle them, we can do something about it."" This video can not be played Lord Willetts says there is a divide between older and younger people The report calls for the scrapping of the council tax system, replacing it with a new property tax which would raise more money from wealthier homeowners. The proceeds would be used to halve stamp duty for first-time buyers. The cross-party commission, which included input from the heads of the CBI business lobby group and the Trades Union Congress, also demands more secure tenancies for renters. Millennials - people born between 1981 and 2000 - are half as likely as baby boomers - born between 1946 and 1965 - to own their own home by 30. Lord Willetts said that a lot of the problems had been created by political inertia by a series of governments. ""I think we still care about it,"" Lord Willetts said. ""We still feel the obligations that generations have to each other, and families are incredibly important in discharging those obligations. ""But when you look at public policy, sadly when it comes to a properly funded healthcare system, houses available so that people can achieve their goal of owner-occupation and a fair deal in pay for younger people - in all those ways, that contract between the generations has not been maintained. ""That contract has broken down. Families are doing their best, the bank of mum and dad helping out the kids, younger people caring about their grandparents, but when you look at public policy, there are older people worried about their social care, there are people of middle age who still aren't owner-occupiers, and that's what they want to be, and there are younger people whose pay is no higher than it was 10 or 15 years ago, so there's a problem in public policy."" New research produced by the Resolution Foundation revealed that young people are earning less today than the generation before them was earning at the same age. It showed that home ownership levels are far lower. And a poll undertaken for the Intergenerational Commission also suggested people were more pessimistic in Britain about the chances of the next generation having ""better lives"" than the one before it - compared with almost any other country. I asked Lord Willetts whether any government would have the stomach for increasing taxes on pensioners, for example, given that Theresa May was unable to push through a tax increase for the self-employed last year because of a public and Parliamentary backlash. ""There's no avoiding the pressures for more spending on healthcare and social care, the question is how we meet those pressures,"" he replied. ""Extra borrowing is unfair on the younger generation. ""Extra taxes on the working population - when especially younger workers have not really seen any increase in their pay - will be very unfair. ""It so happens that the older people who will benefit most from extra spending on health care have got some resources, so at low rates, it's reasonable to expect them to contribute. ""It is better than any of the alternatives."" Read more from Kamal Ahmed here The foundation also suggests that wealthier people should contribute privately to a social insurance system to help pay for social care in older age. The system would mirror elements of compulsory health insurance policies in Germany. ""We do think that there needs to be some element of private payment into social care costs when people can afford it,"" Lord Willetts said. ""But we're absolutely clear there should be a limit on those contributions, so that people don't face a very large bill that could wipe out their wealth. ""There should be an upper limit on it, and everybody should expect some contribution from the state. ""We want everything to be fair and affordable."" What can you get for Â£10,000?

"Britain's rail companies are to launch a public consultation aimed at making ticketing fairer and easier to use. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents rail firms, said about 55 million different fares exist in the current system. A passenger group said reform was ""overdue"". The industry admits passengers are not currently always offered the cheapest fare available due to ""long-standing anomalies"" such as split ticketing. That means it can be cheaper for passengers to buy several tickets for a single journey than one ticket. Another ""anomaly"" it highlights is the charging of a peak-time fare when half a trip is on an off-peak service. The industry has pledged that average fares will not rise as a result of any reform. Man buys car 'for less than train ticket' Commuters 'priced off' UK trains Are you joining the 'Â£5k commuter club'? A reformed ticketing system could include integrated tickets covering other modes of transport such as buses and trams, and more flexible tickets for part-time workers, the RDG said. The consultation will be launched next month and will run until September. It will lead to a report containing proposals for governments to consider. Buying split tickets can work out cheaper - but by how much? Exeter Central to Sheffield on 16 June, leaving at 08:53 BST. Split tickets: Exeter Central to Exeter St Davids (Â£1.40); Exeter St Davids to Bristol Temple Meads (Â£14.70); Bristol Temple Meads to Cheltenham Spa (Â£7); Cheltenham Spa to Birmingham (Â£9.90); Birmingham to Derby (Â£6.30); Derby to Sheffield (Â£7.50).

Total Â£83.40 Advance ticket: Â£144.10(73% more expensive) Rules governing how tickets are sold and how fares are calculated date back to 1995, and it is argued they have not kept pace with technology or how people work and travel. Three decades ago it was assumed customers bought tickets by visiting ticket offices and each of the 2,500 stations in Britain still has to sell tickets to every other station in the country. However, the rise of smartphones has changed how people purchase tickets, while an increase in part-time and freelance work patterns means traditional season tickets are no longer an economical option. Further layers of complexity have been added through individual franchise agreements, with little taken away. This video can not be played How do UK rail fares compare to Europe? Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG, which represents the various rail companies, has said the industry is committed to reforming ""well-meaning but outdated"" regulation. ""Long-standing anomalies are becoming locked in... as a result it has become increasingly difficult for rail companies to guarantee the right fare,"" he added. Rail companies say they are already making improvements to fares where they can, such as cutting jargon and providing clearer information about peak and off-peak times. However, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Plummer said that making incremental changes ""compounds the problem"" and that ""root and branch reform"" was needed. The RDG believes a more sophisticated computer-based system of ticketing would be able to automatically offer customers the lowest fare.

""Thankfully I decided to ignore the machine and search online whilst standing in the station,"" she said. ""Sure enough, I easily found the Â£14 ticket, which I bought instead."" Ms Hare said she was ""disgusted"" to think how many people would be caught out by such unnecessary price differences. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Campaigners have taken to the streets across the island of Ireland over the Eighth Amendment referendum Facebook has said it will block ads relating to Ireland's forthcoming referendum on abortion that do not originate from advertisers inside the country. There had been worries that foreign ads could influence the result of the vote. Facebook has not applied such a policy to British elections or referendums. A 25 May referendum could repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Republic of Ireland's constitution, which states ""the right to life of the unborn"". It means that the country has a near-total ban on abortion, with terminations not allowed in cases of rape or incest, for example - unless there is a substantial risk to the life of the mother. In April, Irish data protection commissioner Helen Dixonsaid it was possible,externalthat foreign actors could try to sway the referendum. Reports in The Times newspaper's Ireland edition had also highlighted the problem. Facebook said that,externalits ban on ads not from the Republic would be effective from 8 May. The company will rely partly on reports from campaign groups that identify such ads. It added that such a policy would also apply to future elections in the country. Ads uploaded to Facebook by organisations based in the country could still be funded by foreign sources, however. Pro-life groups and others have used Facebook to publish campaign ads targeted at Irish voters ""This is an issue we have been thinking about for some time,"" said Facebook in a statement, referring to the Eighth Amendment referendum. ""Today, as part of our efforts to help protect the integrity of elections and referendums from undue influence, we will begin rejecting ads related to the referendum if they are being run by advertisers based outside of Ireland. ""We feel the spirit of this approach is also consistent with the Irish electoral law that prohibits campaigns from accepting foreign donations."" The firm added that it intended to provide an open platform ""for people to express ideas and views on both sides of a debate"". In April, Facebook announcedit would vet ads relating to the UK's local elections, which took place earlier this month. However, this action did not extend to blocking ads simply because they had been placed by foreign organisations. A spokeswoman for Facebook told the BBC that the social media site did not have any similar plans in other countries to make public at present.

The so-called dieselgate emissions scandal first came to light in September 2015. US prosecutors last week called it an ""appalling"" fraud that went to the very top of the company. Audi's chief executive, Rupert Stadler, said the company had responded quickly ""because full disclosure lies in our highest interest"". Customers will be informed and offered a software update. The German transport ministry said earlier on Tuesday that the country's vehicle authority had summoned Audi for a formal hearing. How VW tried to cover up the emissions scandal Ex-VW boss charged over diesel scandal Three years ago, Volkswagen admitted that nearly 600,000 cars sold in the US were fitted with ""defeat devices"" designed to circumvent emissions tests. It said it had installed software in 11 million diesel cars worldwide that could tell when they were being tested and cut their emissions. On the open road, untested, the level of emissions would in practice be far higher - up to 40 times as bad as recorded under laboratory conditions. Last Thursday, US prosecutors claimed that former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn was not only fully briefed about what his engineers were up to in the emissions scandal, but that he also authorised a continuing cover-up. VW has said it is co-operating with the US investigations. Audi says it discovered what it calls ""irregularities"" in the emissions controls of some A6 and A7 models while carrying out internal investigations in the wake of the scandal that engulfed the VW Group two years ago. It notified the authorities itself. It is worth remembering that the VW Group is still under intense scrutiny from US regulators. Continued surveillance by a court-appointed monitor was a condition of the $4.3bn settlement agreed with the Department of Justice last year. So it is unlikely that the latest concerns arise from any new deliberate wrongdoing. Reports suggest the software in question limits the injection of adblue - an additive used to help clean exhaust gases - when the contents of the adblue tank run low. That in turn means emissions go up. It could be a defeat device - or it could be a system originally designed just to give users a bit more time to fill up their adblue tanks, but which is now deemed to be unacceptable because of its impact on emissions. Either way, Audi clearly has some explaining to do. Embarrassing perhaps - particularly as the news has come out the day before Audi's AGM. But  a ""smoking gun"" pointing to more serious issues? Probably not.

"This video can not be played Inter-generational fairness: One family, three voices A Â£10,000 payment should be given to the young and pensioners taxed more, a new report into inter-generational fairness in the UK suggests. The research and policy organisation, the Resolution Foundation, says these radical moves are needed to better fund the NHS and maintain social cohesion. Its chairman, Lord Willetts, said the contract between young and old had ""broken down"". Without action, young people would become ""increasingly angry"", he said. The Resolution Foundation says its goal is to improve outcomes for people on low and modest incomes. Give Â£10,000 to all young adults at the age of 25, funded by a new ""lifetime receipts tax"" that would replace inheritance tax Scrap council tax and replace it with a new property tax targeting wealthier homeowners Use the proceeds from property tax reform to halve stamp duty for first-time buyers and increase public funding for social care Make earnings of those above state pension age subject to National Insurance contributions What can you get for Â£10,000? Lord Willetts, the former universities minister under David Cameron, argued that young people were being locked out of the housing market and older people were worried about the demands of healthcare. Lord Willetts was speaking as the Resolution Foundation, which he heads,published a report calling for tax changes,externalto help heal the growing economic tensions between the generations. The foundation's Intergenerational Commission report calls for an NHS ""levy"" of Â£2.3bn paid for by increased national insurance contributions by those over the age of 65. It says that all young people should receive a Â£10,000 windfall at the age of 25 to help pay for a deposit on a home, start a business or improve their education or skills. The report proposes that this money be raised by abolishing inheritance tax and replacing it with a lifetime limit for recipients of Â£125,000 before taxes kick in. The commission estimates this would raise Â£5bn. ""We've got a very serious problem of ensuring there's a fair deal across the generations,"" Lord Willetts told me. ""Older people are worried about a properly funded healthcare system, people in middle age still haven't been able to buy their own home, and for younger people their pay is no better than it was 10 or 15 years ago. ""So the different generations in the UK all face different pressures. ""But we can tackle them, we can do something about it."" This video can not be played Lord Willetts says there is a divide between older and younger people The report calls for the scrapping of the council tax system, replacing it with a new property tax which would raise more money from wealthier homeowners. The proceeds would be used to halve stamp duty for first-time buyers. The cross-party commission, which included input from the heads of the CBI business lobby group and the Trades Union Congress, also demands more secure tenancies for renters. Millennials - people born between 1981 and 2000 - are half as likely as baby boomers - born between 1946 and 1965 - to own their own home by 30. Lord Willetts said that a lot of the problems had been created by political inertia by a series of governments. ""I think we still care about it,"" Lord Willetts said. ""We still feel the obligations that generations have to each other, and families are incredibly important in discharging those obligations. ""But when you look at public policy, sadly when it comes to a properly funded healthcare system, houses available so that people can achieve their goal of owner-occupation and a fair deal in pay for younger people - in all those ways, that contract between the generations has not been maintained. ""That contract has broken down. Families are doing their best, the bank of mum and dad helping out the kids, younger people caring about their grandparents, but when you look at public policy, there are older people worried about their social care, there are people of middle age who still aren't owner-occupiers, and that's what they want to be, and there are younger people whose pay is no higher than it was 10 or 15 years ago, so there's a problem in public policy."" New research produced by the Resolution Foundation revealed that young people are earning less today than the generation before them was earning at the same age. It showed that home ownership levels are far lower. And a poll undertaken for the Intergenerational Commission also suggested people were more pessimistic in Britain about the chances of the next generation having ""better lives"" than the one before it - compared with almost any other country. I asked Lord Willetts whether any government would have the stomach for increasing taxes on pensioners, for example, given that Theresa May was unable to push through a tax increase for the self-employed last year because of a public and Parliamentary backlash. ""There's no avoiding the pressures for more spending on healthcare and social care, the question is how we meet those pressures,"" he replied. ""Extra borrowing is unfair on the younger generation. ""Extra taxes on the working population - when especially younger workers have not really seen any increase in their pay - will be very unfair. ""It so happens that the older people who will benefit most from extra spending on health care have got some resources, so at low rates, it's reasonable to expect them to contribute. ""It is better than any of the alternatives."" Read more from Kamal Ahmed here The foundation also suggests that wealthier people should contribute privately to a social insurance system to help pay for social care in older age. The system would mirror elements of compulsory health insurance policies in Germany. ""We do think that there needs to be some element of private payment into social care costs when people can afford it,"" Lord Willetts said. ""But we're absolutely clear there should be a limit on those contributions, so that people don't face a very large bill that could wipe out their wealth. ""There should be an upper limit on it, and everybody should expect some contribution from the state. ""We want everything to be fair and affordable."" What can you get for Â£10,000?

"Wet wipes are a key component of fatbergs - like this giant one that weighed as much as 10 double decker buses Wet wipes, used for sticky fingers and removing eye make-up, as well as on other parts of the anatomy, could themselves be wiped out over the next couple of decades. The government says its plan to eliminate plastic waste ""includes single use products like wet wipes"". The wipes contain non-biodegradable plastic. So manufacturers will either have to develop plastic-free wipes or consumers will have to go without. Wet wipes are behind93% of blockages in UK sewers, a key element of the infamous giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to Water UK, the trade body representing all of the main water and sewerage companies in the country. That has prompted the government and industry to focus on persuading consumers not to flush them into the waste water system. Five ways to break up with plastic What are the alternatives to plastic? Firms sign up to pledge to cut plastic pollution ""We are continuing to work with manufacturers and retailers of wet wipes to make sure labelling on packaging is clear and people know how to dispose of them properly,"" a spokesperson for the Department of the Environment (Defra) said. This video can not be played A lazy person's guide to cutting plastic from your life However, Defra says it is also ""encouraging innovation so that more and more of these products can be recycled and are working with industry to support the development of alternatives, such as a wet-wipe product that does not contain plastic and can therefore be flushed"". Despite the name, fatbergs are actually mainly made up of wet wipes. They account for a startling 93% of the material blocking our sewers according to Water UK, the membership body for water providers. They collected samples to analyse from blockages in sewers, pumps and wastewater treatment works. Wet wipes - mostly baby wipes, but also those used to remove make up and clean surfaces - made up the vast majority of the material. Fat, oil and grease only made up 0.5%. The other 7% was made up of a range of other materials including feminine hygiene products, cotton pads and plastic wrappers. Toilet paper made up just 0.01% of the material blocking our pipes and sewers. Environmental charities including Greenpeace and the Marine Conservation Society say they are not surprised by this high number, since wet wipes are often marketed as ""flushable"". The wet-wipe industry has flourished over the last decade with manufacturers offering an ever broader range of wipes, for sensitive skin, babies' bottoms, removing make-up, applying insect repellent, deodorant or sunscreen. However most are made of polyester and other non-biodegradable materials. One manufacturer, Jeremy Freedman, managing director of Guardpack, has written to his MP to say banning them would be environmentally disastrous. Mr Freedman told the BBC what he saw as their benefits: ""If you go to TGI Friday and Nando's, for example, you'll see our products there. ""These wipes are biodegradeable, take 3ml of liquid on average. If they weren't able to use these, they would need to wash their hands, using on average one litre of water. ""They are also widely used in the medical industry and, for people with incontinence and disabled people, these wipes are critical to their lifestyle."" He said many of the wipes he produced were made of 100% biodegradable materials, but warned they were under no circumstances flushable. Defra is in the process of exploring how changes to the tax system or charges could be used to reduce the amount of single-use plastics wasted. Prime Minister Theresa May pledged in January to eradicate all ""avoidable plastic waste"" by 2042. The government has also said it will consult over whether or not to ban plastic straws, cotton buds and drink stirrers. What are the alternatives to plastic?

"Prosecutors said Moseley, 50, fired the shotgun but handed it to his son saying: ""Tell them you've done it."" A father who pressured his 14-year-old son into taking the blame for a murder he had committed has been jailed. Matthew Moseley, 50, shot Lee Holt in the chest when he tried to get into his home last October. After he fired the shotgun, Moseley handed it to his son, saying: ""Tell them you've done it."" Moseley, who had denied murder, was given a life sentence at Preston Crown Court and ordered to serve at least 26 years in jail. Jurors heard Mr Holt had gone to confront Moseley at his home in Oswaldtwistle, near Accrington, amid a long-running dispute between the men's children. Moseley opened his front door and fired a Beretta semi-automatic shotgun at Mr Holt, the jury was told. His son made a fake confession and Moseley stayed silent as the teenager was arrested and led away in handcuffs. Despite the boy changing his account, Moseley maintained his innocence and said he had knocked the gun from his son's hands. In a covert recording of a prison van conversation, Moseley said to his son: ""You are a minor. You can't go to any jail. ""Self-defence for you and you didn't know what you were doing. Me, different ball game. And that is the way we have got to go with this."" Passing sentence, Mr Justice Simon Bryan told Moseley there was ""no possible justification"" for his actions, nor any suggestion he acted in self-defence. Lee Holt had gone to confront Moseley about an argument between the men's sons ""How any father could do that to their son is difficult enough to comprehend but what is truly incomprehensible is the cynical way in which you sought to manipulate, and pressurise, your son into accepting responsibility for the shooting and death of Lee Holt. ""You allowed your son to be arrested and questioned on suspicion of murder when all along you knew you had shot [him]. ""Your continual denial of guilt resulted in him having to give evidence against his own father and members of Lee Holt's family having to relive the terrible events of the night in question."" Richard Littler, defending, said his client was a hard-working family man who reacted in a ""bizarre fashion"" in the heat of the moment when there was ""kicking, banging and threats"" made at his front door. Moseley used a Beretta semi-automatic shotgun to kill Lee Holt Det Ch Insp Jill Johnston from Lancashire Police said Moseley's sentence was ""nothing less than he deserves"". There were ""no winners"" in the case, she said, as the Holt family ""lost a dearly loved father, son, partner, brother and uncle"", while Moseley's son must ""try and build a life for himself knowing his dad is in prison after trying to blame him"".

"The insurance industry has pledged to crack down on ""excessive"" differences in premiums for new customers and existing policyholders. The plan aims to iron out some of the controversial big differences between premiums for new and existing clients. The move follows new rules that force firms to display the previous year's premium on renewal notices. The new guidelines apply to home, motor and travel insurance, but not pet or health cover. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the British Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA) say their Guiding Principles and Action Points should mean ""an improvement in the outcomes for long-standing customers"". The new commitments by ABI and BIBA members include: Not supporting excessive differences between new customer premiums and subsequent renewal premiums that unfairly penalise long-standing customers Members will take action so that customers' tendency to shop around at renewal is not used to lead to excessive pricing differences that unfairly penalise long-standing customers. Firms should make clear in written, online or verbal customer communications that the new customer premium only applies for that year and subsequent renewal premiums may be higher. ABI chairman Andy Briggs said insurers did a ""great job"" for their customers, ""but the renewal market simply doesn't work where loyal customers get charged much more than new customers"". ""Given many consumers expect to get cheaper insurance when they shop around, there is no easy solution,"" he added. ""These new guiding principles and action points are a positive initiative by the ABI and BIBA members to demonstrate that the whole industry recognise this is an important issue that needs to be addressed."" Gareth Shaw of Which? said: ""A review of the unfair practice that sees existing customers charged excessively steeper premiums than new customers is long overdue. We regularly hear from consumers who are paying hundreds of pounds more a year than new customers because they've automatically renewed their cover. ""Insurers must now act with urgency and implement much-needed changes to ensure their customers aren't excessively penalised simply for their loyalty."" Insurers are finally owning up to what customers have been complaining about for years: the more loyal they are, the more they seem to pay. The extra cost can amount to hundreds of pounds a year on a policy. People selling insurance have become addicted to the ruse of offering big discounts to new buyers to keep business moving. If you don't bother to shop around, you end up footing the bill. The problem with today's plan is that it will be left up to individual insurers to decide which prices are excessive and how to narrow the gap. Customers will still need to check what they are paying to make sure they aren't being taken for a ride. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said its research had found that long-standing home insurance customers could pay an average of Â£110 more a year than new customers. The new plan showed the industry ""recognises the scale of this problem and is willing to act responsibly to stop consumers being penalised for their loyalty"", she added. ""The devil, however, will be in the detail - whether this is successful will depend on prices actually coming down for loyal customers,"" she added. ""The industry should also work with the Financial Conduct Authority to collect better data on the scale of this loyalty penalty. Then we can assess whether this unfair practice is being tackled effectively.""

ABI chairman Andy Briggs said insurers did a ""great job"" for their customers, ""but the renewal market simply doesn't work where loyal customers get charged much more than new customers"". ""Given many consumers expect to get cheaper insurance when they shop around, there is no easy solution,"" he added. ""These new guiding principles and action points are a positive initiative by the ABI and BIBA members to demonstrate that the whole industry recognise this is an important issue that needs to be addressed."" Gareth Shaw of Which? said: ""A review of the unfair practice that sees existing customers charged excessively steeper premiums than new customers is long overdue. We regularly hear from consumers who are paying hundreds of pounds more a year than new customers because they've automatically renewed their cover. ""Insurers must now act with urgency and implement much-needed changes to ensure their customers aren't excessively penalised simply for their loyalty."" Insurers are finally owning up to what customers have been complaining about for years: the more loyal they are, the more they seem to pay. The extra cost can amount to hundreds of pounds a year on a policy. People selling insurance have become addicted to the ruse of offering big discounts to new buyers to keep business moving. If you don't bother to shop around, you end up footing the bill. The problem with today's plan is that it will be left up to individual insurers to decide which prices are excessive and how to narrow the gap. Customers will still need to check what they are paying to make sure they aren't being taken for a ride. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said its research had found that long-standing home insurance customers could pay an average of Â£110 more a year than new customers. The new plan showed the industry ""recognises the scale of this problem and is willing to act responsibly to stop consumers being penalised for their loyalty"", she added. ""The devil, however, will be in the detail - whether this is successful will depend on prices actually coming down for loyal customers,"" she added. ""The industry should also work with the Financial Conduct Authority to collect better data on the scale of this loyalty penalty. Then we can assess whether this unfair practice is being tackled effectively.""

"This video can not be played How Melania's cause compares to previous campaigns US First Lady Melania Trump has been caught up in another plagiarism row, following the launch of her new online safety for children campaign on Monday. A booklet put out by Mrs Trump bore a striking resemblance to one published under the Obama administration. The text and graphics of the ""Be Best"" booklet were nearly identical to those in the previous edition. The White House said that Mrs Trump had sought to used her position to ""amplify"" the text's positive message. In 2016 Mrs Trumpwas accused of plagiarising parts of a speech from a 2008 address by Michelle Obama. After commentators picked up on very close similarities between the two speeches, Meredith McIver, a Trump administration staff member who wrote Mrs Trump's speech, admitted borrowing from Mrs Obama. Melania Trump's 'starring role' debut How did Melania Trump get an 'Einstein visa'? This video can not be played Did Melania Trump's speech copy Michelle Obama's? Mrs Trump's online safety booklet was initially billed on the initiative's website as being ""by First Lady Melania Trump and the Federal Trade Commission"". After similarities to the Obama-era edition were picked up online, the text was revised to describe it as a ""Federal Trade Commission booklet, promoted by First Lady Melania Trump"". A White House statement released on Tuesday accused ""opposition"" media of taking ""a day meant to promote kindness and positive efforts on behalf of children, to instead lob baseless accusations towards the First Lady and her new initiatives"". It said that the Be Best initiative was aimed at supporting children and opening dialogue on issues affecting them - including by helping the Federal Trade Commission to promote the booklet - and called on media workers ""to attempt to Be Best in their own professions"" by focussing on Mrs Trump's programme. A sample from the two booklets: 2014 on the left, and the Melania Trump version on the right Launching the ""Be Best"" initiative at the White House on Monday, Mrs Trump said the aim was to promote healthy living, encourage positive use of social media, and combat opioid abuse. ""As we all know, social media can both positively and negatively affect our children, but too often it is used in negative ways,"" she said. Her decision to focus on cyber-bullying has prompted questions about the behaviour of her husband, who frequently uses Twitter to attack and insult his opponents. The 2014 version, left, and Melania Trump version, right Mr Trump was widely criticised in 2017when he used the platform to call TV hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough ""low I.Q. Crazy Mika"" and ""Psycho Joe"", and claimed he saw Ms Brzezinski ""bleeding badly from a face-lift"". He has also been accused of mocking a disabled reporter. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was asked ahead of the launch of the initiative whether President Trump believed he bore any responsibility for the need to address cyber-bullying. ""I think the idea that you're trying to blame cyber-bullying on the president is kind of ridiculous,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? President Donald Trump is to reveal whether the US will abandon the nuclear deal with Iran and reimpose sanctions. Mr Trump has been highly critical of the 2015 accord, under which Iran limited its nuclear activities.

""In the coming days, it will also be important to remain in discussion with all sides to avoid an uncontrolled escalation,"" the official said. The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) saw Iran agree to limit the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel, but also nuclear weapons - for 15 years and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium for 10 years. Iran also agreed to modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. Iran limited its sensitive nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief In return, sanctions imposed by the UN, US and EU that had crippled Iran's economy were lifted. The deal was agreed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). What is the Iran nuclear deal?

Officials told the Associated Press that Mr Trump might reimpose sanctions on Iran's central bank,external, which would hit Iran's oil exports, and give foreign companies doing business with Iran a six-month grace period to wind down operations before incurring penalties.

"This video can not be played Commuters react as rail fare rises take effect: ""It's gone up every year, relentlessly"" Average rail ticket prices have risen by 3.4% across the UK, in the biggest increase to fares since 2013. Many commuters have seen their season tickets go up by more than Â£100, while campaigners and unions warn many people were being ""priced off"" UK railways. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said the railway network was ""fractured, expensive and complex"". The Department for Transport said price rises were capped in line with inflation and improved the network. Commuter routes that are now more expensive include Liverpool to Manchester (up Â£108 to Â£3,152), Maidenhead to London (up Â£104 to Â£3,092) and Elgin to Inverness (up Â£100 to Â£2,904). This video can not be played How do UK rail fares compare to Europe? Fare increases to regulated fares - which comprise about half of all tickets - are calculated using the previous July's Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation. Since 2007 the financial burden of running the rail system has increasingly fallen on passengers, after the government decided taxpayers as a whole should pay less via subsidies. Why are train fares going up? Are you joining the 'Â£5k commuter club'? Network Rail generates Â£4.8m from toilets Conservative MP Martin Vickers, a member of Parliament's transport select committee, sympathised with season ticket holders, but told Radio 4's World at One programme that it is appropriate for rail passengers to make their contribution to the system. ""The reality is that someone has to pay and it's either the tax payer or the users of the system,"" he said. He said the system of privatisation is ""far from perfect"" but added that it was the failings of Network Rail - which is nationalised - that is leading to the system's ""lack of capacity"". Campaigners have planned protests at busy rail stations, including Kings Cross in London Fares used to account for about half the cost of running our trains, whereas now it is about 70%. Paul Plummer, chief executive of industry trade body the Rail Delivery Group, said fare changes would provide cash for better services and investment, including the Thameslink and Great Northern rail upgrades. Speaking from London Bridge station,where five revamped platforms have been opened, he said fares were ""underpinning massively required investment"". Grayling 'in hiding' over fare rises Train fault cancels Labour fare rise protest Bruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, says the lower Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation measure should be used for regulated fare increases. He argued that if CPI had been used rather than RPI since 2004, rail fares would be 17% lower. Transport Secretary Chris Graylingis out of the country for a ministerial visit to Qatar, but a government spokesman said the way fares were calculated was ""under review"". The spokesman said the government ""carefully monitors how rail fares and average earnings change"". Labour's Mr McDonald said his plans to join protests across the country were ""interrupted""after his train to Leeds broke down. Hetweeted,externala video message on board, saying: ""Let's take our railway back into public ownership."" Passenger Sarah Beer, from Lingfield in Surrey, pays nearly Â£4,000 a year for her rail commute to London, which she describes as an ""extortionate amount of money"". ""It is like watching the Great Train Robbery all over again,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""What I cannot grasp, in this day and age, is that all we ask for is a reliable train service."" Robin Keenan, from Waltham Abbey in Essex, said he has been priced out of his London-based job due to ticket costs. ""I'm starting a new job tomorrow that's a lot closer to home - so no more trains,"" he told BBC News. ""I've taken a Â£2,000 hit in my wages but I'll be saving that amount due to a short bike journey."" Many commuters expressed their frustration with the increases on social media.

Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), accused the government of choosing to ""snub rail passengers"" while fuel duty continued to be frozen. ""The extra money that season ticket holders will have to fork out this year is almost as much as drivers will save,"" Mr Joseph said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who hasfrozen fares across the capital's TfL network until 2020, questioned why ticket prices were going up elsewhere. ""It's a scandal that the government are allowing failing private train companies to increase rail fares again,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) union, warned people were being ""priced off"" UK railways. He told BBC News that public ownership of the railways was a ""necessary"" step. The union has staged fare protests in stations across England and Wales, with separate protests planned for 3 January in Scotland where it is a bank holiday. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said it was investing in the ""biggest modernisation of our railways since the Victorian times"". He said: ""This includes the first trains running though London on the Crossrail project, an entirely new Thameslink rail service, and continuing work on the transformative Great North Rail Project."" Mark Carne, chief executive of Network Rail, said passengers would see a ""huge change"" in the coming year due to investment in rail networks. ""We all share the desire to try to keep fares as low as possible,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""My job is to run the network as efficiently as possible.""

"Campaigners have taken to the streets across the island of Ireland over the Eighth Amendment referendum Facebook has said it will block ads relating to Ireland's forthcoming referendum on abortion that do not originate from advertisers inside the country. There had been worries that foreign ads could influence the result of the vote. Facebook has not applied such a policy to British elections or referendums. A 25 May referendum could repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Republic of Ireland's constitution, which states ""the right to life of the unborn"". It means that the country has a near-total ban on abortion, with terminations not allowed in cases of rape or incest, for example - unless there is a substantial risk to the life of the mother. In April, Irish data protection commissioner Helen Dixonsaid it was possible,externalthat foreign actors could try to sway the referendum. Reports in The Times newspaper's Ireland edition had also highlighted the problem. Facebook said that,externalits ban on ads not from the Republic would be effective from 8 May. The company will rely partly on reports from campaign groups that identify such ads. It added that such a policy would also apply to future elections in the country. Ads uploaded to Facebook by organisations based in the country could still be funded by foreign sources, however. Pro-life groups and others have used Facebook to publish campaign ads targeted at Irish voters ""This is an issue we have been thinking about for some time,"" said Facebook in a statement, referring to the Eighth Amendment referendum. ""Today, as part of our efforts to help protect the integrity of elections and referendums from undue influence, we will begin rejecting ads related to the referendum if they are being run by advertisers based outside of Ireland. ""We feel the spirit of this approach is also consistent with the Irish electoral law that prohibits campaigns from accepting foreign donations."" The firm added that it intended to provide an open platform ""for people to express ideas and views on both sides of a debate"". In April, Facebook announcedit would vet ads relating to the UK's local elections, which took place earlier this month. However, this action did not extend to blocking ads simply because they had been placed by foreign organisations. A spokeswoman for Facebook told the BBC that the social media site did not have any similar plans in other countries to make public at present. She added, ""We are looking closely at all elections and determining what steps we can take."" Date set for Irish abortion referendum Why are polls and Facebook ads at odds in Ireland?

"Labour MP Heidi Alexander is quitting Parliament to work for London Mayor Sadiq Khan. The Lewisham East MP will become the new deputy mayor for transport. It means there will be a by-election in her South London seat, where Labour won by more than 20,000 votes in last year's general election. Announcing the appointment, Mr Khan said Ms Alexander - who replaces retiring Val Shawcross - was ""respected across the political divide"". Ms Alexander said she was ""really excited"" at her appointment, adding: ""I know just how important it is we ensure everyone has access to a high-quality and affordable public transport network, with safe cycling routes across the capital."" She has been an MP since 2010, and was shadow health secretary between 2015 and 2016, resigning from the front bench with an attack on Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. Allow Twitter content?

In a statement, Mr Schneiderman said he ""strongly contests"" the allegations. ""In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity,"" the statement says. ""I have not assaulted anyone.

"This video can not be played ""I have achieved everything I was told I wouldn't"" A young man who was bullied over his appearance is using his terrible experience to help others avoid it. Rory McGuire's birthmark saw him tormented and abused from an early age and despite surviving more than 20 operations, the abuse he has endured has been far more damaging and painful. The 24-year-old is now fronting a campaign to encourage victims of abuse over facial differences to report these hate crimes to police. He says any hate crime is unacceptable. At the age of six, Rory felt he was ""different"". The vascular birthmark which covered his lip earned abuse from an early age. Despite countless bouts of surgery to correct it, the abuse meant that at one point he hoped that he wouldn't wake up from the operating table. Some of the abuse Rory McGuire was subjected to as a child He had accepted that nothing would change. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams Programme: ""It was at its worst point in my late teens, I said to myself: 'This is it - this is how life is going to be and I just have to deal with it.' ""It was heartbreaking. I thought I would just have to deal with comments, stares and laughs for the rest of my life. ""My close friends didn't realise the extent of it. My mum and dad saw it affecting my confidence but there were a lot of things I didn't tell them. ""Anywhere I went in public I knew I was going to get stares or laughs or comments and I heard people turning to their friends and saying things and it was just constant."" It was only after countless corrective surgeries and from blogging his experience of relentless abuse that Rory gained enough confidence to stand up and try to prevent anyone else from feeling the same. Rory, from Ayr, supports theChanging Faces,externalcampaign for those with facial disfigurement to report abuse as a hate crime. Rory has had many corrective surgeries but is still subjected to bullying He said: ""I am happy to be the face of a campaign that is all about making a difference and stop other people having the experience I had when I was younger. ""If I can help as many people as I can then that is my goal. ""For me, none of it is acceptable and if someone is being put down to the point they just can't cope with it any more then they should feel there is help out there."" Rory tells heartbreaking stories of being frequently laughed at, mocked and stared at as a child and into his teens. He says people thought it was okay to call him awful names and compare him to film and TV characters. He recalls being cornered by a group of people who would compete to see who could call him the most offensive names. He suffered the double whammy of being left out when other children didn't want him to be a part of something and missing out because he was too shy to try to become involved with other children. Now he is encouraging everyone to stand up to hate crimes. ""It is absolutely unacceptable that people have to go through prejudice for reasons that are outwith their control. I want to promote the fact they can be reported and you can get help for them rather than bottling up these feelings which can be hard to deal with."" Rory after one of his surgeries A survey by Changing Faces of 800 people with a disfigurement found that a third had been a victim of a hate crime because of how they look, but hardly any of them reported it to police. The charity's Rob Murray said: ""We found out part of the reason was a lack of faith in the police, and resources. People see it as part of life."" Insp Claire Miller from Police Scotland said: ""Hate crime is any crime which is perceived by the victim or any other person to be motivated by malice and ill will towards a social group. ""It can be vandalism, anti-social behaviour or physical assault and none of those should be tolerated. ""We take hate crime very seriously. Victims or witnesses of hate crime should report it to us.""

"This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? President Donald Trump is to reveal whether the US will abandon the nuclear deal with Iran and reimpose sanctions. Mr Trump has been highly critical of the 2015 accord, under which Iran limited its nuclear activities. EU powers see it as the best way to stop Iran developing a nuclear bomb and their officials met a senior Iranian on Tuesday without US officials present. The White House has signalled that the president might stop short of reneging completely on the deal. It is unclear what that would entail. The president's announcement will take place at 14:00 (18:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Live updates as world awaits verdict Could the deal collapse? UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson urged Mr Trump not to ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" on Monday, while his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian made clear that France, the UK and Germany would continue to honour the accord. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has warned that his country could face ""some problems"" in the coming months, but stressed it will ""keep working with the world"". UK's Johnson courts Trump on Fox & Friends Do not quit Iran deal, UN urges Trump Envoys of Germany, France and the UK discussed the situation with Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Brussels on Tuesday, an EU statement said. An unnamed German official told Reuters news agency that representatives of the countries had been in contact for weeks. ""In the coming days, it will also be important to remain in discussion with all sides to avoid an uncontrolled escalation,"" the official said. The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) saw Iran agree to limit the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel, but also nuclear weapons - for 15 years and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium for 10 years. Iran also agreed to modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. Iran limited its sensitive nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief In return, sanctions imposed by the UN, US and EU that had crippled Iran's economy were lifted. The deal was agreed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). What is the Iran nuclear deal? Is Iran's economy better off now? Mr Trump has called the deal a ""disaster"" and ""insane"" and twice refused to certify to Congress that Iran is complying with it. In January, he warned that the US would ""withdraw"" from the accord on 12 May - the next deadline for waiving sanctions - unless its ""disastrous flaws"" were fixed. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal He complained that the deal only limited Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period; had failed to stop the development of ballistic missiles; and had handed Iran a $100bn (Â£74bn) windfall that it used ""as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression"" across the Middle East. European leaders attempted to persuade Mr Trump that his concerns could be addressed through a supplemental agreement. ButEuropean diplomats reportedly concluded on Monday that they had failed,external. The president could immediately hit Tehran with a barrage of oil and banking sanctions, along with measures targeting Iranian companies - a hard exit that the BBC's Nick Bryant in Washington says could effectively kill the entire deal. The US could reimpose sanctions on Iran's central bank, intended to target its oil exports However, the White House has signalled that he will stop short of that. Officials told the Associated Press that Mr Trump might reimpose sanctions on Iran's central bank,external, which would hit Iran's oil exports, and give foreign companies doing business with Iran a six-month grace period to wind down operations before incurring penalties. He also does not need to issue waivers for other sanctions until later this year, including those targeting 400 Iranian companies, individuals and business sectors. President Rouhani told an audience of oil and gas executives in Tehran on Tuesday morning that if Mr Trump chose to reimpose sanctions, Iran would ""face some problems for two or three months"" but would ""pass through this"". He stressed that ""the foundation of our policy is to work and have constructive relations with the world"" - an apparent reference to other parties to the deal. But others within his government struck a different tone. It ""will not be in the Americans' interest"" if they cause the deal to collapse, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council said. Iran ""will not be passive if the US starts confrontation"" with it, Fars news agency also quoted Ali Shamkhani as saying. This video can not be played Rouhani: The US would regret leaving nuclear deal ""like never before"" The speaker of the Iranian parliament, Ali Larijani, said the US ""did not implement their commitments"", seemingly anticipating a withdrawal. ""It seems you can only speak with the Americans in the language of force, and there is no other solution."" Mr Rouhani represents the more moderate face of Iran's leadership, and he helped finalise the nuclear deal in a bid to ease the desperate state of Iran's economy. Correspondents say there are other more hardline forces in Iran that never embraced the agreement and would not be unhappy to see it undermined. Could the Iran nuclear deal collapse?

"This video can not be played Trenton McKinley is now on a slow recovery process - half his skull must be re-connected A 13-year-old boy in the US state of Alabama regained consciousness just after his parents signed the paperwork to donate his organs. Trenton McKinley suffered severe brain trauma when he fell from a car trailer which flipped over and hit his head. Doctors told his parents he would not recover and that his organs were a match for five children who needed transplants. A day before his life support was to end, Trenton showed signs of awareness. The teenager suffered seven skull fractures in the accident in Mobile, Alabama, in March. According to his mother, Jennifer Reindl, Trenton has since undergone several craniotomy surgeries,external, suffering kidney failure and cardiac arrest. At one point, Ms Reindl said, Trenton died on the table for 15 minutes, after which doctors told her he would ""never be normal again"". Ms Reindl told CBS News that she agreed to sign the organ donation papers when she learned her son's organs could save five other children. ""We said yes, that also ensured that they would continue to keep Trenton alive to clean his organs for the donation,""Ms Reindl said, recalling how her son regained consciousness in March,external. ""The next day he was scheduled to have his final brain wave test to call his time of death, but his vitals spiked so they cancelled the test."" Trenton says he does not remember anything from the accident Trenton is now going through a slow recovery process. ""I hit the concrete, and the trailer landed on top of my head.After that, I don't remember anything,"" he said,external. He still has nerve pain and seizures, and will need surgery to reconnect half of his skull. He has been walking and talking, even reading and doing maths, Ms Reindl said, calling it ""a miracle"". Trenton himself told WALA he thought he was in heaven while he was unconscious. ""I was in an open field walking straight,"" the 13-year-old said. ""There's no other explanation but God.""

"Ann Coffey said some children are being sent as far as 100 miles from where they live Ministers have been accused of breaking a promise to cut the number of children being ""farmed out"" to children's homes huge distances from where they live. Government reforms in 2012 pledged to cut down ""out-of-borough placements"" to help combat child sexual exploitation. Labour MP Ann Coffey used a Commons debate to say a ""sent-away generation"" is in danger of falling prey to paedophiles and drugs gangs. The government said placements ""should meet the needs of children"". Stockport MP Ms Coffey - chair of the all party parliamentary group for runaway and missing children and adults - said there had been a 64% rise nationally in the number of children being sent to live away between 2012 and 2017. Figures obtained by Ms Coffey from the Department for Education show the number of children placed in homes out of their borough has risen from 2,250 in 2012 to 3,680 in March 2017. Ms Coffey said some children were being sent as far as 100 miles from where they live ""where they have no friends or family circles or local social workers"", creating a ""perfect storm where it is increasingly difficult to protect [them]"". ""Despite the [government] pledge, record numbers of children are being sent away to places where they are more vulnerable to exploitation,"" she added. ""These children are running away at a faster rate and are being targeted and preyed upon by paedophiles and criminals who know they are vulnerable."" Scale of child abuse survey 'needed every 10 years' Some 650 missing children 'at risk' Missing child appeals 'leave negative online footprint' The MP said there had also been a huge increase in the number of sent-away children going missing, with the number of incidents more than doubling to almost 10,000 a year. The government says it is strengthening its care planning and children's homes regulation Children's charity the NSPCC said going missing from care ""puts children at greater risk of physical abuse, grooming and sexual exploitation"". A Department for Education spokesman said it was updating its strategy to improve responses to missing people and strengthening its care planning and children's homes regulation to require all homes to have a ""clear policy for preventing children from going missing"". ""Local authorities have a statutory duty to make sure that placements meet the needs of children in their care and this includes the location of the placement,"" they added. Ms Coffey was author of Real Voices report- and a subsequent reviewReal Voices - Are they being heard?,external- into child sexual exploitation which was commissioned in the wake of theRochdale grooming casein 2012. She found almost 650 children reported missing in Greater Manchester in 2014 were at risk of child sexual exploitation or serious harm,with almost half concerning children in care. Ms Coffey is highlighting the links between children going missing and sexual exploitation in the debate in Westminster Hall.

"Wet wipes are a key component of fatbergs - like this giant one that weighed as much as 10 double decker buses Wet wipes, used for sticky fingers and removing eye make-up, as well as on other parts of the anatomy, could themselves be wiped out over the next couple of decades. The government says its plan to eliminate plastic waste ""includes single use products like wet wipes"". The wipes contain non-biodegradable plastic. So manufacturers will either have to develop plastic-free wipes or consumers will have to go without. Wet wipes are behind93% of blockages in UK sewers, a key element of the infamous giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to Water UK, the trade body representing all of the main water and sewerage companies in the country. That has prompted the government and industry to focus on persuading consumers not to flush them into the waste water system. Five ways to break up with plastic What are the alternatives to plastic? Firms sign up to pledge to cut plastic pollution ""We are continuing to work with manufacturers and retailers of wet wipes to make sure labelling on packaging is clear and people know how to dispose of them properly,"" a spokesperson for the Department of the Environment (Defra) said. This video can not be played A lazy person's guide to cutting plastic from your life However, Defra says it is also ""encouraging innovation so that more and more of these products can be recycled and are working with industry to support the development of alternatives, such as a wet-wipe product that does not contain plastic and can therefore be flushed"". Despite the name, fatbergs are actually mainly made up of wet wipes. They account for a startling 93% of the material blocking our sewers according to Water UK, the membership body for water providers. They collected samples to analyse from blockages in sewers, pumps and wastewater treatment works. Wet wipes - mostly baby wipes, but also those used to remove make up and clean surfaces - made up the vast majority of the material. Fat, oil and grease only made up 0.5%. The other 7% was made up of a range of other materials including feminine hygiene products, cotton pads and plastic wrappers. Toilet paper made up just 0.01% of the material blocking our pipes and sewers. Environmental charities including Greenpeace and the Marine Conservation Society say they are not surprised by this high number, since wet wipes are often marketed as ""flushable"". The wet-wipe industry has flourished over the last decade with manufacturers offering an ever broader range of wipes, for sensitive skin, babies' bottoms, removing make-up, applying insect repellent, deodorant or sunscreen. However most are made of polyester and other non-biodegradable materials. One manufacturer, Jeremy Freedman, managing director of Guardpack, has written to his MP to say banning them would be environmentally disastrous. Mr Freedman told the BBC what he saw as their benefits: ""If you go to TGI Friday and Nando's, for example, you'll see our products there. ""These wipes are biodegradeable, take 3ml of liquid on average. If they weren't able to use these, they would need to wash their hands, using on average one litre of water. ""They are also widely used in the medical industry and, for people with incontinence and disabled people, these wipes are critical to their lifestyle."" He said many of the wipes he produced were made of 100% biodegradable materials, but warned they were under no circumstances flushable. Defra is in the process of exploring how changes to the tax system or charges could be used to reduce the amount of single-use plastics wasted. Prime Minister Theresa May pledged in January to eradicate all ""avoidable plastic waste"" by 2042. The government has also said it will consult over whether or not to ban plastic straws, cotton buds and drink stirrers. What are the alternatives to plastic?

"Model Amber Valletta, with mobile phone, at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival The Cannes Film Festival kicks off later, one day earlier than normal, with a number of new measures set to ensure it won't be business as usual. Guests taking selfies on the red carpet risk being shut out of screenings in an attempt to stamp out the practice. Press screenings for films having their world premieres at the festival will no longer be held in advance. The festival will also work with the French government to set up a helpline for women to report sexual harassment. It follows allegations that producer Harvey Weinstein raped one actress and behaved inappropriately to others while attending previous festivals. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sexual activity. Cannes Film Festival: 10 films to look out for This year's festival is the first to be held since the entertainment industry became engulfed in a sexual harassment scandal. The #MeToo and Time's Up movements are sure to be referenced by those attending the event, which runs until 19 May. L to R: Cate Blanchett, Lea Seydoux and Kristen Stewart Among the main competition jury is French actress Lea Seydoux, one of many to accuse Weinstein of making unwelcome advances. The jury will be chaired by Australian Oscar winner Cate Blanchett and include Kristen Stewart, star of the Twilight films. All three stars have worked with Woody Allen, who has been accused by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow of sexually abusing her as a child. A number of prominent actors have distanced themselves from the director, who has repeatedly denied the allegations. Women outnumber men by five to four on this year's jury, which also includes Selma director Ava DuVernay and Burundian songwriter Khadja Nin. The panel is completed by Chinese actor Chang Chen and a trio of male directors - France's Robert Guediguian, Canada's Denis Villeneuve and Russia's Andrey Zvyagintsev. In the competition line-up itself, though, women are very much in the minority. Of the 21 films in contention, only three have female directors - the same number as last year. They are France's Eva Husson, Lebanon's Nadine Labaki and Italy's Alice Rohrwacher - the only one of the three to have previously been in competition. L to R: Jean-Luc Godard, Spike Lee and Pawel Pawlikowski Spike Lee, Jean-Luc Godard and Pawel Pawlikowski are among the male directors in the running for the prestigious Palme d'Or award. They are joined by a raft of less familiar names in a line-up that has been described as ""surprisingly fresh,external"" by Cannes standards. Other films eligible for the event's highest honour include Three Faces, whose Iranian director, Jafar Panahi, is banned from leaving his country. The French authorities have appealed to Iran's government to relax its travel ban and allow Panahi to attend. It is doubtful too whether the Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov, whose film Leto is in competition, will be present. The theatre and film directorwas put under house arrestlast year after being arrested on fraud charges. Further controversy swirls around the Kenyan film Rafiki, which will be shown at the festival as part of the Un Certain Regard sidebar. The film, a love story about two young women, has been banned in Kenya due to its lesbian storyline. Lesbian film banned ahead of Cannes debut And then there is The House That Jack Built, a film about a serial killer (Matt Dillon), the inclusion of which marks Lars von Trier's return to the festival. The Danish director was expelled from Cannes in 2011 after claiming to ""understand"" and ""sympathise with"" Adolf Hitler at a press conference. Last year von Trier denied he had sexually harassed Bjork after the Icelandic singeraccused a director she did not nameof behaving inappropriately. Von Trier was the director of Bjork's only film to date - 2000 Palme d'Or recipient Dancer in the Dark. L to R: Matt Dillon, Lars von Trier and Uma Thurman This year's festival will open with Everybody Knows, a psychological thriller starring husband and wife actors Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. It will close next week with The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, Terry Gilliam's oft-postponed retelling of the Miguel de Cervantes classic. That screening might be cancelled, however, if one of its former backers prevails in a legal challenge to have it blocked. Paulo Branco - who was at Gilliam's side when the project was resurrected in 2016 - claims the film cannot be shown without his permission. Terry Gilliam resurrects Don Quixote 'nightmare' Gilliam, who was born in America and became a UK subject in 1968, is one of the few British filmmakers with a presence at this year's Cannes. Their small number includes the Scottish director Kevin Macdonald, whose documentary about singer Whitney Houston will have a late-night screening. Christopher Nolan will be attending the festival, but only to host a 70mm screening of Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film sci-fi fans are really looking forward to, though, is Solo: A Star Wars Story, which will have its first screening at Cannes. Han Solo film gets Cannes screening Expect to see stormtroopers patrolling the red carpet on 15 May - provided, of course, they don't take any selfies. Selfies are a major bugbears of festival director Thierry Fremaux, who has branded them ""trivial"" and ""grotesque"" in interviews. Stormtroopers at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival A notable absence this year is Netflix, who had two films in competition - Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories - 12 months ago. This year, though, its titles were excluded from competition after the streaming giant refused to guarantee them a release in French cinemas. Many critics, meanwhile, have been dismayed by a decision to replace morning previews of films with press screenings held at the same time as their official unveilings. The previous system often saw films receive a critical drubbing before their red-carpet premieres had even taken place.

"Wet wipes are a key component of fatbergs - like this giant one that weighed as much as 10 double decker buses Wet wipes, used for sticky fingers and removing eye make-up, as well as on other parts of the anatomy, could themselves be wiped out over the next couple of decades. The government says its plan to eliminate plastic waste ""includes single use products like wet wipes"". The wipes contain non-biodegradable plastic. So manufacturers will either have to develop plastic-free wipes or consumers will have to go without. Wet wipes are behind93% of blockages in UK sewers, a key element of the infamous giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to Water UK, the trade body representing all of the main water and sewerage companies in the country. That has prompted the government and industry to focus on persuading consumers not to flush them into the waste water system. Five ways to break up with plastic What are the alternatives to plastic? Firms sign up to pledge to cut plastic pollution ""We are continuing to work with manufacturers and retailers of wet wipes to make sure labelling on packaging is clear and people know how to dispose of them properly,"" a spokesperson for the Department of the Environment (Defra) said. This video can not be played A lazy person's guide to cutting plastic from your life However, Defra says it is also ""encouraging innovation so that more and more of these products can be recycled and are working with industry to support the development of alternatives, such as a wet-wipe product that does not contain plastic and can therefore be flushed"". Despite the name, fatbergs are actually mainly made up of wet wipes. They account for a startling 93% of the material blocking our sewers according to Water UK, the membership body for water providers. They collected samples to analyse from blockages in sewers, pumps and wastewater treatment works. Wet wipes - mostly baby wipes, but also those used to remove make up and clean surfaces - made up the vast majority of the material. Fat, oil and grease only made up 0.5%. The other 7% was made up of a range of other materials including feminine hygiene products, cotton pads and plastic wrappers. Toilet paper made up just 0.01% of the material blocking our pipes and sewers. Environmental charities including Greenpeace and the Marine Conservation Society say they are not surprised by this high number, since wet wipes are often marketed as ""flushable"". The wet-wipe industry has flourished over the last decade with manufacturers offering an ever broader range of wipes, for sensitive skin, babies' bottoms, removing make-up, applying insect repellent, deodorant or sunscreen. However most are made of polyester and other non-biodegradable materials. One manufacturer, Jeremy Freedman, managing director of Guardpack, has written to his MP to say banning them would be environmentally disastrous. Mr Freedman told the BBC what he saw as their benefits: ""If you go to TGI Friday and Nando's, for example, you'll see our products there. ""These wipes are biodegradeable, take 3ml of liquid on average. If they weren't able to use these, they would need to wash their hands, using on average one litre of water. ""They are also widely used in the medical industry and, for people with incontinence and disabled people, these wipes are critical to their lifestyle."" He said many of the wipes he produced were made of 100% biodegradable materials, but warned they were under no circumstances flushable. Defra is in the process of exploring how changes to the tax system or charges could be used to reduce the amount of single-use plastics wasted. Prime Minister Theresa May pledged in January to eradicate all ""avoidable plastic waste"" by 2042. The government has also said it will consult over whether or not to ban plastic straws, cotton buds and drink stirrers. What are the alternatives to plastic?

A police spokesman said the incident, which sparked a ""large police presence"", was ""contained"" and ""no one sustained any serious injuries"". Officers began to allow residents to return to their homes on Monday evening after presenting themselves at the police cordon. All road closures have been lifted in the area, though police remain at the scene. Thames Valley Police said shots were fired from a property in Paradise Square With the streets now open, it was eerily quiet down Paradise Square this morning. It was as if the incident hadn't happened at all as people freely used the road to go about their daily business. At about 07:00 BST some residents began returning to their homes after spending the night away for their safety. The police officers and emergency service personnel - which swarmed the street for most of the afternoon yesterday - were nowhere to be seen. The only sign left in the street to show the gravity of the incident was a police officer looking out from a window in one of the properties, and a single police car parked at the end of the road.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Why Donald Trump could deserve Nobel Peace Prize UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has appealed to US President Donald Trump on his favourite morning TV show not to tear up the Iran nuclear deal. Appearing on Fox & Friends, Mr Johnson urged the president not to ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"". While in Washington, Mr Johnson met Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, but he did not get to see the president. Mr Trump later said he would announce his decision on the Iran nuclear accord on Tuesday afternoon. He has until 12 May to decide whether to stick with the pact - which he has called ""insane"". Under the international deal, the Islamic Republic has limited its nuclear activities in return for eased economic sanctions. What is the Iran nuclear deal? Is Iran's economy better off since the nuclear deal? Could the deal collapse? Appearing on Fox & Friends on Monday morning, the British foreign secretary said Mr Trump was ""right to see the flaws in the deal"", though he argued they could be fixed. The foreign secretary said without the accord, ""Plan B does not seem, to me, to be particularly well developed at this stage"". This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? He said: ""If you do that you have to answer the question what next? What if the Iranians do rush for a nuclear weapon? ""Are we seriously saying that we are going to bomb those facilities at Fordo and Natanz? ""Is that really a realistic possibility? Or do we work round what we have got and push back on Iran together?"" Mr Johnson added: ""There doesn't seem to me at the moment to be a viable military solution."" In a separate interview during the visit, Mr Johnson raised the prospect of Mr Trump winning the Nobel Peace Prize. ""If he can fix North Korea and if he can fix the Iran nuclear deal then I don't see why he is any less of a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize than Barack Obama, who got it before he even did anything,"" Mr Johnson told Sky News. Mr Johnsonalso wrote a New York Times op-ed,externalarguing that ""only Iran would gain"" from abandoning nuclear restrictions that ""handcuff"" the Islamic Republic. Shortly before promising a decision on the deal on Tuesday, Mr Trump accused former Secretary of State John Kerry of conducting ""possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy"" on the Iran deal. The suggestion of illegal activity could be a reference to the Logan Act, a more than 200-year-old law aimed at stopping US citizens conducting foreign affairs without the permission of the US government. The Boston Globe reports,externalthat Mr Kerry recently met Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in New York to discuss how to preserve the agreement, which they both helped negotiate with world powers.

"Eric Schneiderman is one of America's top lawyers and has been a vocal supporter of women's rights New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has resigned following allegations of assault by four women. The New Yorker magazine published a report,externalquoting the women, two of them ex-girlfriends, who accused Mr Schneiderman, 63, of hitting them. Mr Schneiderman has been a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and a fierce opponent of President Donald Trump. In a statement, Mr Schneiderman said he ""strongly contests"" the allegations. ""In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity,"" the statement says. ""I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in non-consensual sex, which is a line I would not cross."" Mr Schneiderman said: ""While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office's work at this critical time."" How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Is #meToo changing Hollywood? Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo Mr Schneiderman became attorney general in 2010 and had intended to run for re-election to the post this year. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had called for Mr Schneiderman's resignation, following the reports. ""No-one is above the law, including New York's top legal officer,"" he said. ""I do not believe it is possible for Eric Schneiderman to continue to serve as attorney general."" Mr Cuomo said he would ask a prosecutor to investigate the allegations. Michelle Manning Barish (above): After four weeks of being involved with Mr Schneiderman, she says that, as they were preparing for bed and still fully clothed, he ""all of a sudden, just slapped me, open-handed and with great force, across the face"" and then pushed her down and began to choke her. She says: ""This was under no circumstances a sex game gone wrong... I did not consent to physical assault."" She says he later said: ""You know, hitting an officer of the law is a felony."" Tanya Selvaratnam:Says Mr Schneiderman warned her he could have her followed and phone-tapped and said he would kill her if she broke up with him, all of which he denies. The Sri Lanka-born author and actor says Mr Schneiderman called her ""brown slave"", adding: ""Sometimes, he'd tell me to call him Master, and he'd slap me until I did."" Third romantic partner:Says he repeatedly subjected her to non-consensual physical violence. Fourth woman: A prominent lawyer, says Mr Schneiderman slapped her with force after she rebuffed his advances. ""After the most difficult month of my life - I spoke up,"" Ms Manning Barish wrote on Twitter after the allegations were published. ""For my daughter and for all women. I could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me."" How the Weinstein scandal unfolded Jennifer Cunningham, Mr Schneiderman's ex-wife, released a statement on Monday saying: ""I've known Eric for nearly 35 years as a husband, father, and friend...
