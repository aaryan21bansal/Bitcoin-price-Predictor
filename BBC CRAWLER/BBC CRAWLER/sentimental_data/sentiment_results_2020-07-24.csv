"Most people in England, about 30 million, are to be offered a free flu vaccine this year, the government says. It is to prepare for a winter that could see the annual flu season coincide with a surge in coronavirus. The NHS flu programme will add all over-50s, people shielding and those who live with them and children in their first year of secondary school. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he wanted ""everyone to have a flu jab in the run up to this winter"". He said it was important to ""protect the NHS in the winter months because we've still got Covid and the threat of a second spike of Covid, and its vital therefore to keep that pressure off the NHS by everybody getting a flu jab."" Flu, which can be deadly or need hospital treatment, poses additional threats during the pandemic: There is some evidence a double infection with coronavirus and flu is more deadly than either alone A big flu season combined with coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals If lots of NHS or care-home staff are sick with flu, then it may not be possible to respond to Covid-19 in the same way as during the peak in spring. But it is impossible to predict how big a flu season we will have. Australia, which is currently in its winter, is either having a very mild or very late flu season. Social-distancing and hygiene measures in place to stop coronavirus should, in theory, also have an impact on the amount of flu going around. people who were required toshield from coronavirusand anyone they live with people withsome medical conditions,externalincluding diabetes, heart failure and asthma pregnant women pre-school children over the age of two all primary school children, as last year, and, for the first time, Year 7 pupils initially all people over 65, before the programme is extended to the over-50s The NHS will get in contact with those who are eligible. It wants to ensure the highest risk patients are at the front of the queue when the immunisation programme starts in September. Those aged 50-64 will be offered the jab later, with the full details still to be announced. Last year, around 15 million people in England were vaccinated as part of the NHS campaign, far fewer than the 25 million who were invited to have it. This year more than 30m doses have been ordered. The vaccine will also be available privately in pharmacies and some supermarkets to adults who are not eligible for an NHS jab. It usually costs around Â£20. A Scottish government spokesperson said it was ""examining the best options"" for expanding eligibility for its flu vaccine programme which would be set out when it had ""confidence that there is adequate supply of vaccines in order to delivery on any commitments we make"". Plans for Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet been announced. The symptoms of flu include a fever and a dry cough. By now this should sound familiar - as they are the key signs of Covid-19 too. Other symptoms such as fatigue, aches, a sore throat or headaches are also shared by both infections. And there are also other winter viruses, such as rhinovirus and RSV, that can also lead to similar symptoms. This could create a problem come winter - as far more people would need testing to work out whether they have had coronavirus and their contacts needed tracing. This is why the government has already announced plans to increase testing capacity to half a million a day. Today's announcement on vaccines aims to suppress the flu season so numbers are as low as possible. GP Dr William Bird, an expert on preventative health, told BBC Breakfast it was right to offer the flu jab more widely, but that logistics would be a big problem. He said flu clinics were already run like a ""military operation"" with people ""bunched together"" - and social distancing would complicate matters. Children are given the flu vaccine with a nasal spray, while adults have a jab Plans are also being put together for ensuring coronavirus does not disrupt vaccination by, for example, causing schools, which deliver the childhood programme, to shut. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical advisor, said: ""This winter more than ever, with Covid-19 still circulating, we need to help reduce all avoidable risks. ""Vaccinating more people will help reduce flu transmission and stop people becoming ill."" Children are ""super-spreaders"" of the flu virus, but the expansion of the childhood programme had not been anticipated before the pandemic. The plan had been to assess the impact of vaccinating all primary school children, achieved for the first time last year, before deciding what to do next.

GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Meanwhile, there will be a renewed push to persuade health and care workers to have the vaccine. Last year,74% of staff,externalwere immunised. Paulette Hamilton, from the Local Government Association, said: ""Extending the free winter flu jab to as many people as possible is essential if we are to tackle two potentially deadly viruses head-on and prevent one seasonable and predictable virus creating the conditions for a second, more serious and unpredictable deadly second wave of Covid-19. ""It is absolutely critical that all our health and care workers get themselves vaccinated, to protect both themselves and the people they look after, including our elderly and most vulnerable, from a potentially devastating second wave of infections.""

"More than 12 million Africans were forcibly transported across the Atlantic to work as slaves A major DNA study has shed new light on the fate of millions of Africans who were traded as slaves to the Americas between the 16th and 19th centuries. More than 50,000 people took part in the study, which was able to identify more details of the ""genetic impact"" the trade has had on present-day populations in the Americas. It lays bare the consequences of rape, maltreatment, disease and racism. More than 12.5m Africans were traded between 1515 and the mid-19th Century. Some two million of the enslaved men, women and children died en route to the Americas. Searching for my slave roots Moving to Ghana 'to escape racism' The DNA study was led by consumer genetics company 23andMe and included 30,000 people of African ancestry on both sides of the Atlantic. The findingswere published in the American Journal of Human Genetics,external. Steven Micheletti, a population geneticist at 23andMe told AFP news agency that the aim was to compare the genetic results with the manifests of slave ships ""to see how they agreed and how they disagree"". While much of their findings agreed with historical documentation about where people were taken from in Africa and where they were enslaved in the Americas, ""in some cases, we see that they disagree, quite strikingly"", he added. This video can not be played Ghanaian artist Kwame Akoto-Bamfo creates sculptures of slaves to immerse people in their experience. The study found, in line with the major slave route, that most Americans of African descent have roots in territories now located in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. What was surprising was the over-representation of Nigerian ancestry in the US and Latin America when compared with the recorded number of enslaved people from that region. Researchers say this can be explained by the ""intercolonial trade that occurred primarily between 1619 and 1807"". They believe enslaved Nigerians were transported from the British Caribbean to other areas, ""presumably to maintain the slave economy as transatlantic slave-trading was increasingly prohibited"". Likewise, the researchers were surprised to find an underrepresentation from Senegal and The Gambia - one of the first regions from where slaves were deported. Researchers put this down to two grim factors: many were sent to work in rice plantations where malaria and other dangerous conditions were rampant; and in later years larger numbers of children were sent, many of whom did not survive the crossing. Some two million people did not survive the horrendous conditions aboard ship In another gruesome discovery, the study found that the treatment of enslaved women across the Americas had had an impact on the modern gene pool. Researchers said a strong bias towards African female contributions in the gene pool - even though the majority of slaves were male - could be attributed to ""the rape of enslaved African women by slave owners and other sexual exploitation"". In Latin America, up to 17 African women for every African man contributed to the gene pool. Researchers put this down in part to a policy of ""branqueamento"", racial whitening, in a number of countries, which actively encouraged the immigration of European men ""with the intention to dilute African ancestry through reproduction"". 'My Nigerian great-grandfather sold slaves' Although the bias in British colonised America was just two African women to one African man, it was no less exploitative. The study highlighted the ""practice of coercing enslaved people to having children as a means of maintaining an enslaved workforce nearing the abolition of the transatlantic trade"". In the US, women were often promised freedom in return for reproducing and racist policies opposed the mixing of different races, researchers note.

They are: Yvette Tan, Krutika Pathi, Yaroslav Lukov, Frances Mao, Saira Asher, Andreas Illmer, Anna Jones, Sophie Williams, Hazel Shearing, Katie Wright, Patrick Jackson, Paul Kirby, Georgina Rannard, Lauren Turner, Joseph Lee, Ashitha Nagesh and Max Matza. Thank you for joining us for our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today - particularly if you're in a city or country that's currently in lockdown. We're pausing our live page until tomorrow morning (UK time). But to sum up, here are the main headlines from today. Many shoppers were prepared for the new rules on face coverings We're wrapping up today's live page coverage shortly, but if you want to catch up on the day's events, here is what has been happening in the UK. Hazel Shearing & Alex KleidermanBBC News ""Oh, better put our masks on,"" a woman says to her friend outside a homeware shop in Camberwell, south London, fishing around in her bag. He shrugs and follows her inside, opting to go without. It's thefirst day that face coverings have been compulsory for customers in England's shops. But this short exchange sums up the dilemma for some shopkeepers and shoppers. Susan Green, 57, in Liverpool, said: ""I think it is a little bit late to have introduced this and lots of people I've seen this morning are not even wearing one. ""It won't put me off coming to the shops because I'll be out anyway, but it does seem a bit unnecessary."" Read the full story here This video can not be played Boris Johnson: There maybe things we could have done differently Claire MarshallEnvironment correspondent, BBC News Team GB open water swimmer Toby Robinson has been training in the River Soar Figures suggest that more people than ever are heading to Britain's rivers with the easing of lockdown - renewing calls for better public rights of access. It comes as MPs are to consider proposals aimed at opening up the waterways to all. But after recent incidences of overcrowding and littering, there are fears more people on rivers could ""cause chaos"". The Canal & Rivers Trust, British Canoeing, the Outdoor Swimming Society and the Angling Trust all report a surge in interest during lockdown and after the easing of restrictions began. Unlike in Scotland, there is currently no ""right to roam"" equivalent on waterways in England and Wales. The vast majority of rivers in England and Wales - around 95% - are in private hands and access is limited. If you swim, fish or paddle without the right permission, you are breaking the law. ""The Crown owns the water you swim in, while the person who owns the property up to the bank is also said to own the bed of the river up to the middle,"" says Nick Hayes, author of The Book of Trespass. Read more There have been more than 15 million people infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, and the number of cases is still rising fast in many parts of the world. In parts of the world badly affected during the early stages of the pandemic, including European countries such as Italy, France and the UK, the daily death toll has fallen dramatically. But in other places, such as parts of South America, India and South Africa, the death rate is rising fast. The US has seen the world's highest number of daily cases and deaths in recent days, as infections spiked in a number of states once coronavirus restrictions were relaxed. Among the worst-affected states at the moment are Florida and Louisiana, with high rates of infection in Texas, Arizona, Nevada and across the southern US. The US is not the only country to see coronavirus rise again. Israel, Australia and Japan have seen a second rise in cases after measures against coronavirus appeared to have got the infection under control, while Iran has also seen cases increase sharply. Although he admitted there were ""open questions"" about the government's early response to the virus, Boris Johnson denied that they had been too slow to act. ""If you look at the timing of every single piece of advice that we got from our advisers, from Sage, you will find that whenever they said that we needed to take a particular step, actually, we stuck to that advice like glue,"" he told the BBC. The prime minister also warned that the UK is vulnerable to a second surge, particularly in the winter. ""Collectively, this country has done an incredible thing to get the disease down to the levels it's at. But we all know that it can come back,"" he said. ""And we can see what's happening in other countries - I won't name them - but you can see the resurgence that's happening. We know that we're vulnerable there. ""So that's why we're getting on now with our preparations for the winter... a massive flu vaccination programme, stockpiling PPE, making sure that we ramp up Test and Trace, and making sure that people get tested if they have symptoms."" A McDonald's that is closed for indoor dining in Miami McDonald's has announced that anyone entering one of their 14,000 restaurants in the US will be required to wear a mask starting on 1 August. The fast-food chain joins other major businesses, like Walmart and Starbucks, that have announced new rules mandating masks. In a statement, McDonald's said that nearly 82% of its restaurants are in regions that require masks. Experts agree that wearing masks helps to prevent the spread of Covid-19. McDonald's said they were taking steps to also assist customers who refuse or are unable to wear a mask. ""In those situations where a customer declines to wear a face covering, weâll put in place additional procedures to take care of them in a friendly, expedited way,"" the statement said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Restricted from travel abroad due to the infection rate, Swedes are holidaying at home Brightly coloured beach towels line the shores of Lake Storsjon, two hours north of Stockholm. Staycations are popular here this summer, thanks to a slew of travel restrictions imposed on Sweden by other countries, due to its coronavirus infection rate. More than 5,500 people have died with Covid-19 in this country of just 10 million. It is one of the highest death rates relative to population size in Europe, and by far the worst among the Nordic nations. Unlike Sweden, the rest all chose to lock down early in the pandemic. ""Maybe we should have taken some more care of each other,"" says Dan Eklund, 31, visiting the lake on his friend's boat. Sweden has largely relied on voluntary social distancing guidelines since the start of the pandemic, including working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. The unusual strategy has attracted global criticism. But according to clinical epidemiologist Helena Nordenstedt, there's no consensus in Sweden's scientific community that the strategy as a whole has failed. Read more.  Reaction to the prime minister's interview with the BBC is continuing to come in. Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said: ""At last Boris Johnson has admitted what we have all known for some time - this government made fundamental mistakes in their handling of the coronavirus crisis. ""However, to try and minimise this as there were some things they could have done differently is not only an enormous understatement, but it is an insult to all those who tragically lost loved ones to the virus. ""This interview has given people more questions than answers. With no remorse for the catastrophic mistakes such as the failure to protect our care homes or a refusal to put a comprehensive plan in place for a second wave, it is clear the prime minster has learnt nothing over the course of the last few months."" Face coverings are now compulsory for customers in shops and supermarkets in England. Globally, the wearing of face coverings and masks has been polarising opinion over the past few weeks - and has become particularly politicised in the US. So why are some people hesitant to wear masks, and is there actually any truth in their claims? The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been investigating false and misleading claims about the health risks of face masks and coverings being shared on social media.Read the full story here. Children at a California summer school earlier this month The latest guidance on schools and childcare from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasises the urgency of getting children back into classrooms in the autumn. The document comes two weeks after President Trump criticised the previous CDC guidance on schools as ""very tough and expensive"". ""It is critically important for our public health to open schools this fall,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield, a Trump appointee, said in a statement announcing the updates. Critics - including many teachers - say it is too early to commit to in-person learning as infections continue to rise across the US. âI am comfortable with that,"" Trump said earlier this week when asked about his 14-year-old son and his school-aged grandchildren returning to classrooms. âI would like to see the schools open 100 percent. And weâll do it safely. Weâll do it carefully,â he said. Despite Trump's efforts, the Maryland private school attended by his son Barron has said they will not fully open in September due to virus concerns. We reported earlier about Boris Johnson's interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has now responded, saying that the prime minister ""has finally admitted the government mishandled its response to the coronavirus"". ""This finally puts to bed the prime minister's previous claim his government 'took the right decisions at the right time',"" Ashworth added. ""It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown, and too slow to take this crisis seriously. ""The threat of a second wave is still very real. It is imperative the government learns the lessons of its mistakes so we can help to save lives."" Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check A major privately run airline in Zambia has been using unproven badges whose manufacturers claim that they can offer protection against viruses. Avideo posted by Mahogany Air,externalon their Facebook page shows cabin crew wearing the badges. Mahogany Air claims without any basis that the badges have âair-purifying virus buster technology that purifies the air around any passenger or crew member wearing it"". The airlineâs CEO, Jim Belemu, told the BBC he believed the badges worked and would offer additional protection but there's no evidence these badges can ward off viruses and bacteria, and some health authorities have issued warnings about them. Similar devices are being sold around the world and at one time were worn by members of the Russian parliament. Some countries have banned them. In Africa, the president of South Sudan and other senior officials were seen using the badges although a government official told the BBC they later stopped wearing them. The substance released by such cards or badges - the bleaching agent chlorine dioxide - is potentially harmful. In April, the US Food and Drug Administration said chlorine dioxide products had not been shown to be safe and effective for any use, including against Covid-19.The agency says the substance, which is a powerful bleaching agent, can cause âserious and potentially life-threatening side effects"". If you're joining us from the US, good morning. To help you catch up, here are the main headlines from your side of the pond. The prime minister says the UK government didn't understand coronavirus in the ""first few weeks and months"" and has acknowledged there were things the government ""could have done differently"" in its handling of the virus. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Boris Johnson said there were ""lessons to be learned"" about how the virus was managed in the early stages. ""We didn't understand (the virus) in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months. ""The single thing that we didn't see at the beginning was the extent to which it was being transmitted asymptomatically from person to person. ""I think it's fair to say that there are things that we need to learn about how we handled it in the early stages."" The prime minister also said there were ""very open questions"" over whether lockdown came too late - a marked change from ministers' previous insistence that the right decisions were taken at the right time. Asked whether there was a delay in implementing a lockdown which ultimately cost lives, he said:
""Maybe there were things we could have done differently and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done differently."" Read the full story here BBC OS Dozens of protesters

Meanwhile, Florida and Tennessee each set new state records for most coronavirus-related deaths in a 24-hour period. The US recorded a total of 68,663 new cases on Thursday and 1,114 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The pace of infections across the US is increasing, experts say. It took the US 15 days to jump from 3m to 4m - a milestone the country passed on Thursday. It previously took 45 days to go from 1m to 2m infections, the Washington Post reports, and the leap from 2m cases to 3m took 27 days.  Another 123 deaths have been reported in hospitals, care homes and the community in the UK, according tocoronavirus.data.gov.uk,external. It brings the total number of deaths following a positive Covid-19 test result to 45,677. There were also a further 770 cases confirmed through testing. The daily death toll figures continue to be published by Public Health England on the coronavirus dashboard, but the government haslaunched a reviewinto them over concerns that the figures from England may include some people who died months after a positive test.

"More than 12 million Africans were forcibly transported across the Atlantic to work as slaves A major DNA study has shed new light on the fate of millions of Africans who were traded as slaves to the Americas between the 16th and 19th centuries. More than 50,000 people took part in the study, which was able to identify more details of the ""genetic impact"" the trade has had on present-day populations in the Americas. It lays bare the consequences of rape, maltreatment, disease and racism. More than 12.5m Africans were traded between 1515 and the mid-19th Century.

"""Oh, better put our masks on,"" a woman says to her friend outside a homeware shop in Camberwell, south London, fishing around in her bag. He shrugs and follows her inside, opting to go without. It's thefirst day that face coverings have been compulsory for customers in England's shops, and most people are complying on this high street. But the exchange sums up the dilemma for some shopkeepers. On one side of the road, a mum ushers her two daughters into Lidl - the three of them clad in matching face coverings. On the other, a woman hovers outside a shop front, sussing out with the sales assistant whether she can come in without one. Where do I now have to wear a face covering? How to make your own face mask Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask ""Keep distance please!"" reads a sign in the window of Ragini Patel's stationery shop. She says all she can do is ask customers to wear face coverings but some of the older customers, in particular, don't listen. One customer was even aggressive when she reminded him about social distancing. ""There's no point saying anything to anybody, you don't want to get in trouble,"" she shrugs. Ragini Patel says all she can do is ask that customers wear face coverings in her shop A hundred miles away, in Birmingham, another shopper, Laura, told BBC Radio 5 Live she had been in a branch of supermarket Aldi this morning where a couple of people weren't wearing face coverings. She didn't approve. ""If there's even a remote possibility that wearing a mask can reduce infection rate then it's worth it. It's not a hardship,"" she added. Meanwhile, listener Paul said he had been on the receiving end of some ""mask outrage"" this morning in Maidenhead, Berkshire, when he went into Tesco without a face covering after a bike ride. He said it was an ""honest mistake"" but a fellow shopper berated him. ""She just went to town on me,"" Paul said. ""I've been rightfully scolded."" Like many shopping areas across the country, stores in the Liverpool One complex have put up signs telling customers to wear face coverings. But Susan Green, 57, in Liverpool, said: ""I think it is a little bit late to have introduced this and lots of people I've seen this morning are not even wearing one. ""It won't put me off coming to the shops because I'll be out anyway but it does seem a bit unnecessary."" Liverpool One also has a new vending machine selling face coverings in a multitude of styles - and they have sprung up on other high streets too. Vending machines selling face coverings have sprung up across the country Back in Camberwell, at the Scope charity shop, Dawn Suleyman says only one customer has come in today without a face covering - and was grateful when she handed her a spare. She agrees that it might not be wise to challenge customers, since there have been instances when staff have been verbally abused for asking shoppers to use the hand sanitiser pump. Leaning over to tap the counter to her left, she adds: ""So far today, touch wood, we've not had any problems."" Dawn Suleyman says reopening has been difficult because people haven't been able to try clothes on ""I wouldn't say to someone, 'You can't come in because you haven't got a mask on,'"" says Dawn, who is exempt when she goes shopping because she suffers from asthma. ""I'd explain to them, 'You do realise that you could possibly get a fine? And if you haven't got a mask I'm happy to give you one.'"" Melanie Wall from Chloe James boutique in St Albans says there's been a ""great reaction"" among her shop's customers. ""People are very happy to wear face masks - it sparks conversation and banter when they come in... we talk about the different styles - it's been really well accepted,"" she said. ""We did have a lady who approached the front door and said, 'I haven't got a face mask but I'm here to buy a face mask'. She obviously couldn't come into  the shop... but I served her from the doorstep, so it was a lovely funny moment."" Melanie Wall said there had been a ""great reaction"" to the rules among her customers Meanwhile, one shopper in the city told the BBC she was ""really pleased"" the rules have come in, adding: ""It's given us more confidence to come into town. We've been avoiding it up to now."" In Leicester - the first city in England to have a local lockdown imposed - the new rules on face coverings came in on the same day some non-essential stores were allowed to reopen. Callum Goodson, 22, a buyer with clothes store Pilot in the Lanes shopping area, said levels of compliance from customers had so far been high. Non-essential shops started to reopen in Leicester on the same day the new rules came in Mr Goodson said: ""Everyone coming into the store have been wearing masks.  If anyone does come in without a mask, we can offer them one. ""If they refuse it's down to us if we accept that - but we haven't had to do that so far."" There were no problems for forgetful shoppers in Bristol either, where city council staff had bought in 80,000 masks to hand out in the city's shopping areas. Face masks were handed out to shoppers in Bristol In Camberwell, not everyone is quite so worried about enforcing the regulations. In a photo-printing shop, the sales assistant says customers have been compliant. They have a stash of reusable masks they can give out in return for a charity donation, but she doesn't know what she'd do if someone refused.  ""I'm sure we could politely tell them to put it on,"" she says. In the arcade, a security guard with a face covering stands outside Poundland. Two women browse the ""two for Â£5"" stands in a nearby clothes shop - both wearing masks, though the shop assistant is barefaced, which is acceptable under the rules. Arjan Patel says most customers have complied Around the corner in a hardware shop, Arjan Patel says some builders have come in without face coverings but most people have been compliant. ""What can we say? It's their choice, isn't it?"" he says. The shop needs customers, after all. ""We can't police it anyway, but maybe a bit more diplomacy might help.""

"Boris Johnson doesn't tend to do remorse. He is fond of looking on the bright side and moving forward. ""Come on! Come on!"" and ""Fantastic, fantastic!"" are the phrases you hear in public most frequently from his mouth. Even some of his allies agree privately with his detractors that he is a politician for the good times, a spreader of cheer, rather than seeming like a statesman for a crisis. That's one reason why the handling of this terrible epidemic has been a profound political challenge for this prime minister, beyond the enormous strain that coronavirus has put on the government machine and his own health. Johnson: We could have done things differently PM promises an independent coronavirus inquiry Boris Johnson: The PM's year in No 10 He moved into No 10 a year ago today, taking charge of a country politically divided over Brexit, with protestors at the gate. But after chucking veteran Tories out of the parliamentary party and suspending Parliament, the first tumultuous phase of his premiership ended with him being clapped back into No 10 for the second time, and with a thumping majority. A pugilistic Downing Street was almost punch drunk with the opportunities that lay before them. But with unbelievable timing, 31 January 2020 - Brexit day - was also the day that the UK confirmed its first cases of coronavirus. Far from the first day of Boris Johnson's dream of raw power, it was the first day of a nightmare for the country's health and economy too. It is the pandemic, therefore, not his hoped-for policies, that have fundamentally shaped Boris Johnson's premiership so far. This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg speaks to Boris Johnson Like other world leaders, he had to take a series of enormous decisions, at huge speed, that have had consequences for each and every one of us. The worst of the health crisis has faded; however, Boris Johnson has shown a profound reluctance to admit mistakes that were made. The government did expand the capacity of the health service at breakneck speed. The Treasury's interventions in the economy have kept millions of people afloat for now. UK scientists are ahead in the world in terms of treatments and vaccine research. But a debate has raged about whether the lockdown came too late. Why was the government slow to ramp up the testing they now say is vital? Why were protections for care homes not introduced much sooner? Why has the death rate here been so much higher than in nearly every other country? Why does the government keep promising 'world beating' this, and 'world beating' that, when the UK's record on handling the pandemic has many flaws? When these questions have come, the prime minister's stock response has been to protest that it is not the right time to look at what went wrong. Time and again, ministers have repeated the mantra that ""we made the right decisions at the right time"". But today, as he reflected on his 366 days in power, Boris Johnson inched towards confronting what went wrong. Ministers have faced criticism over their initial decision to abandon mass community testing. In his first full TV interview since the lockdown, and his own time in hospital, he told me that ministers had not understood the disease ""for the first few weeks and months"", unaware that the virus was already here and in circulation before the government fully realised. And what of the timing of the lockdown? Again, he took a step towards acknowledging that there could have been mistakes, suggesting the lockdown timing was an ""open question"", and that while the government had stuck ""like glue"" to the advice given by its scientists, maybe that advice had been wrong. Despite that change in tone, the prime minister's reluctance to go into detail yet about the mistakes the government might have made is still striking. Advice from his former close adviser Will Walden, who spoke to uson Newscast, is that he should admit mistakes were made, and get on with a proper inquiry into what went wrong, seems to have fallen largely on deaf ears. While the prime minister always says that he takes full responsibility for what the government does, that's perhaps preaching, not practice. Mr Johnson wants to use the government's experience of what happened during the pandemic to speed up his agenda, to ""double down on levelling up"", as he puts it in his peculiar political jargon. In other words, to push ahead with more determination, and less fudge in Whitehall, with the changes that he says will actually improve the lives of voters, particularly those who voted Tory for the first time in 2019. While preparing the NHS for a potential second surge, he clearly wants to concentrate on what's next, not what's gone before. But perhaps until the government is really ready to acknowledge what has happened, the questions will continue - and the public may still feel anxious about whether they can really trust ministers to handle a second surge next time round. Just as 366 days ago, optimism is Boris Johnson's trademark. But if the last few months have shown anything, it is that the real challenge of life in power, is that events that can surprise.

"Tom, centre, and Joe (right) are pictured with their wives after scooping the Powerball jackpot Long-time friends Joe Feeney and Tom Cook made a pact in 1992 - sealed with a handshake - that if one of them won the US Powerball lottery they would share it. Nearly 30 years later the numbers came up for Tom - and he honoured the deal. Joe said he was stunned when his friend called to say they were sharing the $22m (Â£17m) jackpot. ""He called me and I said, 'are you jerking my bobber?'"" said the keen fisherman. The two men live in the Menomonie area of the US state of Wisconsin.

"Face coverings are now compulsory for customers in shops in England, after new coronavirus rules came into force within 12 hours of the government issuing guidance on the change. Coverings are mandatory in enclosed public spaces such as supermarkets, indoor shopping centres, transport hubs, banks and takeaways. Police can hand out fines of up to Â£100 to those who do not comply. But some retailers have insisted they will not enforce the rule. The deaths of another 123 people in the UK who have tested positive for Covid-19 been announced, taking the number to have died to 45,677. There were also a further 770 cases confirmed through testing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government's ability to ease social-distancing measures and face-mask rules depended on it being able to drive down the level of the virus. ""The message is - we have done very well, the virus is under control to a very large extent but it is still there,"" he said during a visit to a GP surgery. He said he believed the UK would be ""well past"" coronavirus by the middle of next year, saying: ""We have tough times ahead in coming through economically, but I have absolutely no doubt that we are going to, and this country is going to bounce back stronger than ever before."" Costa Coffee said their staff would not challenge customers who entered their stores without masks. Sainsbury's also said that staff members would not be individually responsible for challenging customers - but added that stores would have regular Tannoy announcements asking customers to follow the new rules. Asda said enforcement was the ""responsibility of the relevant authorities"". Waitrose has positioned staff at shop doors reminding customers of the rule, and Tesco is selling face coverings at store entrances. Greggs and McDonalds say takeaway customers need to wear masks.

But the government says it was the responsibility of individuals to wear a covering.

This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Police will be able to ""use force"" to remove customers from shops if they do not wear face coverings, or to prevent them from entering, according to the College of Policing. Butindividual forces have saidthey will only be enforcing the rules, including issuing fines, as a last resort - and officers will not be patrolling premises. Health Minister Helen Whately said the government was confident ""the vast majority of people"" would comply with the regulations. In Scotland, where face coverings in shops became compulsory on 10 July,one person has been finedfor failing to wear one. Can police make me wear a face mask or covering? There are exemptions to the new rules for children under 11, those with disabilities or certain health conditions, such as respiratory or cognitive impairments that make it difficult for them to wear a face covering. Ms Whately said people could print outa card from the government's website,externalto show they were exempt if they wished, but stressed people would not be expected to carry proof of an exemption. Public Health England has warned parents not to buy coverings for babies and young children because of the risk of choking or suffocation. Masks will not be mandatory in indoor venues that have other safety measures in place, including: Eat-in restaurants Pubs Hairdressers and salons Gyms and leisure centres Cinemas, concert halls and theatres Visitor attractions such as museums Libraries For some people with certain health conditions or disabilities, wearing a mask can be more difficult. Kerise Vowles-Myners, who has autism, had a particularly bad experience when she tried wearing one to visit the doctor last week. ""I literally had it on for two minutes and had a panic attack and threw up in public - it was quite embarrassing,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Kerise said she had spoken to her social worker about going shopping for her when she had bad days. ""I don't like being confronted because I have to explain myself,"" she said. ""Whenever I go out, a lot of people don't even realise that I'm on the spectrum so they just look at me and think, 'Oh she is just a normal person, why is she not wearing a mask?'"" Retail and trade organisations have criticised the government over the time it took to publish guidance on masks - after thechanges were announced 10 days ago. Meanwhile, union leaders voiced fears the rules could put workers' safety at risk if people refused to wear a mask or became abusive. The British Retail Consortium called on customers to be ""respectful"" of the new rules, while UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said takeaway outlets had been left with ""a very short time to properly brief staff, prepare signage and take steps to encourage compliance"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? According to the government,,externalface coverings should cover the mouth and nose and can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that securely fits around the side of the face without having to be held in place. The requirement to wear face coverings at transport hubs - railway and bus stations, airports and maritime ports - only applies for areas which are fully indoors and enclosed. You are allowed to remove a face covering in certain situations, for example to prove identification in banks or when buying age-restricted products. Face coverings have been compulsory in shops in Scotland since 10 July. Shoppers are not currently required to wear them in Wales or Northern Ireland, althoughNI will wait until 20 August before decidingwhether to make them compulsory. Coverings are already compulsory on public transport in England and Scotland, as well as most buses, trains and ferries in Northern Ireland. They will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July.

"The prime minister is set to announce new measures to curb obesity next week, and they are expected to include a ban on TV junk food adverts before 21:00. It comes amid growing evidence people who are overweight or obese are at greater risk from coronavirus. The measures are yet to be finalised but are also likely to include a ban on online ads for unhealthy foods, and limits on in-store promotions. One food industry leader said it was a ""slap in the face"". The move marks a change in stance by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and described his views on tackling obesity as ""libertarian"". Mr Johnson's experience in intensive care during his treatment for Covid-19 is thought to have contributed to his changing position. Speaking during a visit to a GP surgery in east London, he said that while he was not normally one for ""nannying or bossying"", the country did need to lose weight to protect from a second spike. He said: ""Obesity is one of the real co-morbidity factors. Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus."" Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? Does being overweight or obese affect how ill people get with coronavirus? Obesity study shows increased disease and death risks Obesity strategies have had a chequered recent history. David Cameron, backed by NHS leaders, was all set to unveil wide-ranging curbs on food marketing and advertising in England in the summer of 2016. Then he abruptly left office and his successor Theresa May watered down or ditched most of the ideas. Two years later she had changed her view, and her Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans to ban fast food advertising before the 21:00 TV watershed and prevent supermarkets from promoting unhealthy food products in stores. These plans were put out to consultation but were left in limbo when Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street a year ago. His comments about the ""continuing creep of the nanny state"" and the need for a review of ""sin taxes"" were taken to mean he was against further intervention on people's diet choices. But he has shifted, and most of the 2018 plan now seems set to be implemented. It could have been enacted by now but, whatever the timing, the measures - including sweeping changes to the way food is advertised, are a significant move to tackle one of the biggest health challenges of our times. Ministers are still finalising the detail of some anti-obesity measures, such as whether to require more prominent labelling of food and drinks with high levels of sugar or salt. Some restaurants could be required to put calorie labels on menus. It is thought Mr Johnson is likely to push ahead with advertising restrictions, and is considering banning in-store promotions of unhealthy foods. BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo said: ""Although it goes against his political instincts, Boris Johnson now wants to give the strategy a renewed push. ""He's previously been sceptical of taxes on unhealthy food and drinks and it's not yet clear how far his proposals will go beyond what's been suggested before. ""Though obesity is linked to a whole host of health problems, the prime minister has clearly been prompted into action by the coronavirus connection."" Tim Rycroft, chief operating officer of the Food and Drink Federation, said the rumoured move was a ""slap in the face"" to the food industry, which he said had worked ""heroically"" to keep the nation fed during the pandemic. ""It is going to ban promotions of food 10 days before the chancellor launches the biggest food promotion the country has ever seen,"" he told Today. ""It is going to put enormous costs on the advertising industry and on broadcasters at a time when the economy is in quite a tenuous situation."" A letter from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising sent to the prime minister said a government impact assessment last year showed a 21:00 watershed on high fat, sugar and salt food and drinks would only remove around 1.7 calories per day from a child's diet - the equivalent of half a Smartie. In the letter, director general Paul Bainsfair wrote: ""The introduction of such a draconian measure at this time could have deep repercussions for agencies and the advertising sector, generally, in terms of jobs and creative output, for very little end result."" Health and Social Care Minister Helen Whately told BBC Breakfast an announcement was due ""imminently"". She said she recognised obesity was ""possibly the greatest health challenge"" the country faced - ""particularly with Covid"". Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed the prime minister's experience in St Thomas's hospital had been a ""game changer"" and that it was understood the aim was to get people to lose weight ""prior to the next spike"". He said: ""There hasn't been a ban like this but it has got to be given a try - and if after a period of time it is shown not to be so effective, then maybe it will stop. ""It is indeed a risk but the problem is that the consequence of obesity is so great that risks and daring measures have to be put in place."" He called for the sugar tax on soft drinks to be extended to other products. The NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese.

"The prime minister is set to announce new measures to curb obesity next week, and they are expected to include a ban on TV junk food adverts before 21:00. It comes amid growing evidence people who are overweight or obese are at greater risk from coronavirus. The measures are yet to be finalised but are also likely to include a ban on online ads for unhealthy foods, and limits on in-store promotions. One food industry leader said it was a ""slap in the face"". The move marks a change in stance by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and described his views on tackling obesity as ""libertarian"". Mr Johnson's experience in intensive care during his treatment for Covid-19 is thought to have contributed to his changing position. Speaking during a visit to a GP surgery in east London, he said that while he was not normally one for ""nannying or bossying"", the country did need to lose weight to protect from a second spike. He said: ""Obesity is one of the real co-morbidity factors. Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus."" Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? Does being overweight or obese affect how ill people get with coronavirus? Obesity study shows increased disease and death risks Obesity strategies have had a chequered recent history. David Cameron, backed by NHS leaders, was all set to unveil wide-ranging curbs on food marketing and advertising in England in the summer of 2016. Then he abruptly left office and his successor Theresa May watered down or ditched most of the ideas. Two years later she had changed her view, and her Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans to ban fast food advertising before the 21:00 TV watershed and prevent supermarkets from promoting unhealthy food products in stores. These plans were put out to consultation but were left in limbo when Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street a year ago. His comments about the ""continuing creep of the nanny state"" and the need for a review of ""sin taxes"" were taken to mean he was against further intervention on people's diet choices. But he has shifted, and most of the 2018 plan now seems set to be implemented. It could have been enacted by now but, whatever the timing, the measures - including sweeping changes to the way food is advertised, are a significant move to tackle one of the biggest health challenges of our times. Ministers are still finalising the detail of some anti-obesity measures, such as whether to require more prominent labelling of food and drinks with high levels of sugar or salt. Some restaurants could be required to put calorie labels on menus. It is thought Mr Johnson is likely to push ahead with advertising restrictions, and is considering banning in-store promotions of unhealthy foods. BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo said: ""Although it goes against his political instincts, Boris Johnson now wants to give the strategy a renewed push. ""He's previously been sceptical of taxes on unhealthy food and drinks and it's not yet clear how far his proposals will go beyond what's been suggested before. ""Though obesity is linked to a whole host of health problems, the prime minister has clearly been prompted into action by the coronavirus connection."" Tim Rycroft, chief operating officer of the Food and Drink Federation, said the rumoured move was a ""slap in the face"" to the food industry, which he said had worked ""heroically"" to keep the nation fed during the pandemic. ""It is going to ban promotions of food 10 days before the chancellor launches the biggest food promotion the country has ever seen,"" he told Today. ""It is going to put enormous costs on the advertising industry and on broadcasters at a time when the economy is in quite a tenuous situation."" A letter from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising sent to the prime minister said a government impact assessment last year showed a 21:00 watershed on high fat, sugar and salt food and drinks would only remove around 1.7 calories per day from a child's diet - the equivalent of half a Smartie. In the letter, director general Paul Bainsfair wrote: ""The introduction of such a draconian measure at this time could have deep repercussions for agencies and the advertising sector, generally, in terms of jobs and creative output, for very little end result."" Health and Social Care Minister Helen Whately told BBC Breakfast an announcement was due ""imminently"". She said she recognised obesity was ""possibly the greatest health challenge"" the country faced - ""particularly with Covid"". Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed the prime minister's experience in St Thomas's hospital had been a ""game changer"" and that it was understood the aim was to get people to lose weight ""prior to the next spike"". He said: ""There hasn't been a ban like this but it has got to be given a try - and if after a period of time it is shown not to be so effective, then maybe it will stop. ""It is indeed a risk but the problem is that the consequence of obesity is so great that risks and daring measures have to be put in place."" He called for the sugar tax on soft drinks to be extended to other products. The NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese. Another measure of excess fat is waist size - men with a waist of 94cm or more and women with a waist of 80cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related problems.

In June, the town hadEngland's sixth-highest infection ratebut while rates are declining, the latest figures show twice as many cases as the previous week. The council said the decision was due to indoor facilities being ""more susceptible to the virus being spread"". It said they would reopen when they are ""safe and viable"". David PittamBBC News Online Shoppers in the first city in England to
have a local lockdown have been grappling with new rules on masks as
non-essential stores were given the green light to reopen. Clothes shops were among those
allowed to welcome back customers in Leicester today, following the relaxation
of local measures imposed on 29 June after a spike in coronavirus infections in the city. Security on the door of the city's
Primark store made sure shoppers entering wore face coverings, which became mandatory across England today. Melinda Moore, 25, said she ""absolutely hates"" wearing the mask. She said: ""I've got to wear one at work and now out of it too."" Waad Ekwas, 22, from Hamilton, said the mask was inconvenient on a warm day when she was already wearing a headscarf. ""It's so annoying,"" she said. ""But we have to wear it. We know it's not protecting us but it's stopping any droplets spreading. That's a priority over comfort."" In Liverpool One shopping complex on Friday, signs telling customers to wear masks were up in many of the stores and a vending machine selling face coverings had been installed. The machine has packs of five three-ply masks for Â£4.75, packets of two for Â£1.95 or fashion coverings for Â£5.95. Susan Green, 57, from Liverpool, was wearing a clear visor, which she had bought from a nearby shop, as she waited for HMV to open. She said: ""I think it is a little bit late to have introduced this and lots of people I've seen this morning are not even wearing one. ""It won't put me off coming to the shops because I'll be out anyway but it does seem a bit unnecessary."" Rob EnglandBBC News A further 16 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, according to NHS figures. This brings the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,247. NHS England said the patients were aged between 58 and 104 years old and all had known underlying health conditions. No deaths were reported in the East of England, London and South West regions. The prime minister is set to announce new measures to curb obesity next week, and they are expected to include a ban on TV junk food adverts before 21:00. It comes amid growing evidence people who are overweight or obese are at greater risk from coronavirus. The measures are yet to be finalised but are also likely to include a ban on online ads for unhealthy foods, and limits on in-store promotions. One food industry leader said it was a ""slap in the face"". A minibus carrying food packaging workers has been identified as the source of a coronavirus outbreak. Fourteen staff at Evesham Vale Growers Limited in Worcestershire tested positivefor Covid-19 since Monday. Public Health officials have now traced the cases to a minibus which transported workers from Sandwell, where another outbreak was identified. All 340 staff at the plant are now being tested for the virus, with results expected over the weekend. Judith Molloy, from St Helens, was wearing a mask as she did some shopping in Liverpool One this morning. ""I'm vulnerable and so is my husband. I think this should have started from day one,"" she said. The 72-year-old added she'd seen many people around without maskson the first day they became mandatory to wear in shops. ""I was on the bus this morning and people were getting on with no masks. If you go in to a shop without a mask I don't think anyone is going to say anything. ""I think people are more relaxed now."" A charity is due to close after the coronavirus crisis ""compounded"" its ""financial challenges"". Age UK Suffolk's services cost Â£2m a year to run but it has seen a fall in fundraising and paid for services during the pandemic. It said a full review of what it offers had ""not been enough to fully mitigate"" these effects and 145 staff were being made redundant on Friday. The county council said it would ""help to ensure the essential gap is filled"". In Leicester,where non-essential shops have been able to openafter a local lockdown was imposed, eager shoppersare also having to handle the new rules on face coverings. Returning from a visit to the post office, student Frank Boakye said he'd been opting to wear a mask since lockdown began ""for my own protection"". ""Everyone I saw in the post office was wearing a mask,"" the 29-year-old said. ""It's a very good idea."" Callum Goodson, a buyer with independent clothes store Pilot, in the busy Lanes shopping district of Leicester said levels of compliance from customers on mask-wearing rules had been high in the city so far. The 22-year-old said: ""Everyone coming into the store and staff have been wearing masks. If anyone does come in without a mask, we can offer them one. If they refuse it's down to us if we accept that - but we haven't had to do that so far."" On a visit to a GP surgery, Boris Johnson has called people who oppose vaccinations ""nuts"". During the visit, he told reporters that one of the best ways people can safeguard themselves against coronavirus is to lose some weight.

"Most people in England, about 30 million, are to be offered a free flu vaccine this year, the government says. It is to prepare for a winter that could see the annual flu season coincide with a surge in coronavirus. The NHS flu programme will add all over-50s, people shielding and those who live with them and children in their first year of secondary school. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he wanted ""everyone to have a flu jab in the run up to this winter"". He said it was important to ""protect the NHS in the winter months because we've still got Covid and the threat of a second spike of Covid, and its vital therefore to keep that pressure off the NHS by everybody getting a flu jab."" Flu, which can be deadly or need hospital treatment, poses additional threats during the pandemic: There is some evidence a double infection with coronavirus and flu is more deadly than either alone A big flu season combined with coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals If lots of NHS or care-home staff are sick with flu, then it may not be possible to respond to Covid-19 in the same way as during the peak in spring. But it is impossible to predict how big a flu season we will have. Australia, which is currently in its winter, is either having a very mild or very late flu season. Social-distancing and hygiene measures in place to stop coronavirus should, in theory, also have an impact on the amount of flu going around. people who were required toshield from coronavirusand anyone they live with people withsome medical conditions,externalincluding diabetes, heart failure and asthma pregnant women pre-school children over the age of two all primary school children, as last year, and, for the first time, Year 7 pupils initially all people over 65, before the programme is extended to the over-50s The NHS will get in contact with those who are eligible. It wants to ensure the highest risk patients are at the front of the queue when the immunisation programme starts in September. Those aged 50-64 will be offered the jab later, with the full details still to be announced. Last year, around 15 million people in England were vaccinated as part of the NHS campaign, far fewer than the 25 million who were invited to have it. This year more than 30m doses have been ordered. The vaccine will also be available privately in pharmacies and some supermarkets to adults who are not eligible for an NHS jab. It usually costs around Â£20. A Scottish government spokesperson said it was ""examining the best options"" for expanding eligibility for its flu vaccine programme which would be set out when it had ""confidence that there is adequate supply of vaccines in order to delivery on any commitments we make"". Plans for Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet been announced. The symptoms of flu include a fever and a dry cough. By now this should sound familiar - as they are the key signs of Covid-19 too. Other symptoms such as fatigue, aches, a sore throat or headaches are also shared by both infections. And there are also other winter viruses, such as rhinovirus and RSV, that can also lead to similar symptoms. This could create a problem come winter - as far more people would need testing to work out whether they have had coronavirus and their contacts needed tracing. This is why the government has already announced plans to increase testing capacity to half a million a day. Today's announcement on vaccines aims to suppress the flu season so numbers are as low as possible. GP Dr William Bird, an expert on preventative health, told BBC Breakfast it was right to offer the flu jab more widely, but that logistics would be a big problem. He said flu clinics were already run like a ""military operation"" with people ""bunched together"" - and social distancing would complicate matters. Children are given the flu vaccine with a nasal spray, while adults have a jab Plans are also being put together for ensuring coronavirus does not disrupt vaccination by, for example, causing schools, which deliver the childhood programme, to shut. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical advisor, said: ""This winter more than ever, with Covid-19 still circulating, we need to help reduce all avoidable risks. ""Vaccinating more people will help reduce flu transmission and stop people becoming ill."" Children are ""super-spreaders"" of the flu virus, but the expansion of the childhood programme had not been anticipated before the pandemic. The plan had been to assess the impact of vaccinating all primary school children, achieved for the first time last year, before deciding what to do next. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Meanwhile, there will be a renewed push to persuade health and care workers to have the vaccine. Last year,74% of staff,externalwere immunised. Paulette Hamilton, from the Local Government Association, said: ""Extending the free winter flu jab to as many people as possible is essential if we are to tackle two potentially deadly viruses head-on and prevent one seasonable and predictable virus creating the conditions for a second, more serious and unpredictable deadly second wave of Covid-19. ""It is absolutely critical that all our health and care workers get themselves vaccinated, to protect both themselves and the people they look after, including our elderly and most vulnerable, from a potentially devastating second wave of infections.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: We followed scientific advice Boris Johnson has admitted the government did not understand coronavirus during the ""first few weeks and months"" of the UK outbreak. The PM told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg there were ""very open questions"" about whether the lockdown had started too late. Mr Johnson also spoke of ""lessons to be learned"" and said ministers could have done some things ""differently"". Labour accused the government of ""mishandling"" the crisis. More than 45,000 peoplein the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus, government figures show, with almost 300,000 cases confirmed. Last week, Mr Johnsonpromised an ""independent"" inquiryinto the pandemic, but no details have been given of its scope or timing. Boris Johnson's year in No 10 How is the PM doing? Johnson's battles PM to target junk food ads in obesity crackdown Previously, the prime minister has said he took the ""right decisions at the right time"", based on the advice of scientists. But, in an interview with Laura Kuenssberg to mark the first anniversary of his entering Downing Street, he said: ""We didn't understand [the virus] in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months. ""And I think, probably, the single thing that we didn't see at the beginning was the extent to which it was being transmitted asymptomatically from person to person."" Mr Johnson wants to use the government's experience of what happened during the pandemic to speed up his agenda, to ""double down on levelling up"", as he puts it in his peculiar political jargon. In other words, to push ahead with more determination, and less fudge in Whitehall, with the changes that he says will actually improve the lives of voters, particularly those who voted Tory for the first time in 2019. While preparing the NHS for a potential second surge, he clearly wants to concentrate on what's next, not what's gone before. But perhaps until the government is really ready to acknowledge what has happened, the questions will continue - and the public may still feel anxious about whether they can really trust ministers to handle a second surge next time round. Just as 366 days ago, optimism is Boris Johnson's trademark. But if the last few months have shown anything, it is that the real challenge of life in power, is that events that can surprise. Read Laura's full blog The prime minister added: ""I think it's fair to say that there are things that we need to learn about how we handled it in the early stages...There will be plenty of opportunities to learn the lessons of what happened."" The UK went intofull lockdown in late March, which critics say was too late and cost lives. Mr Johnson said: ""Maybe there were things we could have done differently, and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done differently."" Boris Johnson was himself diagnosed with coronavirus in March He added that these were still ""very open questions as far as [scientists] are concerned, and there will be a time, obviously, to consider all those issues"". On Friday, the government announced that30 million people in England would be offered a flu vaccinethis year, to reduce pressure on the NHS in case of a surge in coronavirus infections during the autumn and winter. Mr Johnson said this was in addition to increased testing and tracing and more procurement of personal protective equipment, adding: ""What people really want to focus on now is what are we doing to prepare for the next phase."" He said: ""We mourn every one of those who lost their lives and our thoughts are very much with their families. And I take full responsibility for everything that government did."" The prime minister, who was himself placed in intensive care in April after contracting coronavirus, said he would ""very soon"" set outnew measures to deal with obesity,seen as an added risk factor for patients. In December, Mr Johnson's Conservative Party pulled off a convincing general election win over Jeremy Corbyn's Labour, after promising to ""level up"" all parts of the UK. And, despite the economic damage caused by coronavirus in the past four months or so, the prime minister promised more nurses, doctors, hospitals and police, saying his government's priorities were ""exactly what they always have been, except more so. We're doubling down."" ""The agenda is what it was when I stood on the steps of Downing Street a year ago, but we want to go further and we want to go faster."" Mr Johnson reminisced about first entering No 10 as prime minister on 24 July 2019, saying it ""was very exciting, and everybody seemed to be in a very good mood"" and ""happy, upbeat"". He added that coronavirus had caused many ""difficulties"" since then. This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg speaks to Boris Johnson ""Psychologically it's been an extraordinary time for the country,"" Mr Johnson said. ""But I also know that this is a nation with incredible natural resilience, and fortitude and imagination. And I think we will bounce back really much stronger than ever before."" For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Boris Johnson has finally admitted the government has mishandled its response to the coronavirus. ""It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown and too slow to take this crisis seriously."" The threat of a second wave of infections was ""still very real"", he added, while it was ""imperative the government learns the lessons of its mistakes so we can help to save lives"". Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said an ""immediate"" coronavirus inquiry was ""essential"", and that the prime minister had shown ""no remorse"" for his ""catastrophic mistakes"".

"It is one year since Boris Johnson became the prime minister of the UK. And it wasn't 12 months he - or any of us - could easily forget. On the anniversary of his premiership, we take a look at some of the most defining and controversial moments so far. In pictures: Johnson replaces May as PM Boris Johnson's battles Johnson's track record The country was following every twist and turn, watching Brexit votes and key decisions unfold in Parliament. But whenMr Johnson came to power on 24 July 2019, his first task was getting to grips with Brexit - and following through with his plan, to ditch his predecessor Theresa May's deal and renegotiate with Brussels. All sides of the Brexit argument took to the streets When he took the reins, the deadline for leaving the EU was 31 October, and he condemned the ""the doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters"" who didn't think an agreement was possible by then. But protesters for both Leave and Remain swarmed around the House of Commons, he barely had a majority in Parliament and there were more rebels on his benches than John Bercow's daily ""order!"" tally. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I'd rather be dead in a ditch"" than ask for Brexit delay Mr Johnson managed to secure a new deal with the bloc - minus the Irish backstop. But it tookwithdrawing the whip from 21 of his own MPs, multiple failed votes in the Commons, anunsuccessful Saturday sitting, having to request an extension he'd rather ""die in a ditch"" than ask for, and, eventually, an election to get it passed. The UK left the EU on 31 Januaryand in March, the trade negotiations between the two sides began, with another deadline of the end of the year to contend with. As if there wasn't enough argument amongst MPs, the PM set off more fireworks early on in his tenure. While Westminster was on its summer break in August, Mr Johnson announcedhe planned to prorogue Parliamentwithin days of its return in September until 14 October. This video can not be played Some MPs voiced their objection to the suspension in the Commons He said it would allow him to come back with a Queen's Speech and outline his ""very exciting agenda"" as the new man at No 10. But MPs criticised the lengthy closure, accusing him of avoiding scrutiny, knowing it would only give them two weeks to pass proposed legislation preventing a no-deal Brexit. Rows broke out, the Speaker got involved, and eventually the whole decision ended up in the Supreme Court, leading toLady Hale ruling Mr Johnson's action as ""unlawful"". Protesters rallied in Parliament Square against the prorogation MPs came back to the Commons and got their no-deal blocking law, but Mr Johnson also got his Queen's Speech, with his plans laid for his time in Downing Street. Who would have thought another Queen's Speech was only two months away... Another issue which cropped up throughout the first few months of Mr Johnson's leadership was when he would call an election. The Tory majority was slim, and in order to achieve his plans, he would need the backing of the Commons. The numbers in the Commons were not in the PM's favour before the election But with prominent rebels scattered over his benches and a failing partnership with the DUP, it seemed impossible to garner support. Within days of getting the keys to No 10, Mr Johnsonruled out a pre-Brexit election, saying voters wanted him to ""deliver on their mandate"" to exit the EU, not head back to the polls. But failing to get his newly-negotiated deal through led to a change in approach from the PM. He took to the dispatch box three times to call for an election. But under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, he needed two thirds of the Commons to agree. On the fourth attempt, havingwritten to the EU to ask for an extensionto the Brexit deadline, he got what he wanted andan election date was set for 12 December- the first December election since 1923. Boris Johnson introduced his campaign slogan in a novel way Five weeks of campaigning began and the parties' policies were announced: the Tory's mantra of ""Get Brexit Done"" vied with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour calling to renegotiate the deal under their leadership - before putting it to a confirmatory referendum - and the Liberal Democrats promising to revoke the decision to leave the bloc altogether. Cue head-to-head debates, cheering (and booing) crowds, and at one point, even a JCB digger being driven through a wall. But on the night, Mr Johnson came home with a huge - by recent standards -80-strong majority, securing his spot as prime minister, heralding the end of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour party, and the end of the UK's membership of the EU. While much of the prime minister's first six months were dominated - as expected - by Brexit, he, the country, and the world, were in for a shock. A few cases of Covid-19 had made their way into the UK in early 2020, but by March, Mr Johnson was addressing the nation, telling them tostay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You must stay at home"" He came in for some criticism for not locking down the country earlier - and for some poorly chosen words on shaking people's hands - but everything changed when, within days of the announcement, the PM himselftested positive for the virus. Soon Mr Johnson was in hospital, and subsequently wasmoved into intensive care. He began to recover and was moved out of the ICU. And after a few weeks recuperating at Chequers, he was back in the hot seat in Downing Street, relieving his stand-in, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. The PM was isolating and working from home after he tested positive for coronavirus Back in charge, Mr Johnson faced questions over his decisions in tackling the outbreak. There may have been praise for the establishment of the Nightingale hospitals, the sourcing of ventilators and the introduction of a furlough scheme for workers. But there was criticism too - over failed testing targets, strategies for care homes and missing supplies of PPE. Criticism too, for Mr Johnson's decisionto stand by his top aide, Dominic Cummings. Dominic Cummings gave a press conference to explain his trip to County Durham during lockdown Mr Cummings waswidely criticised for travelling to County Durham from London at the height of the pandemicwhile he and his wife had the virus. Lockdown measures may be easing, but coronavirus will dominate politics for the foreseeable future. While coronavirus has, understandably, been the leading issue in Westminster and beyond in recent months, it has not been the only problem on Mr Johnson's desk. Back in February, the prime minister wasaccused of ""hiding"" when severe flooding hit several parts of the UK, and action had to be taken to help struggling communities. The PM had some awkward encounters when he visited flood affected areas HS2 also became another hot potato for the PM, as hedecided to back the projectdespite dismay from some in his own party. And the issue of Chinese telecoms firm Huawei heated up debate within Conservative circles again. Mr Johnson gave the green light to using the company's equipment in the UK's future 5G network back in January, albeit with limited market share. But this was not enough for some vocal backbenchers, and eventually there was a change of tack by the PM. The UK has now ruled out buying any of the firm's equipmentfor the network after the end of this year and is forcing mobile providers to remove all of its 5G kit from their networks by 2027. The decision around Huawei has been a major test for Boris Johnson There have also been rumblings about Mr Cummings and his plans to shake up Whitehall, after a number of senior civil servants announced they would step down from their roles this year. Four figures have announced their exit in six months, and the most senior, Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, saw his role split, as he was replaced as national security advisor by a political appointee, chief Brexit negotiator David Frost. The most recent controversy, of course, is the release of the Intelligence and Security Committee's report into Russian influence in the UK. Boris Johnson was accused of holding up the report on Russian interference The report claimedthe UK was ""playing catch-up"" in face of the threatand had not investigated alleged interference in the 2016 EU referendum. Mr Johnson was accused of sitting on the report for months and preventing its release ahead of the general election - as well as coming under fire forkicking the committee's new chair out of the parliamentary Tory partyafter he won the position ahead of No 10's alleged preferred candidate, Chris Grayling. But the PM has dismissed the accusations, promising to update security laws and tackle the Russia threat head on. It wasn't just political storylines that dominated the last year for Boris Johnson. When he moved into No 10 last July, he was accompanied by his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, making them the first unmarried couple to ever live at the famous address. The couple were pictured together at the Tory Party conference Mr Johnson and his second wife, Marina Wheeler, hadannounced their split in September 2018and were in the process of getting a divorce when he became leader. The pair got their first pet together, a dog called Dilyn. Boris Johnson and Dilyn pose for pictures together But come February, the couple announced they were engaged and Ms Symonds was expecting their first child. At the start of May, Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas was born, named after their grandfathers and two doctors who treated Mr Johnson while he was in hospital with coronavirus. Soon after the birth, Mr Johnson and Ms Wheeler's divorce was finalised. The couple took part in a video call with midwives after the birth of their son The PM also faced questions about his relationship with another woman,US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. There were accusations she had received special treatment from him while he was Mayor of London and that the pair's relationship went beyond that of friends. However, Mr Johnson denied the claims and said everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". Remember, under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, Mr Johnson has five years in charge of No 10 - unless two thirds of the Commons votes for an election. As he has said, ""we are not out of the woods yet"", when it comes to coronavirus, and he has confirmed there will be an inquiry. The economy has taken a massive hit, and questions keep on coming about how all the extra borrowing his government has undertaken will be paid back. And, on top of this,post-Brexit trade talks with the EU are ongoing. There will be plenty more action in Downing Street for Boris Johnson So, watch this space for more drama in Boris Johnson's tenure.

"UK retail sales were near pre-lockdown levels in June, as the reopening of shops released pent-up demand. The amount of goods sold last month increased by 13.9% compared to May,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS),external. Separately, a closely watched survey showed that activity in the UK's services and manufacturing sectors returned to growth last month. However, economists warned that the country's recovery would take time. June's rise in retail sales followed record falls in April and a partial recovery in May as the coronavirus pandemic led to widespread shop closures. But it masked ""big changes"" in retail, with food and online sales up, while clothing was still ""struggling"", the ONS said. Online sales continued to go ""from strength to strength"", the ONS added, accounting for Â£3 out of every Â£10 spent by consumers. Demand at food stores remained strong, hitting new highs for the lockdown period. Compared with February, the volume of food sales was 5.3% higher while non-store retailing grew by 53.6%. The ONS said the rebound had brought overall retail sales back to a similar level to where they were pre-lockdown, but there was a ""mixed picture"" in different store types. In June, non-food stores, including department stores and clothes shops, partially recovered from strong falls during the lockdown but were still 15% lower than in February. Non-essential shops in England were not allowed to reopen until 15 June, so they were only trading for half the month. New face covering rules come into force in England 'They said I'd be cleaning toilets so I quit' Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician, told the BBC that there had been ""some really big changes under the surface"" of the retail landscape since lockdown began. ""Food shops continue to do quite well, as we're eating at home more,"" he said. ""But the real growth has been in online sales. Online sales continue to go from strength to strength."" Britain's nation of shoppers has come to the fore. The amount of what we buy is virtually back to pre-crisis levels - but that doesn't signal a wider full bounce-back in our economic fortunes. This is for a couple of reasons. Firstly, what we buy has changed: more online, more staples, fewer impulse forays onto the High Street. While there was an initial flurry in sales of clothing and household goods immediately after non-essential shops opened in June, more timely data on payments suggested that tailed off in July. The fallout can be seen in the mounting job losses announced by stalwarts, from John Lewis to M&S. Secondly, retail sales are only part of the recovery jigsaw, totalling about a fifth of the economy. Factories and building sites are coming back to life. But the big unknown is spending on services such as restaurants, bars and hotels - so-called ""social spending"". Even with eating out vouchers and VAT cuts, a full and rapid recovery there seems unlikely. And it is these sectors that have suffered most and have furloughed the vast majority of their staff. Their future will hinge on how spending convalesces there. Mr Athow said some sectors were ""struggling"". ""Some of that is due to the restrictions, which were only relaxed part-way through June in England. Clothing is down by about a third. ""And if you look at the High Street more generally, sales in the High Street, or physical shops, are also down by about a third."" Clothing sales did rise 70% month-on-month in June, but from a very low base, meaning that they are still well below pre-lockdown levels. Mr Athow said they had fallen so far that ""virtually any pick-up will look like a big number"". The proportion of online spending reduced to 31.8% in June from the record 33.3% reported in May, but was well up on the 20% reported in February, said the ONS. Meanwhile, a survey measuring new orders, employment and business sentiment in the services and manufacturing sectors indicated a return to growth during June. The ""flash"" - or preliminary -Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI),external, compiled by IHS Markit and CIPS, rose to 57.1 in July, up sharply from 47.7 last month. It was the first time since February that it was above 50, indicating expansion. However, Markit's chief business economist, Chris Williamson, cautioned: ""While the recession looks to have been brief, the scars are likely to be deep."" One businesswoman who has taken advantage of the move to online shopping is Hellen Stirling-Baker of Small Stuff, a Sheffield-based independent retailer. She sells sustainably made toys, gifts and homewares for young children. ""Driving my store online is how I have been able to survive,"" she said. ""Offering face-to-face video calling for customers to recreate the in-store experience has been crucial and sales are picking up. ""I've also added new services such as local delivery by hand, which really boost engagement."" Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at Equals Money, said the retail sector had seen a ""V-shaped recovery"", echoingremarks by the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane. ""The motto of the British consumer has long been 'When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping' and it seems like June encapsulated that well,"" he added. Silvia Rindone, retail partner at EY, said the latest figures showed there was ""some hope on the horizon"", with consumers beginning to show ""a cautious optimism"". But she added: ""We're still not past the pandemic and getting back to 'normal' will still take time.

The council said the decision was due to indoor facilities being ""more susceptible to the virus being spread"". It said they would reopen when they are ""safe and viable"". David PittamBBC News Online Shoppers in the first city in England to
have a local lockdown have been grappling with new rules on masks as
non-essential stores were given the green light to reopen. Clothes shops were among those
allowed to welcome back customers in Leicester today, following the relaxation
of local measures imposed on 29 June after a spike in coronavirus infections in the city. Security on the door of the city's
Primark store made sure shoppers entering wore face coverings, which became mandatory across England today. Melinda Moore, 25, said she ""absolutely hates"" wearing the mask. She said: ""I've got to wear one at work and now out of it too."" Waad Ekwas, 22, from Hamilton, said the mask was inconvenient on a warm day when she was already wearing a headscarf. ""It's so annoying,"" she said. ""But we have to wear it. We know it's not protecting us but it's stopping any droplets spreading. That's a priority over comfort."" In Liverpool One shopping complex on Friday, signs telling customers to wear masks were up in many of the stores and a vending machine selling face coverings had been installed. The machine has packs of five three-ply masks for Â£4.75, packets of two for Â£1.95 or fashion coverings for Â£5.95. Susan Green, 57, from Liverpool, was wearing a clear visor, which she had bought from a nearby shop, as she waited for HMV to open. She said: ""I think it is a little bit late to have introduced this and lots of people I've seen this morning are not even wearing one. ""It won't put me off coming to the shops because I'll be out anyway but it does seem a bit unnecessary."" Rob EnglandBBC News A further 16 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, according to NHS figures. This brings the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,247. NHS England said the patients were aged between 58 and 104 years old and all had known underlying health conditions. No deaths were reported in the East of England, London and South West regions. The prime minister is set to announce new measures to curb obesity next week, and they are expected to include a ban on TV junk food adverts before 21:00. It comes amid growing evidence people who are overweight or obese are at greater risk from coronavirus. The measures are yet to be finalised but are also likely to include a ban on online ads for unhealthy foods, and limits on in-store promotions. One food industry leader said it was a ""slap in the face"". A minibus carrying food packaging workers has been identified as the source of a coronavirus outbreak. Fourteen staff at Evesham Vale Growers Limited in Worcestershire tested positivefor Covid-19 since Monday. Public Health officials have now traced the cases to a minibus which transported workers from Sandwell, where another outbreak was identified. All 340 staff at the plant are now being tested for the virus, with results expected over the weekend. Judith Molloy, from St Helens, was wearing a mask as she did some shopping in Liverpool One this morning. ""I'm vulnerable and so is my husband. I think this should have started from day one,"" she said. The 72-year-old added she'd seen many people around without maskson the first day they became mandatory to wear in shops. ""I was on the bus this morning and people were getting on with no masks. If you go in to a shop without a mask I don't think anyone is going to say anything. ""I think people are more relaxed now."" A charity is due to close after the coronavirus crisis ""compounded"" its ""financial challenges"". Age UK Suffolk's services cost Â£2m a year to run but it has seen a fall in fundraising and paid for services during the pandemic. It said a full review of what it offers had ""not been enough to fully mitigate"" these effects and 145 staff were being made redundant on Friday. The county council said it would ""help to ensure the essential gap is filled"". In Leicester,where non-essential shops have been able to openafter a local lockdown was imposed, eager shoppersare also having to handle the new rules on face coverings. Returning from a visit to the post office, student Frank Boakye said he'd been opting to wear a mask since lockdown began ""for my own protection"". ""Everyone I saw in the post office was wearing a mask,"" the 29-year-old said. ""It's a very good idea."" Callum Goodson, a buyer with independent clothes store Pilot, in the busy Lanes shopping district of Leicester said levels of compliance from customers on mask-wearing rules had been high in the city so far. The 22-year-old said: ""Everyone coming into the store and staff have been wearing masks. If anyone does come in without a mask, we can offer them one. If they refuse it's down to us if we accept that - but we haven't had to do that so far."" On a visit to a GP surgery, Boris Johnson has called people who oppose vaccinations ""nuts"". During the visit, he told reporters that one of the best ways people can safeguard themselves against coronavirus is to lose some weight.

"This video can not be played Marine experts tried in vain to rescue the stranded shark A shark which had got stranded in shallow waters on the Yorkshire coast has been put down, according to a marine charity. The basking shark was spotted in the water trying to beach itself at Filey in North Yorkshire, on Thursday. The beach was closed while a lifeboat crew tried to prevent it from beaching and to get it back out to sea. Marine charity Sea Watch said it was believed the creature was ill and the decision was made to euthanise it. This video can not be played The shark had attempted to beach itself and could not be persuaded to go back out to sea Sea Watch's Robin Petch said: ""It was in the shallows in Filey Bay trying to beach itself and members of the public, the Coastguard and the RNLI were in attendance trying to stop it and persuade it to go out to sea. ""There was a vet in attendance and in the end they decided the best thing to do for the animal was to euthanise it."" More news and stories from Yorkshire Basking sharks are an endangered species The basking shark is the largest shark found in UK seas They can be up to 12 metres in length and weigh up to six tonnes Despite their size, they feed on zooplankton They are believed to have an average lifespan of about 50 years They are most commonly seen in the summer, when they arrive in British waters The large, black, triangular dorsal fin moves slowly through the water, with the tail tip and bulbous snout often visible above the waves They are found all around the UK coast, but most frequently sited around the south-west of England, Wales, Isle of Man and west coast of Scotland The North East Atlantic population are classed as endangered and are protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Source: The Wildlife Trusts Rescuers from British Divers Marine Life Rescue took part in efforts to try and get the animal back into deeper water. A spokesperson said: ""Unfortunately, the shark appeared to be struggling as it was listing consistently over to its right-hand side and circling in the shallows, sometimes needing support from the rescuers."" ""Despite attempts to move it into deeper water the shark continued to head back to the beach where it restranded and later in the evening was put to sleep by a vet due to the poor prognosis."" The RNLI's Filey lifeboat was called at about 18:00 BST when the shark was spotted in the water close to the beach Basking sharks are the second largest fish in the oceans. Despite their size they only feed on zooplankton and are not considered a danger to humans. ""This one was a little under four and a half metres, so it was a young one, not a juvenile but not quite an adult,"" Mr Petch said. ""They can grow quite large - the biggest ones recorded are about 10 to 11 metres."" He said they were usually found in deeper waters and it was possible the animal had been ill and come into shore. It could also have got trapped in the shallow waters and then been starved of oxygen. Basking sharks are an endangered species.

"Most people in England, about 30 million, are to be offered a free flu vaccine this year, the government says. It is to prepare for a winter that could see the annual flu season coincide with a surge in coronavirus. The NHS flu programme will add all over-50s, people shielding and those who live with them and children in their first year of secondary school. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he wanted ""everyone to have a flu jab in the run up to this winter"". He said it was important to ""protect the NHS in the winter months because we've still got Covid and the threat of a second spike of Covid, and its vital therefore to keep that pressure off the NHS by everybody getting a flu jab."" Flu, which can be deadly or need hospital treatment, poses additional threats during the pandemic: There is some evidence a double infection with coronavirus and flu is more deadly than either alone A big flu season combined with coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals If lots of NHS or care-home staff are sick with flu, then it may not be possible to respond to Covid-19 in the same way as during the peak in spring. But it is impossible to predict how big a flu season we will have. Australia, which is currently in its winter, is either having a very mild or very late flu season. Social-distancing and hygiene measures in place to stop coronavirus should, in theory, also have an impact on the amount of flu going around. people who were required toshield from coronavirusand anyone they live with people withsome medical conditions,externalincluding diabetes, heart failure and asthma pregnant women pre-school children over the age of two all primary school children, as last year, and, for the first time, Year 7 pupils initially all people over 65, before the programme is extended to the over-50s The NHS will get in contact with those who are eligible. It wants to ensure the highest risk patients are at the front of the queue when the immunisation programme starts in September. Those aged 50-64 will be offered the jab later, with the full details still to be announced. Last year, around 15 million people in England were vaccinated as part of the NHS campaign, far fewer than the 25 million who were invited to have it. This year more than 30m doses have been ordered. The vaccine will also be available privately in pharmacies and some supermarkets to adults who are not eligible for an NHS jab. It usually costs around Â£20. A Scottish government spokesperson said it was ""examining the best options"" for expanding eligibility for its flu vaccine programme which would be set out when it had ""confidence that there is adequate supply of vaccines in order to delivery on any commitments we make"". Plans for Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet been announced. The symptoms of flu include a fever and a dry cough. By now this should sound familiar - as they are the key signs of Covid-19 too. Other symptoms such as fatigue, aches, a sore throat or headaches are also shared by both infections. And there are also other winter viruses, such as rhinovirus and RSV, that can also lead to similar symptoms. This could create a problem come winter - as far more people would need testing to work out whether they have had coronavirus and their contacts needed tracing. This is why the government has already announced plans to increase testing capacity to half a million a day. Today's announcement on vaccines aims to suppress the flu season so numbers are as low as possible. GP Dr William Bird, an expert on preventative health, told BBC Breakfast it was right to offer the flu jab more widely, but that logistics would be a big problem. He said flu clinics were already run like a ""military operation"" with people ""bunched together"" - and social distancing would complicate matters. Children are given the flu vaccine with a nasal spray, while adults have a jab Plans are also being put together for ensuring coronavirus does not disrupt vaccination by, for example, causing schools, which deliver the childhood programme, to shut. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical advisor, said: ""This winter more than ever, with Covid-19 still circulating, we need to help reduce all avoidable risks. ""Vaccinating more people will help reduce flu transmission and stop people becoming ill."" Children are ""super-spreaders"" of the flu virus, but the expansion of the childhood programme had not been anticipated before the pandemic. The plan had been to assess the impact of vaccinating all primary school children, achieved for the first time last year, before deciding what to do next. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Meanwhile, there will be a renewed push to persuade health and care workers to have the vaccine. Last year,74% of staff,externalwere immunised. Paulette Hamilton, from the Local Government Association, said: ""Extending the free winter flu jab to as many people as possible is essential if we are to tackle two potentially deadly viruses head-on and prevent one seasonable and predictable virus creating the conditions for a second, more serious and unpredictable deadly second wave of Covid-19. ""It is absolutely critical that all our health and care workers get themselves vaccinated, to protect both themselves and the people they look after, including our elderly and most vulnerable, from a potentially devastating second wave of infections.""

"Face coverings are now compulsory for customers in shops in England, after new coronavirus rules came into force within 12 hours of the government issuing guidance on the change. Coverings are mandatory in enclosed public spaces such as supermarkets, indoor shopping centres, transport hubs, banks and takeaways. Police can hand out fines of up to Â£100 to those who do not comply. But some retailers have insisted they will not enforce the rule. The deaths of another 123 people in the UK who have tested positive for Covid-19 been announced, taking the number to have died to 45,677. There were also a further 770 cases confirmed through testing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government's ability to ease social-distancing measures and face-mask rules depended on it being able to drive down the level of the virus. ""The message is - we have done very well, the virus is under control to a very large extent but it is still there,"" he said during a visit to a GP surgery. He said he believed the UK would be ""well past"" coronavirus by the middle of next year, saying: ""We have tough times ahead in coming through economically, but I have absolutely no doubt that we are going to, and this country is going to bounce back stronger than ever before."" Costa Coffee said their staff would not challenge customers who entered their stores without masks. Sainsbury's also said that staff members would not be individually responsible for challenging customers - but added that stores would have regular Tannoy announcements asking customers to follow the new rules. Asda said enforcement was the ""responsibility of the relevant authorities"". Waitrose has positioned staff at shop doors reminding customers of the rule, and Tesco is selling face coverings at store entrances. Greggs and McDonalds say takeaway customers need to wear masks. Live updates: Latest coronavirus developments The day England's shoppers put on their face coverings Shops or trains - where do I need to cover my face? Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask How to make your own face mask According to guidanceissued by the government,externalon Thursday for England, staff in premises where face coverings are required are encouraged to take steps to ""promote compliance with the law"" and can refuse entry to people who do not have a valid exemption under the rules. But the government says it was the responsibility of individuals to wear a covering. Ragini Patel says one customer was aggressive when she reminded him of social distancing rules By Hazel Shearing ""Oh, better put our masks on,"" a woman says to her friend outside a homeware shop in Camberwell. He shrugs and follows her inside, opting to go without. Most people are wearing face coverings inside the shops on this South London high street, but this exchange sums up the dilemma for some shopkeepers. Ragini Patel says she asks customers to wear face coverings in her stationery shop, but some older customers, in particular, don't listen. ""There's no point saying anything to anybody, you don't want to get in trouble,"" she shrugs. In Scope charity shop, Dawn Suleyman says only one customer has come in today without one - and was grateful when she handed her a spare. ""I wouldn't say to someone 'you can't come in because you haven't got a mask on',"" she says. ""I'd explain to them, 'You do realise that you could possibly get a fine? And if you haven't got a mask I'm happy to give you one'."" This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Police will be able to ""use force"" to remove customers from shops if they do not wear face coverings, or to prevent them from entering, according to the College of Policing. Butindividual forces have saidthey will only be enforcing the rules, including issuing fines, as a last resort - and officers will not be patrolling premises. Health Minister Helen Whately said the government was confident ""the vast majority of people"" would comply with the regulations. In Scotland, where face coverings in shops became compulsory on 10 July,one person has been finedfor failing to wear one. Can police make me wear a face mask or covering? There are exemptions to the new rules for children under 11, those with disabilities or certain health conditions, such as respiratory or cognitive impairments that make it difficult for them to wear a face covering. Ms Whately said people could print outa card from the government's website,externalto show they were exempt if they wished, but stressed people would not be expected to carry proof of an exemption. Public Health England has warned parents not to buy coverings for babies and young children because of the risk of choking or suffocation. Masks will not be mandatory in indoor venues that have other safety measures in place, including: Eat-in restaurants Pubs Hairdressers and salons Gyms and leisure centres Cinemas, concert halls and theatres Visitor attractions such as museums Libraries For some people with certain health conditions or disabilities, wearing a mask can be more difficult. Kerise Vowles-Myners, who has autism, had a particularly bad experience when she tried wearing one to visit the doctor last week. ""I literally had it on for two minutes and had a panic attack and threw up in public - it was quite embarrassing,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Kerise said she had spoken to her social worker about going shopping for her when she had bad days. ""I don't like being confronted because I have to explain myself,"" she said. ""Whenever I go out, a lot of people don't even realise that I'm on the spectrum so they just look at me and think, 'Oh she is just a normal person, why is she not wearing a mask?'"" Retail and trade organisations have criticised the government over the time it took to publish guidance on masks - after thechanges were announced 10 days ago. Meanwhile, union leaders voiced fears the rules could put workers' safety at risk if people refused to wear a mask or became abusive. The British Retail Consortium called on customers to be ""respectful"" of the new rules, while UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said takeaway outlets had been left with ""a very short time to properly brief staff, prepare signage and take steps to encourage compliance"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? According to the government,,externalface coverings should cover the mouth and nose and can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that securely fits around the side of the face without having to be held in place. The requirement to wear face coverings at transport hubs - railway and bus stations, airports and maritime ports - only applies for areas which are fully indoors and enclosed. You are allowed to remove a face covering in certain situations, for example to prove identification in banks or when buying age-restricted products. Face coverings have been compulsory in shops in Scotland since 10 July. Shoppers are not currently required to wear them in Wales or Northern Ireland, althoughNI will wait until 20 August before decidingwhether to make them compulsory. Coverings are already compulsory on public transport in England and Scotland, as well as most buses, trains and ferries in Northern Ireland. They will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July.

"Tom, centre, and Joe (right) are pictured with their wives after scooping the Powerball jackpot Long-time friends Joe Feeney and Tom Cook made a pact in 1992 - sealed with a handshake - that if one of them won the US Powerball lottery they would share it. Nearly 30 years later the numbers came up for Tom - and he honoured the deal. Joe said he was stunned when his friend called to say they were sharing the $22m (Â£17m) jackpot. ""He called me and I said, 'are you jerking my bobber?'"" said the keen fisherman. The two men live in the Menomonie area of the US state of Wisconsin. ""Congratulations to Tom, Joe, and their families,""Wisconsin Lottery director Cindy Polzin said in a statement,external.  ""The power of friendship and a handshake has paid off.

The two men decided to take a cash option of about $16.7m which means that - after federal and state taxes - each will take home about $5.7m. Tom decided to retire after learning about the win while Joe was already retired. They say they are looking forward to spending more time with family. ""We can pursue what we feel comfortable with.

Hazel Shearing & Alex KleidermanBBC News ""Oh, better put our masks on,"" a woman says to her friend outside a homeware shop in Camberwell, south London, fishing around in her bag. He shrugs and follows her inside, opting to go without. It's thefirst day that face coverings have been compulsory for customers in England's shops. But this short exchange sums up the dilemma for some shopkeepers and shoppers. Susan Green, 57, in Liverpool, said: ""I think it is a little bit late to have introduced this and lots of people I've seen this morning are not even wearing one. ""It won't put me off coming to the shops because I'll be out anyway, but it does seem a bit unnecessary."" Read the full story here This video can not be played Boris Johnson: There maybe things we could have done differently Claire MarshallEnvironment correspondent, BBC News Team GB open water swimmer Toby Robinson has been training in the River Soar Figures suggest that more people than ever are heading to Britain's rivers with the easing of lockdown - renewing calls for better public rights of access. It comes as MPs are to consider proposals aimed at opening up the waterways to all. But after recent incidences of overcrowding and littering, there are fears more people on rivers could ""cause chaos"". The Canal & Rivers Trust, British Canoeing, the Outdoor Swimming Society and the Angling Trust all report a surge in interest during lockdown and after the easing of restrictions began. Unlike in Scotland, there is currently no ""right to roam"" equivalent on waterways in England and Wales. The vast majority of rivers in England and Wales - around 95% - are in private hands and access is limited. If you swim, fish or paddle without the right permission, you are breaking the law. ""The Crown owns the water you swim in, while the person who owns the property up to the bank is also said to own the bed of the river up to the middle,"" says Nick Hayes, author of The Book of Trespass. Read more There have been more than 15 million people infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, and the number of cases is still rising fast in many parts of the world. In parts of the world badly affected during the early stages of the pandemic, including European countries such as Italy, France and the UK, the daily death toll has fallen dramatically. But in other places, such as parts of South America, India and South Africa, the death rate is rising fast. The US has seen the world's highest number of daily cases and deaths in recent days, as infections spiked in a number of states once coronavirus restrictions were relaxed. Among the worst-affected states at the moment are Florida and Louisiana, with high rates of infection in Texas, Arizona, Nevada and across the southern US. The US is not the only country to see coronavirus rise again. Israel, Australia and Japan have seen a second rise in cases after measures against coronavirus appeared to have got the infection under control, while Iran has also seen cases increase sharply. Although he admitted there were ""open questions"" about the government's early response to the virus, Boris Johnson denied that they had been too slow to act. ""If you look at the timing of every single piece of advice that we got from our advisers, from Sage, you will find that whenever they said that we needed to take a particular step, actually, we stuck to that advice like glue,"" he told the BBC. The prime minister also warned that the UK is vulnerable to a second surge, particularly in the winter. ""Collectively, this country has done an incredible thing to get the disease down to the levels it's at. But we all know that it can come back,"" he said. ""And we can see what's happening in other countries - I won't name them - but you can see the resurgence that's happening. We know that we're vulnerable there. ""So that's why we're getting on now with our preparations for the winter... a massive flu vaccination programme, stockpiling PPE, making sure that we ramp up Test and Trace, and making sure that people get tested if they have symptoms."" A McDonald's that is closed for indoor dining in Miami McDonald's has announced that anyone entering one of their 14,000 restaurants in the US will be required to wear a mask starting on 1 August. The fast-food chain joins other major businesses, like Walmart and Starbucks, that have announced new rules mandating masks. In a statement, McDonald's said that nearly 82% of its restaurants are in regions that require masks. Experts agree that wearing masks helps to prevent the spread of Covid-19. McDonald's said they were taking steps to also assist customers who refuse or are unable to wear a mask. ""In those situations where a customer declines to wear a face covering, weâll put in place additional procedures to take care of them in a friendly, expedited way,"" the statement said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Restricted from travel abroad due to the infection rate, Swedes are holidaying at home Brightly coloured beach towels line the shores of Lake Storsjon, two hours north of Stockholm. Staycations are popular here this summer, thanks to a slew of travel restrictions imposed on Sweden by other countries, due to its coronavirus infection rate. More than 5,500 people have died with Covid-19 in this country of just 10 million. It is one of the highest death rates relative to population size in Europe, and by far the worst among the Nordic nations. Unlike Sweden, the rest all chose to lock down early in the pandemic. ""Maybe we should have taken some more care of each other,"" says Dan Eklund, 31, visiting the lake on his friend's boat. Sweden has largely relied on voluntary social distancing guidelines since the start of the pandemic, including working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. The unusual strategy has attracted global criticism. But according to clinical epidemiologist Helena Nordenstedt, there's no consensus in Sweden's scientific community that the strategy as a whole has failed. Read more.  Reaction to the prime minister's interview with the BBC is continuing to come in. Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said: ""At last Boris Johnson has admitted what we have all known for some time - this government made fundamental mistakes in their handling of the coronavirus crisis. ""However, to try and minimise this as there were some things they could have done differently is not only an enormous understatement, but it is an insult to all those who tragically lost loved ones to the virus. ""This interview has given people more questions than answers. With no remorse for the catastrophic mistakes such as the failure to protect our care homes or a refusal to put a comprehensive plan in place for a second wave, it is clear the prime minster has learnt nothing over the course of the last few months."" Face coverings are now compulsory for customers in shops and supermarkets in England. Globally, the wearing of face coverings and masks has been polarising opinion over the past few weeks - and has become particularly politicised in the US. So why are some people hesitant to wear masks, and is there actually any truth in their claims?

The document comes two weeks after President Trump criticised the previous CDC guidance on schools as ""very tough and expensive"". ""It is critically important for our public health to open schools this fall,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield, a Trump appointee, said in a statement announcing the updates. Critics - including many teachers - say it is too early to commit to in-person learning as infections continue to rise across the US. âI am comfortable with that,"" Trump said earlier this week when asked about his 14-year-old son and his school-aged grandchildren returning to classrooms. âI would like to see the schools open 100 percent. And weâll do it safely. Weâll do it carefully,â he said. Despite Trump's efforts, the Maryland private school attended by his son Barron has said they will not fully open in September due to virus concerns. We reported earlier about Boris Johnson's interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has now responded, saying that the prime minister ""has finally admitted the government mishandled its response to the coronavirus"". ""This finally puts to bed the prime minister's previous claim his government 'took the right decisions at the right time',"" Ashworth added. ""It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown, and too slow to take this crisis seriously. ""The threat of a second wave is still very real.

The prime minister says the UK government didn't understand coronavirus in the ""first few weeks and months"" and has acknowledged there were things the government ""could have done differently"" in its handling of the virus. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Boris Johnson said there were ""lessons to be learned"" about how the virus was managed in the early stages. ""We didn't understand (the virus) in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months.

""I think it's fair to say that there are things that we need to learn about how we handled it in the early stages."" The prime minister also said there were ""very open questions"" over whether lockdown came too late - a marked change from ministers' previous insistence that the right decisions were taken at the right time. Asked whether there was a delay in implementing a lockdown which ultimately cost lives, he said:

Many shoppers were prepared for the new rules on face coverings We're wrapping up today's live page coverage shortly, but if you want to catch up on the day's events, here is what has been happening in the UK. Hazel Shearing & Alex KleidermanBBC News ""Oh, better put our masks on,"" a woman says to her friend outside a homeware shop in Camberwell, south London, fishing around in her bag. He shrugs and follows her inside, opting to go without. It's thefirst day that face coverings have been compulsory for customers in England's shops. But this short exchange sums up the dilemma for some shopkeepers and shoppers. Susan Green, 57, in Liverpool, said: ""I think it is a little bit late to have introduced this and lots of people I've seen this morning are not even wearing one. ""It won't put me off coming to the shops because I'll be out anyway, but it does seem a bit unnecessary.""

It comes as MPs are to consider proposals aimed at opening up the waterways to all. But after recent incidences of overcrowding and littering, there are fears more people on rivers could ""cause chaos"". The Canal & Rivers Trust, British Canoeing, the Outdoor Swimming Society and the Angling Trust all report a surge in interest during lockdown and after the easing of restrictions began. Unlike in Scotland, there is currently no ""right to roam"" equivalent on waterways in England and Wales. The vast majority of rivers in England and Wales - around 95% - are in private hands and access is limited. If you swim, fish or paddle without the right permission, you are breaking the law. ""The Crown owns the water you swim in, while the person who owns the property up to the bank is also said to own the bed of the river up to the middle,"" says Nick Hayes, author of The Book of Trespass. Read more There have been more than 15 million people infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, and the number of cases is still rising fast in many parts of the world. In parts of the world badly affected during the early stages of the pandemic, including European countries such as Italy, France and the UK, the daily death toll has fallen dramatically. But in other places, such as parts of South America, India and South Africa, the death rate is rising fast. The US has seen the world's highest number of daily cases and deaths in recent days, as infections spiked in a number of states once coronavirus restrictions were relaxed. Among the worst-affected states at the moment are Florida and Louisiana, with high rates of infection in Texas, Arizona, Nevada and across the southern US. The US is not the only country to see coronavirus rise again. Israel, Australia and Japan have seen a second rise in cases after measures against coronavirus appeared to have got the infection under control, while Iran has also seen cases increase sharply. Although he admitted there were ""open questions"" about the government's early response to the virus, Boris Johnson denied that they had been too slow to act. ""If you look at the timing of every single piece of advice that we got from our advisers, from Sage, you will find that whenever they said that we needed to take a particular step, actually, we stuck to that advice like glue,"" he told the BBC. The prime minister also warned that the UK is vulnerable to a second surge, particularly in the winter. ""Collectively, this country has done an incredible thing to get the disease down to the levels it's at. But we all know that it can come back,"" he said. ""And we can see what's happening in other countries - I won't name them - but you can see the resurgence that's happening. We know that we're vulnerable there. ""So that's why we're getting on now with our preparations for the winter... a massive flu vaccination programme, stockpiling PPE, making sure that we ramp up Test and Trace, and making sure that people get tested if they have symptoms."" A McDonald's that is closed for indoor dining in Miami McDonald's has announced that anyone entering one of their 14,000 restaurants in the US will be required to wear a mask starting on 1 August. The fast-food chain joins other major businesses, like Walmart and Starbucks, that have announced new rules mandating masks. In a statement, McDonald's said that nearly 82% of its restaurants are in regions that require masks. Experts agree that wearing masks helps to prevent the spread of Covid-19. McDonald's said they were taking steps to also assist customers who refuse or are unable to wear a mask. ""In those situations where a customer declines to wear a face covering, weâll put in place additional procedures to take care of them in a friendly, expedited way,"" the statement said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Restricted from travel abroad due to the infection rate, Swedes are holidaying at home Brightly coloured beach towels line the shores of Lake Storsjon, two hours north of Stockholm. Staycations are popular here this summer, thanks to a slew of travel restrictions imposed on Sweden by other countries, due to its coronavirus infection rate. More than 5,500 people have died with Covid-19 in this country of just 10 million. It is one of the highest death rates relative to population size in Europe, and by far the worst among the Nordic nations. Unlike Sweden, the rest all chose to lock down early in the pandemic. ""Maybe we should have taken some more care of each other,"" says Dan Eklund, 31, visiting the lake on his friend's boat. Sweden has largely relied on voluntary social distancing guidelines since the start of the pandemic, including working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. The unusual strategy has attracted global criticism. But according to clinical epidemiologist Helena Nordenstedt, there's no consensus in Sweden's scientific community that the strategy as a whole has failed. Read more.  Reaction to the prime minister's interview with the BBC is continuing to come in. Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said: ""At last Boris Johnson has admitted what we have all known for some time - this government made fundamental mistakes in their handling of the coronavirus crisis. ""However, to try and minimise this as there were some things they could have done differently is not only an enormous understatement, but it is an insult to all those who tragically lost loved ones to the virus. ""This interview has given people more questions than answers. With no remorse for the catastrophic mistakes such as the failure to protect our care homes or a refusal to put a comprehensive plan in place for a second wave, it is clear the prime minster has learnt nothing over the course of the last few months."" Face coverings are now compulsory for customers in shops and supermarkets in England. Globally, the wearing of face coverings and masks has been polarising opinion over the past few weeks - and has become particularly politicised in the US. So why are some people hesitant to wear masks, and is there actually any truth in their claims?

""Maybe there were things we could have done differently and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done differently."" Read the full story here BBC OS Dozens of protesters

Meanwhile, Florida and Tennessee each set new state records for most coronavirus-related deaths in a 24-hour period. The US recorded a total of 68,663 new cases on Thursday and 1,114 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The pace of infections across the US is increasing, experts say. It took the US 15 days to jump from 3m to 4m - a milestone the country passed on Thursday. It previously took 45 days to go from 1m to 2m infections, the Washington Post reports, and the leap from 2m cases to 3m took 27 days.  Another 123 deaths have been reported in hospitals, care homes and the community in the UK, according tocoronavirus.data.gov.uk,external. It brings the total number of deaths following a positive Covid-19 test result to 45,677. There were also a further 770 cases confirmed through testing. The daily death toll figures continue to be published by Public Health England on the coronavirus dashboard, but the government haslaunched a reviewinto them over concerns that the figures from England may include some people who died months after a positive test.

"The prime minister is set to announce new measures to curb obesity next week, and they are expected to include a ban on TV junk food adverts before 21:00. It comes amid growing evidence people who are overweight or obese are at greater risk from coronavirus. The measures are yet to be finalised but are also likely to include a ban on online ads for unhealthy foods, and limits on in-store promotions. One food industry leader said it was a ""slap in the face"". The move marks a change in stance by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and described his views on tackling obesity as ""libertarian"". Mr Johnson's experience in intensive care during his treatment for Covid-19 is thought to have contributed to his changing position. Speaking during a visit to a GP surgery in east London, he said that while he was not normally one for ""nannying or bossying"", the country did need to lose weight to protect from a second spike. He said: ""Obesity is one of the real co-morbidity factors. Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus."" Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? Does being overweight or obese affect how ill people get with coronavirus? Obesity study shows increased disease and death risks Obesity strategies have had a chequered recent history. David Cameron, backed by NHS leaders, was all set to unveil wide-ranging curbs on food marketing and advertising in England in the summer of 2016. Then he abruptly left office and his successor Theresa May watered down or ditched most of the ideas. Two years later she had changed her view, and her Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans to ban fast food advertising before the 21:00 TV watershed and prevent supermarkets from promoting unhealthy food products in stores. These plans were put out to consultation but were left in limbo when Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street a year ago. His comments about the ""continuing creep of the nanny state"" and the need for a review of ""sin taxes"" were taken to mean he was against further intervention on people's diet choices. But he has shifted, and most of the 2018 plan now seems set to be implemented. It could have been enacted by now but, whatever the timing, the measures - including sweeping changes to the way food is advertised, are a significant move to tackle one of the biggest health challenges of our times. Ministers are still finalising the detail of some anti-obesity measures, such as whether to require more prominent labelling of food and drinks with high levels of sugar or salt. Some restaurants could be required to put calorie labels on menus. It is thought Mr Johnson is likely to push ahead with advertising restrictions, and is considering banning in-store promotions of unhealthy foods. BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo said: ""Although it goes against his political instincts, Boris Johnson now wants to give the strategy a renewed push. ""He's previously been sceptical of taxes on unhealthy food and drinks and it's not yet clear how far his proposals will go beyond what's been suggested before. ""Though obesity is linked to a whole host of health problems, the prime minister has clearly been prompted into action by the coronavirus connection."" Tim Rycroft, chief operating officer of the Food and Drink Federation, said the rumoured move was a ""slap in the face"" to the food industry, which he said had worked ""heroically"" to keep the nation fed during the pandemic. ""It is going to ban promotions of food 10 days before the chancellor launches the biggest food promotion the country has ever seen,"" he told Today. ""It is going to put enormous costs on the advertising industry and on broadcasters at a time when the economy is in quite a tenuous situation."" A letter from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising sent to the prime minister said a government impact assessment last year showed a 21:00 watershed on high fat, sugar and salt food and drinks would only remove around 1.7 calories per day from a child's diet - the equivalent of half a Smartie. In the letter, director general Paul Bainsfair wrote: ""The introduction of such a draconian measure at this time could have deep repercussions for agencies and the advertising sector, generally, in terms of jobs and creative output, for very little end result."" Health and Social Care Minister Helen Whately told BBC Breakfast an announcement was due ""imminently"". She said she recognised obesity was ""possibly the greatest health challenge"" the country faced - ""particularly with Covid"". Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed the prime minister's experience in St Thomas's hospital had been a ""game changer"" and that it was understood the aim was to get people to lose weight ""prior to the next spike"". He said: ""There hasn't been a ban like this but it has got to be given a try - and if after a period of time it is shown not to be so effective, then maybe it will stop. ""It is indeed a risk but the problem is that the consequence of obesity is so great that risks and daring measures have to be put in place."" He called for the sugar tax on soft drinks to be extended to other products. The NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese. Another measure of excess fat is waist size - men with a waist of 94cm or more and women with a waist of 80cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related problems.

"UK retail sales were near pre-lockdown levels in June, as the reopening of shops released pent-up demand. The amount of goods sold last month increased by 13.9% compared to May,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS),external. Separately, a closely watched survey showed that activity in the UK's services and manufacturing sectors returned to growth last month. However, economists warned that the country's recovery would take time. June's rise in retail sales followed record falls in April and a partial recovery in May as the coronavirus pandemic led to widespread shop closures. But it masked ""big changes"" in retail, with food and online sales up, while clothing was still ""struggling"", the ONS said. Online sales continued to go ""from strength to strength"", the ONS added, accounting for Â£3 out of every Â£10 spent by consumers. Demand at food stores remained strong, hitting new highs for the lockdown period. Compared with February, the volume of food sales was 5.3% higher while non-store retailing grew by 53.6%. The ONS said the rebound had brought overall retail sales back to a similar level to where they were pre-lockdown, but there was a ""mixed picture"" in different store types. In June, non-food stores, including department stores and clothes shops, partially recovered from strong falls during the lockdown but were still 15% lower than in February. Non-essential shops in England were not allowed to reopen until 15 June, so they were only trading for half the month. New face covering rules come into force in England 'They said I'd be cleaning toilets so I quit' Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician, told the BBC that there had been ""some really big changes under the surface"" of the retail landscape since lockdown began. ""Food shops continue to do quite well, as we're eating at home more,"" he said. ""But the real growth has been in online sales. Online sales continue to go from strength to strength."" Britain's nation of shoppers has come to the fore. The amount of what we buy is virtually back to pre-crisis levels - but that doesn't signal a wider full bounce-back in our economic fortunes. This is for a couple of reasons. Firstly, what we buy has changed: more online, more staples, fewer impulse forays onto the High Street. While there was an initial flurry in sales of clothing and household goods immediately after non-essential shops opened in June, more timely data on payments suggested that tailed off in July. The fallout can be seen in the mounting job losses announced by stalwarts, from John Lewis to M&S. Secondly, retail sales are only part of the recovery jigsaw, totalling about a fifth of the economy. Factories and building sites are coming back to life. But the big unknown is spending on services such as restaurants, bars and hotels - so-called ""social spending"". Even with eating out vouchers and VAT cuts, a full and rapid recovery there seems unlikely. And it is these sectors that have suffered most and have furloughed the vast majority of their staff. Their future will hinge on how spending convalesces there. Mr Athow said some sectors were ""struggling"". ""Some of that is due to the restrictions, which were only relaxed part-way through June in England. Clothing is down by about a third. ""And if you look at the High Street more generally, sales in the High Street, or physical shops, are also down by about a third."" Clothing sales did rise 70% month-on-month in June, but from a very low base, meaning that they are still well below pre-lockdown levels. Mr Athow said they had fallen so far that ""virtually any pick-up will look like a big number"". The proportion of online spending reduced to 31.8% in June from the record 33.3% reported in May, but was well up on the 20% reported in February, said the ONS. Meanwhile, a survey measuring new orders, employment and business sentiment in the services and manufacturing sectors indicated a return to growth during June. The ""flash"" - or preliminary -Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI),external, compiled by IHS Markit and CIPS, rose to 57.1 in July, up sharply from 47.7 last month. It was the first time since February that it was above 50, indicating expansion. However, Markit's chief business economist, Chris Williamson, cautioned: ""While the recession looks to have been brief, the scars are likely to be deep."" One businesswoman who has taken advantage of the move to online shopping is Hellen Stirling-Baker of Small Stuff, a Sheffield-based independent retailer. She sells sustainably made toys, gifts and homewares for young children. ""Driving my store online is how I have been able to survive,"" she said. ""Offering face-to-face video calling for customers to recreate the in-store experience has been crucial and sales are picking up. ""I've also added new services such as local delivery by hand, which really boost engagement."" Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at Equals Money, said the retail sector had seen a ""V-shaped recovery"", echoingremarks by the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane. ""The motto of the British consumer has long been 'When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping' and it seems like June encapsulated that well,"" he added. Silvia Rindone, retail partner at EY, said the latest figures showed there was ""some hope on the horizon"", with consumers beginning to show ""a cautious optimism"". But she added: ""We're still not past the pandemic and getting back to 'normal' will still take time.

"Small business owners in Edinburgh said they cannot afford to keep giving NHS worker discounts Small business owners in Edinburgh said they cannot afford to keep giving NHS worker discounts and have asked workers to stop asking for them. Some business owners said they had been asked up to 100 times for deductions on food bills by NHS staff over the four-month lockdown period. Some larger retailers have advertised discounts to NHS staff. NHS Lothian said it was ""not appropriate or acceptable to request free or discounted foods"". Mohammed Alam, manager of Morningside Spice on Edinburgh's Morningside Road, said he had never seen business so bad in the 17 years he had been working in the restaurant. He said: ""I have had about 100 NHS staff asking for discounts over the last four months. ""I have been happy to give NHS staff discounts when they have asked for it during the lockdown but now it is becoming more difficult for us. ""There is a big mental health hospital and a nursing home near here and that's where they have been coming from to ask for discounts. ""Business is not going in the right direction because of the lockdown situation so we can't keep giving the discounts like we have been doing. ""I also voluntarily gave Marie Curie in Fairmilehead 25 meals during the lockdown so I have been doing every thing I can to help but now we are struggling. ""Before the lockdown I would have about 80 people sitting in the restaurant on Friday nights and the same on Saturdays but now I'm down to between two to eight people on weekend nights, so business is very much down."" Mohammed Alam, manager of Morningside Spice in Edinburgh, said he had never seen business so bad in the 17 years he had been working in the restaurant Mohammed Parvez, 55, who is the owner of the Indian restaurant Rannaghor in Edinburgh's Currie area, said he had been receiving three to four requests a week from NHS workers asking for discounts. He said: ""I've just been giving it to them because they have been asking me but the business hasn't been doing so well so it is very hard to give discounts. ""I have helped the NHS with the discounts and now I'm asking everyone to support us so we can survive. ""The situation is getting worse and worse and I am just a little businessman so it is very hard."" Mohammed Parvez owner of the Rannaghor in Edinburgh's Currie area said it was very hard to give discounts at the moment An Edinburgh fish and chip owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: ""I had a call from a nurse at a hospital asking for a free meal for her colleagues, it was five suppers and came to about Â£40. ""I asked her why and she said because it would help with all the stress they were going through at the moment. ""A week later two nurses in their uniforms came into my shop and one asked for a discount and when I said no she started arguing with me. I was saying you earn a full wage but she kept asking and asking until her colleague stepped in and said enough and told her to pay. ""Last night I had a man who said he was a paramedic who asked for an NHS discount but when my staff said no he was fine about it. ""I like to help everyone but unfortunately there is only so much we can do. ""NHS staff keep asking and it's not right. It would make our life much easier if they would please stop asking for discounts."" Janis Butler, NHS Lothian's director of human resources and organisational development, said: ""We have been humbled by the support of our communities right across Edinburgh and the Lothians during the pandemic. ""Local business, schools, organisations and individual members of the public made many generous offers of food and supplies to our staff and patients at the height of the pandemic. ""We offer our thanks again to them all for these extraordinarily generous gestures of their appreciation for the hard work and dedication of our staff.

"Small business owners in Edinburgh said they cannot afford to keep giving NHS worker discounts Small business owners in Edinburgh said they cannot afford to keep giving NHS worker discounts and have asked workers to stop asking for them. Some business owners said they had been asked up to 100 times for deductions on food bills by NHS staff over the four-month lockdown period. Some larger retailers have advertised discounts to NHS staff. NHS Lothian said it was ""not appropriate or acceptable to request free or discounted foods"". Mohammed Alam, manager of Morningside Spice on Edinburgh's Morningside Road, said he had never seen business so bad in the 17 years he had been working in the restaurant. He said: ""I have had about 100 NHS staff asking for discounts over the last four months. ""I have been happy to give NHS staff discounts when they have asked for it during the lockdown but now it is becoming more difficult for us. ""There is a big mental health hospital and a nursing home near here and that's where they have been coming from to ask for discounts. ""Business is not going in the right direction because of the lockdown situation so we can't keep giving the discounts like we have been doing. ""I also voluntarily gave Marie Curie in Fairmilehead 25 meals during the lockdown so I have been doing every thing I can to help but now we are struggling. ""Before the lockdown I would have about 80 people sitting in the restaurant on Friday nights and the same on Saturdays but now I'm down to between two to eight people on weekend nights, so business is very much down."" Mohammed Alam, manager of Morningside Spice in Edinburgh, said he had never seen business so bad in the 17 years he had been working in the restaurant Mohammed Parvez, 55, who is the owner of the Indian restaurant Rannaghor in Edinburgh's Currie area, said he had been receiving three to four requests a week from NHS workers asking for discounts. He said: ""I've just been giving it to them because they have been asking me but the business hasn't been doing so well so it is very hard to give discounts. ""I have helped the NHS with the discounts and now I'm asking everyone to support us so we can survive. ""The situation is getting worse and worse and I am just a little businessman so it is very hard."" Mohammed Parvez owner of the Rannaghor in Edinburgh's Currie area said it was very hard to give discounts at the moment An Edinburgh fish and chip owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: ""I had a call from a nurse at a hospital asking for a free meal for her colleagues, it was five suppers and came to about Â£40. ""I asked her why and she said because it would help with all the stress they were going through at the moment. ""A week later two nurses in their uniforms came into my shop and one asked for a discount and when I said no she started arguing with me. I was saying you earn a full wage but she kept asking and asking until her colleague stepped in and said enough and told her to pay. ""Last night I had a man who said he was a paramedic who asked for an NHS discount but when my staff said no he was fine about it. ""I like to help everyone but unfortunately there is only so much we can do. ""NHS staff keep asking and it's not right. It would make our life much easier if they would please stop asking for discounts."" Janis Butler, NHS Lothian's director of human resources and organisational development, said: ""We have been humbled by the support of our communities right across Edinburgh and the Lothians during the pandemic. ""Local business, schools, organisations and individual members of the public made many generous offers of food and supplies to our staff and patients at the height of the pandemic. ""We offer our thanks again to them all for these extraordinarily generous gestures of their appreciation for the hard work and dedication of our staff. ""The overwhelming majority of our staff know that it is not appropriate or acceptable to request free or discounted foods and we would expect all our staff to treat traders with courtesy and respect.""

"This video can not be played Marine experts tried in vain to rescue the stranded shark A shark which had got stranded in shallow waters on the Yorkshire coast has been put down, according to a marine charity. The basking shark was spotted in the water trying to beach itself at Filey in North Yorkshire, on Thursday. The beach was closed while a lifeboat crew tried to prevent it from beaching and to get it back out to sea. Marine charity Sea Watch said it was believed the creature was ill and the decision was made to euthanise it. This video can not be played The shark had attempted to beach itself and could not be persuaded to go back out to sea Sea Watch's Robin Petch said: ""It was in the shallows in Filey Bay trying to beach itself and members of the public, the Coastguard and the RNLI were in attendance trying to stop it and persuade it to go out to sea. ""There was a vet in attendance and in the end they decided the best thing to do for the animal was to euthanise it."" More news and stories from Yorkshire Basking sharks are an endangered species The basking shark is the largest shark found in UK seas They can be up to 12 metres in length and weigh up to six tonnes Despite their size, they feed on zooplankton They are believed to have an average lifespan of about 50 years They are most commonly seen in the summer, when they arrive in British waters The large, black, triangular dorsal fin moves slowly through the water, with the tail tip and bulbous snout often visible above the waves They are found all around the UK coast, but most frequently sited around the south-west of England, Wales, Isle of Man and west coast of Scotland The North East Atlantic population are classed as endangered and are protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Source: The Wildlife Trusts Rescuers from British Divers Marine Life Rescue took part in efforts to try and get the animal back into deeper water. A spokesperson said: ""Unfortunately, the shark appeared to be struggling as it was listing consistently over to its right-hand side and circling in the shallows, sometimes needing support from the rescuers."" ""Despite attempts to move it into deeper water the shark continued to head back to the beach where it restranded and later in the evening was put to sleep by a vet due to the poor prognosis."" The RNLI's Filey lifeboat was called at about 18:00 BST when the shark was spotted in the water close to the beach Basking sharks are the second largest fish in the oceans. Despite their size they only feed on zooplankton and are not considered a danger to humans. ""This one was a little under four and a half metres, so it was a young one, not a juvenile but not quite an adult,"" Mr Petch said. ""They can grow quite large - the biggest ones recorded are about 10 to 11 metres."" He said they were usually found in deeper waters and it was possible the animal had been ill and come into shore. It could also have got trapped in the shallow waters and then been starved of oxygen. Basking sharks are an endangered species.

"The prime minister is set to announce new measures to curb obesity next week, and they are expected to include a ban on TV junk food adverts before 21:00. It comes amid growing evidence people who are overweight or obese are at greater risk from coronavirus. The measures are yet to be finalised but are also likely to include a ban on online ads for unhealthy foods, and limits on in-store promotions. One food industry leader said it was a ""slap in the face"". The move marks a change in stance by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and described his views on tackling obesity as ""libertarian"". Mr Johnson's experience in intensive care during his treatment for Covid-19 is thought to have contributed to his changing position. Speaking during a visit to a GP surgery in east London, he said that while he was not normally one for ""nannying or bossying"", the country did need to lose weight to protect from a second spike. He said: ""Obesity is one of the real co-morbidity factors. Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus."" Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? Does being overweight or obese affect how ill people get with coronavirus? Obesity study shows increased disease and death risks Obesity strategies have had a chequered recent history. David Cameron, backed by NHS leaders, was all set to unveil wide-ranging curbs on food marketing and advertising in England in the summer of 2016. Then he abruptly left office and his successor Theresa May watered down or ditched most of the ideas. Two years later she had changed her view, and her Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans to ban fast food advertising before the 21:00 TV watershed and prevent supermarkets from promoting unhealthy food products in stores. These plans were put out to consultation but were left in limbo when Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street a year ago. His comments about the ""continuing creep of the nanny state"" and the need for a review of ""sin taxes"" were taken to mean he was against further intervention on people's diet choices. But he has shifted, and most of the 2018 plan now seems set to be implemented. It could have been enacted by now but, whatever the timing, the measures - including sweeping changes to the way food is advertised, are a significant move to tackle one of the biggest health challenges of our times. Ministers are still finalising the detail of some anti-obesity measures, such as whether to require more prominent labelling of food and drinks with high levels of sugar or salt. Some restaurants could be required to put calorie labels on menus. It is thought Mr Johnson is likely to push ahead with advertising restrictions, and is considering banning in-store promotions of unhealthy foods. BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo said: ""Although it goes against his political instincts, Boris Johnson now wants to give the strategy a renewed push. ""He's previously been sceptical of taxes on unhealthy food and drinks and it's not yet clear how far his proposals will go beyond what's been suggested before. ""Though obesity is linked to a whole host of health problems, the prime minister has clearly been prompted into action by the coronavirus connection."" Tim Rycroft, chief operating officer of the Food and Drink Federation, said the rumoured move was a ""slap in the face"" to the food industry, which he said had worked ""heroically"" to keep the nation fed during the pandemic. ""It is going to ban promotions of food 10 days before the chancellor launches the biggest food promotion the country has ever seen,"" he told Today. ""It is going to put enormous costs on the advertising industry and on broadcasters at a time when the economy is in quite a tenuous situation."" A letter from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising sent to the prime minister said a government impact assessment last year showed a 21:00 watershed on high fat, sugar and salt food and drinks would only remove around 1.7 calories per day from a child's diet - the equivalent of half a Smartie. In the letter, director general Paul Bainsfair wrote: ""The introduction of such a draconian measure at this time could have deep repercussions for agencies and the advertising sector, generally, in terms of jobs and creative output, for very little end result."" Health and Social Care Minister Helen Whately told BBC Breakfast an announcement was due ""imminently"". She said she recognised obesity was ""possibly the greatest health challenge"" the country faced - ""particularly with Covid"". Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed the prime minister's experience in St Thomas's hospital had been a ""game changer"" and that it was understood the aim was to get people to lose weight ""prior to the next spike"". He said: ""There hasn't been a ban like this but it has got to be given a try - and if after a period of time it is shown not to be so effective, then maybe it will stop. ""It is indeed a risk but the problem is that the consequence of obesity is so great that risks and daring measures have to be put in place."" He called for the sugar tax on soft drinks to be extended to other products. The NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese. Another measure of excess fat is waist size - men with a waist of 94cm or more and women with a waist of 80cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related problems.

Thank you for joining us for our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today - particularly if you're in a city or country that's currently in lockdown. We're pausing our live page until tomorrow morning (UK time). But to sum up, here are the main headlines from today. Many shoppers were prepared for the new rules on face coverings We're wrapping up today's live page coverage shortly, but if you want to catch up on the day's events, here is what has been happening in the UK. Hazel Shearing & Alex KleidermanBBC News ""Oh, better put our masks on,"" a woman says to her friend outside a homeware shop in Camberwell, south London, fishing around in her bag. He shrugs and follows her inside, opting to go without. It's thefirst day that face coverings have been compulsory for customers in England's shops. But this short exchange sums up the dilemma for some shopkeepers and shoppers. Susan Green, 57, in Liverpool, said: ""I think it is a little bit late to have introduced this and lots of people I've seen this morning are not even wearing one. ""It won't put me off coming to the shops because I'll be out anyway, but it does seem a bit unnecessary."" Read the full story here This video can not be played Boris Johnson: There maybe things we could have done differently Claire MarshallEnvironment correspondent, BBC News Team GB open water swimmer Toby Robinson has been training in the River Soar Figures suggest that more people than ever are heading to Britain's rivers with the easing of lockdown - renewing calls for better public rights of access. It comes as MPs are to consider proposals aimed at opening up the waterways to all. But after recent incidences of overcrowding and littering, there are fears more people on rivers could ""cause chaos"". The Canal & Rivers Trust, British Canoeing, the Outdoor Swimming Society and the Angling Trust all report a surge in interest during lockdown and after the easing of restrictions began. Unlike in Scotland, there is currently no ""right to roam"" equivalent on waterways in England and Wales. The vast majority of rivers in England and Wales - around 95% - are in private hands and access is limited. If you swim, fish or paddle without the right permission, you are breaking the law. ""The Crown owns the water you swim in, while the person who owns the property up to the bank is also said to own the bed of the river up to the middle,"" says Nick Hayes, author of The Book of Trespass. Read more There have been more than 15 million people infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, and the number of cases is still rising fast in many parts of the world. In parts of the world badly affected during the early stages of the pandemic, including European countries such as Italy, France and the UK, the daily death toll has fallen dramatically. But in other places, such as parts of South America, India and South Africa, the death rate is rising fast. The US has seen the world's highest number of daily cases and deaths in recent days, as infections spiked in a number of states once coronavirus restrictions were relaxed. Among the worst-affected states at the moment are Florida and Louisiana, with high rates of infection in Texas, Arizona, Nevada and across the southern US. The US is not the only country to see coronavirus rise again. Israel, Australia and Japan have seen a second rise in cases after measures against coronavirus appeared to have got the infection under control, while Iran has also seen cases increase sharply. Although he admitted there were ""open questions"" about the government's early response to the virus, Boris Johnson denied that they had been too slow to act. ""If you look at the timing of every single piece of advice that we got from our advisers, from Sage, you will find that whenever they said that we needed to take a particular step, actually, we stuck to that advice like glue,"" he told the BBC. The prime minister also warned that the UK is vulnerable to a second surge, particularly in the winter. ""Collectively, this country has done an incredible thing to get the disease down to the levels it's at. But we all know that it can come back,"" he said. ""And we can see what's happening in other countries - I won't name them - but you can see the resurgence that's happening. We know that we're vulnerable there. ""So that's why we're getting on now with our preparations for the winter... a massive flu vaccination programme, stockpiling PPE, making sure that we ramp up Test and Trace, and making sure that people get tested if they have symptoms."" A McDonald's that is closed for indoor dining in Miami McDonald's has announced that anyone entering one of their 14,000 restaurants in the US will be required to wear a mask starting on 1 August. The fast-food chain joins other major businesses, like Walmart and Starbucks, that have announced new rules mandating masks. In a statement, McDonald's said that nearly 82% of its restaurants are in regions that require masks. Experts agree that wearing masks helps to prevent the spread of Covid-19. McDonald's said they were taking steps to also assist customers who refuse or are unable to wear a mask. ""In those situations where a customer declines to wear a face covering, weâll put in place additional procedures to take care of them in a friendly, expedited way,"" the statement said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Restricted from travel abroad due to the infection rate, Swedes are holidaying at home Brightly coloured beach towels line the shores of Lake Storsjon, two hours north of Stockholm. Staycations are popular here this summer, thanks to a slew of travel restrictions imposed on Sweden by other countries, due to its coronavirus infection rate. More than 5,500 people have died with Covid-19 in this country of just 10 million. It is one of the highest death rates relative to population size in Europe, and by far the worst among the Nordic nations. Unlike Sweden, the rest all chose to lock down early in the pandemic. ""Maybe we should have taken some more care of each other,"" says Dan Eklund, 31, visiting the lake on his friend's boat. Sweden has largely relied on voluntary social distancing guidelines since the start of the pandemic, including working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. The unusual strategy has attracted global criticism. But according to clinical epidemiologist Helena Nordenstedt, there's no consensus in Sweden's scientific community that the strategy as a whole has failed. Read more.  Reaction to the prime minister's interview with the BBC is continuing to come in. Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said: ""At last Boris Johnson has admitted what we have all known for some time - this government made fundamental mistakes in their handling of the coronavirus crisis. ""However, to try and minimise this as there were some things they could have done differently is not only an enormous understatement, but it is an insult to all those who tragically lost loved ones to the virus. ""This interview has given people more questions than answers. With no remorse for the catastrophic mistakes such as the failure to protect our care homes or a refusal to put a comprehensive plan in place for a second wave, it is clear the prime minster has learnt nothing over the course of the last few months."" Face coverings are now compulsory for customers in shops and supermarkets in England. Globally, the wearing of face coverings and masks has been polarising opinion over the past few weeks - and has become particularly politicised in the US. So why are some people hesitant to wear masks, and is there actually any truth in their claims? The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been investigating false and misleading claims about the health risks of face masks and coverings being shared on social media.Read the full story here. Children at a California summer school earlier this month The latest guidance on schools and childcare from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasises the urgency of getting children back into classrooms in the autumn. The document comes two weeks after President Trump criticised the previous CDC guidance on schools as ""very tough and expensive"". ""It is critically important for our public health to open schools this fall,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield, a Trump appointee, said in a statement announcing the updates. Critics - including many teachers - say it is too early to commit to in-person learning as infections continue to rise across the US. âI am comfortable with that,"" Trump said earlier this week when asked about his 14-year-old son and his school-aged grandchildren returning to classrooms. âI would like to see the schools open 100 percent. And weâll do it safely. Weâll do it carefully,â he said. Despite Trump's efforts, the Maryland private school attended by his son Barron has said they will not fully open in September due to virus concerns. We reported earlier about Boris Johnson's interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has now responded, saying that the prime minister ""has finally admitted the government mishandled its response to the coronavirus"". ""This finally puts to bed the prime minister's previous claim his government 'took the right decisions at the right time',"" Ashworth added. ""It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown, and too slow to take this crisis seriously. ""The threat of a second wave is still very real. It is imperative the government learns the lessons of its mistakes so we can help to save lives."" Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check A major privately run airline in Zambia has been using unproven badges whose manufacturers claim that they can offer protection against viruses. Avideo posted by Mahogany Air,externalon their Facebook page shows cabin crew wearing the badges. Mahogany Air claims without any basis that the badges have âair-purifying virus buster technology that purifies the air around any passenger or crew member wearing it"". The airlineâs CEO, Jim Belemu, told the BBC he believed the badges worked and would offer additional protection but there's no evidence these badges can ward off viruses and bacteria, and some health authorities have issued warnings about them. Similar devices are being sold around the world and at one time were worn by members of the Russian parliament. Some countries have banned them. In Africa, the president of South Sudan and other senior officials were seen using the badges although a government official told the BBC they later stopped wearing them. The substance released by such cards or badges - the bleaching agent chlorine dioxide - is potentially harmful. In April, the US Food and Drug Administration said chlorine dioxide products had not been shown to be safe and effective for any use, including against Covid-19.The agency says the substance, which is a powerful bleaching agent, can cause âserious and potentially life-threatening side effects"". If you're joining us from the US, good morning. To help you catch up, here are the main headlines from your side of the pond. The prime minister says the UK government didn't understand coronavirus in the ""first few weeks and months"" and has acknowledged there were things the government ""could have done differently"" in its handling of the virus. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Boris Johnson said there were ""lessons to be learned"" about how the virus was managed in the early stages. ""We didn't understand (the virus) in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months. ""The single thing that we didn't see at the beginning was the extent to which it was being transmitted asymptomatically from person to person. ""I think it's fair to say that there are things that we need to learn about how we handled it in the early stages."" The prime minister also said there were ""very open questions"" over whether lockdown came too late - a marked change from ministers' previous insistence that the right decisions were taken at the right time. Asked whether there was a delay in implementing a lockdown which ultimately cost lives, he said:
""Maybe there were things we could have done differently and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done differently."" Read the full story here BBC OS Dozens of protesters
have been gathering outside Japan's National Stadium in the capital Tokyo
today, the day that the Tokyo Olympics were due to begin. They've now been
postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. But protesters say
that's too soon for the Games to be held safely. BBC OS
on World Service radiohas been hearing from people in Japan. Tomomi Morisawa lives in the
city of Sapporo on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. She has started a
petition calling for the Tokyo Olympics to be cancelled altogether. ""We have Covid-19.
Will it come to an end in a year? No. Postponing is not an option. Cancellation
is our only option."" Masao Ohkushi lives in
Tokyo. He had tickets for the Games and says he's disappointed by the
postponement. ""In my opinion
Tokyo is safe, but some other countries or cities are not,"" he said. ""I'm expecting that
the virus will become weaker than now next year. But people are so afraid about
the virus now so it's hard to get rid of this mindset. ""It's not only
Tokyo's problem. We, all over the world, need to fix this."" Five states - Alabama, Hawaii, Indiana, Missouri and New Mexico - set new records for single-day infections on Thursday. Meanwhile, Florida and Tennessee each set new state records for most coronavirus-related deaths in a 24-hour period. The US recorded a total of 68,663 new cases on Thursday and 1,114 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The pace of infections across the US is increasing, experts say. It took the US 15 days to jump from 3m to 4m - a milestone the country passed on Thursday. It previously took 45 days to go from 1m to 2m infections, the Washington Post reports, and the leap from 2m cases to 3m took 27 days.  Another 123 deaths have been reported in hospitals, care homes and the community in the UK, according tocoronavirus.data.gov.uk,external. It brings the total number of deaths following a positive Covid-19 test result to 45,677. There were also a further 770 cases confirmed through testing. The daily death toll figures continue to be published by Public Health England on the coronavirus dashboard, but the government haslaunched a reviewinto them over concerns that the figures from England may include some people who died months after a positive test.

"The prime minister is set to announce new measures to curb obesity next week, and they are expected to include a ban on TV junk food adverts before 21:00. It comes amid growing evidence people who are overweight or obese are at greater risk from coronavirus. The measures are yet to be finalised but are also likely to include a ban on online ads for unhealthy foods, and limits on in-store promotions. One food industry leader said it was a ""slap in the face"". The move marks a change in stance by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and described his views on tackling obesity as ""libertarian"". Mr Johnson's experience in intensive care during his treatment for Covid-19 is thought to have contributed to his changing position. Speaking during a visit to a GP surgery in east London, he said that while he was not normally one for ""nannying or bossying"", the country did need to lose weight to protect from a second spike. He said: ""Obesity is one of the real co-morbidity factors. Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus."" Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? Does being overweight or obese affect how ill people get with coronavirus? Obesity study shows increased disease and death risks Obesity strategies have had a chequered recent history. David Cameron, backed by NHS leaders, was all set to unveil wide-ranging curbs on food marketing and advertising in England in the summer of 2016. Then he abruptly left office and his successor Theresa May watered down or ditched most of the ideas. Two years later she had changed her view, and her Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans to ban fast food advertising before the 21:00 TV watershed and prevent supermarkets from promoting unhealthy food products in stores. These plans were put out to consultation but were left in limbo when Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street a year ago. His comments about the ""continuing creep of the nanny state"" and the need for a review of ""sin taxes"" were taken to mean he was against further intervention on people's diet choices. But he has shifted, and most of the 2018 plan now seems set to be implemented. It could have been enacted by now but, whatever the timing, the measures - including sweeping changes to the way food is advertised, are a significant move to tackle one of the biggest health challenges of our times. Ministers are still finalising the detail of some anti-obesity measures, such as whether to require more prominent labelling of food and drinks with high levels of sugar or salt. Some restaurants could be required to put calorie labels on menus. It is thought Mr Johnson is likely to push ahead with advertising restrictions, and is considering banning in-store promotions of unhealthy foods. BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo said: ""Although it goes against his political instincts, Boris Johnson now wants to give the strategy a renewed push. ""He's previously been sceptical of taxes on unhealthy food and drinks and it's not yet clear how far his proposals will go beyond what's been suggested before. ""Though obesity is linked to a whole host of health problems, the prime minister has clearly been prompted into action by the coronavirus connection."" Tim Rycroft, chief operating officer of the Food and Drink Federation, said the rumoured move was a ""slap in the face"" to the food industry, which he said had worked ""heroically"" to keep the nation fed during the pandemic. ""It is going to ban promotions of food 10 days before the chancellor launches the biggest food promotion the country has ever seen,"" he told Today. ""It is going to put enormous costs on the advertising industry and on broadcasters at a time when the economy is in quite a tenuous situation."" A letter from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising sent to the prime minister said a government impact assessment last year showed a 21:00 watershed on high fat, sugar and salt food and drinks would only remove around 1.7 calories per day from a child's diet - the equivalent of half a Smartie. In the letter, director general Paul Bainsfair wrote: ""The introduction of such a draconian measure at this time could have deep repercussions for agencies and the advertising sector, generally, in terms of jobs and creative output, for very little end result."" Health and Social Care Minister Helen Whately told BBC Breakfast an announcement was due ""imminently"". She said she recognised obesity was ""possibly the greatest health challenge"" the country faced - ""particularly with Covid"". Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed the prime minister's experience in St Thomas's hospital had been a ""game changer"" and that it was understood the aim was to get people to lose weight ""prior to the next spike"". He said: ""There hasn't been a ban like this but it has got to be given a try - and if after a period of time it is shown not to be so effective, then maybe it will stop. ""It is indeed a risk but the problem is that the consequence of obesity is so great that risks and daring measures have to be put in place."" He called for the sugar tax on soft drinks to be extended to other products. The NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese. Another measure of excess fat is waist size - men with a waist of 94cm or more and women with a waist of 80cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related problems.

"Covid-19 has taken a disproportionate toll on those with underlying health conditions. Some experts say the crisis has shone a light on the poor state of our health as a nation. But in many communities it has also highlighted the link between ill health and poverty. So what lessons has coronavirus taught us - and will ministers and health leaders act upon them? Those with type 2 diabetes, often associated with being overweight or obese, have been particularly vulnerable to falling seriously ill with Covid-19. About a fifth of all those who have died after contracting coronavirus had diabetes. Roxana Falfara knows that she falls into that dangerous category. Ever since she was a child, Roxana has had a difficult relationship with food. She understands that her eating is tied up with her mental health, but says that doesn't make it any easier to manage. Roxanna Falfara: ""I had this anxiety of going out, especially with knowing I have type 2 diabetes"" ""Every time you sit at a table you meet your demons. So you meet the addiction every time you have to eat."" As an adult, Roxana became very overweight and developed type 2 diabetes. Now she's trying to eat more healthily and lose weight ahead of a second bout of surgery. But, with her heightened vulnerability to Covid-19, the past few months have been tough for her. ""I had this anxiety of going out, especially with knowing I have type 2 diabetes,"" she says. ""I'm at a high level of danger so I tried to avoid going out as much as I could."" In her home town of Sheffield, about 60% of the adult population is overweight or obese. And like Roxana, that group was among those at greatest risk of falling seriously ill during the pandemic. The coronavirus has exposed the deep inequalities in our health. What happened in Sheffield at the height of the coronavirus pandemic reflects what happened in many towns and cities across the UK. The more affluent areas of Sheffield escaped pretty much unscathed. But in the poorer parts of the city, they saw some of the highest mortality rates in the entire country. For the director of public health in Sheffield, Greg Fell, that raises some really difficult questions about the underlying state of our public health. He describes it as a complex, multi-layered picture. ""It's the environments in which we live. It's the poverty, it's the poor housing, it's the lack of educational opportunities, it's the job opportunities,"" he says. ""Economic policy, housing policy, all of those things make a difference to health, far more so than the treatment the NHS can provide."" So what has this coronavirus pandemic told us about the underlying state of our health - and more broadly, our society? Earlier this year,externalan influential report warned that life expectancy - particularly among the poor - had stalled. Now the author of that report, Sir Michael Marmot, says coronavirus has reinforced the connection between poverty and ill health. ""Health and health equity, the fair distribution of health, tell us a great deal about how well society is doing,"" he says. ""And the fact that health stopped improving, life expectancy has stalled, and inequality in life expectancy is increasing - that told us that over the last decade, society had stopped improving and inequalities in society had been increasing. ""So when the pandemic came, it just exaggerated, it exposed and amplified those inequalities."" For many public health experts, the coronavirus crisis is the inevitable consequence of decades-long failure to address our unhealthy habits. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Prof John Wass has spent much of his professional life studying a pandemic that has been growing steadily for decades - obesity. ""The fact that we have one of the highest death rates in the world is something which really does need to be understood,"" he says. ""We are not a healthy nation with regard to, for example, the statistics for obesity, the statistics for diabetes, and so on. ""This is not a simple thing. It's not just selling fewer McDonalds on the high street. ""We need a situation where health is linked to education, it's linked to healthy eating and agriculture, it's linked to business. ""So we need a joined-up approach between all the government departments. ""It's complicated - but this is a complicated thing that needs a solution."" Governments set the direction of policy, but the job of creating real change on the ground falls to people like Sheffield's director of public health. And despite the challenges posed by coronavirus,  Greg Fell is still optimistic that the situation we find ourselves in might present an opportunity. ""We know that we have neglected the health of the public for many, many years,"" he says. ""Now is a perfect time to start to put some of that right. ""We know that health is unequally distributed. We know that people who are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds live shorter lives and in poorer health than those of us who are white British. ""We know that those who are disabled live shorter lives in poorer health. We know those who live in the poorest parts of our towns have shorter lives and poorer health. ""So now's a perfect time to put that right, there's never been a better time to put that right."" As communities across the UK reflect on their experience of coronavirus, the challenge for political leaders is how to apply the lessons of the pandemic. It's hard to draw any conclusion other than a real transformation of our nation's health will need fundamental changes in society.

"Face coverings are now compulsory for customers in shops in England, after new coronavirus rules came into force within 12 hours of the government issuing guidance on the change. Coverings are mandatory in enclosed public spaces such as supermarkets, indoor shopping centres, transport hubs, banks and takeaways. Police can hand out fines of up to Â£100 to those who do not comply. But some retailers have insisted they will not enforce the rule. The deaths of another 123 people in the UK who have tested positive for Covid-19 been announced, taking the number to have died to 45,677. There were also a further 770 cases confirmed through testing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government's ability to ease social-distancing measures and face-mask rules depended on it being able to drive down the level of the virus. ""The message is - we have done very well, the virus is under control to a very large extent but it is still there,"" he said during a visit to a GP surgery. He said he believed the UK would be ""well past"" coronavirus by the middle of next year, saying: ""We have tough times ahead in coming through economically, but I have absolutely no doubt that we are going to, and this country is going to bounce back stronger than ever before."" Costa Coffee said their staff would not challenge customers who entered their stores without masks. Sainsbury's also said that staff members would not be individually responsible for challenging customers - but added that stores would have regular Tannoy announcements asking customers to follow the new rules. Asda said enforcement was the ""responsibility of the relevant authorities"". Waitrose has positioned staff at shop doors reminding customers of the rule, and Tesco is selling face coverings at store entrances. Greggs and McDonalds say takeaway customers need to wear masks. Live updates: Latest coronavirus developments The day England's shoppers put on their face coverings Shops or trains - where do I need to cover my face? Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask How to make your own face mask According to guidanceissued by the government,externalon Thursday for England, staff in premises where face coverings are required are encouraged to take steps to ""promote compliance with the law"" and can refuse entry to people who do not have a valid exemption under the rules. But the government says it was the responsibility of individuals to wear a covering. Ragini Patel says one customer was aggressive when she reminded him of social distancing rules By Hazel Shearing ""Oh, better put our masks on,"" a woman says to her friend outside a homeware shop in Camberwell. He shrugs and follows her inside, opting to go without. Most people are wearing face coverings inside the shops on this South London high street, but this exchange sums up the dilemma for some shopkeepers. Ragini Patel says she asks customers to wear face coverings in her stationery shop, but some older customers, in particular, don't listen. ""There's no point saying anything to anybody, you don't want to get in trouble,"" she shrugs. In Scope charity shop, Dawn Suleyman says only one customer has come in today without one - and was grateful when she handed her a spare. ""I wouldn't say to someone 'you can't come in because you haven't got a mask on',"" she says. ""I'd explain to them, 'You do realise that you could possibly get a fine? And if you haven't got a mask I'm happy to give you one'."" This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Police will be able to ""use force"" to remove customers from shops if they do not wear face coverings, or to prevent them from entering, according to the College of Policing. Butindividual forces have saidthey will only be enforcing the rules, including issuing fines, as a last resort - and officers will not be patrolling premises. Health Minister Helen Whately said the government was confident ""the vast majority of people"" would comply with the regulations. In Scotland, where face coverings in shops became compulsory on 10 July,one person has been finedfor failing to wear one. Can police make me wear a face mask or covering? There are exemptions to the new rules for children under 11, those with disabilities or certain health conditions, such as respiratory or cognitive impairments that make it difficult for them to wear a face covering. Ms Whately said people could print outa card from the government's website,externalto show they were exempt if they wished, but stressed people would not be expected to carry proof of an exemption. Public Health England has warned parents not to buy coverings for babies and young children because of the risk of choking or suffocation. Masks will not be mandatory in indoor venues that have other safety measures in place, including: Eat-in restaurants Pubs Hairdressers and salons Gyms and leisure centres Cinemas, concert halls and theatres Visitor attractions such as museums Libraries For some people with certain health conditions or disabilities, wearing a mask can be more difficult. Kerise Vowles-Myners, who has autism, had a particularly bad experience when she tried wearing one to visit the doctor last week. ""I literally had it on for two minutes and had a panic attack and threw up in public - it was quite embarrassing,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Kerise said she had spoken to her social worker about going shopping for her when she had bad days. ""I don't like being confronted because I have to explain myself,"" she said. ""Whenever I go out, a lot of people don't even realise that I'm on the spectrum so they just look at me and think, 'Oh she is just a normal person, why is she not wearing a mask?'"" Retail and trade organisations have criticised the government over the time it took to publish guidance on masks - after thechanges were announced 10 days ago. Meanwhile, union leaders voiced fears the rules could put workers' safety at risk if people refused to wear a mask or became abusive. The British Retail Consortium called on customers to be ""respectful"" of the new rules, while UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said takeaway outlets had been left with ""a very short time to properly brief staff, prepare signage and take steps to encourage compliance"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? According to the government,,externalface coverings should cover the mouth and nose and can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that securely fits around the side of the face without having to be held in place. The requirement to wear face coverings at transport hubs - railway and bus stations, airports and maritime ports - only applies for areas which are fully indoors and enclosed. You are allowed to remove a face covering in certain situations, for example to prove identification in banks or when buying age-restricted products. Face coverings have been compulsory in shops in Scotland since 10 July. Shoppers are not currently required to wear them in Wales or Northern Ireland, althoughNI will wait until 20 August before decidingwhether to make them compulsory. Coverings are already compulsory on public transport in England and Scotland, as well as most buses, trains and ferries in Northern Ireland. They will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July.

"Beauty salons will be able to reopen on Monday Cinemas, museums and beauty salons in Wales have been given the green light to reopen on Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed the latest moves to ease coronavirus restrictions in Wales. Face masks on public transport, including taxis, will also be made compulsory for anyone over the age of 11 on the same day. Meanwhile campsites and accommodation with shared facilities can reopen on Saturday. Mr Drakeford said people would need to get used to ""some changes"" to help protect themselves and people working in reopening businesses. ""This may mean having to book ahead or giving our details to the places we are visiting, to help our test, trace, protect service, in the event there's an outbreak of coronavirus,"" he said.

"The prime minister is set to announce new measures to curb obesity next week, and they are expected to include a ban on TV junk food adverts before 21:00. It comes amid growing evidence people who are overweight or obese are at greater risk from coronavirus. The measures are yet to be finalised but are also likely to include a ban on online ads for unhealthy foods, and limits on in-store promotions. One food industry leader said it was a ""slap in the face"". The move marks a change in stance by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and described his views on tackling obesity as ""libertarian"". Mr Johnson's experience in intensive care during his treatment for Covid-19 is thought to have contributed to his changing position. Speaking during a visit to a GP surgery in east London, he said that while he was not normally one for ""nannying or bossying"", the country did need to lose weight to protect from a second spike. He said: ""Obesity is one of the real co-morbidity factors. Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus."" Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? Does being overweight or obese affect how ill people get with coronavirus? Obesity study shows increased disease and death risks Obesity strategies have had a chequered recent history. David Cameron, backed by NHS leaders, was all set to unveil wide-ranging curbs on food marketing and advertising in England in the summer of 2016. Then he abruptly left office and his successor Theresa May watered down or ditched most of the ideas. Two years later she had changed her view, and her Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans to ban fast food advertising before the 21:00 TV watershed and prevent supermarkets from promoting unhealthy food products in stores. These plans were put out to consultation but were left in limbo when Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street a year ago. His comments about the ""continuing creep of the nanny state"" and the need for a review of ""sin taxes"" were taken to mean he was against further intervention on people's diet choices. But he has shifted, and most of the 2018 plan now seems set to be implemented. It could have been enacted by now but, whatever the timing, the measures - including sweeping changes to the way food is advertised, are a significant move to tackle one of the biggest health challenges of our times. Ministers are still finalising the detail of some anti-obesity measures, such as whether to require more prominent labelling of food and drinks with high levels of sugar or salt. Some restaurants could be required to put calorie labels on menus. It is thought Mr Johnson is likely to push ahead with advertising restrictions, and is considering banning in-store promotions of unhealthy foods. BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo said: ""Although it goes against his political instincts, Boris Johnson now wants to give the strategy a renewed push. ""He's previously been sceptical of taxes on unhealthy food and drinks and it's not yet clear how far his proposals will go beyond what's been suggested before. ""Though obesity is linked to a whole host of health problems, the prime minister has clearly been prompted into action by the coronavirus connection."" Tim Rycroft, chief operating officer of the Food and Drink Federation, said the rumoured move was a ""slap in the face"" to the food industry, which he said had worked ""heroically"" to keep the nation fed during the pandemic. ""It is going to ban promotions of food 10 days before the chancellor launches the biggest food promotion the country has ever seen,"" he told Today. ""It is going to put enormous costs on the advertising industry and on broadcasters at a time when the economy is in quite a tenuous situation."" A letter from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising sent to the prime minister said a government impact assessment last year showed a 21:00 watershed on high fat, sugar and salt food and drinks would only remove around 1.7 calories per day from a child's diet - the equivalent of half a Smartie. In the letter, director general Paul Bainsfair wrote: ""The introduction of such a draconian measure at this time could have deep repercussions for agencies and the advertising sector, generally, in terms of jobs and creative output, for very little end result."" Health and Social Care Minister Helen Whately told BBC Breakfast an announcement was due ""imminently"". She said she recognised obesity was ""possibly the greatest health challenge"" the country faced - ""particularly with Covid"". Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed the prime minister's experience in St Thomas's hospital had been a ""game changer"" and that it was understood the aim was to get people to lose weight ""prior to the next spike"". He said: ""There hasn't been a ban like this but it has got to be given a try - and if after a period of time it is shown not to be so effective, then maybe it will stop. ""It is indeed a risk but the problem is that the consequence of obesity is so great that risks and daring measures have to be put in place."" He called for the sugar tax on soft drinks to be extended to other products. The NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese. Another measure of excess fat is waist size - men with a waist of 94cm or more and women with a waist of 80cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related problems.

"This video can not be played Marine experts tried in vain to rescue the stranded shark A shark which had got stranded in shallow waters on the Yorkshire coast has been put down, according to a marine charity. The basking shark was spotted in the water trying to beach itself at Filey in North Yorkshire, on Thursday. The beach was closed while a lifeboat crew tried to prevent it from beaching and to get it back out to sea. Marine charity Sea Watch said it was believed the creature was ill and the decision was made to euthanise it. This video can not be played The shark had attempted to beach itself and could not be persuaded to go back out to sea Sea Watch's Robin Petch said: ""It was in the shallows in Filey Bay trying to beach itself and members of the public, the Coastguard and the RNLI were in attendance trying to stop it and persuade it to go out to sea. ""There was a vet in attendance and in the end they decided the best thing to do for the animal was to euthanise it."" More news and stories from Yorkshire Basking sharks are an endangered species The basking shark is the largest shark found in UK seas They can be up to 12 metres in length and weigh up to six tonnes Despite their size, they feed on zooplankton They are believed to have an average lifespan of about 50 years They are most commonly seen in the summer, when they arrive in British waters The large, black, triangular dorsal fin moves slowly through the water, with the tail tip and bulbous snout often visible above the waves They are found all around the UK coast, but most frequently sited around the south-west of England, Wales, Isle of Man and west coast of Scotland The North East Atlantic population are classed as endangered and are protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Source: The Wildlife Trusts Rescuers from British Divers Marine Life Rescue took part in efforts to try and get the animal back into deeper water. A spokesperson said: ""Unfortunately, the shark appeared to be struggling as it was listing consistently over to its right-hand side and circling in the shallows, sometimes needing support from the rescuers."" ""Despite attempts to move it into deeper water the shark continued to head back to the beach where it restranded and later in the evening was put to sleep by a vet due to the poor prognosis."" The RNLI's Filey lifeboat was called at about 18:00 BST when the shark was spotted in the water close to the beach Basking sharks are the second largest fish in the oceans. Despite their size they only feed on zooplankton and are not considered a danger to humans. ""This one was a little under four and a half metres, so it was a young one, not a juvenile but not quite an adult,"" Mr Petch said. ""They can grow quite large - the biggest ones recorded are about 10 to 11 metres."" He said they were usually found in deeper waters and it was possible the animal had been ill and come into shore. It could also have got trapped in the shallow waters and then been starved of oxygen. Basking sharks are an endangered species.

More than half the population of England will be offered a free flu jab this winter - to try to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed by seasonal flu and Covid 19. Rob England and Jay Vydelingum From Friday, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests. Rob EnglandBBC News Our live coverage on the coronavirus pandemic across England has finished for this week. We'll be back on Monday from 09:00 with all the latest news and updates. Have a great weekend. Claire Gilbody-DickersonBBC News Theatre Royal Plymouthâs famous statue is helping Plymouth City Council spread the message to wear a mask - by wearing one herself. A mask has been put on the 10-tonne statue in a bid to encourage everyone to abide by thenow mandatory use of face coverings in enclosed public areas. Plymouth City Councilsaid in a post on Twitter,external: ""Wear a mask. ""Thatâs the message from Messenger.@TRPlymouth,external's famous statue is helping us spread the message that from today the law states that you must wear a mask â or face covering - in enclosed public spaces."" The law gives police the power to issue Â£100 fines to those who do not comply with it. Leisure centres in Bedfordwill remain shutbecause of recent high Covid-19 infection rates. In June, the town hadEngland's sixth-highest infection ratebut while rates are declining, the latest figures show twice as many cases as the previous week. The council said the decision was due to indoor facilities being ""more susceptible to the virus being spread"". It said they would reopen when they are ""safe and viable"". David PittamBBC News Online Shoppers in the first city in England to
have a local lockdown have been grappling with new rules on masks as
non-essential stores were given the green light to reopen. Clothes shops were among those
allowed to welcome back customers in Leicester today, following the relaxation
of local measures imposed on 29 June after a spike in coronavirus infections in the city. Security on the door of the city's
Primark store made sure shoppers entering wore face coverings, which became mandatory across England today. Melinda Moore, 25, said she ""absolutely hates"" wearing the mask. She said: ""I've got to wear one at work and now out of it too."" Waad Ekwas, 22, from Hamilton, said the mask was inconvenient on a warm day when she was already wearing a headscarf. ""It's so annoying,"" she said. ""But we have to wear it. We know it's not protecting us but it's stopping any droplets spreading. That's a priority over comfort."" In Liverpool One shopping complex on Friday, signs telling customers to wear masks were up in many of the stores and a vending machine selling face coverings had been installed. The machine has packs of five three-ply masks for Â£4.75, packets of two for Â£1.95 or fashion coverings for Â£5.95. Susan Green, 57, from Liverpool, was wearing a clear visor, which she had bought from a nearby shop, as she waited for HMV to open. She said: ""I think it is a little bit late to have introduced this and lots of people I've seen this morning are not even wearing one. ""It won't put me off coming to the shops because I'll be out anyway but it does seem a bit unnecessary."" Rob EnglandBBC News A further 16 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, according to NHS figures. This brings the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,247. NHS England said the patients were aged between 58 and 104 years old and all had known underlying health conditions. No deaths were reported in the East of England, London and South West regions. The prime minister is set to announce new measures to curb obesity next week, and they are expected to include a ban on TV junk food adverts before 21:00. It comes amid growing evidence people who are overweight or obese are at greater risk from coronavirus. The measures are yet to be finalised but are also likely to include a ban on online ads for unhealthy foods, and limits on in-store promotions. One food industry leader said it was a ""slap in the face"". A minibus carrying food packaging workers has been identified as the source of a coronavirus outbreak. Fourteen staff at Evesham Vale Growers Limited in Worcestershire tested positivefor Covid-19 since Monday. Public Health officials have now traced the cases to a minibus which transported workers from Sandwell, where another outbreak was identified. All 340 staff at the plant are now being tested for the virus, with results expected over the weekend. Judith Molloy, from St Helens, was wearing a mask as she did some shopping in Liverpool One this morning. ""I'm vulnerable and so is my husband. I think this should have started from day one,"" she said. The 72-year-old added she'd seen many people around without maskson the first day they became mandatory to wear in shops. ""I was on the bus this morning and people were getting on with no masks. If you go in to a shop without a mask I don't think anyone is going to say anything. ""I think people are more relaxed now."" A charity is due to close after the coronavirus crisis ""compounded"" its ""financial challenges"". Age UK Suffolk's services cost Â£2m a year to run but it has seen a fall in fundraising and paid for services during the pandemic. It said a full review of what it offers had ""not been enough to fully mitigate"" these effects and 145 staff were being made redundant on Friday. The county council said it would ""help to ensure the essential gap is filled"". In Leicester,where non-essential shops have been able to openafter a local lockdown was imposed, eager shoppersare also having to handle the new rules on face coverings. Returning from a visit to the post office, student Frank Boakye said he'd been opting to wear a mask since lockdown began ""for my own protection"". ""Everyone I saw in the post office was wearing a mask,"" the 29-year-old said. ""It's a very good idea."" Callum Goodson, a buyer with independent clothes store Pilot, in the busy Lanes shopping district of Leicester said levels of compliance from customers on mask-wearing rules had been high in the city so far. The 22-year-old said: ""Everyone coming into the store and staff have been wearing masks. If anyone does come in without a mask, we can offer them one. If they refuse it's down to us if we accept that - but we haven't had to do that so far."" On a visit to a GP surgery, Boris Johnson has called people who oppose vaccinations ""nuts"". During the visit, he told reporters that one of the best ways people can safeguard themselves against coronavirus is to lose some weight.

"We are now - again - one year away from the start of the Olympics in Tokyo For some athletes, today was the last chance to take part in the Tokyo Olympics. They are too old, too exhausted or too financially stretched to wait for another year, after the pandemic forced its postponement. One of them is 35-year-old Tetsuya Sotomura. When I met him on a sweltering afternoon earlier this week he was still hard at it in a converted factory building in a north Tokyo suburb, flying high into the air, spinning and tumbling on a massive trampoline. Back in 2008 Tetsuya placed 4th at the Beijing Olympics, just missing a bronze medal. Since then he's fought injury that put him out of London in 2012 and Rio in 2016. Tokyo was to be his last hurrah, a hometown Olympics to end his trampolining career on a high. But another year is just too much. ""Back in 2008, if the Beijing Games had been postponed by a year I would have thought ok, it's another year to train, another year to grow,"" he tells me. ""But now I am 35. A year feels like a very long time. So, I have decided retirement is the only option."" Tetsuya Sotomura believes retirement is now his only option But there is another reason Tetsuya is getting off the trampoline. He thinks Tokyo 2021 may never happen. ""It's so uncertain. No-one knows the probability. If what awaits us next year is cancellation, I would have lost another year for nothing. So that is another reason to go now."" Enthusiasm for the Games has plummeted in Japan since Covid-19 arrived here in January. The Japanese government has closed Japan's borders to most foreigners to protect the country from imported cases, and many Japanese people are in no hurry to see them re-open for athletes or spectators. After retirement, Tetsuya is helping and coaching at his old trampoline gym in the north of Tokyo TV reporters have been visiting the towns due to host various foreign teams and asking locals how they feel. The residents of a town north of Tokyo due to host the Brazilian team were clearly struggling to maintain any semblance of enthusiasm. An opinion poll by the Kyodo news agency found just 23% of people in Japan now support holding the games if Covid-19 infections are still widespread next year. The latest figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) do not make for happy viewing. More than 15 million infections worldwide, and that number is growing by about a million every four to five days. Tokyo Olympics postponement leaves UK firms in limbo London 2012 - 10 things you may have forgotten What is the best British Olympic moment? From the US to Brazil, from India to South Africa, suppression efforts are failing and infections are surging. Of course, a year feels like a long time, but many health experts say it is now very unlikely the pandemic will be contained by next summer. At Kobe University Hospital in western Japan, Prof Kentaro Iwata says the only hope for the Olympics is a vaccine. The status of the Olympics will remain uncertain without a vaccine, officials fear ""If a vaccine is available it could be a game changer,"" he says. ""Phase 1 and 2 trials have some promising results. I have not lost hope. ""But generally speaking vaccines don't eradicate a virus, they lower the incidence by about half. So, I don't think Covid-19 can be eradicated. Instead [even with a vaccine] it will continue into 2021."" Prof Iwata is particularly concerned looking at what is going on in the US, the country that more than any other pays for the Olympics. ""The US will suffer from Covid for many months to come,"" he says. ""Can athletes come from the US come here? Can we have the Olympics without Americans? Most likely not. The priority must be the safety of the athletes and of Japanese people. ""The US TV companies may not like that, but is the Olympics a sports competition or a TV show?"" There is one seemingly simple solution: push the Tokyo Games back another year to 2022. It is far more likely the pandemic will have run its course by then. But that has been ruled out by the Japanese government. From his home in Montreal the longest-serving member of the International Olympic Committee, Dick Pound, told me it is now 2021 or bust. ""What we do know is 2021 is our last chance,"" he says. ""It's not something we can put off until 2022 or 2023. I don't think it's fair to expect Japan to keep the balls in the air any longer. To the extent that it's safe for the athletes to come, every effort will be made for the Games to go forward. ""That said, if public health authorities in Japan and around the world conclude that it's not safe enough, there is probably no alternative but to say, 'oh well, the pandemic is the new war'."" The only occasions the Olympic Games have been cancelled was during the two World Wars, and one of those was - you guessed it - Tokyo, in 1940. A ceremony was held to reset the clock So how about one final idea: a much-simplified Games, with foreign athletes going through quarantine before arrival but foreign spectators kept away? According to Dick Pound, this is a non-starter. ""In the North American phrase - you either have the fish or cut bait,"" he says. ""Japan would have to decide, do they want the Games to go ahead or are the risks too much? In which case Japan would probably propose, and the IOC would accept, cancellation."" On Thursday night inside the Olympic stadium they held a ceremony to reset the clock, one year until the opening ceremony.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe insists the Games must go on but Covid-19 is almost certainly not listening.

"The US has reportedly been given until Monday to close its Consulate-General in Chengdu China has ordered the closure of the US consulate in the south-western city of Chengdu, in a tit-for-tat escalation between the two countries. China said the move was in response to the US closing its consulate in Houston, and accused staff in Chengdu of meddling in its internal affairs. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US decision was taken because China was ""stealing"" intellectual property. Tensions have been rising between the US and China over several key issues. President Donald Trump's administration has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic, as well as China's imposition of a controversial new security law in Hong Kong. On Friday, Washington urged China to ""cease these malign actions rather than engage in tit-for-tat retaliation"". The US-China battle behind the scenes What's behind Trump's new strategy on China? China's move came hours after Mr Pompeo hardened his tone further in a speech on Thursday at the library of former President Richard Nixon, whose 1972 China visit heralded a period of improved relations. ""Today, China is increasingly authoritarian at home, and more aggressive in its hostility to freedom everywhere else,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""The free world must triumph over this new tyranny."" On Friday, China's foreign ministry said it was closing the US consulate in Chengdu after staff there ""interfered in China's internal affairs, and endangered China's security and interests"". During a news conference, ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin also saidthe US decision to close the consulate in Houstonwas based on ""a hodgepodge of anti-Chinese lies"". He said Mr Pompeo's announcement on Thursday was ""filled with ideological bias and a Cold War mentality."" ""Pompeo made a speech in which he made a malicious attack on the Chinese Communist Party,"" Mr Wang said, adding: ""To this, China expresses strong indignation and resolute opposition."" The US consulate in Chengdu employs more than 200 people, the majority of them hired locally The ministry earlier said that the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu was a ""legitimate and necessary response"" to the actions taken by the US. ""The current situation between China and the United States is something China does not want to see, and the US bears all responsibility for that."" China has given the US until Monday to close the consulate in Chengdu, according to the editor of China's Global Times. The mission, established in 1985 and currently having more than 200 staff - 150 hired locally - is seen as strategically important because it allows the US to gather information on the autonomous region of Tibet, where there has been long-running pressure for independence. With its industry and growing services sector, Chengdu also is seen by the US as providing opportunities for exports of agricultural products, cars and machinery. On Tuesday, the US government ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, Texas, by Friday. The move came after unidentified individuals were filmed burning paper in bins in the building's courtyard. This video can not be played Men are filmed using a hose and closing rubbish bins at China's consulate in Houston Mr Pompeo accused China of stealing ""not just American intellectual property... but European intellectual property too... costing hundreds of thousands of jobs"". ""We are setting out clear expectations for how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave. And when they don't, we're going to take actions,"" he said. The Chinese consulate in Houston was one of five in the US, along with the embassy in Washington DC. It was not clear why it was singled out. China's foreign ministry spokeswoman said the reasons given by the US for closing the consulate were ""unbelievably ridiculous"". Hua Chunying urged the US to reverse its ""erroneous decision"", or China would ""react with firm countermeasures"". In a further US move,four Chinese nationals have been charged with visa fraudfor allegedly lying about their membership of China's armed forces. On Friday, US officials told reporters a Chinese student who fled to China's consulate in San Francisco was now in US custody. Three others were arrested earlier. Separately, a Singaporean man has pleaded guilty at a federal court in Washington to a charge of operating as an illegal agent of the Chinese government, John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security, said on Friday. Jun Wei Yeo, also known as Dickson Yeo, was charged with using his political consultancy in the US as a front to collect information for Chinese intelligence. US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping There are a number of things at play. US officials have blamed China for the global spread of Covid-19. More specifically, President Trump has alleged, without evidence, that the virus originated from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan. And, in unsubstantiated remarks, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said in March that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan. The US and China have also been locked in a tariff war since 2018. US-China trade war in 300 words Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft, but in Beijing there is a perception that the US is trying to curb its rise as a global economic power. The US has also imposed sanctions on Chinese politicianswho it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.  China is accused of mass detentions, religious persecution and forced sterilisation of Uighurs and others. Beijing denies the allegations and has accused the US of ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs. China's imposition of a sweeping security law there is also a source of tension with the US and the UK, which ruled the territory until 1997. In response,the US last week revoked Hong Kong's special trading status, which allowed it to avoid tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the US. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Trump hits China with order on Hong Kong trade The US and UK see the security law as a threat to the freedoms Hong Kong has enjoyed under a 1984 agreement between China and the UK - before sovereignty reverted to Beijing.

"The US has reportedly been given until Monday to close its Consulate-General in Chengdu China has ordered the closure of the US consulate in the south-western city of Chengdu, in a tit-for-tat escalation between the two countries. China said the move was in response to the US closing its consulate in Houston, and accused staff in Chengdu of meddling in its internal affairs. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US decision was taken because China was ""stealing"" intellectual property. Tensions have been rising between the US and China over several key issues. President Donald Trump's administration has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic, as well as China's imposition of a controversial new security law in Hong Kong. On Friday, Washington urged China to ""cease these malign actions rather than engage in tit-for-tat retaliation"". The US-China battle behind the scenes What's behind Trump's new strategy on China? China's move came hours after Mr Pompeo hardened his tone further in a speech on Thursday at the library of former President Richard Nixon, whose 1972 China visit heralded a period of improved relations. ""Today, China is increasingly authoritarian at home, and more aggressive in its hostility to freedom everywhere else,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""The free world must triumph over this new tyranny."" On Friday, China's foreign ministry said it was closing the US consulate in Chengdu after staff there ""interfered in China's internal affairs, and endangered China's security and interests"". During a news conference, ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin also saidthe US decision to close the consulate in Houstonwas based on ""a hodgepodge of anti-Chinese lies"". He said Mr Pompeo's announcement on Thursday was ""filled with ideological bias and a Cold War mentality."" ""Pompeo made a speech in which he made a malicious attack on the Chinese Communist Party,"" Mr Wang said, adding: ""To this, China expresses strong indignation and resolute opposition."" The US consulate in Chengdu employs more than 200 people, the majority of them hired locally The ministry earlier said that the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu was a ""legitimate and necessary response"" to the actions taken by the US. ""The current situation between China and the United States is something China does not want to see, and the US bears all responsibility for that."" China has given the US until Monday to close the consulate in Chengdu, according to the editor of China's Global Times. The mission, established in 1985 and currently having more than 200 staff - 150 hired locally - is seen as strategically important because it allows the US to gather information on the autonomous region of Tibet, where there has been long-running pressure for independence. With its industry and growing services sector, Chengdu also is seen by the US as providing opportunities for exports of agricultural products, cars and machinery.

"Covid-19 has taken a disproportionate toll on those with underlying health conditions. Some experts say the crisis has shone a light on the poor state of our health as a nation. But in many communities it has also highlighted the link between ill health and poverty. So what lessons has coronavirus taught us - and will ministers and health leaders act upon them? Those with type 2 diabetes, often associated with being overweight or obese, have been particularly vulnerable to falling seriously ill with Covid-19. About a fifth of all those who have died after contracting coronavirus had diabetes. Roxana Falfara knows that she falls into that dangerous category. Ever since she was a child, Roxana has had a difficult relationship with food. She understands that her eating is tied up with her mental health, but says that doesn't make it any easier to manage. Roxanna Falfara: ""I had this anxiety of going out, especially with knowing I have type 2 diabetes"" ""Every time you sit at a table you meet your demons. So you meet the addiction every time you have to eat."" As an adult, Roxana became very overweight and developed type 2 diabetes. Now she's trying to eat more healthily and lose weight ahead of a second bout of surgery. But, with her heightened vulnerability to Covid-19, the past few months have been tough for her. ""I had this anxiety of going out, especially with knowing I have type 2 diabetes,"" she says. ""I'm at a high level of danger so I tried to avoid going out as much as I could."" In her home town of Sheffield, about 60% of the adult population is overweight or obese. And like Roxana, that group was among those at greatest risk of falling seriously ill during the pandemic. The coronavirus has exposed the deep inequalities in our health. What happened in Sheffield at the height of the coronavirus pandemic reflects what happened in many towns and cities across the UK. The more affluent areas of Sheffield escaped pretty much unscathed. But in the poorer parts of the city, they saw some of the highest mortality rates in the entire country. For the director of public health in Sheffield, Greg Fell, that raises some really difficult questions about the underlying state of our public health. He describes it as a complex, multi-layered picture. ""It's the environments in which we live. It's the poverty, it's the poor housing, it's the lack of educational opportunities, it's the job opportunities,"" he says. ""Economic policy, housing policy, all of those things make a difference to health, far more so than the treatment the NHS can provide."" So what has this coronavirus pandemic told us about the underlying state of our health - and more broadly, our society? Earlier this year,externalan influential report warned that life expectancy - particularly among the poor - had stalled. Now the author of that report, Sir Michael Marmot, says coronavirus has reinforced the connection between poverty and ill health. ""Health and health equity, the fair distribution of health, tell us a great deal about how well society is doing,"" he says. ""And the fact that health stopped improving, life expectancy has stalled, and inequality in life expectancy is increasing - that told us that over the last decade, society had stopped improving and inequalities in society had been increasing. ""So when the pandemic came, it just exaggerated, it exposed and amplified those inequalities."" For many public health experts, the coronavirus crisis is the inevitable consequence of decades-long failure to address our unhealthy habits. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Prof John Wass has spent much of his professional life studying a pandemic that has been growing steadily for decades - obesity. ""The fact that we have one of the highest death rates in the world is something which really does need to be understood,"" he says. ""We are not a healthy nation with regard to, for example, the statistics for obesity, the statistics for diabetes, and so on. ""This is not a simple thing. It's not just selling fewer McDonalds on the high street. ""We need a situation where health is linked to education, it's linked to healthy eating and agriculture, it's linked to business. ""So we need a joined-up approach between all the government departments. ""It's complicated - but this is a complicated thing that needs a solution."" Governments set the direction of policy, but the job of creating real change on the ground falls to people like Sheffield's director of public health. And despite the challenges posed by coronavirus,  Greg Fell is still optimistic that the situation we find ourselves in might present an opportunity. ""We know that we have neglected the health of the public for many, many years,"" he says. ""Now is a perfect time to start to put some of that right. ""We know that health is unequally distributed. We know that people who are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds live shorter lives and in poorer health than those of us who are white British. ""We know that those who are disabled live shorter lives in poorer health. We know those who live in the poorest parts of our towns have shorter lives and poorer health. ""So now's a perfect time to put that right, there's never been a better time to put that right."" As communities across the UK reflect on their experience of coronavirus, the challenge for political leaders is how to apply the lessons of the pandemic. It's hard to draw any conclusion other than a real transformation of our nation's health will need fundamental changes in society.

"Lockdown in Wales has been the responsibility of the Welsh Government UK ministers have announced Â£1.2bn funding for the Welsh Government. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said it was ""like an advance payment"" ahead of announcements to be made in England. TheBarnett formulais used to decide how much money the other nations receive when the UK government spends in England. The Welsh finance minister said it would ""give the NHS the kind of certainty that it needs"" to plan for a potential second wave of the virus. The Welsh Government has previously said it was ""not clear how much of this package is wholly new"". Mr Hart told BBC Radio Wales: ""What we're trying to do here as a UK-wide project is make sure all the devolved nations have the money they need during Covidâ¦ ""The sum has gone from 2.3 [billion pounds] to 2.8 last week. With the chancellor's announcement it has now gone up by a further 1.2 so the total the Welsh Government will have received for Covid-related activity will be Â£4bn since March... ""It is a consequential of announcements to be made, like an advance payment - still fresh money, still new money... ""It's like get your money up front, in advance, rather than retrospectively."" Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the additional funding would allow the Welsh Government to announce ""a really significant stabilisation package for the NHS"". She added that the money would be used to respond to ""a really wide range of pressures"" such as those faced by local authorities. But it would also enable the government to ""give the NHS the kind of certainty that it needs in order to to plan most effectively for a potential second wave of the coronavirus"" and to ensure that it's ""in good shape"" to cope with winter pressures. The Â£4bn figure does not include direct spending by the Conservative UK government in Wales - such as the furlough scheme or VAT cuts for the tourism and hospitality sector. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the UK government's ""guarantee"" means the Welsh Government can invest to protect jobs Speaking to BBC Radio Wales ahead of Mr Hart's interview, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""It was reported as being clearly additional money over and above Barnett but we don't think that's the case at all and it's one of the difficult and disappointing things that is just unnecessary... ""It is difficult and disappointing because I'd like the public to have a straight message where you don't hear Welsh Government politicians disagreeing with UK government politicians about the state of the money being provided."" 'Â£500m extra for Wales' from chancellor statement The billions being spent on coronavirus in Wales What Covid-19 decisions are made in Wales? The Welsh Government has called for more freedom to borrow cash Welsh Government ministers have previously called for their UK counterparts to allow them to borrow more money to help deal with the pandemic. ""The pressures facing our budget are unrivalled in the post Second World War era,"" a Welsh Government spokesperson said in response to the funding announcement. ""And while we welcome confirmation of Wales' share of spend in England, it is not clear how much of this package is wholly new. ""We fully expected to receive funding on major PPE (personal protective equipment) costs and NHS winter funding. ""We look forward to receiving the full detail on new funding and hope that the UK Treasury will finally lift the restrictions on our ability to access our own savings to address urgent pressures."" Reacting to the announcement, Plaid Cymru's health and finance spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth told BBC Radio Wales: ""The union can't be sewn together with a bung where you don't even know what's in the brown envelope, where we're expected to trust that somehow it's a lot of money. ""What we need, and we're in agreement with Welsh Government actually, is we need additional flexibility with the spending powers that we have in Wales. ""This is the time when we need to be making decisions now on how much money to borrow to get us through this incredibly sticky point in our history... rather than expect to be grateful for somebody filling a begging bowl with money that we don't know how much it is anyway."" Expect to hear UK government ministers talk a lot more about the union in months to come. The pandemic has led to greater awareness of devolved powers - especially health and education. While Welsh Government ministers have faced scrutiny for their response to the pandemic, like being later to test all care home staff and residents, the UK government equally has faced criticisms for being behind on issues like committing to providing free school meals for eligible children during the summer holidays. The prime minister's visit to Scotland, praising the furlough scheme and UK armed forces, and this announcement today send a clear signal: trying to strengthen support for the union is heavily back on the UK government's agenda. Meanwhile a group of MPs have also set up a new pro-union lobby group to keep it on the agenda in government and Parliament, chaired by Conservative Aberconwy MP Robin Millar. Boris Johnson visited Scotland on Thursday The UK government has been in charge of much of the UK's economic response to the virus, including the coronavirus job retention furlough scheme. But devolved governments have been responsible for the severe restrictions on day-to-day life, as well as their national health services, and different parts of the UK have come out of lockdown in different ways. On a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he ""pledged to be a prime minister for every corner of the United Kingdom"", adding that the response to the pandemic had shown his government's commitment to the whole of the UK.

"Boris Johnson says there are ""lessons to be learned"" from the UK's early handling of coronavirus New rules begin in England making it compulsory to wear face coverings in shops The UK is drawing up new measures to curb obesity because of higher risk from the virus India records 49,310 new infections - its highest daily number of cases Cases in the US pass four million with at least 144,000 deaths President Trump cancels the Republican convention in Florida, blaming the virus ""flare-up"" Former UK PM Tony Blair believes coronavirus will not be eliminated Globally there have been more than 15.4m cases and almost 632,000 deaths Edited by Lauren Turner Today our coverage has been brought to you by our journalists in London, Washington DC, Singapore and Sydney. They are: Yvette Tan, Krutika Pathi, Yaroslav Lukov, Frances Mao, Saira Asher, Andreas Illmer, Anna Jones, Sophie Williams, Hazel Shearing, Katie Wright, Patrick Jackson, Paul Kirby, Georgina Rannard, Lauren Turner, Joseph Lee, Ashitha Nagesh and Max Matza. Thank you for joining us for our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today - particularly if you're in a city or country that's currently in lockdown. We're pausing our live page until tomorrow morning (UK time). But to sum up, here are the main headlines from today. Many shoppers were prepared for the new rules on face coverings We're wrapping up today's live page coverage shortly, but if you want to catch up on the day's events, here is what has been happening in the UK. Hazel Shearing & Alex KleidermanBBC News ""Oh, better put our masks on,"" a woman says to her friend outside a homeware shop in Camberwell, south London, fishing around in her bag. He shrugs and follows her inside, opting to go without. It's thefirst day that face coverings have been compulsory for customers in England's shops. But this short exchange sums up the dilemma for some shopkeepers and shoppers. Susan Green, 57, in Liverpool, said: ""I think it is a little bit late to have introduced this and lots of people I've seen this morning are not even wearing one. ""It won't put me off coming to the shops because I'll be out anyway, but it does seem a bit unnecessary."" Read the full story here This video can not be played Boris Johnson: There maybe things we could have done differently Claire MarshallEnvironment correspondent, BBC News Team GB open water swimmer Toby Robinson has been training in the River Soar Figures suggest that more people than ever are heading to Britain's rivers with the easing of lockdown - renewing calls for better public rights of access. It comes as MPs are to consider proposals aimed at opening up the waterways to all. But after recent incidences of overcrowding and littering, there are fears more people on rivers could ""cause chaos"". The Canal & Rivers Trust, British Canoeing, the Outdoor Swimming Society and the Angling Trust all report a surge in interest during lockdown and after the easing of restrictions began. Unlike in Scotland, there is currently no ""right to roam"" equivalent on waterways in England and Wales. The vast majority of rivers in England and Wales - around 95% - are in private hands and access is limited. If you swim, fish or paddle without the right permission, you are breaking the law. ""The Crown owns the water you swim in, while the person who owns the property up to the bank is also said to own the bed of the river up to the middle,"" says Nick Hayes, author of The Book of Trespass. Read more There have been more than 15 million people infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began, and the number of cases is still rising fast in many parts of the world. In parts of the world badly affected during the early stages of the pandemic, including European countries such as Italy, France and the UK, the daily death toll has fallen dramatically. But in other places, such as parts of South America, India and South Africa, the death rate is rising fast. The US has seen the world's highest number of daily cases and deaths in recent days, as infections spiked in a number of states once coronavirus restrictions were relaxed. Among the worst-affected states at the moment are Florida and Louisiana, with high rates of infection in Texas, Arizona, Nevada and across the southern US. The US is not the only country to see coronavirus rise again. Israel, Australia and Japan have seen a second rise in cases after measures against coronavirus appeared to have got the infection under control, while Iran has also seen cases increase sharply. Although he admitted there were ""open questions"" about the government's early response to the virus, Boris Johnson denied that they had been too slow to act. ""If you look at the timing of every single piece of advice that we got from our advisers, from Sage, you will find that whenever they said that we needed to take a particular step, actually, we stuck to that advice like glue,"" he told the BBC. The prime minister also warned that the UK is vulnerable to a second surge, particularly in the winter. ""Collectively, this country has done an incredible thing to get the disease down to the levels it's at. But we all know that it can come back,"" he said. ""And we can see what's happening in other countries - I won't name them - but you can see the resurgence that's happening. We know that we're vulnerable there. ""So that's why we're getting on now with our preparations for the winter... a massive flu vaccination programme, stockpiling PPE, making sure that we ramp up Test and Trace, and making sure that people get tested if they have symptoms."" A McDonald's that is closed for indoor dining in Miami McDonald's has announced that anyone entering one of their 14,000 restaurants in the US will be required to wear a mask starting on 1 August. The fast-food chain joins other major businesses, like Walmart and Starbucks, that have announced new rules mandating masks. In a statement, McDonald's said that nearly 82% of its restaurants are in regions that require masks. Experts agree that wearing masks helps to prevent the spread of Covid-19. McDonald's said they were taking steps to also assist customers who refuse or are unable to wear a mask. ""In those situations where a customer declines to wear a face covering, weâll put in place additional procedures to take care of them in a friendly, expedited way,"" the statement said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Restricted from travel abroad due to the infection rate, Swedes are holidaying at home Brightly coloured beach towels line the shores of Lake Storsjon, two hours north of Stockholm. Staycations are popular here this summer, thanks to a slew of travel restrictions imposed on Sweden by other countries, due to its coronavirus infection rate. More than 5,500 people have died with Covid-19 in this country of just 10 million. It is one of the highest death rates relative to population size in Europe, and by far the worst among the Nordic nations. Unlike Sweden, the rest all chose to lock down early in the pandemic. ""Maybe we should have taken some more care of each other,"" says Dan Eklund, 31, visiting the lake on his friend's boat. Sweden has largely relied on voluntary social distancing guidelines since the start of the pandemic, including working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. The unusual strategy has attracted global criticism. But according to clinical epidemiologist Helena Nordenstedt, there's no consensus in Sweden's scientific community that the strategy as a whole has failed. Read more.  Reaction to the prime minister's interview with the BBC is continuing to come in. Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said: ""At last Boris Johnson has admitted what we have all known for some time - this government made fundamental mistakes in their handling of the coronavirus crisis. ""However, to try and minimise this as there were some things they could have done differently is not only an enormous understatement, but it is an insult to all those who tragically lost loved ones to the virus. ""This interview has given people more questions than answers. With no remorse for the catastrophic mistakes such as the failure to protect our care homes or a refusal to put a comprehensive plan in place for a second wave, it is clear the prime minster has learnt nothing over the course of the last few months."" Face coverings are now compulsory for customers in shops and supermarkets in England. Globally, the wearing of face coverings and masks has been polarising opinion over the past few weeks - and has become particularly politicised in the US. So why are some people hesitant to wear masks, and is there actually any truth in their claims? The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been investigating false and misleading claims about the health risks of face masks and coverings being shared on social media.Read the full story here. Children at a California summer school earlier this month The latest guidance on schools and childcare from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasises the urgency of getting children back into classrooms in the autumn. The document comes two weeks after President Trump criticised the previous CDC guidance on schools as ""very tough and expensive"". ""It is critically important for our public health to open schools this fall,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield, a Trump appointee, said in a statement announcing the updates. Critics - including many teachers - say it is too early to commit to in-person learning as infections continue to rise across the US. âI am comfortable with that,"" Trump said earlier this week when asked about his 14-year-old son and his school-aged grandchildren returning to classrooms. âI would like to see the schools open 100 percent. And weâll do it safely. Weâll do it carefully,â he said. Despite Trump's efforts, the Maryland private school attended by his son Barron has said they will not fully open in September due to virus concerns. We reported earlier about Boris Johnson's interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has now responded, saying that the prime minister ""has finally admitted the government mishandled its response to the coronavirus"". ""This finally puts to bed the prime minister's previous claim his government 'took the right decisions at the right time',"" Ashworth added. ""It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown, and too slow to take this crisis seriously. ""The threat of a second wave is still very real. It is imperative the government learns the lessons of its mistakes so we can help to save lives."" Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check A major privately run airline in Zambia has been using unproven badges whose manufacturers claim that they can offer protection against viruses. Avideo posted by Mahogany Air,externalon their Facebook page shows cabin crew wearing the badges. Mahogany Air claims without any basis that the badges have âair-purifying virus buster technology that purifies the air around any passenger or crew member wearing it"". The airlineâs CEO, Jim Belemu, told the BBC he believed the badges worked and would offer additional protection but there's no evidence these badges can ward off viruses and bacteria, and some health authorities have issued warnings about them. Similar devices are being sold around the world and at one time were worn by members of the Russian parliament. Some countries have banned them. In Africa, the president of South Sudan and other senior officials were seen using the badges although a government official told the BBC they later stopped wearing them. The substance released by such cards or badges - the bleaching agent chlorine dioxide - is potentially harmful. In April, the US Food and Drug Administration said chlorine dioxide products had not been shown to be safe and effective for any use, including against Covid-19.The agency says the substance, which is a powerful bleaching agent, can cause âserious and potentially life-threatening side effects"". If you're joining us from the US, good morning. To help you catch up, here are the main headlines from your side of the pond. The prime minister says the UK government didn't understand coronavirus in the ""first few weeks and months"" and has acknowledged there were things the government ""could have done differently"" in its handling of the virus. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Boris Johnson said there were ""lessons to be learned"" about how the virus was managed in the early stages. ""We didn't understand (the virus) in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months. ""The single thing that we didn't see at the beginning was the extent to which it was being transmitted asymptomatically from person to person. ""I think it's fair to say that there are things that we need to learn about how we handled it in the early stages."" The prime minister also said there were ""very open questions"" over whether lockdown came too late - a marked change from ministers' previous insistence that the right decisions were taken at the right time. Asked whether there was a delay in implementing a lockdown which ultimately cost lives, he said:
""Maybe there were things we could have done differently and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done differently."" Read the full story here BBC OS Dozens of protesters
have been gathering outside Japan's National Stadium in the capital Tokyo
today, the day that the Tokyo Olympics were due to begin. They've now been
postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. But protesters say
that's too soon for the Games to be held safely. BBC OS
on World Service radiohas been hearing from people in Japan. Tomomi Morisawa lives in the
city of Sapporo on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. She has started a
petition calling for the Tokyo Olympics to be cancelled altogether. ""We have Covid-19.
Will it come to an end in a year? No. Postponing is not an option. Cancellation
is our only option."" Masao Ohkushi lives in
Tokyo. He had tickets for the Games and says he's disappointed by the
postponement. ""In my opinion
Tokyo is safe, but some other countries or cities are not,"" he said. ""I'm expecting that
the virus will become weaker than now next year. But people are so afraid about
the virus now so it's hard to get rid of this mindset. ""It's not only
Tokyo's problem. We, all over the world, need to fix this."" Five states - Alabama, Hawaii, Indiana, Missouri and New Mexico - set new records for single-day infections on Thursday. Meanwhile, Florida and Tennessee each set new state records for most coronavirus-related deaths in a 24-hour period. The US recorded a total of 68,663 new cases on Thursday and 1,114 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The pace of infections across the US is increasing, experts say. It took the US 15 days to jump from 3m to 4m - a milestone the country passed on Thursday. It previously took 45 days to go from 1m to 2m infections, the Washington Post reports, and the leap from 2m cases to 3m took 27 days.  Another 123 deaths have been reported in hospitals, care homes and the community in the UK, according tocoronavirus.data.gov.uk,external. It brings the total number of deaths following a positive Covid-19 test result to 45,677. There were also a further 770 cases confirmed through testing. The daily death toll figures continue to be published by Public Health England on the coronavirus dashboard, but the government haslaunched a reviewinto them over concerns that the figures from England may include some people who died months after a positive test.

"Women who have Covid-19 are unlikely to pass on the infection to their babies during childbirth if precautions are in place, a small study suggests. Of 120 babies born at three hospitals in New York, none tested positive for the disease after being born to infected mothers. The results appeared similar two weeks later after some had been breastfed and shared a room with their mothers. Experts say the results are reassuring but larger trials are needed. Data on the risk of Covid-19 transmission during pregnancy and while breastfeeding is scarce, so recommendations for pregnant women and new mothers vary. In the UK, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggests mothers should share a room with their babies and breastfeed if they wish, but with appropriate precautions. Together with the World Health Organization (WHO), they say the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential risks of Covid-19 spread. Meanwhile, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention suggests considering a temporary separation of the newborn from a mother, to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to the baby. It says mothers in this situation may consider expressing breast milk. In this study, mothers and babies were allowed to stay in the same room and mothers could breastfeed - with measures such as wearing face masks and frequent handwashing. Babies had enclosed cribs about 2m (6ft) from the mother's bed. Researchers found: All 120 babies were negative for coronavirus at birth when tested using nasal swabs. 82 were checked again a week later and all were negative. Most of these babies (68) had shared a room with their mothers and more than three-quarters were being breastfed. 72 babies were tested a fortnight after birth and found to be negative. Researchers acknowledge almost a third of the babies did not have further tests after birth, partly because parents did not want to bring them back to a clinical environment during a pandemic. Nevertheless, Dr Christine Salvatore, who led the study, said: ""We hope our study will provide some reassurance to new mothers that the risk of them passing Covid-19 to their babies is very low. ""However, larger studies are needed to better understand the risks of transmission from mother to child."" Prof Marian Knight, who leads the UK's national surveillance of Covid-19 in pregnancy, said the research provided reassurance and supported current guidance. She said: ""More than 1,000 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection have given birth in the UK, and only 1-2% of their babies have had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2.  Infection does not appear to cause severe illness in these babies. ""This small US study also indicates transmission of infection from mother to baby is uncommon with simple precautions such as the wearing of face masks by mums with Covid-19.""

"Most people in England, about 30 million, are to be offered a free flu vaccine this year, the government says. It is to prepare for a winter that could see the annual flu season coincide with a surge in coronavirus. The NHS flu programme will add all over-50s, people shielding and those who live with them and children in their first year of secondary school. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he wanted ""everyone to have a flu jab in the run up to this winter"". He said it was important to ""protect the NHS in the winter months because we've still got Covid and the threat of a second spike of Covid, and its vital therefore to keep that pressure off the NHS by everybody getting a flu jab."" Flu, which can be deadly or need hospital treatment, poses additional threats during the pandemic: There is some evidence a double infection with coronavirus and flu is more deadly than either alone A big flu season combined with coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals If lots of NHS or care-home staff are sick with flu, then it may not be possible to respond to Covid-19 in the same way as during the peak in spring. But it is impossible to predict how big a flu season we will have. Australia, which is currently in its winter, is either having a very mild or very late flu season. Social-distancing and hygiene measures in place to stop coronavirus should, in theory, also have an impact on the amount of flu going around. people who were required toshield from coronavirusand anyone they live with people withsome medical conditions,externalincluding diabetes, heart failure and asthma pregnant women pre-school children over the age of two all primary school children, as last year, and, for the first time, Year 7 pupils initially all people over 65, before the programme is extended to the over-50s The NHS will get in contact with those who are eligible. It wants to ensure the highest risk patients are at the front of the queue when the immunisation programme starts in September. Those aged 50-64 will be offered the jab later, with the full details still to be announced. Last year, around 15 million people in England were vaccinated as part of the NHS campaign, far fewer than the 25 million who were invited to have it. This year more than 30m doses have been ordered. The vaccine will also be available privately in pharmacies and some supermarkets to adults who are not eligible for an NHS jab. It usually costs around Â£20. A Scottish government spokesperson said it was ""examining the best options"" for expanding eligibility for its flu vaccine programme which would be set out when it had ""confidence that there is adequate supply of vaccines in order to delivery on any commitments we make"". Plans for Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet been announced. The symptoms of flu include a fever and a dry cough. By now this should sound familiar - as they are the key signs of Covid-19 too. Other symptoms such as fatigue, aches, a sore throat or headaches are also shared by both infections. And there are also other winter viruses, such as rhinovirus and RSV, that can also lead to similar symptoms. This could create a problem come winter - as far more people would need testing to work out whether they have had coronavirus and their contacts needed tracing. This is why the government has already announced plans to increase testing capacity to half a million a day. Today's announcement on vaccines aims to suppress the flu season so numbers are as low as possible. GP Dr William Bird, an expert on preventative health, told BBC Breakfast it was right to offer the flu jab more widely, but that logistics would be a big problem. He said flu clinics were already run like a ""military operation"" with people ""bunched together"" - and social distancing would complicate matters. Children are given the flu vaccine with a nasal spray, while adults have a jab Plans are also being put together for ensuring coronavirus does not disrupt vaccination by, for example, causing schools, which deliver the childhood programme, to shut. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical advisor, said: ""This winter more than ever, with Covid-19 still circulating, we need to help reduce all avoidable risks. ""Vaccinating more people will help reduce flu transmission and stop people becoming ill."" Children are ""super-spreaders"" of the flu virus, but the expansion of the childhood programme had not been anticipated before the pandemic. The plan had been to assess the impact of vaccinating all primary school children, achieved for the first time last year, before deciding what to do next. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Meanwhile, there will be a renewed push to persuade health and care workers to have the vaccine. Last year,74% of staff,externalwere immunised. Paulette Hamilton, from the Local Government Association, said: ""Extending the free winter flu jab to as many people as possible is essential if we are to tackle two potentially deadly viruses head-on and prevent one seasonable and predictable virus creating the conditions for a second, more serious and unpredictable deadly second wave of Covid-19. ""It is absolutely critical that all our health and care workers get themselves vaccinated, to protect both themselves and the people they look after, including our elderly and most vulnerable, from a potentially devastating second wave of infections.""

"We are now - again - one year away from the start of the Olympics in Tokyo For some athletes, today was the last chance to take part in the Tokyo Olympics. They are too old, too exhausted or too financially stretched to wait for another year, after the pandemic forced its postponement. One of them is 35-year-old Tetsuya Sotomura. When I met him on a sweltering afternoon earlier this week he was still hard at it in a converted factory building in a north Tokyo suburb, flying high into the air, spinning and tumbling on a massive trampoline. Back in 2008 Tetsuya placed 4th at the Beijing Olympics, just missing a bronze medal. Since then he's fought injury that put him out of London in 2012 and Rio in 2016. Tokyo was to be his last hurrah, a hometown Olympics to end his trampolining career on a high. But another year is just too much. ""Back in 2008, if the Beijing Games had been postponed by a year I would have thought ok, it's another year to train, another year to grow,"" he tells me. ""But now I am 35. A year feels like a very long time. So, I have decided retirement is the only option."" Tetsuya Sotomura believes retirement is now his only option But there is another reason Tetsuya is getting off the trampoline. He thinks Tokyo 2021 may never happen. ""It's so uncertain. No-one knows the probability. If what awaits us next year is cancellation, I would have lost another year for nothing. So that is another reason to go now."" Enthusiasm for the Games has plummeted in Japan since Covid-19 arrived here in January. The Japanese government has closed Japan's borders to most foreigners to protect the country from imported cases, and many Japanese people are in no hurry to see them re-open for athletes or spectators. After retirement, Tetsuya is helping and coaching at his old trampoline gym in the north of Tokyo TV reporters have been visiting the towns due to host various foreign teams and asking locals how they feel. The residents of a town north of Tokyo due to host the Brazilian team were clearly struggling to maintain any semblance of enthusiasm. An opinion poll by the Kyodo news agency found just 23% of people in Japan now support holding the games if Covid-19 infections are still widespread next year. The latest figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) do not make for happy viewing. More than 15 million infections worldwide, and that number is growing by about a million every four to five days. Tokyo Olympics postponement leaves UK firms in limbo London 2012 - 10 things you may have forgotten What is the best British Olympic moment? From the US to Brazil, from India to South Africa, suppression efforts are failing and infections are surging. Of course, a year feels like a long time, but many health experts say it is now very unlikely the pandemic will be contained by next summer. At Kobe University Hospital in western Japan, Prof Kentaro Iwata says the only hope for the Olympics is a vaccine. The status of the Olympics will remain uncertain without a vaccine, officials fear ""If a vaccine is available it could be a game changer,"" he says. ""Phase 1 and 2 trials have some promising results. I have not lost hope. ""But generally speaking vaccines don't eradicate a virus, they lower the incidence by about half. So, I don't think Covid-19 can be eradicated. Instead [even with a vaccine] it will continue into 2021."" Prof Iwata is particularly concerned looking at what is going on in the US, the country that more than any other pays for the Olympics. ""The US will suffer from Covid for many months to come,"" he says. ""Can athletes come from the US come here? Can we have the Olympics without Americans? Most likely not. The priority must be the safety of the athletes and of Japanese people. ""The US TV companies may not like that, but is the Olympics a sports competition or a TV show?"" There is one seemingly simple solution: push the Tokyo Games back another year to 2022. It is far more likely the pandemic will have run its course by then. But that has been ruled out by the Japanese government. From his home in Montreal the longest-serving member of the International Olympic Committee, Dick Pound, told me it is now 2021 or bust. ""What we do know is 2021 is our last chance,"" he says. ""It's not something we can put off until 2022 or 2023. I don't think it's fair to expect Japan to keep the balls in the air any longer. To the extent that it's safe for the athletes to come, every effort will be made for the Games to go forward. ""That said, if public health authorities in Japan and around the world conclude that it's not safe enough, there is probably no alternative but to say, 'oh well, the pandemic is the new war'."" The only occasions the Olympic Games have been cancelled was during the two World Wars, and one of those was - you guessed it - Tokyo, in 1940. A ceremony was held to reset the clock So how about one final idea: a much-simplified Games, with foreign athletes going through quarantine before arrival but foreign spectators kept away? According to Dick Pound, this is a non-starter. ""In the North American phrase - you either have the fish or cut bait,"" he says. ""Japan would have to decide, do they want the Games to go ahead or are the risks too much? In which case Japan would probably propose, and the IOC would accept, cancellation."" On Thursday night inside the Olympic stadium they held a ceremony to reset the clock, one year until the opening ceremony.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe insists the Games must go on but Covid-19 is almost certainly not listening.
