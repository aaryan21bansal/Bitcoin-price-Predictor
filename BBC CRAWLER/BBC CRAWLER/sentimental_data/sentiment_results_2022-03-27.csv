"Refugees are forced to put their trust in strangers Five weeks into Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, imagine for a moment what it's like to live there now. Bombs, bloodshed, trauma. No school for your children, no healthcare for your parents, no safe roof over your head in many parts of the country. Would you try to run?Ten million Ukrainians have, according to the United Nations. Most seek refuge in other areas of Ukraine, believed to be safer. But more than three and a half million people have fled over the border. They are mainly women and children, as men under the age of 60 are obliged by the Ukrainian government to stay put and fight. Displaced and disoriented, often with no idea where to go next, refugees are forced to put their trust in strangers. The chaos of war is now behind them, but the truth is, they're not entirely safe outside Ukraine either. ""For predators and human traffickers, the war in Ukraine is not a tragedy,"" UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned on Twitter. ""It's an opportunity - and women and children are the targets."" Trafficking rings are notoriously active in Ukraine and neighbouring countries in peace time. The fog of war is perfect cover to increase business. Karolina WierzbiÅska, a coordinator at Homo Faber, a human rights organisation based in Lublin, told me children were a huge concern. Many youngsters were travelling out of Ukraine unaccompanied, she said. Patchy registration processes in Poland and other border regions - especially at the start of the war - meant children disappeared, their current whereabouts unknown. My colleagues and I headed down to the Polish-Ukrainian border to see for ourselves. At a train station, well known for refugee arrivals, we found a hive of activity. Dazed-looking women and crying children were all around. Women and their children have been arriving at the border area Many were being comforted and offered hot food from steaming industrial-sized cooking pots by an army of volunteers wearing high-vis gilets. So far, so well organised, right? Not quite. We met Margherita Husmanov, a Ukrainian refugee from Kyiv in her early 20s. She arrived at the border two weeks ago, but decided to stay on, to help stop fellow refugees falling into the wrong hands. I asked her if she felt vulnerable. ""Yes,"" she told me. ""That's especially why I worry about their safety. ""The women and children come here from a terrible war. They don't speak Polish or English. They don't know what's going on and they believe what anyone tells them. ""Anyone can turn up at this station. The first day I volunteered, we saw three men from Italy. They were looking for beautiful women to sell into the sex trade. ""I called the police and it turned out I was right. It wasn't paranoia. It's horrible."" Margherita Husmanov is a refugee turned volunteer Margherita says local officials are a bit more organised now. Police regularly patrol the station. The people (mainly men, we're told) with cardboard signs to tempting destinations, so present in the first couple of weeks of refugee arrivals, have largely disappeared. But as we find out from a number of sources, other ill-intentioned individuals are now posing as high-vis-wearing volunteers. Elena Moskvitina spoke out on Facebook to raise awareness. She's now safely in Denmark, so we chatted at length via Skype. Her experience is chilling. She and her children crossed into neighbouring Romania from war-torn Ukraine. They were looking for a lift away from the border. What she described as fake volunteers at a refugee centre asked where she was staying. They turned up later in the day and aggressively told her Switzerland was the best place to go and that they'd give her a lift there, with a van full of other women. Elena told me the men looked at her and her daughter ""sleazily"". Her daughter was petrified. They asked her to show them her son, who was in another room. They looked him up and down, she said. They then insisted she travel with no-one else except them, and they got angry when she asked to see their ID cards. To get the men away from her family, Elena promised to meet them when the other women were in their van. But as soon as they left, she told me, she grabbed her children and ran. ElÅ¼bieta Jarmulska offers safe passage to Ukrainian refugees ElÅ¼bieta Jarmulska, a feisty Polish entrepreneur, is the founder of the Women Take The Wheel Initiative. Her aim, she says, is to provide Ukrainian refugees with a ""bubble of safety"". ""Those women have been through so much already, walking or driving their way through a war zone and then they are exposed to fear and exploitation here? I have no words for what that must be like,"" she says. By now, she has recruited more than 650 Polish ""amazing women"", as she describes them, driving backwards and forwards as often as they can to the Polish-Ukrainian border, in order to offer refugees safe passage. I accompany ElÅ¼bieta, better known as Ela, to a refugee centre where she makes a point of showing her ID card and proof of residence to officials, before she asks if anyone wants a lift to Warsaw. Her car was full in moments. The passengers: refugee Nadia and her three children. Ela settled the family into her thoughtfully stocked car, offering the small children water, chocolate and motion-sickness tablets if they needed them. Nadia and her children are grateful for the lift Nadia, meanwhile, told me of her dangerous journey out of Ukraine from Kharkiv. Now in Poland, she was so relieved, she said, to have a female driver. She'd heard of the risks of trafficking and exploitation on Ukrainian radio. But she came anyway. Her home was being shelled, she said. The risks of war were more immediate. Ela has the refugees' best interests at heart. But leaving the border safely doesn't mean the danger is over for them. Most we spoke to hoped to go home as soon as the violence ends. But over the next days, weeks, even months, they need somewhere to sleep, to eat, to send their children to school, as well as a job to properly support themselves. Those needs make refugees vulnerable. EU leaders have unanimously approved a measure to open up the job market, schools and access to health care for Ukrainians, but as human rights groups point out, refugees need help to get registered and be informed of their rights. One of the volunteers I met at the Polish-Ukrainian border told me that when you're down and out, friendless and in need of money, you can all too easily end up doing things you would have never imagined. This woman was lured into prostitution when she was younger. And that, she says, is a large part of the reason she's helping Ukrainian refugees now. ""I want to protect them. To warn them,"" she told me. She asked me not to reveal her name. She's since turned her life around and doesn't want her children to know about her past. Refugees are all too vulnerable to exploitation Five weeks into Russia's onslaught in Ukraine, processes across Europe screening those claiming to help Ukrainians are still far from foolproof. Organised crime (including sex and organ trafficking and frequently, slave labour) is not the only menace. Refugees are exploited by individuals too. People in Poland, Germany, the UK and elsewhere have opened up their homes to refugees, most with the best of intentions. But sadly not all. We found a post on social media from a Ukrainian woman who fled to DÃ¼sseldorf in Germany. The man who offered her a room confiscated her ID papers and demanded she clean his house for free. He then started to make sexual advances as well. She refused - and he kicked her out on the street. Irena Dawid-Olczyk, chief executive of the Warsaw branch of anti-trafficking NGO La Strada, told me the story was all too familiar. That kind of thing happens, war or no war, she told me. But an avalanche of conflict-scarred women and children bursting out of Ukraine means that exploitation and abuse cases escalate. She cites teenage refugees as a particular concern. ""We all know teenagers, don't we? They're insecure. They want acceptance and recognition,"" she says. ""And if they are refugees who are far from home and friends, they're even easier to exploit. ""Girls might love attention lavished on them by older men. Or they'll be introduced to a cool girl their own age, who has great clothes and invites them to parties. ""That's how it starts. Don't forget, it's not only men who are pimps, traffickers and abusers."" Refugees are given leaflets offering help The push factors for Ukrainian women to accept seemingly generous online offers to escape their difficulties also increase manyfold in war time. Without revealing identities, Irena reels off case after case that La Strada Poland is working on - Ukrainian girls offered plane tickets to Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, without ever having met the men inviting them. ""My colleagues are trying to persuade a 19-year-old girl not to join her friend at a man's house,"" she says. ""She knows her friend has been beaten. But the man calls her on her mobile, says sweet things and offers her presents. ""If they insist on going, we beg the girls to at least register with the local authorities. If they don't, they have our phone number. ""I hope they can call us if they need us."" Governments across Europe have pledged solidarity with Ukraine. Human rights groups want them to take better care of those running for their lives. They need protection. Where have Ukraine's millions of refugees gone?

"Tests take place behind the barriers of a makeshift Covid centre in Shanghai earlier this week China has announced its biggest city-wide lockdown since the Covid outbreak began more than two years ago. The city of Shanghai will be locked down in two stages over nine days while authorities carry out Covid-19 testing. The important financial hub has battled a new wave of infections for nearly a month, although case numbers are not high by some international standards. Authorities had so far resisted locking down the city of some 25 million people to avoid destabilising the economy. But after Shanghai recorded its highest daily number of cases on Saturday since the early days of the pandemic, authorities appear to have changed course. The lockdown will happen in two stages, with the eastern side of the city under restrictions from Monday until 1 April, and the western side from 1-5 April. Public transport will be suspended and firms and factories must halt operations or work remotely, authorities said. The city government published the instructions on its WeChat account, asking the public ""to support, understand and cooperate with the city's epidemic prevention and control work"". How is China's zero-Covid strategy changing? Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on? Other lockdowns during the pandemic have affected entire Chinese provinces, though people could often still travel within those regions. But Shanghai, due to its high population density, is the largest single city to be locked down to date. It is China's commercial capital and by some calculations the biggest city in the country - but is now one of the worst-hit areas as China fights to contain a resurgence of the virus with Omicron, leading to a spike in new cases. Officials had until now said the eastern Chinese port and financial hub must keep running for the good of the economy. The staggered approach to this lockdown means half the city will remain functioning at a time. Millions of residents in other Chinese cities have been subjected to citywide lockdowns,often after a relatively small number of Covid cases. In a city that's been on its knees for two weeks, parts of it reduced to something like a ghost town, the streets are now suddenly busy with panic shoppers. I've been out and seen queues stretching out of shop doors as people stock up before the lockdown starts early on Monday. The subway station at the end of my road, newly opened just a few months ago, will be shut on Monday. Public transport will stop and all residents will be subject to mass city-wide Covid testing. Almost 25 million people will be affected; the eastern side of the city first, then at the end of next week the western side. Wuhan was sealed off at the very outset of this pandemic. Before Christmas it was Xi'an. Now China's commercial and financial capital is being shut. Just a few days ago officials here said Shanghai was too big and too important to lock down. The question now on many residents' lips will be whether nine days is enough. The recent surge in cases in China, although small compared to some countries,is a significant challenge to China's ""zero-Covid"" strategy, which uses swift lockdowns and aggressive restrictions to contain any outbreak. The policy sets China apart from most other countries which are trying to live with the virus. But the increased transmissibility and milder nature of the Omicron variant has led to questions over whether the current strategy is sustainable in the long run. Some Shanghai residents have complained about the seemingly endless cycles of testing, suggesting that the cost of zero-Covid had become too high. China's national health commission reported more than 4,500 new domestically transmitted cases on Sunday. How many Covid cases are there in China? Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on?

"Jeehan Saleh and Hesham Hussain say they ""weren't shocked"" to hear standing charges where they live will see a big rise Sharp rises in standing charges on standard electricity bills will see customers face very different cost increases depending on where they live. Customers in South Scotland, Merseyside, North Wales and the South West of England will see the daily payments double from April. Those in London and the East of England will see increases of less than 60%. Almost all consumer bills include a standing charge; a fixed daily payment covering the costs of supply and other levies. The regulator Ofgem caps them for consumers on standard default tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland, although the cap varies by region. Standing charges are not the biggest part of an energy bill, but they are set to rise by more than Â£71 a year on average in April. Jeehan Saleh and Hesham Hussain told the BBC the wide regional differences were unfair at time when energy bills are soaring. They say they ""weren't shocked"" when they learned that standing charges where they live in Garston in South Liverpool would rise by double that of other areas. ""Surprise, surprise, Liverpool again isn't it,"" said Hesham. ""It's always us being hit the hardest,"" added Jeehan. ""There's people in poorer areas where we work who are choosing between food bills and energy bills. Thankfully we're not in that position but it's not too far from home. You're already feeling it in so many areas, this is just another hit."" The standing charge has always varied depending on where you live, due to different costs to supply homes with power in rural or more remote areas. What help with bills is there in my council tax band? Energy bills could reach Â£3,000 as oil price soars However, BBC research has shown that the increase this spring varies disproportionately in different parts of Britain, when comparing standard variable tariffs for electricity paid for by direct debit. Analysts told the BBC that local suppliers are moving charges which were once part of a consumer's unit price for energy (which now has a tight upper limit on it) over to their standing charge. They are also increasing standing charges to the maximum level for each region, which means a big jump for some places. The average increase - of just under 20p per day - will add more than Â£71 a year to a standard electricity tariff. But in North Wales and Merseyside, the South West, the Midlands, South Scotland and South Wales the rise will add over Â£80 a year. In London less than Â£30 will be added. Price per day for Single Rate Electricity Meter from April 2022 by British region in order of percentage charge. London: up 8p a day to 31p - a 38% increase Eastern: up 13p a day to 36p - a 58% increase South East: up 17p a day to 40p - a 73% increase North West: up 17p a day to 40p - 73% increase Southern: up 18p a day to 41p - an 80% increase Yorkshire: up 21p a day to 46p - an 81% increase North Scotland: up 22p a day to 48p - a 83% increase Northern: up 21p a day to 46p - an 85% increase East Midlands: up 20p a day to 43p - an 88% increase Midlands: up 22p a day to 46p - a 92% increase South Wales: up 22p a day to 46p - a 94% increase Southern Scotland: up 24p a day to 47p - a 100% increase South Western: up 25p a day to 49p - a 101% increase North Wales & Merseyside: up 23p a day to 45p - 102% increase Source: Ofgem The changes are slightly different for customers using prepayment meters. It comes as households in England, Scotland and Wales prepare for an even bigger hit when the energy price cap - which limits what consumer pay per unit of gas and electricity - also goes up in April. In Liverpool, David and Joan Boyle told us their energy bill was rising by Â£700. They are happy they will be able to manage but say they worry about other people. Elsewhere there was more concern. Kev Oloughlin and his son Leo ""Standing charges should be the same everywhere shouldn't they,"" said Kev Oloughlin. He was enjoying a day out in the sunshine with his son Leo. He told us they'd ""normally shop around every year when bills come in, but at the moment it's pointless"". He added: ""We're managing alright with things but we're conscious of having the heating and things like that on. Everyone's got to tighten their belt at the minute haven't they."" The standing charge not only covers costs such network maintenance, administration fees and certain government schemes. It is also the part of your bill that will contribute to the cost of the 28 energy suppliers that have gone bust since last autumn amid a cost crunch sparked by sharply rising wholesale energy prices. Ofgem told the BBC that the levy added to bills to pay for costs associated with energy suppliers going bust had been spread equally across the country. It says standing charges in some regions are increasing more than others because of a reallocation of network costs, the level of which differs between distribution networks. The BBC contacted major suppliers British Gas, Scottish Power, EDF, EOn, Ovo/SSE, Shell, Octopus and Bulb, and almost all confirmed they now have a majority of customers on a standard default tariff, which is controlled by the Ofgem cap. Three of the biggest suppliers, British Gas, Scottish and Ovo/SSE would not give details on their charges, calling them ""commercially sensitive"". But EOn, EDF, Shell, Octopus and Bulb confirmed they were increasing standing charges on these tariffs in line with the standard charge cap, with example prices (including VAT) from Bulb, EDF and Shell varying from 32p a day in London and 38p in the East, to around 50p in Northern Scotland and the South West. And it is not an expense that can be avoided by shopping around. While tariffs actively chosen by customers, such as fixed rate tariffs, are not subject to the default tariff cap on standard charges, there are only a handful of such deals on the market. Moneysupermarket told the BBC that as of 14 March, there were just five fixed tariffs available to consumers. This compares to about 96 fixed deals available at the same time in 2021. Standing charges are certainly not the biggest part of your energy bill, and they are dwarfed by the massive increases in the unit price for the energy you use. But in normal circumstances an extra Â£80 a year on your energy bill just from standing charges would not go unnoticed, especially as in some areas they are increasing by a lot more than others. So is something fishy going on? Ofgem assures me that the extra costs for failed energy companies are being spread equally across the country. But the Energy Networks Association say that no major network developments have happened in any areas in the last six months that would explain the regional divisions. Local suppliers are moving charges which were once part of your unit price, which now has a tight price cap on it, and shifting them across to your standing charge. Most suppliers are upping their standing charges to the maximum level for each region, which means a big jump for some places, adding insult to the injury of a whopping energy bill. Update 18 May 2022: This article was amended to reflect the fact that some previously offered deals don't include standing charges.

"Police said they had arrested four leaders of the MS-13 gang ahead of the vote El Salvador's parliament has approved a state of emergency after the Central American country recorded dozens of gang-related murders in a single day. Police said there had been 62 murders on Saturday, making it the most violent 24-hour period since the end of the civil war in 1992. New laws restrict the right to gather, allow arrests without a warrant and the monitoring of communications. Last year, the gang-plagued nation recorded 1,140 murders - a 30-year low. However, that still equates to 18 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. In November, another spate of violence led to more than 40 people being killed within three days. Did El Salvador's government make a deal with gangs? El Salvador's jails: Where social distancing is impossible Hours before MPs voted on the new powers, which will remain in place for 30 days, police said four leaders of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang had been arrested over the spate of killings. President Nayib Bukele, elected in 2019 on promises to fight organised crime and improve security, said: ""We have had a new spike in homicides, something that we had worked so hard to reduce. ""While we fight criminals in the streets, we must try to figure out what is happening and who is financing this."" The country ""must let the agents and soldiers do their job and must defend them from the accusations of those who protect the gang members"", he added, in the statementtweeted by Congress president,externalErnesto Castro. This video can not be played El Salvador: God or the gang However, Juan Pappier, from the international campaign group Human Rights Watch,tweeted,externalthe measures were ""very worrying, especially in a country where there are no independent democratic institutions"". Authorities say the MS-13 and Barrio-18 gangs, among others, number about 70,000 members and are responsible for homicides, extortion and drug-trafficking. Police said the latest bloodshed had left 12 people dead in the central department of La Libertad, as well as nine each in the capital, San Salvador, and the western department of Ahuachapan, with the other killings spread around the country. In April 2020, as coronavirus swept through the country, President Bukele imposed a 24/7 lockdown for imprisoned gang members after more than 50 people were killed in three days. He argued that many of the murders were ordered from behind bars and said prisoners belonging to rival gangs would be made to share cells in a bid to break up lines of communication.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been accused of violating international law, including targeting civilians The UK's attorney general has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine over the Russian invasion. Suella Braverman said Sir Howard Morrison would become an independent adviser to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova. Sir Howard served as a judge on the International Criminal Court in The Hague for more than 12 years. It comes as Russian forces continue to be accused of violating international law by targeting civilians. Could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes? Are Russia's attacks war crimes? Earlier this month,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of committing war crimesafter it launched air strikes in Kharkiv that hit an opera house, a concert hall and government offices. The ICC's chief prosecutor later said evidence was being collected on whether the Russian military had committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. But Russia is not a member of the ICC, so any Russian nationals indicted by the court would have to be extradited by the Kremlin. Asked by MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday about alternative ways of prosecuting war criminals other than the ICC, the attorney general said ""all options are on the table"", although she insisted the ICC was the UK's preferred option. ""I will always defer and support my counterpart in Ukraine, the prosecutor general, in terms of my efforts to support her in terms of her choice of route for redress,"" she said. ""But whilst we welcome the focus on accountability, we do believe that the ICC is the right place for those responsible for committing these atrocious crimes in Ukraine to be held accountable for their actions."" Announcing Sir Howard's appointment, Ms Braverman said the UK was committed to ""showing that the atrocities we see being committed day after day in Ukraine will not be forgotten"". Ms Venediktova welcomed Sir Howard's help, saying his experience and knowledge of international criminal law ""speaks louder than words"". During his time as a judge, Sir Howard oversaw cases such as that of the Serbian war criminal, Radovan Karadzic. The attorney general's office said Ms Braverman was in regular communication with Ukraine's prosecutor general and they planned to meet in person next month. On a trip to The Hague last week, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab accused Mr Putin of responding in ""ever more barbaric ways"" in Ukraine and offered the ICC financial and technical help for prosecuting alleged war crimes in the country. Boris Johnson has used similar language, describing the Russian military under Mr Putin's orders of using""barbaric and indiscriminate"" tactics. Russia denies targeting civilians and says it is carrying out a military operation against ""neo-Nazis"" in Ukraine.

""But whilst we welcome the focus on accountability, we do believe that the ICC is the right place for those responsible for committing these atrocious crimes in Ukraine to be held accountable for their actions."" Announcing Sir Howard's appointment, Ms Braverman said the UK was committed to ""showing that the atrocities we see being committed day after day in Ukraine will not be forgotten"". Ms Venediktova welcomed Sir Howard's help, saying his experience and knowledge of international criminal law ""speaks louder than words"". During his time as a judge, Sir Howard oversaw cases such as that of the Serbian war criminal, Radovan Karadzic. The attorney general's office said Ms Braverman was in regular communication with Ukraine's prosecutor general and they planned to meet in person next month. On a trip to The Hague last week, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab accused Mr Putin of responding in ""ever more barbaric ways"" in Ukraine and offered the ICC financial and technical help for prosecuting alleged war crimes in the country. Boris Johnson has used similar language, describing the Russian military under Mr Putin's orders of using""barbaric and indiscriminate"" tactics. Russia denies targeting civilians and says it is carrying out a military operation against ""neo-Nazis"" in Ukraine.

Thank you for joining us. Updates were brought to you by Helen Bushby, Paul Glynn, Steven McIntosh, Mary O'Connor, Mark Savage and Claire Heald. The moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars It was a night where the spotlight fell on the Will Smith-Chris Rock slapping incident, overshadowing the big winners at the Academy Awards. As we bring our live updates to a close, here's a sum-up of what went down: Will Smith slaps Chris Rock  Who won what?  You can read the full listhere.  Stars criticise LGBTQ bill And on a night when the first openly queer woman of colour, Ariana DeBose, won an Oscar, several stars spoke out against the US state of Floridaâs so-called ""donât say gay"" bill, which would limit classroom discussions around sexual orientation or gender identity. Chastain labelled the legislation as ""discriminatory and bigotedâ, pointing to ""hate crimes"" being committed around the world. Allow YouTube content?

We'll be bringing our coverage of events at the 94th Academy Awards to a close shortly, but first there is, of course, time to share this from Queen Bey. She may not have taken home a trophy, but BeyoncÃ©'s performance of Be Alive, from the film King Richard, was one of the highlights of Sunday's Oscar ceremony. The pre-taped segment was recorded at the same tennis courts in Compton, California, where Richard Williams taught his daughters Venus and Serena the game of tennis when they were children. The star was joined by her own daughter, Blue Ivy, while her band and backup dancers all wore neon yellow outfits the colour of tennis balls. Before Will Smith hit Chris Rock, the comedian had just made a joke referring to the actor's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith and her shaven-head appearance. It's something Pinkett Smith has talked about and is the result of the hair loss condition alopecia. The boss of one charity which works to help people with alopecia has been talking to the BBC. Alopecia UK chief executive Sue Schilling says she was shocked to see violence unfold at the Oscars and her first thoughts were for Pinkett Smith and how she might feeling. ""Alopecia affects people emotionally as well as physically and it affects the wider family,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's not surprising to me that there was an emotional response but the violence was really surprising to me - violence is the wrong way. ""All my thoughts are with Jada Pinkett Smith - rather than Chris Rock or Will Smith."" She said the appropriateness of Rock's comments were for Pinkett Smith alone to decide on. ""I put myself in her shoes, and I would be feeling sensitive about that, given how public she has been about her journey,"" Sue adds. ""She looked amazing last night. But now the story is all about an act of violence and not a celebration - and what a shame that is."" She says people with the condition who want to find support can share their views online with the charity and it has written ablog post about the Oscars,external. Empire Magazine's Amon Warmann has been talking to Nicky Campbell on the BBC's 5 Live about the ceremony and says Will Smith showed a ""lack of judgment"" in  lashing out at Chris Rock. He says it's damaging and that it overshadowed Smith's first acting Oscar, ""something that he's been working towards for the past three decades, and something that's been very, very deserved on many levels"". ""He's wrecked it by his own actions, which is a terrible shame,"" he added, ""but you can't normalise violence because you don't like a joke."" A little more now on the film which won the crown of the night - the best picture award. According toDeadline magazine,external, Coda was the least-watched film in the running for best picture this year. In the US, it had only been streamed about 975,000 times before the ceremony, compared to 10.3 million for Netflix's eco-satire Don't Look Up. With the streaming market increasingly fragmented and confusing, it can be hard to know where the films are available. Luckily, we're here to help. Seemingly putting the events of the night behind him, Will Smith is at the Vanity Fair afterparty dancing to his own songs, and posing for photos with his Oscar. Footage of the star was captured by reporters from trade papers Variety and The Hollywood Reporter and posted online. TheLos Angeles Police Department later told Variety,externalRock had ""declined to file a police report"" after what happened Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a latertweet,external, Jaden shared a photo of himself wearing sunglasses in the back seat of a car, writing: ""My Dads Speech Made Me Cry"". That post has subsequently been deleted. Colin PatersonEntertainment Correspondent, BBC Radio 5 live Will Smith with his sons Trey Smith and Jaden Smith, daughter Willow Smith and wife Jada Pinkett Smith attending the Vanity Fair Oscar Party I've covered 19 Oscars and the only moment that comes close to this is when La La Land was wrongly announced as the Best Picture winner in 2017. I was watching the ceremony from the red carpet at the Vanity Fair party and, at first, everyone just thought it was a joke. ""What's going on here? Is this a bit of comedy? I'm not quite getting this."" Then we quickly realised what had happened. Two hours later, word came through that he was going to attend the afterparty. I thought, 'that's never going to happen', but suddenly he was here, with Jada Pinkett Smith, beaming with smiles and kissing and chatting to people. He wouldn't speak to us. He definitely heard me shout his name. But the couple obviously decided they were going to come to the party and put on a brave face. The sad thing is that, when people talk about the 2022 Oscars, they're not going to say it was the year that a film starring deaf actors won the best picture and broke all kinds of grounds. They're just going to say, 'Oh, that was the Oscars were where Will Smith hit Chris Rock'. This was the moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on-stage. There were gasps in the audience as Smith went up on to the stage, slapped Rock, and returned to his seat, where he continued to shout at the presenter. The slap came after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife and Jada's shaved hairstyle - which is a result of the hair loss condition alopecia. She has spoken publicly about her struggle with the condition. Will Smith slaps Chris Rock Will Smith became tearful as he gave his acceptance speech Will Smith went up to the stage and slapped Chris Rock after he made a joke about his wife earlier on in the ceremony. When Smith later went up to the stage, it was to collect his Academy Award for best actor. He delivered this apologetic speech, where he talked about God, love and his actions and referenced his role, as the father of tennis players Venus and Serena Williams: ""Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world. Making this film, I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who is one of the most strongest, most delicate people I've ever met. I got to protect Saniyya [Sidney] and Demi [Singleton], the two actresses who played Venus and Serena. I'm being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people. I know, to do what we do, you've got to be able to take abuse. You got to be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business, you've got to be able to have people disrespecting you, and you've got to smile, you've got to pretend like that's OK. What I loved was, Denzel [Washington] said to me a few moments ago, he said, 'At your highest moment, be careful, that's when the devil comes for you'. I want to be a vessel for love. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena and the entire Williams family for entrusting me with your story. That's what I want to do. I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern. I want to apologise to the Academy. I want to apologise to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment and I'm not crying for winning an award. It's not about winning an award for me. It's about being able to shine a light on all of the people - Tim [White, producer] and Trevor [White, producer] and Zach [Baylin, writer] and Saniyya and Demi and Aunjanue and the entire cast and crew of King Richard, and Venus and Serena, the entire Williams family. Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things. And my motherâ¦ a lot in this moment is really complicated for me but to my mother, she didn't want to come out. She's had her knitting crew who she's in Philly watching with. Being able to love and care for my mother, my family, my wifeâ¦ I'm taking up too much timeâ¦ Thank you for this honour. Thank you for this moment and thank you on behalf of Richard and Oracene and the entire Williams family. Thank you. I hope the Academy invites me back. Thank you."" Her film's success has been overshadowed by what happened at the ceremony - but Welsh actress Emilia Jones, who plays the lead role in Coda, says she is ""on cloud nine"" after the film won all three of the Oscars it was nominated for, including best picture. An independent film about the only hearing child of a deaf family, it had been an underdog during the entire Oscars race, but slowly emerged as a contender in recent weeks. In a touching moment, the audience applauded in sign language as it picked up the night's main award. ""It's been really beautiful watching people adapt and change and learn more signs,"" said Jones, who herself learned sign language to appear in the film. ""That's what this movie has done, I think. It's brought people together... and I'm really hoping it opens doors."" The actress also revealed that she'd received a celebratory text message from her father - the singer and radio presenter Aled Jones. ""He just said, 'wow', in all capital letters!"" We've got some more photos of Will Smith posing as he arrives at the Vanity Fair afterparty. And the mood is a world away from the moment he got up on stage and slapped Chris Rock during the Oscar awards ceremony itself. Smith smiled as he held up his best actor award at the Vanity Fair afterparty Smith arrived with wife Jada Pinkett Smith (L), daughter Willow Smith (2nd L), son Jaden Smith (2nd R) and son Trey Smith (R) Smith struck several poses with his award as other stars queued to have their photographs taken Sadly, the triumphant victory of Coda - a touching, independent film about a deaf family and their hearing daughter - has been completely eclipsed by Will Smith slapping comedian Chris Rock. On social media, it's dominating the conversation - with hashtags like ""assault"" and ""toxic masculinity"" trending. Oneuncensored clip of the altercation,externalhas been viewed 7.1m times. Another clip of Smith being comforted by Denzel Washington and Tyler Perry is also proving popular. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Elsewhere, there are calls for Smith to be stripped of his best actor Oscar, while some people are speculating that the whole thing was staged - not that there is any evidence of that. Photos of the audience's reaction are also going viral, with this shot of Nicole Kidman, from earlier in the night, proving particularly popular.  And Lupita Nyong'o - who was sitting directly behind Smith as he called out to Rock on stage - has also started trending. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sir Kenneth (left) was first nominated for an Oscar in 1989 More now from the awards themselves on the night and actor Jamie Dornan says Sir Kenneth Branagh was given a ""hero's welcome"" by the cast and crew of Belfast, after he won his first ever Oscar (for best original screenplay). ""It was a special moment,"" he told BBC 5 Live's Colin Paterson. ""It's mad to think it's his first after seven nominations and such a career."" Dornan, who plays Pa in the troubles-set drama, said the Oscar meant a lot to the whole team. ""It's all about Ken. None of us are stood here without Ken. So for us to be hanging on his shirt-tails is a very cool thing.""  Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith arrive at the Vanity Fair Oscar party Will Smith has arrived at the Vanity Fair afterparty with wife Jada Pinkett Smith after that controversial moment with Chris Rock. The actor received some cheers as he posed for photographs while showing off his award. BBC Entertainment Correspondent Colin Paterson told 5 Live Smith had taken so long, posing for every photographer, that it was causing chaos on the red carpet. ""There's a queue of about 30 guests unable to get into the party because this has gone on so long."" Comedian and actress Tiffany Haddish has called Will Smith's controversial attack on Chris Rock a ""beautiful thing"". âWhen I saw a Black man stand up for his wife,âshe told People Magazine,externalat the Governors Ball. âThat meant so much to me. ""As a woman, who has been unprotected, for someone to say like, âKeep my wifeâs name out your mouth, leave my wife alone,â thatâs what your husband is supposed to do, right? Protect you. And that meant the world to me. ""And maybe the world might not like how it went down, but for me, it was the most beautiful thing I ever seen because it made me believe that there are still men out there that love and care about their women, their wives.â Smith later apologised on stage. The Academy insisted it ""does not condone violence of any form"", while Los Angeles Police Department said Chris Rock had declined to file a police report. Allow Twitter content?

The moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars It was a night where the spotlight fell on the Will Smith-Chris Rock slapping incident, overshadowing the big winners at the Academy Awards.

Stars criticise LGBTQ bill And on a night when the first openly queer woman of colour, Ariana DeBose, won an Oscar, several stars spoke out against the US state of Floridaâs so-called ""donât say gay"" bill, which would limit classroom discussions around sexual orientation or gender identity. Chastain labelled the legislation as ""discriminatory and bigotedâ, pointing to ""hate crimes"" being committed around the world. Allow YouTube content?

We'll be bringing our coverage of events at the 94th Academy Awards to a close shortly, but first there is, of course, time to share this from Queen Bey. She may not have taken home a trophy, but BeyoncÃ©'s performance of Be Alive, from the film King Richard, was one of the highlights of Sunday's Oscar ceremony. The pre-taped segment was recorded at the same tennis courts in Compton, California, where Richard Williams taught his daughters Venus and Serena the game of tennis when they were children. The star was joined by her own daughter, Blue Ivy, while her band and backup dancers all wore neon yellow outfits the colour of tennis balls. Before Will Smith hit Chris Rock, the comedian had just made a joke referring to the actor's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith and her shaven-head appearance. It's something Pinkett Smith has talked about and is the result of the hair loss condition alopecia. The boss of one charity which works to help people with alopecia has been talking to the BBC. Alopecia UK chief executive Sue Schilling says she was shocked to see violence unfold at the Oscars and her first thoughts were for Pinkett Smith and how she might feeling. ""Alopecia affects people emotionally as well as physically and it affects the wider family,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's not surprising to me that there was an emotional response but the violence was really surprising to me - violence is the wrong way. ""All my thoughts are with Jada Pinkett Smith - rather than Chris Rock or Will Smith."" She said the appropriateness of Rock's comments were for Pinkett Smith alone to decide on. ""I put myself in her shoes, and I would be feeling sensitive about that, given how public she has been about her journey,"" Sue adds. ""She looked amazing last night. But now the story is all about an act of violence and not a celebration - and what a shame that is."" She says people with the condition who want to find support can share their views online with the charity and it has written ablog post about the Oscars,external. Empire Magazine's Amon Warmann has been talking to Nicky Campbell on the BBC's 5 Live about the ceremony and says Will Smith showed a ""lack of judgment"" in  lashing out at Chris Rock. He says it's damaging and that it overshadowed Smith's first acting Oscar, ""something that he's been working towards for the past three decades, and something that's been very, very deserved on many levels"". ""He's wrecked it by his own actions, which is a terrible shame,"" he added, ""but you can't normalise violence because you don't like a joke."" A little more now on the film which won the crown of the night - the best picture award. According toDeadline magazine,external, Coda was the least-watched film in the running for best picture this year. In the US, it had only been streamed about 975,000 times before the ceremony, compared to 10.3 million for Netflix's eco-satire Don't Look Up. With the streaming market increasingly fragmented and confusing, it can be hard to know where the films are available. Luckily, we're here to help. Seemingly putting the events of the night behind him, Will Smith is at the Vanity Fair afterparty dancing to his own songs, and posing for photos with his Oscar. Footage of the star was captured by reporters from trade papers Variety and The Hollywood Reporter and posted online. TheLos Angeles Police Department later told Variety,externalRock had ""declined to file a police report"" after what happened Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a latertweet,external, Jaden shared a photo of himself wearing sunglasses in the back seat of a car, writing: ""My Dads Speech Made Me Cry"". That post has subsequently been deleted. Colin PatersonEntertainment Correspondent, BBC Radio 5 live Will Smith with his sons Trey Smith and Jaden Smith, daughter Willow Smith and wife Jada Pinkett Smith attending the Vanity Fair Oscar Party I've covered 19 Oscars and the only moment that comes close to this is when La La Land was wrongly announced as the Best Picture winner in 2017. I was watching the ceremony from the red carpet at the Vanity Fair party and, at first, everyone just thought it was a joke. ""What's going on here? Is this a bit of comedy? I'm not quite getting this."" Then we quickly realised what had happened. Two hours later, word came through that he was going to attend the afterparty. I thought, 'that's never going to happen', but suddenly he was here, with Jada Pinkett Smith, beaming with smiles and kissing and chatting to people. He wouldn't speak to us. He definitely heard me shout his name. But the couple obviously decided they were going to come to the party and put on a brave face. The sad thing is that, when people talk about the 2022 Oscars, they're not going to say it was the year that a film starring deaf actors won the best picture and broke all kinds of grounds. They're just going to say, 'Oh, that was the Oscars were where Will Smith hit Chris Rock'. This was the moment Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on-stage. There were gasps in the audience as Smith went up on to the stage, slapped Rock, and returned to his seat, where he continued to shout at the presenter. The slap came after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife and Jada's shaved hairstyle - which is a result of the hair loss condition alopecia. She has spoken publicly about her struggle with the condition. Will Smith slaps Chris Rock Will Smith became tearful as he gave his acceptance speech Will Smith went up to the stage and slapped Chris Rock after he made a joke about his wife earlier on in the ceremony. When Smith later went up to the stage, it was to collect his Academy Award for best actor. He delivered this apologetic speech, where he talked about God, love and his actions and referenced his role, as the father of tennis players Venus and Serena Williams: ""Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world. Making this film, I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who is one of the most strongest, most delicate people I've ever met. I got to protect Saniyya [Sidney] and Demi [Singleton], the two actresses who played Venus and Serena. I'm being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people. I know, to do what we do, you've got to be able to take abuse. You got to be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business, you've got to be able to have people disrespecting you, and you've got to smile, you've got to pretend like that's OK. What I loved was, Denzel [Washington] said to me a few moments ago, he said, 'At your highest moment, be careful, that's when the devil comes for you'. I want to be a vessel for love. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena and the entire Williams family for entrusting me with your story. That's what I want to do. I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern. I want to apologise to the Academy. I want to apologise to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment and I'm not crying for winning an award. It's not about winning an award for me. It's about being able to shine a light on all of the people - Tim [White, producer] and Trevor [White, producer] and Zach [Baylin, writer] and Saniyya and Demi and Aunjanue and the entire cast and crew of King Richard, and Venus and Serena, the entire Williams family. Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things. And my motherâ¦ a lot in this moment is really complicated for me but to my mother, she didn't want to come out. She's had her knitting crew who she's in Philly watching with. Being able to love and care for my mother, my family, my wifeâ¦ I'm taking up too much timeâ¦ Thank you for this honour. Thank you for this moment and thank you on behalf of Richard and Oracene and the entire Williams family. Thank you. I hope the Academy invites me back. Thank you."" Her film's success has been overshadowed by what happened at the ceremony - but Welsh actress Emilia Jones, who plays the lead role in Coda, says she is ""on cloud nine"" after the film won all three of the Oscars it was nominated for, including best picture. An independent film about the only hearing child of a deaf family, it had been an underdog during the entire Oscars race, but slowly emerged as a contender in recent weeks. In a touching moment, the audience applauded in sign language as it picked up the night's main award. ""It's been really beautiful watching people adapt and change and learn more signs,"" said Jones, who herself learned sign language to appear in the film. ""That's what this movie has done, I think. It's brought people together... and I'm really hoping it opens doors."" The actress also revealed that she'd received a celebratory text message from her father - the singer and radio presenter Aled Jones. ""He just said, 'wow', in all capital letters!"" We've got some more photos of Will Smith posing as he arrives at the Vanity Fair afterparty. And the mood is a world away from the moment he got up on stage and slapped Chris Rock during the Oscar awards ceremony itself. Smith smiled as he held up his best actor award at the Vanity Fair afterparty Smith arrived with wife Jada Pinkett Smith (L), daughter Willow Smith (2nd L), son Jaden Smith (2nd R) and son Trey Smith (R) Smith struck several poses with his award as other stars queued to have their photographs taken Sadly, the triumphant victory of Coda - a touching, independent film about a deaf family and their hearing daughter - has been completely eclipsed by Will Smith slapping comedian Chris Rock. On social media, it's dominating the conversation - with hashtags like ""assault"" and ""toxic masculinity"" trending. Oneuncensored clip of the altercation,externalhas been viewed 7.1m times. Another clip of Smith being comforted by Denzel Washington and Tyler Perry is also proving popular. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Elsewhere, there are calls for Smith to be stripped of his best actor Oscar, while some people are speculating that the whole thing was staged - not that there is any evidence of that. Photos of the audience's reaction are also going viral, with this shot of Nicole Kidman, from earlier in the night, proving particularly popular.  And Lupita Nyong'o - who was sitting directly behind Smith as he called out to Rock on stage - has also started trending. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sir Kenneth (left) was first nominated for an Oscar in 1989 More now from the awards themselves on the night and actor Jamie Dornan says Sir Kenneth Branagh was given a ""hero's welcome"" by the cast and crew of Belfast, after he won his first ever Oscar (for best original screenplay). ""It was a special moment,"" he told BBC 5 Live's Colin Paterson. ""It's mad to think it's his first after seven nominations and such a career."" Dornan, who plays Pa in the troubles-set drama, said the Oscar meant a lot to the whole team. ""It's all about Ken. None of us are stood here without Ken. So for us to be hanging on his shirt-tails is a very cool thing.""  Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith arrive at the Vanity Fair Oscar party Will Smith has arrived at the Vanity Fair afterparty with wife Jada Pinkett Smith after that controversial moment with Chris Rock. The actor received some cheers as he posed for photographs while showing off his award. BBC Entertainment Correspondent Colin Paterson told 5 Live Smith had taken so long, posing for every photographer, that it was causing chaos on the red carpet. ""There's a queue of about 30 guests unable to get into the party because this has gone on so long."" Comedian and actress Tiffany Haddish has called Will Smith's controversial attack on Chris Rock a ""beautiful thing"". âWhen I saw a Black man stand up for his wife,âshe told People Magazine,externalat the Governors Ball. âThat meant so much to me. ""As a woman, who has been unprotected, for someone to say like, âKeep my wifeâs name out your mouth, leave my wife alone,â thatâs what your husband is supposed to do, right? Protect you. And that meant the world to me. ""And maybe the world might not like how it went down, but for me, it was the most beautiful thing I ever seen because it made me believe that there are still men out there that love and care about their women, their wives.â Smith later apologised on stage. The Academy insisted it ""does not condone violence of any form"", while Los Angeles Police Department said Chris Rock had declined to file a police report. Allow Twitter content?

"The government plans to take a 20% stake in a Â£20bn large-scale nuclear plant at Sizewell, the BBC has learned. French developer EDF will also take a 20% stake in the Suffolk power station. Ministers hope the confirmation of two cornerstone investors will encourage infrastructure investors and pension funds to take up the remaining 60%. Sizewell C is a key part of the new UK energy strategy, anticipated this week. However, no decision is expected yet on the future of Wylfa, in north Wales. Government officials say new nuclear facilities at Wylfa could - like Sizewell - be one of the ""big bets on nuclear"" the prime minister has said are integral to plans to reduce UK reliance on fossil fuels over time. It's not yet clear whether these additional ambitions will include large-scale plants, smaller reactors based on nuclear submarine technology, or both. The government's strategy will also include plans for solar and wind power, as well as stimulating additional investment in oil and gas fields in UK waters. How much nuclear power does the UK use? Ukraine war 'puts Wylfa nuclear back on agenda' Funding plan paves way for Sizewell C nuclear site Legislation allowing construction and financing costs to be added to customer bills, as Sizewell C is built over the next decade, is due for a second reading in the House of Commons next month. It made it through the Lords unamended and is expected to become law in the coming weeks having received strong support from MPs. EDF has insisted the amount added per household will be relatively insignificant, at about Â£2 a year for the first phase, rising to a peak of Â£12 a year. The total cost of Sizewell C is expected to be about Â£20bn. That is slightly less than the plant currently under construction at Hinkley Point, in Somerset, as Sizewell C will be a near-identical replica, creating cost savings. However, those numbers are expected to rise as global inflationary pressures affect prices of steel, cement, wages and the large amounts of energy required to build plants of this size. Groups opposed to the Sizewell plan say it is risky, expensive and endangers wildlife The Â£20bn in capital (at current prices) is expected to be financed with about one-third in equity - or cash up front - and the remainder in debt borrowed from financial markets. The government has already committed Â£100m to the project's development but taking a 20% stake in the equity would see that figure rise to around Â£1.5bn. Nuclear industry insiders say proposed reforms to EU-wide financial regulations (Solvency II) will make it easier for pension funds and insurance companies to invest in long-term infrastructure assets like nuclear. While some Suffolk business groups would welcome the jobs and skills that would be brought to the local economy, there is significant opposition to the plant both at a local level and more widely from those who argue big nuclear is slow, expensive, old fashioned, risky and threatens local wildlife. Anti-Sizewell groups have mounted planning challenges and are expected to demand a judicial review of any approval. Campaign group Stop Sizewell C said: ""We are appalled the government plans to throw billions of pounds in taxpayers' money at Sizewell C and hit households with a nuclear tax on their bills when renewable solutions, insulation, efficiency and energy storage will achieve energy security faster, more cheaply and with much less risk."" However, the government is convinced it is a source of non-imported, low carbon, ""always on"" electricity and has a target for nuclear to contribute 25% of the UK's power needs. Nuclear currently produces about 16% of UK power but, of the eight plants still in operation,  all but one are due to be switched off by 2030. Only Hinkley Point C is currently under construction. That plant alone will produce 7% of current needs when it comes online in 2026. The government is also keen to accelerate the development of smaller reactors, of the kind being developed by Rolls Royce, but designs for these are still at an early stage. Critics argue other technologies like solar and wind are cheaper, faster and greener to deploy. While the current energy crisis, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war, has made a powerful argument for weaning economies off volatile fossil fuels, it has also painfully demonstrated that point is still some way off.

"The Duke of Cambridge has said the royal tour of the Caribbean was an ""opportunity to reflect"" The future relationship between the UK and Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas is for their people to decide, the Duke of Cambridge has said. He said that he and the duchess were ""committed to service"" and that ""for us that's not telling people what to do"". Prince William's comments come after an eight-day tour of the Caribbean nations to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. The trip saw the Jamaican prime minister publicly tell the royal couple that his country would be ""moving on"". It also came four months afterBarbados replaced the Queen with an elected president. In a written statement reflecting on the trip, the prince said foreign tours were an ""opportunity to reflect"". ""You learn so much,"" he said. ""What is on the minds of prime ministers. The hopes and ambitions of school children. The day-to-day challenges faced by families and communities."" William respects Caribbean nations mulling republics Duchess of Cambridge speaks to schoolchildren in the Bahamas The trip saw the duke and duchess visit Belize and Jamaica before a final stop in the Bahamas. The Bahamas leg included a trip to a primary school, where the duchess spoke to pupils about the importance of being able to reconnect after being separated during the pandemic. The couple also visited a church on the Abaco Islands to speak to locals about destruction caused by Hurricane Dorian in 2019, and a coral conservation project that was among last year's winners of the Royal Foundation's Earthshot Prize for contributions to environmentalism. The duke and duchess visit a memorial wall to the victims of Hurricane Dorian in 2019 on the Abaco Islands The duke continued: ""I know that this tour has brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future. ""In Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas, that future is for the people to decide upon."" After the couple left Belize on Tuesday, a government minister announced a new commission would begin consulting with people across the country on how the ""decolonization process"" should proceed. Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis has not commented on the issue, although last year said it was ""not on the agenda"". However, the day before the duke and duchess arrived in the Bahamas, a letter was released by campaign group The National Reparations Committee, calling for Britain to pay reparations for the slave trade. In the statement, the duke said he and his wife saw the purpose of their roles as being to serve and support people ""in whatever way they think best, by using the platform we are lucky to have"". ""Who the Commonwealth chooses to lead its family in the future isn't what is on my mind,"" he said. ""What matters to us is the potential the Commonwealth family has to create a better future for the people who form it.""

"Canada's Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson says there is agreement about moving away from Russian oil and gas Canada says it can provide more oil, gas and uranium to help solve the global energy crisis. Prices have soared as a result of Russian supplies being squeezed because of its invasion of Ukraine. Canada's natural resources minister said many countries are committed ""to help as much as we can in terms of displacing Russian oil and gas"". The world's fourth biggest oil producer has committed to exporting an extra 200,000 barrels of oil. Its Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told BBC News it would also export an additional 100,000 barrels of natural gas. EU signs US gas deal to curb reliance on Russia Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Saudi oil giant to ramp up energy production It follows requests from its allies at ameeting of the world's energy ministers,externalat the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris, which pledged to accelerate the move to clean energy. ""We expect that by the end of the year we will be fully up to the 300,000 barrels,"" said Mr Wilkinson. However, that is only a fraction of the three million barrels a day that the IEA says will be removed from global markets by next month because of sanctions against Russia. Canada will export 200,000 more barrels of oil per day by the end of the year Canada is limited in how much oil it can export because its pipelines are running near full capacity, but Mr Wilkinson says sending it via the United States is an option. Canada's biggest pipeline company Enbridge told the BBC it is ""prepared to do what we can to increase energy security for both North America and Europe"". The impact of Canada's extra supplies ""will be relatively limited given the regionality of Canadian crude, which will likely stay in the North American market"", according to Louise Dickson, who is a senior oil analyst at the consultancy Rystad Energy. ""The main energy crisis is playing out in Europe due to supply shortages, and Asia where demand is on the cusp of recovering if Covid-19 lockdowns can be kept at bay,"" added Ms Dickson. Canada has joined the US and UK in introducinga ban on Russian oil. That hasseen prices pushed upas high as almost $130 (Â£98.56) a barrel since the war in Ukraine began. Mr Wilkinson believes ""there is a consensus"" among the other energy ministers at the meeting that the world needs to cope without Russian oil and gas, adding: ""I think the only differences are around how fast can you actually get away from it."" However, the investment bank JP Morgan says it thinks the ""current extreme aversion to Russian oil will subside"" and that the price of a barrel of oil will fall back to about $100 in the second half of this year. TheInternational Monetary Fund,externalis among those who have raised concerns that higher oil prices are causing costs of goods and energy bills to rise and that inflation is harming the global economy. Mr Wilkinson said leaders must ensure that people ""are able to heat their homes and that industries are able to produce the goods that we all need."" Motorists, including these in Toronto, have seen the price of filling up their car go up as a result of the war in Ukraine In the longer term, Mr Wilkinson said he recognised that ""energy security and fighting climate change are intimately linked"". Addressing immediate concerns, he argued: ""Canadian oil displacing Russian oil doesn't cause more climate change. There's no more CO2 emissions."" Having previously run a ""clean energy"" company, Mr Wilkinson said he was a big believer in using hydrogen and other renewable sources to create more energy going forward. The variable nature of solar and wind power means ""there is a role for nuclear in many jurisdictions in terms of providing baseload rather than intermittent power"", Mr Wilkinson said. Russia plays a key role in the global nuclear power industry. As well as mining uranium, it does a lot of the processing to make it useable in power stations. Energy ministers meeting at the IEA in Paris agreed to maintain a focus on cutting carbon emissions as they seek to move away from Russian oil and gas Canada is ""absolutely"" prepared to export more uranium, said Mr Wilkinson. He explained ""our uranium producers actually do have excess capacity and certainly could ramp up to to help to fill the gap that Russian supplies will provide"". The UN Secretary General didn't mention a role for nuclear power when he said a few days ago that therush to use fossil fuels because of the war in Ukraine is ""madness""and threatens the ability to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C.

"Canada's Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson says there is agreement about moving away from Russian oil and gas Canada says it can provide more oil, gas and uranium to help solve the global energy crisis. Prices have soared as a result of Russian supplies being squeezed because of its invasion of Ukraine. Canada's natural resources minister said many countries are committed ""to help as much as we can in terms of displacing Russian oil and gas"". The world's fourth biggest oil producer has committed to exporting an extra 200,000 barrels of oil. Its Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told BBC News it would also export an additional 100,000 barrels of natural gas. EU signs US gas deal to curb reliance on Russia Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Saudi oil giant to ramp up energy production It follows requests from its allies at ameeting of the world's energy ministers,externalat the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris, which pledged to accelerate the move to clean energy. ""We expect that by the end of the year we will be fully up to the 300,000 barrels,"" said Mr Wilkinson. However, that is only a fraction of the three million barrels a day that the IEA says will be removed from global markets by next month because of sanctions against Russia. Canada will export 200,000 more barrels of oil per day by the end of the year Canada is limited in how much oil it can export because its pipelines are running near full capacity, but Mr Wilkinson says sending it via the United States is an option. Canada's biggest pipeline company Enbridge told the BBC it is ""prepared to do what we can to increase energy security for both North America and Europe"". The impact of Canada's extra supplies ""will be relatively limited given the regionality of Canadian crude, which will likely stay in the North American market"", according to Louise Dickson, who is a senior oil analyst at the consultancy Rystad Energy. ""The main energy crisis is playing out in Europe due to supply shortages, and Asia where demand is on the cusp of recovering if Covid-19 lockdowns can be kept at bay,"" added Ms Dickson. Canada has joined the US and UK in introducinga ban on Russian oil. That hasseen prices pushed upas high as almost $130 (Â£98.56) a barrel since the war in Ukraine began. Mr Wilkinson believes ""there is a consensus"" among the other energy ministers at the meeting that the world needs to cope without Russian oil and gas, adding: ""I think the only differences are around how fast can you actually get away from it."" However, the investment bank JP Morgan says it thinks the ""current extreme aversion to Russian oil will subside"" and that the price of a barrel of oil will fall back to about $100 in the second half of this year. TheInternational Monetary Fund,externalis among those who have raised concerns that higher oil prices are causing costs of goods and energy bills to rise and that inflation is harming the global economy. Mr Wilkinson said leaders must ensure that people ""are able to heat their homes and that industries are able to produce the goods that we all need."" Motorists, including these in Toronto, have seen the price of filling up their car go up as a result of the war in Ukraine In the longer term, Mr Wilkinson said he recognised that ""energy security and fighting climate change are intimately linked"". Addressing immediate concerns, he argued: ""Canadian oil displacing Russian oil doesn't cause more climate change. There's no more CO2 emissions."" Having previously run a ""clean energy"" company, Mr Wilkinson said he was a big believer in using hydrogen and other renewable sources to create more energy going forward. The variable nature of solar and wind power means ""there is a role for nuclear in many jurisdictions in terms of providing baseload rather than intermittent power"", Mr Wilkinson said. Russia plays a key role in the global nuclear power industry. As well as mining uranium, it does a lot of the processing to make it useable in power stations. Energy ministers meeting at the IEA in Paris agreed to maintain a focus on cutting carbon emissions as they seek to move away from Russian oil and gas Canada is ""absolutely"" prepared to export more uranium, said Mr Wilkinson. He explained ""our uranium producers actually do have excess capacity and certainly could ramp up to to help to fill the gap that Russian supplies will provide"". The UN Secretary General didn't mention a role for nuclear power when he said a few days ago that therush to use fossil fuels because of the war in Ukraine is ""madness""and threatens the ability to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. Mr Wilkinson said: ""I think where the secretary general and I would agree very much... is the need to accelerate the work that we're doing on climate change. ""We are we are running out of time. There is no question about that - we need to make significant progress by 2030."" He suggested that the war in Ukraine is underlining ""how important it is not just from a climate perspective, although that's enough, it's from an energy security perspective that we actually do this now.

"Three Arab League states normalised relations with Israel for the first time in 2020 Israel's foreign minster says deepening ties with friendly countries from the Arab League will ""first and foremost"" help counter the threat from Iran. He was speaking after a summit held in Israel for the first time with top diplomats from Arab League countries and the US. Three of them - the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Morocco - formed ties with Israel only in 2020. The foreign ministers pledged to continue to develop the partnership. The Arab League diplomats, along with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Egypt's foreign minister, also reiterated their support for a peaceful solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. All back the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel as part of that, something Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has ruled out. The Palestinian foreign ministry called the summit ""a harsh attack against the Palestinian people"", although it did not directly accuse the Arab League participants, the Times of Israel reported. As the ministers gathered at a hotel in Israel's Negev desert on Sunday night,two Israeli Arab gunmen launched an attack in the northern Israeli city of Hadera, killing two policemen and wounding six people. The gunmen were shot dead by counter-terrorism officers. The Islamic State group said it had carried out the attack. The foreign ministers condemned the killings of the Israeli officers, with Morocco's saying the summit was ""the best response"" to such attacks. After the meeting on Monday morning, Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said the delegates had agreed to make the event ""a permanent forum"". ""What we are doing here is making history, building a new regional architecture based on progress, technology, religious tolerance, security and intelligence co-operation. This new architecture, the shared capabilities we are building, intimidates and deters our common enemies, first and foremost Iran and its proxies."" Five reasons why Israel's peace deals matter Meanwhile the King of Jordan, Abdullah II, visited Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday in his first such trip since 2017. Mr Blinken also held talks with Mr Abbas on Sunday, where he reiterated his support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and for increasing funding to the Palestinians. Earlier in the day, Mr Blinken met Prime Minister Bennett in Jerusalem, following which Mr Bennett's spokesperson said the prime minister had tested positive for coronavirus. The Israel-US talks took place at a time of growing Israeli fears that the US is on the brink of signing a new agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear programme in return for an end to crippling US-led sanctions. It is also concerned that the US will remove Iran's powerful Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) from its list of terrorist groups as part of a new nuclear deal. Former US President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 global nuclear agreement with Iran and restored sanctions in a move which led Iran to significantly advance its nuclear activities which had been barred by the accord. Israel says it believes a new deal will be weaker than the previous one and enable Iran to intensify its military activities across the region.

"Sanctions on Russia are a ""hard lever"" that should only be removed following a ""full ceasefire and withdrawal"" from Ukraine, the foreign secretary says. Liz Truss told theSunday Telegraph,externalthat Moscow would also have to commit to ""no further aggression"" or face the prospect of them being reimposed. The West had to remain ""tough to get peace"", she said. The UK, US, and EU have so far imposed sanctions on over 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses. This week saw Moscow announce it would be refocusing its military operations in Ukraine to the country's east. The move was interpreted by many as a sign that the Kremlin was looking to scale back an invasion that has so far made significantly less progress than was widely expected. Ms Truss said that a negotiations unit had been set up to assist Ukraine once the Russians were ""serious"" about negotiations, but added: ""I don't believe they are serious at present."" ""That's why... we need to double down on sanctions,"" she said. The foreign secretary has previouslysaid she believes the peace talks are a ""smokescreen"",externaldesigned to distract from Russia's actions and allow its armed forces time to regroup. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby EXPLAINED:What sanctions are being imposed? VIDEO:Father killed trying to escape MOSCOW SHIFT:Change of emphasis or admission of failure? READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external It comes after the government announced it haddetained indefinitely two jets owned by Russian oligarch Eugene Shvidler, who had been sanctioned over his ties with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. The jets, estimated to be worth $60m (Â£45m), were seized at Farnborough and Biggin Hill airports following a three-week investigation. Ms Truss said she believed more should have been done to deter Mr Putin following his annexation of Crimea in 2014. ""So there needs to be hard levers,"" she said. ""Of course, sanctions are a hard lever."" ""Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal, but also commitments that there will be no further aggression."" She added that ""snapback sanctions"" could be used in the event of more aggression in the future. Eugene Shvidler (right) has been sanctioned over his ties with longstanding business partner Roman Abramovich As well as sanctions on individuals, recent weeks have seen dozens of countries impose bans on the export of luxury goods to Russia and close their airspace to Russian airlines. Some Russian banks have also been banned from using Swift, the system used to manage international payments, and efforts are underway to explore how Europe can reduce its dependency on Russian oil and gas. Ms Truss's comments echo those of US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said this month that the sanctions on Russia were ""not designed to be permanent"". Mr Blinken said the sanctions could ""go away"" in the event of an ""irreversible"" withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. However, speaking in Poland on Saturday, President Biden said that, while sanctions were weakening Russia, the West needed to ""steel ourselves for the long fight ahead"". Asked about ongoing disagreements with the EU about the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which sets out the post-Brexit trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and the EU, Ms Truss said that countries would always have ""differences that we need to resolve"". ""But those types of differences between friends and allies are different from the scale and the sheer belligerence and aggression and lying of Russia,"" she said. She added that, given the scale of their differences with Russia, it was vital that Western countries ""stick together.""

"There was a last-day-of-school feeling on the hill on Thursday How best to sum up Stormont's bumpy journey over the past five years? Itstarted in deadlock, returned in 2020 only to be confronted by a global pandemic and now it has ended in deadlock once more. And 805 days since the parties agreed to return to the executive, there's now the small matter of an assembly election to fight. While assembly members (MLAs) have had their share of trying times, the assembly's end of term report card is far from blank. Just a quick glance at the list of legislation they have passed in two years and there are nownew laws on everything,externalfrom abolishing parking charges at hospitals, strengthening laws against domestic abuse and ensuring support for children who are adopted. In other areas where Northern Ireland lagged behind the rest of the UK for so long, because of previous stalemates, there is also now progress. Tacklingclimate change, anopt-out organ donation systemand makingstalking a specific offenceamong them. Then compare the 47 bits of legislation passed by Stormont since 2020 - half of them in just the last six weeks - to the 78 bills introduced in the 2011-2016 mandate, as detailed by the speaker Alex Maskey this week as he prepared to step down after more than two decades in front-line politics. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then NI Secretary Julian Smith with then First and Deputy First Ministers Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill in 2020 when Stormont was restored Period poverty campaigners who came to Parliament Buildings on Thursday burst into song shortly after MLAs passed a bill to make period products more freely available, insisting Stormont can be a positive place for change. But the distinct last-day-of-school feel didn't detract from the reality that it could be a long time before the next group of 90 MLAs can get on with making more change. And others made clear as the assembly wrapped up that they feel little has been learned since the previous collapse. MPs pass bill to prevent future Stormont collapse Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis O'Neill wants executive formed after election Independent MLA Claire Sugden - herself a former justice minister in 2016 - remarked that departments were still working in ""silos"" and too often ""pass the buck"". TUV leader Jim Allister, one of Stormont's biggest critics, used his end-of-term speech to describe power-sharing as ""unsustainable and unworkable"". But does it stand any chance of being revived yet again, after 5 May? Julian Smith, an architect of the last effort -New Decade, New Approach- in January 2020, is probably one of the few who thinks it does. The former Northern Ireland secretary said devolved government ""had to continue"". ""It's in the best interests of women, men and children across Northern Ireland, it's a huge economic opportunity,"" he said. ""The main thing is it comes back, and I believe it will come back."" Former NI civil service chief David Sterling says the secretary of state is ""quite interventionist"" After the election, the parties will have a period of 24 weeks - about six months - to reappoint a first and deputy first minister to lead the executive. Until then, other ministers can remain in place but only as caretakers, unable to take any significant decisions in a potentially long limbo. David Sterling, who was head of the Northern Ireland civil service from 2017 until 2020, is well versed in political crises. He believes the six-month window will prove problematic. ""If there are 24 weeks available, at least 24 weeks will be taken,"" he said. ""My big fear is that if we don't get an executive back, we're going to see further decay and stagnation across our public services."" The to-do list for an incoming executive is already packed. including tackling the cost-of-living crisis facing many households and businesses. There are also the ongoing UK-EU talks over the Northern Ireland Protocol which will factor into decisions taken by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) before power-sharing returns. And in the interim, what about the Northern Ireland secretary's role? Brandon Lewishas already announced he will step in over Northern Ireland's abortion laws after the election, bypassing the lack of executive approval on what has for many years been held up by political disagreement. Mr Sterling described the secretary of state as ""quite interventionist"" and said that could pave the way for Westminster to take forward other changes. Though the government still hasn't introduced the legislation on Irish and Ulster-Scots it promised to pass last autumn. All those issues will again be raised on the campaign trail over the next six weeks. What though comes after polling day? ""I just hope we get an executive quickly because this place badly needs it, the scale of the challenges we face requires that,"" added Mr Sterling. ""This time it will be harder to put back together than it was before."" Stormont has rarely stuck to the devolution timetable, but could it soon be out of service for good?

"A new fund to help families in Northern Ireland pay the cost of a funeral following the death of a child will be available from June. The Child Funeral Fund will offer a one-off payment of Â£3,056 after the death of a child under 18. The money will also be made available in the event of a still birth after 24 weeks. The fund is not means-tested and will be available to all families regardless of their financial situation. The Department of Communities, which is responsible for the fund, has said the application process for the money is still being finalised but it would ensure access would be made as simple as possible. Similar schemes already exist elsewhere in the UK. A burial fund was introduced in England in 2018 and fees for the burial or cremation of a child in Scotlandwere abolished in the same year. A payment scheme towards funeral costs wasintroduced in Wales last year In Northern Ireland, some councils have alreadychosen to waive burial costs for children. Announcing the new fund, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said the money would support families at a time of ""devastation and sadness"".

"Protests have taken place at ports over P&O Ferries' sacking of 800 workers in favour of lower-paid replacements. Unions rallied at Dover, Hull and Liverpool, chanting slogans such as ""seize the ship"". Protests caused disruptions, and vehicles in Hull were at one stage turned away. It comes after authorities detained P&O Ferries' European Causeway in Northern Ireland, saying it was ""unfit to sail"". P&O Ferries said it would make changes to return the ship to service. Unions have said that crews without experience of the vessels are a danger to shipping. In Hull, protestors from the RMT union at one stage attempted to block access to P&O ferry the Pride of Rotterdam at the city's King George Dock. They want customers to boycott the company. Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? Calls grow for P&O boss to quit BBC correspondent Paul Murphy, at the scene, said picketers at one stage turned away cars and lorries attempting to board Saturday's 20:30 GMT sailing. However, the Pride of Rotterdam ferry left Hull on schedule for The Netherlands. Earlier, the Trades Union Congress had tweeted a video it said showed P&O dockers in Rotterdam refusing to load freight onto a ferry set for Hull in solidarity with sacked workers. Niek Stam, general secretary of the Docker Workers' Union in Rotterdam, told the BBC Radio 4's PM programme they hoped the protests would make ""P&O come back to the table"", adding ""what they have done is outrageous"". Mr Stam said: ""We believe in solidarity, and we will punish every employer who refuses to consult unions."" He added that the protests will carry on in the coming days ""if it is necessary"". Protests have been held across the UK and Ireland since P&O Ferries announced they were firing 800 members of staff on 17 March Unions have raised fears over a lack of training of new crew, after the firm replaced their members with agency workers whose average hourly rate of pay would be Â£5.50 - less than the UK minimum wage. As the company's ships operate internationally and are registered overseas, the UK minimum hourly rate of Â£8.91 does not apply. The company has said it had to replace crews as it was losing Â£100m a year, and would not be a viable business without making the changes. P&O Ferries bossPeter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs on Fridaythat the decision to sack 800 workers without notice broke the law. He said there was ""absolutely no doubt"" that under UK employment law the firm was required to consult unions before making the mass cuts. But Mr Hebblethwaite said no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers ""in full"" instead. At Saturday's Dover protest, RMT union national secretary Darren Procter said: ""Bringing a crew on board a vessel they're not familiar with to sail across the busiest shipping lane in the world, carrying passengers, is going to be a dangerous act."" He said the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) should detain every P&O Ferries vessel around the UK, on the basis they are not fit to sail. This was the scene in Dover, where protesters condemned the dismissal of P&O workers On Saturday, the MCA said the European Causeway had been impounded in Larne over ""failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training"". No passengers or freight were aboard, it said, adding that the vessel would remain under detention until all issues were resolved by P&O Ferries. Transport Secretary Grant Shappswrote on social media,externalthat the ship's detention had followed an instruction from him to the MCA to inspect ""all P&O vessels"" before they entered back into service. ""I will not compromise the safety of these vessels, and P&O will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training,"" he added. P&O Ferries said it would review the findings of the MCA's inspection, ""make any changes required and continue to work closely with the MCA to return the ship to service"". The company's services on the route the ferry sails - from Larne to Cairnryan, in Scotland - are currently suspended. Seamus Leheny, of freight industry body Logistics UK, said rival ferry operator Stena had increased capacity through Belfast by 50% but the situation at Larne was still causing difficulties for businesses. ""It's not sustainable to have so much freight coming through Belfast... we want that Larne service back up and running as soon as possible,"" he added. P&O Ferries services between Dover and Calais remain cancelled. The firm said it would organise an alternative carrier for passengers. Saturday evening's service from Rotterdam to Hull is also suspended, the firm said - but services between Dublin and Liverpool are expected to run as usual.

The drivers spent four hours in meetings late into the night on Friday discussing whether it was safe to continue driving before eventually deciding to follow the lead of the Saudi government, which gave them assurances the event was secure. ""We don't want to go into details of what we discussed,"" Leclerc said. ""It was more a matter of coming together as drivers to share our options because it was a tricky moment to say the least. ""It was very useful to speak about this all together. It took quite a bit of time but that's normal in those situations. ""We are here anyway and we have not listen to the people who are taking care of the situation, and trust them."" Perez's pole was unexpected to say the least. He is not known as a great qualifier, he beat Verstappen only once in their first season together last year and this achievement came in his 220th grand prix. But it was well deserved. He had looked closer than usual to Verstappen throughout the weekend but put in what he called the lap of his life to beat Leclerc at the very end of qualifying. ""I could do another 1,000 laps and I could never beat this lap time,"" Perez said. The Mexican was 0.261 seconds quicker than world champion team-mate Verstappen, who was down in fourth. Perez beat Leclerc by 0.225secs, with Ferrari's Carlos Sainz third, 0.177secs behind his team-mate. Mercedes driver George Russell was sixth as team-mate Lewis Hamilton could manage only 16th. Leclerc himself had saved his best for last - he improved by more than 0.2secs on his final run to leapfrog himself ahead of Sainz, who had taken provisional pole with his first lap. ""The lap felt good,"" Leclerc said. ""I was very happy with the lap. In the second lap, I just went for it. I definitely did not expect that lap time from Checo and he did an incredible job today."" It sets up an intriguing race, with the Ferraris sandwiched between the Red Bulls at the start, following Leclerc's win in the season-opener in Bahrain last weekend, where Red Bull suffered an agonising late double retirement. And it came at the end of a crash-strewn session in which there were two red flags, the second one for a massive crash involving Schumacher which caused a stoppage of nearly an hour. The attack was nine miles from the circuit Mercedes are not competitive at the moment as they battle with aerodynamic problems in their car but no-one would have foreseen Hamilton's struggles. Hamilton was only 11th fastest in final practice although felt he had hit on a decent set-up direction, but when it came to qualifying after nightfall he complained of a lack of grip. ""It was looking good in P3,"" he said. ""I tried to progress in a similar direction and maybe went a bit too far and the car was just undriveable, so nervous."" It was his worst performance in terms of outright pace, disregarding technical or other problems, since the 2009 British Grand Prix. Russell was more than 0.6secs quicker than the seven-time world champion in the first session and made it through to the final top 10 shootout. But while team boss Toto Wolff said he felt the team were still the third quickest car behind Red Bull and Ferrari, that was not the case, and Ocon snuck in front of him. The second Alpine of Fernando Alonso, Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas, Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly and Haas driver Kevin Magnussen completed the top 10. Lando Norris qualified 11th for McLaren, while his team-mate Daniel Ricciardo was one place behind him but given a three-place penalty for impeding Ocon. Schumacher was ahead of Magnussen early in the second part of qualifying but he pushed too hard through the fast swerves for Turns Eight and Nine, caught the kerb, spun and smashed into the wall. The Haas was badly damaged but Schumacher was conscious throughout and the first indications were that he was uninjured, but he was air-lifted to hospital for precautionary checks. Schumacher, however, will not take part in Sunday's race after the team withdrew his car. The accident has raised further questions about the safety of the track, about which drivers have been concerned since it made its debut last year. The first heave accident happened in the first session, when Nicholas Latifi lost his Williams on the entry to Turn 13. The impact was less severe, and he hit crash barriers rather than an exposed concrete wall and the session was able to resume after a few minutes.

"""For God's sake this man cannot remain in power,"" US President Joe Biden says of Vladimir Putin during a speech in Warsaw The Kremlin responds: ""That's not for Biden to decide - the president of Russia is elected by Russians"" The White House says Biden meant Putin should not wield power over neighbours, rather than calling for regime change Powerful explosions have been heard in Lviv, which has been spared the worst of the fighting so far Thick black smoke has been seen rising over the outskirts of the city in the west of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukraine has inflicted ""powerful blows"" and ""significant losses"" on the Russians Edited by Thom Poole Thanks for joining us -we are continuing our live coverage on a new address. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has demanded the West steps up military supplies, saying it wasn't just Ukraine at risk. ""What is the price of this security? This is very specific. These are planes for Ukraine. These are tanks for our state. This is anti-missile defense. This is anti-ship weaponry. This is what our partners have. This is what is covered with dust at their storage facilities,"" he said. ""Because it cannot be acceptable for everyone on the continent if the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia and the whole of Eastern Europe are at risk of a clash with the Russian invaders."""" He said Ukraine needed just 1% of Nato's tanks and aircraft. ""We did not ask for more. And we do not ask for more. And we have already been waiting for 31 days!""  A seven-year-old Ukrainian refugee from Lviv plays outside a temporary shelter in Poland Children in Ukraine face a dire situation and one in two have had to flee their homes, a Unicef spokesperson has told the BBC. The western Ukrainian city of Lvivhas come under heavy rocket fireand James Elder, who's from the UN children's charity Unicef, says the attacks add to the terror felt by people there. ""I'd been to a hospital where I see women go down, every time there's an air raid siren, carrying two day old babies or women 36 weeks pregnant who are frigid cold"", he says. ""Those women are hiding again tonight - terrified, petrified. And so many other people and children."" ""You can just see in the faces of families who have been through this in Kyiv, or Khakiv, and thought they were getting a moment's respite. Well the missiles tell a very different story tonight."" Earlier we reported that the city of Slavutych, where many of the Chernobyl power plant's workers live, has been taken by Russian forces. Now the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed its concern over the welfare of the plant's employees, as there has been no staff rotation at the plant for nearly a week. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, says there are concerns about the ability of staff to regularly rotate and return to their homes to rest. Earlier this month, Grossi stressed the ability of staff to carry out their tasks without undue pressure is one of ""the seven indispensable pillars for nuclear safety"". This is not the only nuclear plant held by the Russians. Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, is also in the hands of Russian troops. ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" said US President Joe Biden of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during a speech in Warsaw earlier. You can watch a clip of the speech - where Biden condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine - below. This video can not be played War in Ukraine: Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power - Biden The Eclipse - a superyacht belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich - docked in Marmaris, Turkey, on 22 March Russia's oligarchs can continue to do business in Turkey so long as they respect international law, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says. He was asked at the Doha Forum in Qatar if Russian oligarchs facing sanctions from western countries could do business in Turkey. ""Of course, if it is legal; if it is not against international law, I will consider it,"" he says. ""If it is against international law, that's another story."" Two superyachts belonging to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovichdocked in Turkey this week. Nato member Turkey, which has strong ties with both Russia and Ukraine, hasn't joined western sanctions targeting Moscow's oligarchs. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Lviv First, mid-afternoon, the air raid sirens went off. Then,
three powerful explosions, and thick plumes of smoke could be seen from the
distance. Hours later, another attack. It all happened a day after Russia said it was focusing its
invasion of Ukraine on the east. Lviv is in the extreme opposite. And this distance from the worst of Russiaâs aggression,
where people have been under unrelenting bombing and shelling, turned this city
into something like a safe haven. Displaced people, humanitarian workers,
volunteers. They are all here. That perception could be changing. Maryanna Pack, a
39-year-old economist who was near the site of the blast, gives a passionate
testimony that may be shared by many. âWeâre feeling unprotected. Nobody really
cares about whatâs happening here,â she says. âWe need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely
destroyed. Itâs really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the
country too.â A nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, has been hit by Russian shelling, according to authorities cited in a Ukrainian news outlet. The Kyiv Independent said because of constant shelling in the area, in the north east of the country, authorities have been unable to assess the damage to the site. Russia has been repeatedly criticised for targeting nuclear power plants in Ukraine, such as the Zhaporizhia nuclear plant in the south east. Though risky, there has so far been no release of radioactive material from this site. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The Russian air strikes on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv today were intended to send a message to US President Joe Biden, mayor Andriy Sadovyy says. He's been speaking at a joint briefing with the head of the Lviv military civil administration, Maksym Kozytskyy, broadcast on YouTube. ""I think that, with today's strikes, the aggressor is sending greetings to President Biden, who is in Poland now. Lviv is 70 km away from Poland,"" Sadovyy says. ""I think the whole world should realise that the threat is extremely serious."" Kozytskyy says the missiles hit two critical infrastructure facilities, one of which was an oil depot in a residential area in Lviv, and another was a military plant also located in a residential area. Each of them was targeted by two missile attacks, he says. No-one was killed, Kozytskyy adds, but five people sought medical help. The Kharkiv Music Festival, in Ukraine's second city, has gone ahead, despite relentless shelling by Russia since the start of the war. Organisers insisted the event must start as scheduled, so musicians have been performing deep underground, on the marble steps of a metro station which serves as a huge bomb shelter. A small crowd watched, some with their eyes closed, others holding children or pets, as a string quintet played classical music, as well as the national anthem. A cello player who performed at the festival, Denys Karachevtsev, said he wanted to deliver a message of hope to the people of Kharkiv: ""My message is that we have no fear, we are strong, and we can be helpful for our country, each person [in their own way]."" Violinist Tatiana Choukh said ""it was maybe the best concert of my life"". The mayor of Ukraine's capital Kyiv - former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko - has urged thousands of protesters in central London to stand with Ukraine. A huge crowd of people, including Ukrainians living in the UK, politicians and celebrities,marched through London in solidarity with Ukraine. Klitschko, speaking via video link from a military bunker, told the crowd on a big screen near Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square: ""We defend, right now, the same principles. ""Please keep together with our country, keep together with Ukraine."" London mayor Sadiq Khan has announced more than Â£1.1m in funding to support migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK capital, and said he was ""full of admiration"" for people who have offered Ukrainian refugees somewhere to stay. Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, told the crowd: ""I urge you to keep up the good work, the military and humanitarian aid. ""The sanctions must continue until the Russian economy has stopped in its tracks."" Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden met at a summit in Geneva in June of last year It is not for Joe Biden to decide if Vladimir Putin stays in power, the Kremlin says. As we reported earlier, the US president gave a speech with comments aimed directly at the Russian people, closing with: ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" According to Reuters, a Kremlin spokesman responded: ""That's not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians."" A White House official says Biden was not calling for regime change, but making the point Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region. Biden was delivering the speech earlier in Warsaw, where he has met Ukrainian government ministers and refugees who have crossed the border into Poland. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A building that was home to several families in Kharkiv has been destroyed Russia has destroyed about 4,500 residential buildings, 100 enterprises, 400 educational institutions and 150 medical establishments in Ukraine, a Ukrainian government minister says. The total damage across the country will be assessed after the end of hostilities and removal of mines, Minister for Community and Territorial Development Oleksiy Chernyshov says, as quoted by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. According to preliminary assessments, the losses incurred by Ukraine have reached tens of billions of US dollars, with the sum increasing daily. With a view to reconstruction efforts, the government has simplified procedures for construction material imports.
   However, the minister adds, any reconstruction must be preceded by clearing mines and rubble. Ukraine hopes to involve domestic and foreign specialists in reconstruction efforts. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Lviv The deputy mayor of thebesieged Ukrainian city of Mariupolsays people are starting to die from starvation and dehydration, as food and
water supplies run low and no humanitarian aid is allowed in. âSome are dying from dehydration and lack of food.
Some are dying from lack of medicine, insulin... Because people cannot find
medical help,â Sergey Orlov tells the BBC. âSome mothers do not have milk, and they don't have food
for children. What should they do with their infants? I donât know. Thereâs no
food for children at all in the city.â Mariupol has been under relentless Russian attacks since the
early days of the war, and pictures show a city in ruins, with entire
neighbourhoods destroyed. Orlov says 70% of hospitals in the city have been âdestroyed
by bombing and shellingâ. Communication with the city is difficult, as the phone
network is intermittent, so it is hard to independently verify information.
Residents spend most of their time in shelters or basements with no
electricity, running water, or gas. âPeople are just looking for any possibility to survive.
[They] share food, water, theyâre collecting wood to cook in the street,â Orlov
says. More than 100,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol. Efforts
to carry out large-scale evacuations have failed, although thousands have
managed to leave in recent days in private vehicles. Next, Joe Biden addresses the Russian people, saying he's worked with Russian leaders for decades, since the height of the Cold War. ""I've always spoken directly and honestly to you the Russian people,"" he says. ""Let me say this, if you're able to listen. You the Russian people are not our enemy. ""I refuse to believe you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents. ""Or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards for God's sake, being pummelled with Russian missiles and bombs. ""Or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee, supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submission. ""Millions of families are being driven from their homes, including half of all Ukraine's children. ""These are not the actions of a great nation."" He closes his speech with a reference to Vladimir Putin - ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" ""My message to the people of Ukraine... we stand with you, period,"" President Biden says during his speech in Warsaw, a line greeted by cheers. ""Today's fighting in Kyiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv are the latest battles in a long struggle,"" he says. ""Hungary in 1956, Poland in 1956 and then again in 1981, Czechoslovakia in 1968 - Soviet tanks crushed democratic uprisings but the resistance continued until finally in 1989, the Berlin Wall and all the walls of Soviet domination, they fell and the people prevailed. ""The battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the Cold War. ""Over the last 30 years the forces of autocracy have revived all across the globe. Its hallmarks are familiar ones. Contempt for the rule of law, contempt for democratic freedom, contempt for the truth itself. ""Today, Russia has strangled democracy and has sought to do so elsewhere."" Biden says it is obscene that Vladimir Putin has lied by saying he is trying to de-Nazify Ukraine. US President Joe Biden says Ukraine and its people are ""fighting to save their nation"", as he  addresses crowds in Warsaw. We need to be clear-eyed - this battle will not be won in days, or months, either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead"" US President Joe Biden US President Joe Biden is speaking in the Polish capital Warsaw. Stay with us and we'll bring you the latest from his speech. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Lviv Smoke from the explosions rises behind Volodymyr Kachinsky More now on the explosions in Lviv. We've heard from residents there. Volodymyr Kachinsky, 24, was working at a restaurant near the area of the western city hit by rocket strikes on Saturday afternoon. âI had never heard anything like this. I can only imagine whatâs happening in the east.â He says he still thought Lviv was safe. â[But] it was really scary.â Maryanna Pack: We need more help now Maryanna Pack, a 39-year-old economist, was also nearby. âIt was a loud noise,â she said. âWeâre feeling unprotected. Nobody really cares about whatâs happening here. We need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely destroyed. Itâs really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the country too.â She said she felt the war coming closer to this city. âThings have changed dramatically. We spend a lot of time in shelters,â she said, because of the constant air-raid sirens. âThis is creating fear and anger.â Joe Biden made the comment to a reporter after meeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland's capital Warsaw US President Joe Biden has described Vladimir Putin as a butcher, during a meeting with Ukrainian refugees in Poland. Biden made the comment at a televised event at the national stadium in Warsaw, on a visit to show support for Poland over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, during which he also met members of the Ukrainian government. A reporter asked the president ""You're dealing every day with Vladimir Putin, look at what he's done to these people. What does it make you think?"" ""He's a butcher,"" responded Biden before walking away. Biden also said each refugee he spoke to had asked him to say a prayer for the safety of their father or brother back home in Ukraine. In response to the president's comments, a Kremlin spokesman quoted by Russia's TASS news agency said Biden's comment narrows the prospects of mending ties between Washington and Moscow. Â© 2025 BBC.
