"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK A new ultrasound process offering more successful diagnosis and management of prostate cancer has been identified by Dundee University researchers. The university said non-invasive shear wave elastography (SWE) offers ""much greater accuracy and reliability"" than current testing and is less expensive. Prostate cancer is themost common cancer in menin the UK. Former Dundee University rector Stephen Fry,who underwent surgery for prostate cancer, called the research ""exciting"". Over 47,000 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed in the UK every year. The most common tests for the disease include the PSA blood test, a digital rectal examination (DRE), MRI scans and a biopsy. The university said each of these carried ""significant problems"". The new method targets the prostate with ultrasound. The Dundee University study involved about 200 patients. Cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue, so the shear waves are slowed as they pass through it. The technology was able to detect 89 per cent of prostate cancers and could identify more aggressive cancers and those beginning to spread outside the prostate. Ghulam Nabi, professor of surgical uro-oncology at the university, said, ""Prostate cancer is one of the most difficult to pinpoint. ""We are still in a position where our diagnosis of prostate cancer is extremely inefficient, leading to unnecessary treatments for many patients."" Prof Nabi said the new treatment was ""like someone has turned the lights on in a darkened room."" He said: ""We have had cases where the SWE technique has picked up cancers which MRI did not reveal. ""We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs."" Stephen Fry said news of the new technique was ""doubly, triply exciting"" Stephen Fry underwent surgery for prostate cancer in January. He said it was ""doubly, triply exciting"" to hear of the new techniques. He said: ""Anyone who has been in my position will know that when it comes to this pernicious disease early screening and diagnosis is the absolute key to a successful outcome. ""The news of this breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the UK, not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence. ""So hurrah for Dundee University and Medical School and a huge thank you to Professor Nabi and his team for their work in developing this new weapon in the war against a deadly killer.""

"The provisional daily average maximum temperature for May 2018 was 17C Last month was the warmest May since records began more than 100 years ago, the Met Office has said. According to provisional figures, May 2018saw an average daily maximum temperature of 17C,external(63F). It would beat the previous May record of 16.9C set in 1992. The Met Office said spring 2018, which ran from March to May, had been ""very dynamic with many fluctuations"". But the period was 0.3C higher than the average between 1981 and 2010. Across the UK, the average May temperature was 1.5C above the long-term 1981-2010 average at 11.9C. With 245.3 hours of sunshine, it is also likely to be confirmed as be the sunniest May since 1989, which saw 241.7 hours of sun. May 2018 was the sunniest since 1989, according to provisional Met Office figures Records for temperature began in 1910 and sunshine in 1929. Less than two-thirds of the average amount of rain for the month fell in May 2018. But with wetter than average spells during March and April, the rainfall for the UK for spring (March to May) as a whole has been near average. The early May Bank Holiday was the hottest on record The early May Bank Holiday wasthe hottest since the holiday was introduced in 1978. Tim Legg, of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said: ""Increased sunshine during (May) has helped to keep daytime temperatures high. Despite changes in the weather, spring was on average warmer than the average between 1981 and 2010 ""People's impressions of spring may well be coloured by their personal weather memories, from coping with freezing conditions to enjoying a hot spell in April. ""Actually, it may well challenge perceptions to realise that the provisional average temperature for this spring is 8C, meaning it has been largely warmer than average across the UK by about 0.3C, when compared with the average between 1981Â­ and 2010."" The beginning of spring saw large parts of the country hit by snow storms March sawseveral winter stormsincluding the tail ends of the Beast from the East andStorm Emma. April sawthe hottest April day since 1949when, on 19 April, the temperature reached 29.1C in London St James' Park. The meteorological summer began on 1 June.

"Thousands of people attended the rally in Belfast Thousands of people have taken part in a rally in Belfast calling for the legalisation of same-sex marriage. A simultaneous rally took place in Londonderry. Among those who attended the Belfast rally were Lord Mayor Nuala McAllister and Northern Ireland-born Labour MP Conor McGinn. Last month,a bill brought by Mr McGinn to bring same-sex marriage to NIwas blocked from moving to the next stage at Westminster. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK and Ireland where same-sex marriage is still illegal. Deadlock over the issue has dogged Stormont for years. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK and Ireland where same-sex marriage is still illegal The last time MLAs debated it a majority voted in favour but the DUP blocked the move using a petition of concern. Police estimate that about 5,000 people were at Saturday's rally in Belfast. But Mr McGinn said the number was higher, claiming 20,000 people attending across the two venues. ""There are tens of thousands more at home who want the law changed - that's what we're demanding from this government,"" Mr McGinn told the BBC. The MP said there is ""a huge majority in the House of Commons"" who want the legislation changed. ""Westminster has a duty to legislate for equal rights in Northern Ireland. These rights are enjoyed by people right across the UK and the rest of the island of Ireland. ""With no functioning assembly, Theresa May must act. This video can not be played 'We can't have inequality and discrimination' ""We can't have inequality and discrimination for LGBT people here - we don't have it anywhere else. ""It confirms what I've always thought which is that the campaign for love equality, for equal marriage in Northern Ireland, has huge support right across the community."" Lord Mayor Ms McAllister said she was honoured that the march was her last event in the role. ""Marriage equality is just one step towards total equality for the LGBT community here,"" she said. Nuala McAllister said Westminster must act in the absence of a functioning assembly in Northern Ireland ""This will not harm anyone. This will not harm your marriage, nor anyone else's. This is about celebrating love between two people. There is nothing to be afraid of."" She added: ""I'm disappointed that we cannot legislate for marriage equality locally. We have too many people in the assembly who abuse power with the petition of concern."" Ms McAllister called for the petition of concern mechanism to be changed. ""If we can't legislate here, it has to be done at Westminster."" If a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support. In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions. A valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs.

"Helpers tried to stabilise the whale but it died on Friday afternoon A pilot whale has died off southern Thailand after swallowing 80 plastic bags, Thai marine officials say. The whale vomited five bags during a vain attempt by conservation officials to save it in a canal in Songkhla province. The bags, weighing about 8kg (17lbs), had made it impossible for the whale to eat food, a marine expert said. A recent report warned the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decadeunless litter was curbed. Thailand is a major user of plastic bags and its government last month announced it was considering a levy on them. Ocean plastic a 'planetary crisis' - UN 'Shame and anger' at plastic ocean pollution Plastic pollution: Images of a global problem They are believed to kill hundreds of marine animals there each year. The small male pilot whale had been discovered ailing and unable to swim in the Na Thap Canal last Monday. Environmental officials used boats to try to help float the whale and erected a sunshade for it. They nursed the whale through the week but it died on Friday afternoon. Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Marine biologist Thon Thamrongnawasawat told Agence France-Presse the bags would have made it impossible for the whale to eat nutritional food.

"Father Ted ran on Channel 4 between 1995-98 Cult comedy Father Ted is set to return as a musical, its co-creator has confirmed. Graham Linehan said the show, called Pope Ted: The Father Ted Musical, was almost written. Fellow writer Arthur Matthews and the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon, who wrote the show's theme tune and original music, are involved in the project. Linehan said it would be ""the real final episode of Father Ted"". He told the BBC: ""It's like putting on an old pair of slippers."" The sitcom ran for three series between 1995-98 on Channel 4, chronicling the escapades of Irish parish priest Father Ted Crilly. Allow Twitter content?

The musical will see Ted move from the fictional Craggy Island to his new role as Pope in the Vatican. Linehan, who also created Channel 4 sitcom the  IT Crowd and co-created sitcom Black Books, said the musical was about ""the least qualified man in the world becoming Pope"". He said: ""I didn't want to do anything like this until the right idea came along, and when Trump won and Corbyn won [the Labour leadership] I kind of thought, 'Maybe Ted has a chance'. ""I thought it wouldn't be too much of a stretch. Obviously we're pulling some shenanigans to get him into that position but I think the shenanigans are entertaining enough that people won't mind."" Dermot Morgan played Father Ted in the Channel 4 comedy series Father Ted became a hit in the 1990s, chronicling the life of the eponymous character, the gormless but loveable Father Dougal McGuire, foul-mouthed drunk Father Jack Hackett and tea-obsessed Mrs Doyle. Stars Ardal O'Hanlon and Pauline McLynn went on to enjoy mainstream success. But Dermot Morgan, who played Father Ted, died from a heart attack the day after filming the final episode Actors, artists and TV personalities who appeared in the show included One Foot In The Grave Star Richard Wilson, presenter Graham Norton, Dervla Kirwan from BBC TV series Ballykissangel and Altered Images lead singer Clare Grogan Storylines included Ted kicking Bishop Brennan in the backside, a group of priests getting lost in ""Ireland's biggest lingerie section"", and Ted trying to become Ireland's Eurovision  nomination with the song, My Lovely Horse The Father Ted theme tune is taken from the Divine Comedy song, Songs of Love. Hannon, the band's lead singer - who is writing the music for the musical - collaborated with Linehan and Matthews on songs for the original sitcom, the most famous being My Lovely Horse - which he also sang in the episode. He also wrote the theme music for the IT Crowd. Neil Hannon has collaborated with Graham Linehan on Father Ted and The IT Crowd Lineham said the team did not know where the musical would debut but said he hoped it would be on stage next year. It is the first time in 20 years that he and Matthews have returned to the characters from Father Ted.

"This video can not be played Norman Scott: ""There is obviously a lot of skulduggery that's gone on"" A probe into a scandal involving former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe is to be revisited, after police admitted that a key suspect may still be alive. A 2015 investigation into the alleged attempted murder of Mr Thorpe's lover - Norman Scott - was closed in 2017. Gwent Police believed Andrew Newton - who claimed he was paid to kill Mr Scott - had died. But the force has now told the BBC this may not be the case. Mr Scott said he thought police were continuing a ""cover-up"". The revelations have been made in the BBC Four documentary The Jeremy Thorpe Scandal. Following the BBC's revelations, theMail on Sunday said it had tracked down Mr Newton,external- living under a different name - in Surrey. The paper has published what it claims is a picture of Mr Newton, taken on Saturday. The man's face cannot be seen. Mr Thorpe, who died in 2014, was accused of hiring a hitman to murder Mr Scott but was acquitted at an Old Bailey trial in 1979. The fresh investigation was launched by Gwent Police in 2015 after new claims emerged. But the police's belief that Newton - who was convicted of shooting Mr Scott's dog in 1975 - had died, led the Crown Prosecution Service to close it last year. Gwent Police told documentary makers enquiries made as part of the investigation had ""indicated Newton was deceased"". But they added: ""We have now revisited these enquiries and have identified information which indicates that Newton may still be alive."" The force said it planned to assess if Mr Newton ""is able to assist the investigation"". When asked on Saturday night about the Mail on Sunday's claims to have tracked Mr Newton to Surrey, Gwent Police said it had ""lines of inquiry open"" but would not provide further comment ""at this time"". This video can not be played A look at the Jeremy Thorpe scandal, the focus of a new BBC drama with Hugh Grant Jeremy Thorpe was the MP for North Devon for 20 years, and leader of the Liberal Party between 1967-76. He died in 2014 He was offered a cabinet post after the February 1974 election by then-Prime Minister Edward Heath In late 1960 or early 1961 he met Norman Scott, who worked for one of Mr Thorpe's friends in Oxfordshire. Mr Scott said the two were lovers, at a time when homosexuality was illegal Mr Scott spent years attempting to reveal the pair's relationship to the public, then claimed Mr Thorpe conspired with colleagues to have him assassinated In 1975, Andrew Newton shot Mr Scott's Great Dane, Rinka, on a rural road in Exmoor, but failed to kill Mr Scott after his gun jammed Newspapers began reporting Mr Scott's claims after he spoke about the relationship in court, meaning they were protected from libel laws Mr Thorpe resigned as leader of the Liberal Party in 1976 over the reports, but denied Mr Scott's allegations. He lost his seat in North Devon in 1979 Mr Thorpe, along with three co-defendants, stood trial. Ex-Liberal MP Peter Bessell, and the failed assassin Newton, gave details of the alleged plot. A jury acquitted all four in 1979 BBC Panorama journalist Tom Mangold, who has investigated the case since the 1970s, said the 2015 investigation hinged on the story of a man he had met called Dennis Meighan. Mr Meighan told the veteran reporter he was originally approached to carry out the murder - but he claimshis police statement was later doctoredto remove incriminating references to the Liberal Party and to Mr Thorpe. A Very 'bone-chilling' English Scandal Hugh Grant, politics and a murdered dog Revealed: Letter that silenced Thorpe Following Gwent Police's admission that Newton could still be alive, Mr Mangold insisted the investigation ""must start again"". And reacting to the news, Mr Scott, 78, told the documentary: ""I just don't think anyone's tried hard enough to look for him. I really don't. ""There must be people who knew him and there would surely be a record of him dying. ""I thought [Gwent Police] were doing something at last, and soon found out that absolutely they weren't, they were continuing the cover up as far as I can see."" Jeremy Thorpe, a former leader of the Liberal Party, was acquitted of conspiracy to murder his ex-lover in 1979 The programme includes unearthed footage from a Panorama programme from 1979 that was never broadcast for legal reasons, after Mr Thorpe and his three co-defendants were acquitted of conspiracy to murder. The director general at the time kept a master copy of the programme but ordered all other copies to be destroyed. But journalist Tom Mangold kept his copy of the report.

"Drugs that boost the immune system have saved the lives of some men with terminal prostate cancer, say doctors in the UK. The team at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden Hospital in London said the results were ""spectacular"" and a ""big deal"". However, the therapy will not work for most patients. Cancer Research UK said the next step was to predict who would respond. Immunotherapy is transforming the treatment of cancer and is now part of routine practice for some skin and lung cancers. It works by taking the brakes off a patients' own immune system so it can attack a tumour. An early stage trial, presented at the world's biggest meeting of cancer doctors and scientists in Chicago, is the first to show that this approach works on prostate cancer too. In the UK, the disease is the most common cancer in men and it has recently overtaken breast cancer to become the third biggest killer. Prostate cancer patient Michael English had more than 10 years of treatment before an immunotherapy drug made him ""effectively cancer-free"" Michael English, 72, was one of 258 men who took part in the trial. He was first diagnosed in 2005, but radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone-based therapies did not kill his cancer. Two years ago, he was given the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab. He said: ""We were astonished when scans showed that the tumour had become undetectable. ""Today I'm effectively cancer-free."" He says he's now planning out the next 20 years of his life, not the next two. Prostate cancer breakthrough hailed Help to spot and treat prostate cancer Late prostate cancer diagnosis 'worries' Researcher Prof Johann de Bono told the BBC: ""This is the first evidence that a subset of prostate cancer patients do spectacularly well on immunotherapy. ""We have several patients in the Marsden who have had a complete response. ""It is a new arrow in the quiver for men with lethal prostate cancer, it's a big deal for these patients."" However, he said that only between 10% and 15% of patients had any response to the therapy at all. This is an approach that will not help the majority of men. That is not unusual for immunotherapy. It seems to work incredibly well for a handful of patients, have a temporary effect in others, and do nothing for the rest. The team in London have seen hints that it works best in patients with the most heavily-mutated cancers. Nell Barrie, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""The next step will be to find out how to tell which men will benefit from taking this drug. ""This is important as although immunotherapy is exciting, it can have severe side effects."" Your immune system is trained to fight infection, but it also attacks parts of the body if they malfunction - such as in cancers. However, tumours have a few tricks up their sleeve in order to survive. They can produce a protein called PD-L1 which switches off any part of the immune system that tries to attack them. Pembrolizumab is one of a suite of drugs called ""checkpoint inhibitors"" being developed by pharmaceutical companies. They stop cancers turning off the immune system so the body can keep on attacking the tumour. The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

"Ben Whishaw (background) and Hugh Grant in A Very English Scandal The opening episode of A Very English Scandal - documenting the rise and fall of politician Jeremy Thorpe - has received broad praise from critics. The BBC mini-series stars Hugh Grant in ""revelatory"" form as the Liberal Party leader, with Ben Whishaw as his ex-lover Norman Scott. Viewers joked thatthe Paddington co-starsturn as lovers meant the family films had taken an ""unexpected turn"". Here is a round-up of reaction to the ""funny"" yet ""chilling"" debut episode. Ahead of broadcast of the Russell T Davies adaptation, much had been made of the decision to cast Grant - previously typecast as a romcom actor - in the role of Thorpe. The Guardian,externalsuggests the gamble has paid off with Grant ""never less than wholly convincing and compelling"" and ""clearly having the time of his actorly life,"" writes Lucy Mangan. Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw previously co-starred in Paddington 2 ""Everything (bar the stutter) that made him a romcom star is still there, but now there is everything else too,"" she says. ""He handles the comic scenes and moments, which are sprinkled liberally throughout, with the deftness you'd expect, but never loses sight of the underlying nervousness, fear and venality underlying the politician's moves,"" Mangan continues. Grant is aided by Davies' dialogue, adapted from John Preston's novel of the same name,says Digital Spy,external- capturing the ""tragedy and farce"" of the scandal prior to the partial legalisation of homosexuality in 1967. A gay affair, a bungled plot and a dead dog on Exmoor were the ingredients of what came to be dubbed ""the trial of the century"". Thorpe - leader of the Liberal Party - became the first British politician to be tried for conspiracy and incitement to murder - charged over an assassination plot against his secret lover Norman Scott. The real Jeremy Thorpe (left) died in 2014, while Norman Scott lives on However, it was a Great Dane called Rinka that ended up being shot on Exmoor in October 1975, by a man whom Scott believed had been sent to kill him. A police investigation into the Exmoor incident led to Thorpe and three associates being charged. Thorpe was acquitted but his career never recovered. He died in 2014, aged 85, after a long battle with Parkinson's. Read the full story. The Telegraph,externalis similarly effusive calling Hugh Grant ""both charming and bone-chilling in this brilliant take on the Thorpe affair"". The paper's Jasper Rees argues Grant's portrayal embodies ""everything that is perfectly loathsome about some Establishment figures: entitlement and charm masking the ruthless guile of a predator."" The depiction of Thorpe's double-life is enabled with ""spiffing joie de vivre"" through Alex Jenning's performance as fellow MP Peter Bessell - the confidant turned witness in Thorpe's eventual trial for conspiracy to murder Scott. And whileThe Times' review,externalnotes the real-life Scott, now 78, reportedly ""hates"" the way Whishaw portrays him as a ""mincing weakling,""The Independent,externalsees Whishaw's take as the puppy-eyed model to be ""pitifully believable"". However, critical response to Whishaw's performance on social media quickly became dwarfed by comparisons to his role in Paddington. The 37-year-old voiced the much-loved bear in the 2014 reboot and last year's sequel, in which Grant, 57, played villain Phoenix Buchanan. Allow Twitter content?

"Ben Whishaw (background) and Hugh Grant in A Very English Scandal The makers of A Very English Scandal, a BBC drama about shamed politician Jeremy Thorpe, explain why his story is still relevant. A gay affair, a bungled plot and a dead dog on Exmoor were the ingredients of what came to be dubbed ""the trial of the century"". At its centre was Jeremy Thorpe - leader of the Liberal Party, a pillar of the establishment and the first British politician to be tried for conspiracy and incitement to murder. Now, almost 40 years on from Thorpe's sensational acquittal, the story behind the case is being retold in a three-part BBC drama. Directed by Stephen Frears and written by Russell T Davies, A Very English Scandal stars Hugh Grant as Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Norman Scott, the ex-lover he was accused of trying to have killed. Based onJohn Preston's 2016 book,external, the dramatisation begins with Thorpe meeting and seducing Scott, a young and sexually inexperienced worker at a horse stables. Once the affair has run its course, Thorpe finds Scott to be a persistent thorn in his side who poses a serious threat to his political ambitions. Grant previously worked with Stephen Frears on Florence Foster Jenkins At the end of episode one, Thorpe is seen exhorting a colleague (played by Alex Jennings) to arrange Scott's death, coldly reasoning that ""it's no worse than shooting a sick dog"". And it was a dog - a Great Dane called Rinka - that ended up being shot on Exmoor in October 1975, by a man whom Scott believed had been sent to kill him. ""It was an absolutely idiotic story, unless you're the dog,"" says Frears. ""But at the bottom of it all was murderousness. ""It's a wonderful, very funny and ridiculous story about corruption in public life."" ""But it's also very sad,"" says Russell T Davies, of Doctor Who and Queer as Folk fame. ""Lives were ruined by this. ""These events were so devastating, people fell out of history. The story still creates controversy, even after all these years."" Whishaw's voice was heard in Paddington and its sequel, in which Grant also appeared Grant remembers the case being ""a riveting and juicy business"" that was ""a source of much sniggering"" when he was in school. ""I love things that are funny and sad at the same time, which rejoice in eccentricity and the oddness of people,"" he continues. Yet the star of Notting Hill and Love, Actually admits to being perplexed when Frears first approached him about the project. ""Stephen rang me up and I said 'Which part?'"" the actor recalls. ""I thought he maybe wanted me to play Rinka the dog."" Not a wholly absurd idea given Grant's recent role in Paddington 2 as a washed-up thespian reduced to appearing in dog food commercials, dressed as a dog. The canine that eventually landed the Rinka role was a source of some frustration to Whishaw, who provided the voice of Paddington and played Q in the recent James Bond films. ""Great Danes, I have learned, are not so clever,"" sighs the actor. ""They're quite highly strung and not that smart."" The real Jeremy Thorpe (left) died in 2014, while Norman Scott lives on Whishaw is however full of praise for the real Scott, now 78, who met with the actor during the course of the production. ""Stephen said I should meet the real Norman so I did,"" Whishaw says. ""It was nice to see him and hear how he recalls these events."" A police investigation into the Exmoor incident led to Thorpe and three associates being charged with conspiring to murder Scott. Scott gave evidence at their 1979 trial, during which he was infamously vilified by the presiding judge as ""a sponger, a whiner and a parasite"". Sir Joseph Cantley's remarks were seized upon by the satirical comedian Peter Cook, who took to the stage shortly afterwards to delivera merciless skewering of a biased judge,external. Frears said he had offered the judge's part to Sir Ian McKellen, but was turned down because ""he knew Peter Cook had nailed it."" Whishaw admits to feeling outrage on Scott's behalf. ""But I didn't want it to be the story of a man who was or saw himself as a victim,"" he continues. ""He was always portrayed as pathetic and a 'fairy' but that's not true. He's more complicated than that, and so is the story."" The drama marks Stephen Frears' (left) first collaboration with Russell T Davies Grant, for his part, acknowledges there are comparisons to be drawn between Thorpe's fall from grace and his own trials by media. ""I suppose there's a little parallel because I've been in the middle of a maelstrom of press attention,"" he says, alluding to the time he was arrested with a prostitute in 1995. ""But what was more difficult was getting my head round a guy, brought up with such privilege, actually uttering the words: 'Let's kill him'. ""For me, it was the changing of the guard and the last hurrah of the establishment. You see Thorpe's world greying and fading as Norman's comes alive."" Thorpe was acquitted but his career never recovered. He died in 2014, aged 85, after a long battle with Parkinson's. Obituary: Jeremy Thorpe Revealed: Letter that silenced Thorpe Four years on, Davies says his role as a writer ""is to understand why these mad things happened and to get inside these people's heads"". ""This drama could not be more relevant,"" he continues. ""Wherever there's money and conservatism and a family, there are always secrets and lies. ""I think what we've made is very forgiving to both men,"" he concludes. ""In the end, it's just a great piece of history."" A Very English Scandal begins on BBC One on 20 May at 21:00 BST.

"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men Help to improve the ""disheartening"" levels of prostate cancer awareness has been launched by a charity. The online course for GPs from Prostate Cymru is aimed at helping them diagnose and treat it quicker. It comes after one urologist said the ""minimal"" information currently available was ""disheartening"". Cancer of the prostate - which is a small gland in the pelvis - affects one in eight men in Wales. A Welsh Government spokesman said guidance was available to support GPs on testing for it. The new module has been accredited by the Royal College of General Practitioners and Prostate Cymru hopes it will ultimately be available to medical students and the public. Janine David, a GP in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, said:  ""Men are notoriously bad at researching health or seeking advice from doctors, so when they do it is so imperative that we as physicians are mindful of the risk factors and offer testing for this increasingly prevalent cancer."" She said greater awareness was also needed before medical students became practitioners, adding: ""I think current training of GPs needs to have more information on men's health on the whole, not just prostate cancer."" Andy Thomas, chairman of Prostate Cymru and a consultant urological surgeon at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, said: ""It is quite disheartening that there is a minimal amount of information readily available about the disease in comparison to other cancers."" A similar online module is available to GPs in England, but this is the first bespoke service for GPs in Wales. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Guidance is available to support GPs on testing for prostate cancer and our Framework for Cancer supports primary care in the diagnosis and management of cancers."" Ian Norton, pictured with his wife Andrea, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2016 Ian Norton, 68, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, who was diagnosed with the disease two years ago, said he knew very little about it, until he did some research and visited his GP. The results of an MRI scan showed that he had an enlarged prostate and early stage cancer. ""I have always led a healthy and sporty life and thought I was invincible, but then I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and reality kicked in with a very big boot,"" he said. ""Men are either too macho or embarrassed to talk about things like this. ""We need to help them realise it is an important issue."" It is cancer of the prostate which is a small gland in the pelvis, found only in men. According toNHS Direct Wales,external, the disease develops slowly and there may be no obvious signs for many years. The causes are largely unknown, but the chances of developing it increase over the age of 50. It is the most common cancer among men with 40,000 new cases diagnosed across the UK every year. Last year, thenumber of men dying of prostate cancer overtook the number of female deaths from breast cancer. A recent report by the charity, Orchard, said that thelate diagnosis of four in ten patients in the UK was a ""worrying trend"". The biggest cancer killers in the UK remain bowel and lung cancer.

"Gay rights campaigners protested about the way homosexuality was treated in the trial It was dubbed ""the trial of the century"" - a dashing, charismatic political leader accused of conspiring to murder his former gay lover in a bizarre, ill-fated plot. But why did Jeremy Thorpe - leader of the Liberal Party and pillar of the Establishment - not go into the witness box to defend himself from charges he vehemently denied? The BBC has obtained a document that sheds new light on the decision by Mr Thorpe's lawyers not to let him give evidence at the Old Bailey in 1979, seen at the time as a high risk manoeuvre that might have led to a lengthy prison sentence for their client. It is a passionate four-page letter from Mr Thorpe to an American man called Bruno sent after they had met in San Francisco in 1961, which Mr Thorpe wrote is ""the one city where a gay person can let down his defences and feel free and unhunted"". The prosecution at the trial had a copy, and if Mr Thorpe had given evidence he would have faced questioning about his sexuality which he wanted to avoid. I received the ""Bruno letter"" and connected records from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation after making an FOI request under American Freedom of Information law. In it, Mr Thorpe also said of San Francisco: ""If I'm driven out of public life in Britain for a gay scandal I shall settle in SF!"" He asked Bruno to write to him at the House of Commons ""marked Personal!"", and discussed how they could meet again, adding: ""I must get on to SF on some mission, which the British or American taxpayers will pay for!!"" Pages one and three in the FBI's copy of Thorpe's letter to ""Bruno"" Pages two and four in the FBI's copy of Thorpe's letter to ""Bruno"" Mr Thorpe, a former leader of the Liberal party, and three others were acquitted of conspiring to murder his former lover, Norman Scott, in one of the most famous court cases in British political history. The trial arose from a bizarre incident on Exmoor in which Mr Scott's dog Rinka had been shot dead. The prosecution asserted that the real plan had been to kill Mr Scott himself, whom Mr Thorpe wanted to silence because he was telling others about their past relationship, a relationship which the former Liberal leader persistently denied. Obituary: Jeremy Thorpe Heath, Thorpe and the lost coalition of 1974 During the court case, many observers were stunned when Mr Thorpe's legal team announced he would not give any evidence in his own defence. This meant that he avoided being cross-examined by the prosecution and personally having to respond to a range of uncomfortable topics. They included evidence of mysterious financial transactions and remarks he had made about wanting Mr Scott dead, which were part of the alleged conspiracy; but also evidence of his affairs at a time when, until 1967, male homosexuality had been illegal. Prosecution lawyers had notified Mr Thorpe's barrister George Carman and solicitor Sir David Napley that they had significant information on his other gay relationships, including the missive to Bruno. Jeremy Thorpe arriving for his trial According to the biography of Mr Carman, written by his son Dominic, the barrister was already inclined to think that Mr Thorpe should not give evidence and the Bruno document ""removed any doubt"" he had that it was the right decision. The significance of the letter is confirmed in an earlier book on the Thorpe affair, Rinkagate, in which the journalists Simon Freeman and Barrie Penrose state: ""Any lingering doubts that Carman and Napley might have had were removed when the prosecution showed them a sexually explicit letter from Thorpe to a friend called Bruno... Carman and Napley agreed it would be a catastrophe for Thorpe if the letter became public, which would definitely happen if he gave evidence."" The decision not to go into the witness box was Mr Thorpe's legal right. The reason he later gave in his own memoirs was that giving evidence ""would have prolonged the trial unnecessarily for at least another 10 to 14 days"". Hugh Grant plays Mr Thorpe in a new BBC drama After the not-guilty verdict, it was widely considered to have been a clever strategy from his legal team. The three key prosecution witnesses all faced significant doubts over their credibility, and they failed to convince the jury. However, in public relations terms it was much less successful. Mr Thorpe's acquittal did not seem to clear him in the court of public opinion. His reputation never recovered from the allegations in the case and the widespread feeling they had not been satisfactorily answered, until he died in 2014. Interest in the trial has recently been reawakened by the forthcoming BBC One series,A Very English Scandal, which dramatises the events of the Thorpe-Scott affair and the ramifications of their falling out. The FBI found the letter in Bruno's possession when they arrested him in 1963 for breaking a probation order he had earlier received for theft. As it indicated the writer was a British member of parliament, the document was passed to the authorities in London, although the FBI's files show they mistakenly thought Mr Thorpe was a Labour rather than a Liberal MP. The US Attorney General, Robert Kennedy, brother of the then president, wanted personally to inform someone whose name is redacted from the FBI's release but given the context, was probably in the UK government. According to the FBI records, Mr Kennedy said: ""The British can't afford another disclosure of this kind."" This was presumably a reference to the Profumo and Vassall sex scandals which had shaken the British establishment at that time. War Secretary John Profumo resigned after the disclosure of his affair with Christine Keeler, a young model also involved with a Russian spy. British diplomat John Vassall was caught after years of passing secrets to the Russians, having been blackmailed by the KGB because of his then illegal homosexuality. In due course the Thorpe scandal was to become equally sensational.

"Spotify has backtracked on the policy thatremoved R Kelly's music from their playlists. In a statement released on Friday, the streaming service said it had created ""confusion and concern"". The ""Hate Content & Hateful Conduct"" policy was introduced in May. It had proven controversial since its introduction, with Kendrick Lamar's record label threatening to remove music. R Kelly's music was removed from promoted playlists due to sexual assault allegations which he denies On Wednesday Spotify CEO Daniel Ek admitted it ""could have done a much better job"". Friday's statement, which can beread in full here,external, clarified their position, explaining the policy had two distinct parts. The first, relating to the decision to remove artists from playlists if they were involved in ""controversies"", has now been reversed. ""We created concern that allegations might affect artists' chances of landing on a Spotify playlist and negatively impact their future,"" the statement explains. ""Some artists even worried that mistakes made in their youth would be used against them. That's not what Spotify is about."" The second part focused on hate content, described as content whose principal purpose is to incite hatred or violence. Spotify says this policy will remain but they clarified that ""offensive, explicit, or vulgar content"" don't violate the terms. Anthony Tiffith, the CEO of record label Top Dawg Entertainment, home to Kendrick Lamar, SZA and Schoolboy Q had threatened to remove music if changes weren't made. Speaking to Billboard, he confirmed he had spoken with Daniel Ek and Spotify's head of artist relations Troy Carter. Kendrick Lamar's label, Top Dawg Entertainment, threatened to remove music from Spotify over the policy ""I expressed how I felt about it, about censorship, how you can't do artists that way."" Tiffith explained his issue regarding how the specific artists were chosen. ""How come they didn't pick out any others from any other genres? It seems to me that they're constantly picking on hip-hop culture. ""My whole thing with them was, we gotta fix this situation, and if it can't be fixed, then there's gonna be a real problem, we're gonna have to start pulling our music from the site.""

"Constables Kenny MacKenzie and Laura Sayer sustained serious injuries A man has been charged in connection with the attempted murder of two police officers in Inverclyde. PC Laura Sayer, 39, and 43-year-old PC Kenny MacKenzie were stabbed as they attended a routine call at Gateside Gardens in Greenock on Friday morning. PC Mackenzie was knifed in the neck while his colleague received an arm injury. Both are expected to leave hospital on Saturday. A 43-year-old man is due to appear at Greenock Sheriff Court on Monday. Constable Sayer has six months' service with Police Scotland and is still on her probationary period and PC MacKenzie has nine years' service. Chief Superintendent Gordon Crossan, visited the two officers for an update on their progress. Constable Laura Sayer is due to undergo a routine surgical procedure prior to being released later. PC Kenny MacKenzie is also expected to be discharged from hospital today. The chief superintendent said: ""Both officers are in remarkable spirits despite what they have been through and are very appreciative of all the well wishes they have received from people across the country. ""They will be released into the care of their families and will receive support from Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Federation. ""PC Sayer and PC MacKenzie thank everyone for their support and ask for privacy while they recover at home."" At the scene yesterday, Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said a major investigation had begun. He said: ""I would like to take this opportunity to publicly praise the incredible bravery shown by these two officers during the extremely difficult and challenging situation they faced this morning. ""They have been seriously injured going about their duties and both they and their colleagues who subsequently attended to assist demonstrated courage and the utmost professionalism both during and after the incident. ""They receive the thanks and the support of everyone within Police Scotland."" He said the incident was not being treated as terrorist-related and was contained without any further risk to the public. Extra patrols will be in place over the course of the weekend. Both officers were taken to Inverclyde Royal Hospital and one was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. The assistant chief constable said their injuries were not life-threatening but ""significant and serious"" and said he had been to see both officers who were in ""remarkable good spirits"". ""I am blown away by the courage of them,"" he said. ""They said we are in the police and we accept that comes with a degree of risk. I was very moved and proud to speak with them."" He also said he had visited Greenock police office and met with the rest of the officers' team. He revealed: ""They are really emotional. They are hurting, they are upset angry and distressed. They have seen their colleagues badly injured. ""At the end of the day, police officers are humans."" The incident came at the timethe force is about to deploy newly-trained Taser-armed officers. The training of 500 officers in the use of the device began in May in a bid to improve the safety of the public and police officers. Assistant Chief Constable Higgins said if Taser-armed officers had been sent to Friday's incident, it could have meant a different outcome. He said: ""Potentially, a Taser could have made a difference. ""Greenock is going to be one of the areas during the rollout period which will see trained officers deployed."" He said Police Scotland would do all it could to support the two involved, adding: ""They will have physical scars, they will have emotional scars but I will guarantee that everybody in Police Scotland will do everything we can to help these officers."" DCC Iain Livingstone, the interim chief constable of Police Scotland, praised the ""incredible bravery"" of the officers. On Twitter, he wrote: ""All of @policescotland officers and staff thinking of them and their families. Courage, protecting their fellow citizens."" Andrea MacDonald, chairwoman of the Scottish Police Federation, said: ""Our thoughts are with the injured officers and their families. Once again we see how difficult and dangerous a job it is. ""Police officers put themselves between other professionals and the public and dangerous individuals sometimes with life changing consequences for themselves and their families. ""We wish our colleagues a speedy and full recovery.""

"Shops, like this Sainsbury's in Leeds, were unable to take Visa payments on Friday Visa services have returned to normal after a hardware failure left European customers unable to make some payments. The company released a statement on Saturday morning, saying its systems were now working at ""full capacity"". Visa apologised and said Friday's outage was not down to ""unauthorised access or a cyber attack"". Customers have reported money going missing from accounts when their cards were declined - including one man who lost Â£10,000 when paying for a car. Tom Mitchell, from Kent, said the money left his Natwest account, but his bank told him it was up to Visa to complete the transaction - instead, his money has been left in ""limbo"". The 33-year-old said: ""I live in Kent and went to Ipswich to get this car. It took four hours by train. ""I woke up a few times in the night to check my bank balance so there is a bit of a worry there... and I haven't heard anything today."" Payments processed through Visa's systems account for Â£1 in Â£3 of all UK spending. Queues formed at ATMs in Dublin as the issue spread across Europe Shoppers were stuck in queues, diners were left embarrassed and one MP even drove away from a petrol station without paying as the issue affected Visa Europe's systems on Friday. Kevin Darley, from Doncaster, told BBC Radio 5 live that his cards were declined at a DIY store, but his bank account was still debited. ""[The] cashier obviously didn't know what was happening,"" he said. ""We said, 'there's plenty of money in there' [and] couldn't understand it. ""We got the receipts and... I went outside, checked my balance and the balance had actually gone down by the amount I should have paid."" And Sarah Brown, from London, had her card declined three times when she was buying a Â£358 jacket and now has three pending transactions on her HSBC account - totalling Â£1,074. The 47-year-old now has to go back to the store and go through the transactions, which she said was a ""massive inconvenience"".

And Jay Curtis, from Swansea, had two cards declined in B&Q when he tried to pay for Â£240 of goods. ""My card just wouldn't go through,"" the 32-year-old told the BBC. ""I didn't have cash on me so I had to drive all the way home."" A pub in Ipswich puts up signs to warn customers of the outage On Friday, Visa said the system was ""close to normal"" five hours after publicly acknowledging the problem. The company's chief executive, Al Kelly, apologised for the trouble caused by the hardware failure. ""Our goal is to ensure all Visa payments work reliably 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,"" he said. ""We fell well short of this goal today and we apologise to all of our partners and Visa account holders for any inconvenience this may have caused.""

"Paul Massey (left) and John Kinsella were both fatally shot A man charged with the murders of an underworld ""Mr Big"" and a gangland enforcer has appeared in court amid a heavy police presence. Mark Fellows is accused of killing Paul Massey, from Salford, and John Kinsella, from Liverpool. The 37-year-old is also charged with the attempted murder of Kinsella's partner. He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on 5 June. Paul Massey was dubbed ""Mr Big"" at a meeting to discuss civil disturbances in 1992 Massey, 55, was shot dead as he got out of a car outside his home on 26 July 2015. A security boss and businessman, he was a convicted criminal once branded ""Mr Big"". Kinsella died after being shot by a man on a bicycle while he was walking his dog with his partner on 5 May. She was shot as she fled the scene by the St Helens Linkway near the M62 in Merseyside. Kinsella had been described as a mob fixer who once stopped a gangster terrorising former Liverpool FC footballer Steven Gerrard. Fellows, dressed in grey jogging bottoms and a sweatshirt, spoke at South Sefton Magistrates' Court only to confirm his name, date of birth and address in Warrington, Cheshire. He was arrested at Manchester Airport on Wednesday after a series of police raids. About 20 friends and relatives of Kinsella watched the three-minute hearing from the public gallery.

"This video can not be played Pedro SÃ¡nchez took the oath alongside King Felipe VI, promising to fufil his duties ""with conscience and honour"" Spanish Socialist Pedro SÃ¡nchez has been sworn in as the country's new prime minister by King Felipe after the ousting of conservative Mariano Rajoy. Mr SÃ¡nchez, who is an atheist, took the oath to protect the constitution without a bible or crucifix - a first in Spain's modern history. He plans to see out the remaining two years of the parliamentary term. The Socialist leader won the support of six other parties to remove Mr Rajoy over a massive corruption scandal. As Spain's new prime minister, whose party only has a quarter of the seats in parliament, he now has to decide who to include in his cabinet and is expected to name them next week. In a brief ceremony at the royal residence in Madrid on Saturday, Mr SÃ¡nchez, 46, promised to ""faithfully fulfil"" his duties ""with conscience and honour, with loyalty to the king, and to guard and have guarded the constitution as a fundamental state rule"". This video can not be played The BBC's Gavin Lee said Mariano Rajoy's departure followed a ""political earthquake"" Mr SÃ¡nchez brought about the downfall of his predecessor Mr Rajoy by filing a no confidence motion in parliament following a scandal centred on a secret campaign fund that the conservative People's Party (PP) ran from 1999 until 2005. Mr Rajoy is the first prime minister in modern Spanish history to be defeated in a no-confidence motion. Uncharted territory for Spain What is the People's Party corruption scandal? Rajoy: The patient man of Spanish politics Meanwhile, Catalonia's new regional government was also sworn in on Saturday, ending seven months of imposed direct rule from Madrid. The new Catalan President Quim Torra, who is a close ally of ousted separatist leader Carles Puigdemont, said that he was committed to continuing the drive for the region's independence from Spain. Profile by Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid Pedro SÃ¡nchez emerged as a virtual unknown to win the Spanish Socialist party premiership in 2014. The photogenic economist and former basketball player won members over with a promise to unite a divided party and put the Socialists back in power. Yet he subsequently suffered two humbling election defeats, in 2015 and 2016. He was eventually forced to resign after his refusal to back Mariano Rajoy in an investiture vote plunged the country into a prolonged political stalemate and his party into bitter infighting. Months later he confounded his many critics by returning to win the Socialist primary. Spain's constitution states that the party presenting a no-confidence motion must be prepared to govern and replace the deposed prime minister if a parliamentary majority backs it. Therefore, this moderate but ambitious 46-year-old from Madrid is now Spain's prime minister, despite the fact that his party commands less than a quarter of seats in Congress. Mr Rajoy's departure casts the EU's fifth-largest economy into political uncertainty. Although Mr SÃ¡nchez leads the Socialist PSOE party, he is not a member of parliament. Correspondents say that with only 84 lower house seats, the party will struggle to find allies to get legislation enacted. In return for having backed Mr SÃ¡nchez in the parliament vote, Spain's left-wing Podemos (We Can) party is likely to demand significant policy concessions from the PSOE, and perhaps some key cabinet posts. Mr SÃ¡nchez is likely to be challenged strongly over his plan to stick to the Rajoy budget. Smaller groups - including Basque and Catalan nationalists - supported the no-confidence motion against Mr Rajoy, but it is unclear whether they will back the new government. The Ciudadanos party, which had been doing well in opinion polls, supported Mr Rajoy. Spain PM Rajoy ousted: What happens next? Spanish PM Rajoy forced out of office 'Political earthquake' for Spain.

"Beijing has been turning islands into military bases China is deploying missiles in the disputed South China Sea to intimidate and coerce its neighbours, US Defence Secretary James Mattis has said. Speaking in Singapore, General Mattis said Beijing's actions called into question its broader goals. A Chinese military official dismissed the comments as ""irresponsible"". Six countries have competing claims in the sea, but tensions have increased in recent years and China has backed its claim with island-building and patrols. Mr Mattis also said the issue of US troops in South Korea was ""not on the table"" at this month's summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. The US wanted complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, he added. South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo also told the Shangri-La Dialogue security summit that US forces in South Korea was a ""separate issue from North Korea's nuclear issue"". There are currently about 28,500 US troops based in South Korea. Trump says summit with Kim is back on What does Kim Jong-un really want? The political gamble of the 21st Century Mr Mattis told the security summit that Beijing had deployed military hardware including anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles and electronic jammers to locations across the South China Sea. ""Despite China's claims to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,"" Gen Mattis said. Why is the South China Sea contentious? China's 'globalised' military power Gen Mattis said the Trump administration wanted a constructive relationship with China but would compete vigorously if necessary. He also said the US recognised that China had a role to play in the region. But speaking at the same conference, China's Lt Gen He Lei said: ""Any irresponsible comments from other countries cannot be accepted."" Beijing's actions were aimed at ""national defence"", he added in quotes reported by AFP.

" When it comes to remote, the Faroe Islands has it all. Tucked between Norway and Iceland, in the dark waters of the North Atlantic, the 18 tiny islands are home to a population of just over 50,000. Half of those residents live in the archipelago's capital Tórshavn “Thor's harbour”. But some of the islands are sparsely populated, with just a handful of people living on them. The Faroese are self-reliant, modest people, with a rich heritage of storytelling and a deep desire to share information with one another. The self-governing nation has a well-developed communication network - courtesy of the Kingdom of Denmark of which it is part - but many still rely on the postal service. Some of the islands are connected by tunnels and bridges, but on others, mail bags arrive by boat or even helicopter. A network of hard-working postal workers then criss-cross islands on old mountain routes used since the 19th Century delivering the post. The fittest people used to be nominated to walk these routes, but these days 4x4 postal vehicles cross the rugged terrain. But still, on the smaller islands, post is delivered on foot by locals. Meet some of them. She will soon retire and pass on most of the responsibility to her brother Bjarni. It’s winter on the Faroe Islands and an icy wind blows. Jancy meets the helicopter that brings the island's post wearing a floral headscarf, simple jacket and short wellingtons. She doesn’t wear gloves, despite the freezing wind coming off the ocean. She says she’s never cold. In summer the island is served by boat, and the mail arrives in brown hessian sacks. But in the winter, it’s too dangerous to sail. Most of the islanders gather at the helipad when the helicopter arrives - this is a big moment in the day. Sheep graze high up on the slopes, and seabirds - most famously puffins - nest all along the island’s westerly tip. Jancy’s canvas shoulder bag often carries copies of the Faroe Islands’ two daily newspapers - both of which have loyal readerships and connect many of the islands’ older residents to the issues of the day. There are currently no children living on Mykines. Two young people left the island recently. One went to study physics abroad and the other went to study in a Faroese town on what's known as the mainland - the largest islands in the archipelago, all connected by road tunnels and bridges. Jancy’s daughter is in her 30s and lives in Copenhagen where she works as a vet. “She'll never move home,” says the post woman. “I understand. I like Copenhagen, you can be anonymous - unlike here.” The residents of Mykines visit their neighbours every day. Doors are never locked - there’s no crime - and visitors are always welcome. In summer, tourists arrive - mostly to view the seabirds. Flasks of black coffee and tins of old-fashioned chocolates sit on plastic-covered tables in every home, ready to welcome visitors. Kristina runs a small guesthouse on the island. She tells me how her children, the last to leave the island, “kept the postal service in business” with their eBay and Amazon purchases. Ordering parcels worth less than 300 Danish Kroner (£35) means residents can avoid heavy taxes - so across the islands, young people order lots of individual items. Internet shopping keeps them connected to the fashions of the outside world. Kristina tells me how she would always mail order clothes for herself and the children from shops in Denmark. She felt it gave them an identity that was far away from their island home. Meinhard and his wife Jessie are among the island’s 22 permanent residents. Skúvoy is famed for its North Atlantic bird population, and local men hunt for Fulmar eggs on the high cliffs in the summer. Before taking over from his father, Meinhard worked as a fisherman. In the 1960s, it was typical for the Faroese boats to fish around Scotland and it was there that he met Jessie, a native of the island of Lewis. The couple married and opened the island’s supermarket. Meinhard took over as a postman in 1975 - a job his father had started in 1938. Today, the mail boat or helicopter arrives on the island three times a week. Meinhard has rarely taken a holiday. Occasionally he travels to the mainland to spend time with the couple's eight grandchildren. Dogs on Skúvoy roam the lanes freely, including Meinhard’s 13-year-old Rolf, who follows him on his postal round. The boat to Skúvoy is relatively new. Light and fast, it was built in Denmark and then sent to Spain to take workers to their jobs. On a previous visit, I travelled to the island on an older, smaller ferry. Strapped to its deck was a shiny white coffin. It would be delivered to the home of Gretur, a local sailor and fisherman who had recently passed away. The crossing is always bumpy as currents merge. The boat is the link to the island’s survival, connecting Skúvoy to the nearby island of Sandoy. Soon Sandoy will be connected to another larger island by a tunnel, and it’s hoped this will encourage more people to start a life there. There is also talk of a tunnel being built to Skúvoy, but islands with tiny populations are unlikely to attract this kind of investment. Stóra Dímun can’t be reached from the sea without climbing a cliff face, so the only way on to the island in winter is by helicopter. At one end is a steep, wind-battered peak on which sits the island’s lighthouse. At the other, is a steep, curving hillside populated by hardy sheep. This glaciated slope curves up to a narrow plateau at the top where Icelandic horses graze. The white Atlantic Airways helicopter named Ruth, after a famous Faroese painter, turns to make her descent on to Stóra Dímun. A woman sits in the helicopter wearing thick, padded farmer’s overalls and low-cut wellington boots. Wiry with brown hair tied back, this is Eva. She helps unload the provisions from the back of the helicopter and she is greeted by her niece Andrea. The arrival of the helicopter is a big event and the only contact the families have with the rest of the world. Everyone is there to watch. From outside, the houses and farm have the appearance of a fort, protecting its inhabitants from the elements. Inside, a lunch of wind-dried lamb, boiled eggs, cow tongue, thinly sliced cured halibut, and rhubarb jam has been prepared. The family squash on to long wooden benches in the low-roofed room and a conversation on Faroese politics begins. On the previous day, a Danish academic was secretly filmed by a Spanish journalist saying how much the Faroese were dependent on Denmark. Not long before this, the Danish government flew an incorrect version of the Faroese flag in Copenhagen. Erla, a mother to three children and wife of Janus, says how this attitude towards the Faroese from the Danish authorities upsets her. This is a family trying to survive on this island, blending old and new. There are reminders of tradition around the house. Above the dining table hang amber-coloured transparent ellipses. They are dried sheep’s bladders, which the children sell at small markets elsewhere in the Faroes. Both Janus and Eva's families are entrepreneurial and full of energy. Their plan is to make cider or an aquavit spirit with the turnips in partnership with a Faroese brewer. The farm buildings are covered by solar panels, utilising the exposed setting. The children Óla Jákup, Andrea and Tórur are schooled on the island in a specially built, traditional grass-roofed cottage that doubles as a house where visitors to the island can stay. The teachers are often young graduates or early in their teaching careers, looking for a new experience. A rota ensures the children see different teachers regularly and this is working well. The children are also connected to corresponding classes in the school on the mainland via the Internet. This allows them to see their “classmates”. Friends and pupils come to stay on Stóra Dímun via helicopter. The post and the helicopter are essential to life on the island. Oil is flown in drums, hung like a trawler’s net full of fish below the helicopter. He lives with his wife and their three grown-up children in a village called Trøllanes on the most northerly tip of the island. The village sits in a hollow, smoothly rounded by glacial ice. To get to the village you must drive through a narrow one-way tunnel with no lighting. Before it was built in the 1970s the village could only be accessed by boat. Fewer than 20 people live in Trøllanes - which when translated into English means Troll peninsula. The ""troll"" relates to humanoid creatures from folklore and mythology. Eyðun’s mother was born in the nearby village of Mikladalur, home to the Faroese legend of the seal woman, or selkie. The whole island of Kalsoy has this folkloric significance. Eyðun is the renaissance man of the island, having lived away and studied before returning to make a home in the village. The ferry to Fugloy brings the post from Hvannasund, a village in a fjord between the islands of Borðoy and Viðoy. It was winter when I visited and there was an icy breeze. The boat’s cargo was light - a postal sack and a box filled with about 50 light bulbs. The bulbs had been used at a party to illuminate a community house, a deckhand said. Below deck, a worn Bible lay on a shelf at the waterline, the front cover missing. Two bubblegum machines with globe-like tops were chained to the stairs leading to the deck. Their colourful sweets rolled around with the swell. I was the only passenger. It grew colder as the boat left the fjord for open water and her destination of Fugloy. Arriving at the island, the swell was high at the village of Kirkja. The boat couldn’t dock and so deliveries had to be thrown towards the harbour, where postman Joannes was waiting. In the family home Svanhild his daughter is sitting at the dining table. Her forearms are covered with white emulsion paint. She’s been helping her father on the farm, painting the buildings that house the sheep during winter. “We have four calves and we still keep sheep,” she says. “The village is shrinking. The last of the children have left and the school is empty. There are just four of us. People come and go.” Still, she is determined to make a go of it, working on the farm and helping with the helicopter duties. All the postal workers, like Meinhard on the island of Skúvoy, have worked hard to keep the disconnected islands connected - not just with letters and parcels but also by providing a vital community link. He hopes that new enterprising families will follow in the tradition of Faroese self-sufficiency and set up homes on his, and the other the remote islands, ensuring the postal sacks are always full.

A study of 10 washing machines by the consumer watchdog found the average cost of a standard cycle to be 18p, while quick cycles cost around 9p.

"Father Ted ran on Channel 4 between 1995-98 Cult comedy Father Ted is set to return as a musical, its co-creator has confirmed. Graham Linehan said the show, called Pope Ted: The Father Ted Musical, was almost written. Fellow writer Arthur Matthews and the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon, who wrote the show's theme tune and original music, are involved in the project. Linehan said it would be ""the real final episode of Father Ted"". He told the BBC: ""It's like putting on an old pair of slippers."" The sitcom ran for three series between 1995-98 on Channel 4, chronicling the escapades of Irish parish priest Father Ted Crilly. Allow Twitter content?

The musical will see Ted move from the fictional Craggy Island to his new role as Pope in the Vatican. Linehan, who also created Channel 4 sitcom the  IT Crowd and co-created sitcom Black Books, said the musical was about ""the least qualified man in the world becoming Pope"". He said: ""I didn't want to do anything like this until the right idea came along, and when Trump won and Corbyn won [the Labour leadership] I kind of thought, 'Maybe Ted has a chance'. ""I thought it wouldn't be too much of a stretch. Obviously we're pulling some shenanigans to get him into that position but I think the shenanigans are entertaining enough that people won't mind."" Dermot Morgan played Father Ted in the Channel 4 comedy series Father Ted became a hit in the 1990s, chronicling the life of the eponymous character, the gormless but loveable Father Dougal McGuire, foul-mouthed drunk Father Jack Hackett and tea-obsessed Mrs Doyle. Stars Ardal O'Hanlon and Pauline McLynn went on to enjoy mainstream success. But Dermot Morgan, who played Father Ted, died from a heart attack the day after filming the final episode Actors, artists and TV personalities who appeared in the show included One Foot In The Grave Star Richard Wilson, presenter Graham Norton, Dervla Kirwan from BBC TV series Ballykissangel and Altered Images lead singer Clare Grogan Storylines included Ted kicking Bishop Brennan in the backside, a group of priests getting lost in ""Ireland's biggest lingerie section"", and Ted trying to become Ireland's Eurovision  nomination with the song, My Lovely Horse The Father Ted theme tune is taken from the Divine Comedy song, Songs of Love. Hannon, the band's lead singer - who is writing the music for the musical - collaborated with Linehan and Matthews on songs for the original sitcom, the most famous being My Lovely Horse - which he also sang in the episode. He also wrote the theme music for the IT Crowd. Neil Hannon has collaborated with Graham Linehan on Father Ted and The IT Crowd Lineham said the team did not know where the musical would debut but said he hoped it would be on stage next year. It is the first time in 20 years that he and Matthews have returned to the characters from Father Ted.

"Top Google executive Diane Greene told staff on Friday there would be no renewal of the contract (file pic) Google will not renew a contract to do artificial intelligence work for the US Pentagon, company sources say. The decision follows strong opposition in the technology giant's workforce. A number of Google employees resigned andthousands of others signed a protest petition against taking part in the Pentagon project, known as Maven. They feared it was the first step towards using artificial intelligence for lethal purposes. There has been no official statement from Google. According to company sources, top executive Diane Greene told staff on Friday there would be no follow-up after the current contract expired next March. But Kate Conger, a journalist for the technology news website Gizmodo, told the BBC that Google had not cancelled Project Maven and did not appear to have ruled out future work with the military. The contract is reported to be worth less than $10m (Â£7.5m) to Google but could potentially lead to more extensive cooperation with the Pentagon. Meet Norman, the psychopathic AI Project Maven involves using machine learning and engineering talent to distinguish people and objects in drone videos. In April up to 4,000 Google employees signed an open letter saying that by its involvement in the project the internet giant was putting users' trust at risk, as well as ignoring its ""moral and ethical responsibility"". A report by Gizmodo said that senior leadership at the company was deeply conflicted about the effects of the partnership with the Pentagon.,external Internal emails suggested that executives saw the contract as a huge opportunity while being concerned about how the company's involvement would be perceived, Gizmodo said.

"Shops, like this Sainsbury's in Leeds, were unable to take Visa payments on Friday Visa services have returned to normal after a hardware failure left European customers unable to make some payments. The company released a statement on Saturday morning, saying its systems were now working at ""full capacity"". Visa apologised and said Friday's outage was not down to ""unauthorised access or a cyber attack"". Customers have reported money going missing from accounts when their cards were declined - including one man who lost Â£10,000 when paying for a car. Tom Mitchell, from Kent, said the money left his Natwest account, but his bank told him it was up to Visa to complete the transaction - instead, his money has been left in ""limbo"". The 33-year-old said: ""I live in Kent and went to Ipswich to get this car. It took four hours by train. ""I woke up a few times in the night to check my bank balance so there is a bit of a worry there... and I haven't heard anything today."" Payments processed through Visa's systems account for Â£1 in Â£3 of all UK spending. Queues formed at ATMs in Dublin as the issue spread across Europe Shoppers were stuck in queues, diners were left embarrassed and one MP even drove away from a petrol station without paying as the issue affected Visa Europe's systems on Friday. Kevin Darley, from Doncaster, told BBC Radio 5 live that his cards were declined at a DIY store, but his bank account was still debited. ""[The] cashier obviously didn't know what was happening,"" he said. ""We said, 'there's plenty of money in there' [and] couldn't understand it. ""We got the receipts and... I went outside, checked my balance and the balance had actually gone down by the amount I should have paid."" And Sarah Brown, from London, had her card declined three times when she was buying a Â£358 jacket and now has three pending transactions on her HSBC account - totalling Â£1,074. The 47-year-old now has to go back to the store and go through the transactions, which she said was a ""massive inconvenience"".

A pub in Ipswich puts up signs to warn customers of the outage On Friday, Visa said the system was ""close to normal"" five hours after publicly acknowledging the problem.

"US firms importing steel from the UK will have to pay an additional 25% tax New tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium from the EU are ""illegal"", the UK's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said. The policy came into force on Friday, meaning anyone in the US importing the metals from the EU will have to pay an additional tax. President Donald Trump said the move would protect US national security. Dr Fox said Prime Minister Theresa May would be raising the issue at the G7 leaders meeting next week. On Friday, Mrs May said she was ""disappointed"" at the US decision - which will see a 25% duty on European steel and a 10% duty on European aluminium - and that the taxes were ""unjustified"". US tariffs: The unusual ways nations have retaliated 'Stand up to bully Trump', says Labour US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Fox said the UK was still seeking exemptions from the tariffs. ""We will still be making that case throughout this week,"" he said. He added: ""The United States believes, I believe wrongly and illegally, that this is a national security matter for the US. ""Given that we export some pretty complex steel products to the United States which are part of their national security programmes themselves, this reasoning that is given is wrong and therefore we believe unlawful."" President Trump originally imposed the tariffs in March, claiming that if the US remained reliant on imported metals, it would threaten the country's national security and damage its own metal industry. The tariffs apply to a wide range of steel and aluminium products such as sheets, plates, bars, pipes and ""semi-finished"" products. President Trump initially exempted Canada, Mexico and the EU from the tariffs to allow time for negotiations. However, the exemption ended at midnight on Thursday, meaning the new taxes would be collected from Friday. Dr Liam Fox has warned against a ""tit-for-tat"" trade war with the US According to UK Steel - the body which represents steel producers across the country - 7% of steel exports go to the US, worth Â£360m. About 31,000 people across the UK work in steel production and many more in the supply chain, with steel mills in the North East, East Midlands, Yorkshire, and Wales. The head of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said EU leaders had a ""gun held to their head"" and while he admitted that there was a problem of global over-capacity in the industry, he claimed most of that was in China. He said that about 20 million tonnes of Chinese steel would need to ""find a new home to go to"" because of the tariffs. ""Because we are a free and open market here in the UK/the EU, it'll come here, we believe, and therefore further damage our sector - not only from the direct impact of tariffs in the US but the surge of steel coming here,"" he added. UK exports of aluminium to the US are small, but the UK's Aluminium Federation said it was concerned about the impact the tariffs could have, hindering free trade. Dr Fox travelled to Washington in March to seek a further exemption for the UK, as there are concerns it could impact the UK market by increasing its prices, but he was unsuccessful. Earlier this week, he called the tariff proposals ""disappointing"" and ""absurd"". Dr Fox's comments follow those of EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, who also called the new tariffs illegal and said the US was playing a ""dangerous game"". French President Emmanuel Macron backed the position, telling President Trump the duties were illegal over the telephone. But Dr Fox warned against a ""tit-for-tat"" escalation in the light of EU counter measures, adding: ""There can be no victors in a trade war, only casualties."" The EU has drawn up a target list of 100 US goods worth â¬2.8bn ($3.5bn, Â£2.5bn) for its retaliatory tariffs, the BBC understands. The 10-page list includes Harley Davidson motorcycles, bourbon, Florida orange juice, cosmetics and jeans. If the list is implemented, it could lead to many every day items becoming more expensive for shoppers in the UK, as shops pass on increased import prices.

"This video can not be played Pedro SÃ¡nchez took the oath alongside King Felipe VI, promising to fufil his duties ""with conscience and honour"" Spanish Socialist Pedro SÃ¡nchez has been sworn in as the country's new prime minister by King Felipe after the ousting of conservative Mariano Rajoy. Mr SÃ¡nchez, who is an atheist, took the oath to protect the constitution without a bible or crucifix - a first in Spain's modern history. He plans to see out the remaining two years of the parliamentary term. The Socialist leader won the support of six other parties to remove Mr Rajoy over a massive corruption scandal. As Spain's new prime minister, whose party only has a quarter of the seats in parliament, he now has to decide who to include in his cabinet and is expected to name them next week. In a brief ceremony at the royal residence in Madrid on Saturday, Mr SÃ¡nchez, 46, promised to ""faithfully fulfil"" his duties ""with conscience and honour, with loyalty to the king, and to guard and have guarded the constitution as a fundamental state rule"". This video can not be played The BBC's Gavin Lee said Mariano Rajoy's departure followed a ""political earthquake"" Mr SÃ¡nchez brought about the downfall of his predecessor Mr Rajoy by filing a no confidence motion in parliament following a scandal centred on a secret campaign fund that the conservative People's Party (PP) ran from 1999 until 2005. Mr Rajoy is the first prime minister in modern Spanish history to be defeated in a no-confidence motion. Uncharted territory for Spain What is the People's Party corruption scandal? Rajoy: The patient man of Spanish politics Meanwhile, Catalonia's new regional government was also sworn in on Saturday, ending seven months of imposed direct rule from Madrid. The new Catalan President Quim Torra, who is a close ally of ousted separatist leader Carles Puigdemont, said that he was committed to continuing the drive for the region's independence from Spain. Profile by Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid Pedro SÃ¡nchez emerged as a virtual unknown to win the Spanish Socialist party premiership in 2014. The photogenic economist and former basketball player won members over with a promise to unite a divided party and put the Socialists back in power. Yet he subsequently suffered two humbling election defeats, in 2015 and 2016. He was eventually forced to resign after his refusal to back Mariano Rajoy in an investiture vote plunged the country into a prolonged political stalemate and his party into bitter infighting. Months later he confounded his many critics by returning to win the Socialist primary. Spain's constitution states that the party presenting a no-confidence motion must be prepared to govern and replace the deposed prime minister if a parliamentary majority backs it. Therefore, this moderate but ambitious 46-year-old from Madrid is now Spain's prime minister, despite the fact that his party commands less than a quarter of seats in Congress. Mr Rajoy's departure casts the EU's fifth-largest economy into political uncertainty. Although Mr SÃ¡nchez leads the Socialist PSOE party, he is not a member of parliament. Correspondents say that with only 84 lower house seats, the party will struggle to find allies to get legislation enacted. In return for having backed Mr SÃ¡nchez in the parliament vote, Spain's left-wing Podemos (We Can) party is likely to demand significant policy concessions from the PSOE, and perhaps some key cabinet posts. Mr SÃ¡nchez is likely to be challenged strongly over his plan to stick to the Rajoy budget. Smaller groups - including Basque and Catalan nationalists - supported the no-confidence motion against Mr Rajoy, but it is unclear whether they will back the new government. The Ciudadanos party, which had been doing well in opinion polls, supported Mr Rajoy. Spain PM Rajoy ousted: What happens next? Spanish PM Rajoy forced out of office 'Political earthquake' for Spain.

"This video can not be played A dedicated team has been formed to log data collected around England More than 400 beaches will be checked weekly in a bid to tackle the ""scourge"" of discarded plastic, the Environment Agency (EA) has said. The new unit will log data from water sampling teams around England about the amount and type of plastic found. It hopes to identify the worst-hit beaches and use its findings to better regulate the problem. More than eight million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year. The damage to marine wildlife was highlighted on the BBC's Blue Planet II, which helped to provoke a range of measures from the government and community groups. The EA's dedicated monitoring team was formed aftera Â£750,000 investmentin tackling plastic pollution was announced in January. Fishing nets and false teeth: Meet the debris hunters Guide: Why is plastic a problem? Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Kirstie Edwards, lead co-ordinator for Plastic Free Falmouth, said: ""After storms and in the summer months there's a huge increase in plastic drink bottles and generic wrappers such as crisps and ice creams. ""We also find a lot of broken-up plastic - fragments of tampon holders, bottle lids, brightly coloured parts of old buckets. ""The biggest problem is that every tide brings new litter and plastic to be cleaned. ""We encourage people to do mini beach cleans as much as they can and use 'the rule of three' - take a minimum of three pieces home. Based in the south west, the team will analyse data collected by its current team ofbathing water samplers.,external Head of the new plastics and sustainability team Bruce Newport said the new initiative gave them ""another level of detail"". ""If we find beaches that are heavily contaminated with plastic we will work with community groups, non-government organisations and we will actually work with local companies. ""Depending what needs to be done we can support or regulate to try and reduce the scourge of plastic which is hitting our beaches causing many many problems,"" he said. Environment agency officers are carrying out the monitoring alongside their water quality sampling More than eight million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year and about 90% of seabirds have eaten it. Mr Newport added: ""Having a clean beach not only is good for wildlife, not only is it good for people who come here - it's good for our economy as well. ""By being responsible with the use of plastics we can achieve that. And having a plastic-free coastline is our ambition."" Checking beaches for plastic pollution.

"Paul Massey (left) and John Kinsella were both fatally shot A man charged with the murders of an underworld ""Mr Big"" and a gangland enforcer has appeared in court amid a heavy police presence. Mark Fellows is accused of killing Paul Massey, from Salford, and John Kinsella, from Liverpool. The 37-year-old is also charged with the attempted murder of Kinsella's partner. He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on 5 June. Paul Massey was dubbed ""Mr Big"" at a meeting to discuss civil disturbances in 1992 Massey, 55, was shot dead as he got out of a car outside his home on 26 July 2015. A security boss and businessman, he was a convicted criminal once branded ""Mr Big"". Kinsella died after being shot by a man on a bicycle while he was walking his dog with his partner on 5 May. She was shot as she fled the scene by the St Helens Linkway near the M62 in Merseyside. Kinsella had been described as a mob fixer who once stopped a gangster terrorising former Liverpool FC footballer Steven Gerrard. Fellows, dressed in grey jogging bottoms and a sweatshirt, spoke at South Sefton Magistrates' Court only to confirm his name, date of birth and address in Warrington, Cheshire.

"Susan Newbon, left, was selected along with two other women to train female driving instructors A Welsh woman has been chosen to be part of the international team training the first female driving instructors in Saudi Arabia. Susan Newbon, Canadian Deborah Sherwood and American Norma Adrianzenwill be able to train women from 24 June. They will work as ""senior assessors"" for up to two years, training new examiners and instructors. Mrs Newbon, 56, from Llantwit Major in Vale of Glamorgan, said ""it's going to change their lives completely"". Previously, only men could obtain driving licences and if a woman was caught driving in public,she risked receiving a fine or being arrested. Starting preparation for her new job on 1 April, Mrs Newbon was flown out to Bahrain while she waited for her visa to be approved and was then driven into Saudi Arabia to develop a driving school. Why has Saudi Arabia suddenly decided cinema is OK? Saudi Arabia has first women politicians Saudi woman live-tweets her arrest for driving Mrs Newbon said about 1,500 applied for the three jobs in Saudi Arabia ""I wanted to do this because I want to see other women achieve,"" she said. ""I was initially nervous about going to the country, however my fears couldn't be further from the truth. ""It's been a rollercoaster, being in Saudi Arabia is totally different to what I expected, the people are so welcoming."" She said about 1,500 people applied for the three jobs, adding: ""I had never written a CV before because I had been self-employed all my life."" Susan Newbon said she ""wanted to see other women achieve"" Mrs Newborn began her career as a driving instructor in Germany in 1987, but returned to the UK in 1993 to set up her driving school. She said some Saudi Arabian women had travelled to other countries in the region to get their driving licences and experience in preparation for the team's arrival. ""After spending the last few weeks with the ladies, and learning about their culture and how not being able to drive has impacted their everyday lives, it is a real honour and privilege to be part of the changes.

"The Met says 2017 was an ""unprecedented year"" for policing in the capital Met Police officers racked up 189,000 cancelled rest days last year amid ""unprecedented"" demands on the force, the BBC has found. Two terror attacksand the Grenfell Tower fire saw extra officers brought in to aid with the force's response. Chair of the Met Police Federation, Ken Marsh MBE, said the situation had put a ""massive strain"" on staff. Deputy Met Commissioner Craig Mackey said officers had been allowed to carry rest days into 2018 and 2019. In the wake of high-profile events, Mr Mackey said, police had to work rest days, on bank holidays and long hours ""in order to get the job done"". ""I have been amazed by the continued dedication and commitment that is being shown and we have made efforts to ensure that officers regain their rest days as soon as possible,"" he said. London terror attacks 'stretched Met Police' Murder detectives loaned to help 'challenged' Met Mayor gives extra Â£59m to 'stretched' Met Police Reality Check: Is the Met Police facing Â£400m in cuts? However, Mr Marsh believes the cancelled days figure is higher and it is putting a ""massive strain"" on staff. ""Regardless of what figure it is, the amount of rest days being cancelled is absurd,"" he said. ""Our officers are not contracted, we serve the Queen and what the public don't understand is that these officers have no choice but to work when days off are cancelled. ""It means officers can't recharge and rest up. It is a massive strain on them."" One of the calls police responded to was that of the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June 2017 At one point in 2017,Mr Mackey had to write to retired officers to ask them to consider returning to workwith the Met to help with an ""unprecedented demand"" on its detective capacity. With aspike in violent crimes across the capital this yearand theprospect of US president Donald Trump visiting London, Mr Marsh fears the adverse impact on officers could get worse. ""The best way forward is to recruit more officers,"" he said. More than 70 murder investigations have also taken place in the capital in 2018 According to the Met, as of April, it currently has 29,924 officers -a drop from 31,075 officers as of January 2017,external.

"The Met says 2017 was an ""unprecedented year"" for policing in the capital Met Police officers racked up 189,000 cancelled rest days last year amid ""unprecedented"" demands on the force, the BBC has found. Two terror attacksand the Grenfell Tower fire saw extra officers brought in to aid with the force's response. Chair of the Met Police Federation, Ken Marsh MBE, said the situation had put a ""massive strain"" on staff. Deputy Met Commissioner Craig Mackey said officers had been allowed to carry rest days into 2018 and 2019. In the wake of high-profile events, Mr Mackey said, police had to work rest days, on bank holidays and long hours ""in order to get the job done"". ""I have been amazed by the continued dedication and commitment that is being shown and we have made efforts to ensure that officers regain their rest days as soon as possible,"" he said. London terror attacks 'stretched Met Police' Murder detectives loaned to help 'challenged' Met Mayor gives extra Â£59m to 'stretched' Met Police Reality Check: Is the Met Police facing Â£400m in cuts? However, Mr Marsh believes the cancelled days figure is higher and it is putting a ""massive strain"" on staff. ""Regardless of what figure it is, the amount of rest days being cancelled is absurd,"" he said. ""Our officers are not contracted, we serve the Queen and what the public don't understand is that these officers have no choice but to work when days off are cancelled. ""It means officers can't recharge and rest up. It is a massive strain on them."" One of the calls police responded to was that of the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June 2017 At one point in 2017,Mr Mackey had to write to retired officers to ask them to consider returning to workwith the Met to help with an ""unprecedented demand"" on its detective capacity. With aspike in violent crimes across the capital this yearand theprospect of US president Donald Trump visiting London, Mr Marsh fears the adverse impact on officers could get worse. ""The best way forward is to recruit more officers,"" he said. More than 70 murder investigations have also taken place in the capital in 2018 According to the Met, as of April, it currently has 29,924 officers -a drop from 31,075 officers as of January 2017,external. ""We will make every effort to ensure that, demand aside, officers can continue to take re-rostered rest days in a timely manner,"" Mr Mackey said.

"Shops, like this Sainsbury's in Leeds, were unable to take Visa payments on Friday Visa services have returned to normal after a hardware failure left European customers unable to make some payments. The company released a statement on Saturday morning, saying its systems were now working at ""full capacity"". Visa apologised and said Friday's outage was not down to ""unauthorised access or a cyber attack"". Customers have reported money going missing from accounts when their cards were declined - including one man who lost Â£10,000 when paying for a car. Tom Mitchell, from Kent, said the money left his Natwest account, but his bank told him it was up to Visa to complete the transaction - instead, his money has been left in ""limbo"". The 33-year-old said: ""I live in Kent and went to Ipswich to get this car. It took four hours by train.

" When it comes to remote, the Faroe Islands has it all. Tucked between Norway and Iceland, in the dark waters of the North Atlantic, the 18 tiny islands are home to a population of just over 50,000. Half of those residents live in the archipelago's capital Tórshavn “Thor's harbour”. But some of the islands are sparsely populated, with just a handful of people living on them. The Faroese are self-reliant, modest people, with a rich heritage of storytelling and a deep desire to share information with one another. The self-governing nation has a well-developed communication network - courtesy of the Kingdom of Denmark of which it is part - but many still rely on the postal service. Some of the islands are connected by tunnels and bridges, but on others, mail bags arrive by boat or even helicopter. A network of hard-working postal workers then criss-cross islands on old mountain routes used since the 19th Century delivering the post. The fittest people used to be nominated to walk these routes, but these days 4x4 postal vehicles cross the rugged terrain. But still, on the smaller islands, post is delivered on foot by locals. Meet some of them. She will soon retire and pass on most of the responsibility to her brother Bjarni. It’s winter on the Faroe Islands and an icy wind blows. Jancy meets the helicopter that brings the island's post wearing a floral headscarf, simple jacket and short wellingtons. She doesn’t wear gloves, despite the freezing wind coming off the ocean. She says she’s never cold. In summer the island is served by boat, and the mail arrives in brown hessian sacks. But in the winter, it’s too dangerous to sail. Most of the islanders gather at the helipad when the helicopter arrives - this is a big moment in the day. Sheep graze high up on the slopes, and seabirds - most famously puffins - nest all along the island’s westerly tip. Jancy’s canvas shoulder bag often carries copies of the Faroe Islands’ two daily newspapers - both of which have loyal readerships and connect many of the islands’ older residents to the issues of the day. There are currently no children living on Mykines. Two young people left the island recently. One went to study physics abroad and the other went to study in a Faroese town on what's known as the mainland - the largest islands in the archipelago, all connected by road tunnels and bridges. Jancy’s daughter is in her 30s and lives in Copenhagen where she works as a vet. “She'll never move home,” says the post woman. “I understand. I like Copenhagen, you can be anonymous - unlike here.” The residents of Mykines visit their neighbours every day. Doors are never locked - there’s no crime - and visitors are always welcome. In summer, tourists arrive - mostly to view the seabirds. Flasks of black coffee and tins of old-fashioned chocolates sit on plastic-covered tables in every home, ready to welcome visitors. Kristina runs a small guesthouse on the island. She tells me how her children, the last to leave the island, “kept the postal service in business” with their eBay and Amazon purchases. Ordering parcels worth less than 300 Danish Kroner (£35) means residents can avoid heavy taxes - so across the islands, young people order lots of individual items. Internet shopping keeps them connected to the fashions of the outside world. Kristina tells me how she would always mail order clothes for herself and the children from shops in Denmark. She felt it gave them an identity that was far away from their island home. Meinhard and his wife Jessie are among the island’s 22 permanent residents. Skúvoy is famed for its North Atlantic bird population, and local men hunt for Fulmar eggs on the high cliffs in the summer. Before taking over from his father, Meinhard worked as a fisherman. In the 1960s, it was typical for the Faroese boats to fish around Scotland and it was there that he met Jessie, a native of the island of Lewis. The couple married and opened the island’s supermarket. Meinhard took over as a postman in 1975 - a job his father had started in 1938. Today, the mail boat or helicopter arrives on the island three times a week. Meinhard has rarely taken a holiday. Occasionally he travels to the mainland to spend time with the couple's eight grandchildren. Dogs on Skúvoy roam the lanes freely, including Meinhard’s 13-year-old Rolf, who follows him on his postal round. The boat to Skúvoy is relatively new. Light and fast, it was built in Denmark and then sent to Spain to take workers to their jobs. On a previous visit, I travelled to the island on an older, smaller ferry. Strapped to its deck was a shiny white coffin. It would be delivered to the home of Gretur, a local sailor and fisherman who had recently passed away. The crossing is always bumpy as currents merge. The boat is the link to the island’s survival, connecting Skúvoy to the nearby island of Sandoy. Soon Sandoy will be connected to another larger island by a tunnel, and it’s hoped this will encourage more people to start a life there. There is also talk of a tunnel being built to Skúvoy, but islands with tiny populations are unlikely to attract this kind of investment. Stóra Dímun can’t be reached from the sea without climbing a cliff face, so the only way on to the island in winter is by helicopter. At one end is a steep, wind-battered peak on which sits the island’s lighthouse. At the other, is a steep, curving hillside populated by hardy sheep. This glaciated slope curves up to a narrow plateau at the top where Icelandic horses graze. The white Atlantic Airways helicopter named Ruth, after a famous Faroese painter, turns to make her descent on to Stóra Dímun. A woman sits in the helicopter wearing thick, padded farmer’s overalls and low-cut wellington boots. Wiry with brown hair tied back, this is Eva. She helps unload the provisions from the back of the helicopter and she is greeted by her niece Andrea. The arrival of the helicopter is a big event and the only contact the families have with the rest of the world. Everyone is there to watch. From outside, the houses and farm have the appearance of a fort, protecting its inhabitants from the elements. Inside, a lunch of wind-dried lamb, boiled eggs, cow tongue, thinly sliced cured halibut, and rhubarb jam has been prepared. The family squash on to long wooden benches in the low-roofed room and a conversation on Faroese politics begins. On the previous day, a Danish academic was secretly filmed by a Spanish journalist saying how much the Faroese were dependent on Denmark. Not long before this, the Danish government flew an incorrect version of the Faroese flag in Copenhagen. Erla, a mother to three children and wife of Janus, says how this attitude towards the Faroese from the Danish authorities upsets her. This is a family trying to survive on this island, blending old and new. There are reminders of tradition around the house. Above the dining table hang amber-coloured transparent ellipses. They are dried sheep’s bladders, which the children sell at small markets elsewhere in the Faroes. Both Janus and Eva's families are entrepreneurial and full of energy. Their plan is to make cider or an aquavit spirit with the turnips in partnership with a Faroese brewer. The farm buildings are covered by solar panels, utilising the exposed setting. The children Óla Jákup, Andrea and Tórur are schooled on the island in a specially built, traditional grass-roofed cottage that doubles as a house where visitors to the island can stay. The teachers are often young graduates or early in their teaching careers, looking for a new experience. A rota ensures the children see different teachers regularly and this is working well. The children are also connected to corresponding classes in the school on the mainland via the Internet. This allows them to see their “classmates”. Friends and pupils come to stay on Stóra Dímun via helicopter. The post and the helicopter are essential to life on the island. Oil is flown in drums, hung like a trawler’s net full of fish below the helicopter. He lives with his wife and their three grown-up children in a village called Trøllanes on the most northerly tip of the island. The village sits in a hollow, smoothly rounded by glacial ice. To get to the village you must drive through a narrow one-way tunnel with no lighting. Before it was built in the 1970s the village could only be accessed by boat. Fewer than 20 people live in Trøllanes - which when translated into English means Troll peninsula. The ""troll"" relates to humanoid creatures from folklore and mythology. Eyðun’s mother was born in the nearby village of Mikladalur, home to the Faroese legend of the seal woman, or selkie. The whole island of Kalsoy has this folkloric significance. Eyðun is the renaissance man of the island, having lived away and studied before returning to make a home in the village. The ferry to Fugloy brings the post from Hvannasund, a village in a fjord between the islands of Borðoy and Viðoy. It was winter when I visited and there was an icy breeze. The boat’s cargo was light - a postal sack and a box filled with about 50 light bulbs. The bulbs had been used at a party to illuminate a community house, a deckhand said. Below deck, a worn Bible lay on a shelf at the waterline, the front cover missing. Two bubblegum machines with globe-like tops were chained to the stairs leading to the deck. Their colourful sweets rolled around with the swell. I was the only passenger. It grew colder as the boat left the fjord for open water and her destination of Fugloy. Arriving at the island, the swell was high at the village of Kirkja. The boat couldn’t dock and so deliveries had to be thrown towards the harbour, where postman Joannes was waiting. In the family home Svanhild his daughter is sitting at the dining table. Her forearms are covered with white emulsion paint. She’s been helping her father on the farm, painting the buildings that house the sheep during winter. “We have four calves and we still keep sheep,” she says. “The village is shrinking. The last of the children have left and the school is empty. There are just four of us. People come and go.” Still, she is determined to make a go of it, working on the farm and helping with the helicopter duties. All the postal workers, like Meinhard on the island of Skúvoy, have worked hard to keep the disconnected islands connected - not just with letters and parcels but also by providing a vital community link. He hopes that new enterprising families will follow in the tradition of Faroese self-sufficiency and set up homes on his, and the other the remote islands, ensuring the postal sacks are always full.

"This video can not be played Norman Scott: ""There is obviously a lot of skulduggery that's gone on"" A probe into a scandal involving former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe is to be revisited, after police admitted that a key suspect may still be alive. A 2015 investigation into the alleged attempted murder of Mr Thorpe's lover - Norman Scott - was closed in 2017. Gwent Police believed Andrew Newton - who claimed he was paid to kill Mr Scott - had died. But the force has now told the BBC this may not be the case. Mr Scott said he thought police were continuing a ""cover-up"". The revelations have been made in the BBC Four documentary The Jeremy Thorpe Scandal. Following the BBC's revelations, theMail on Sunday said it had tracked down Mr Newton,external- living under a different name - in Surrey. The paper has published what it claims is a picture of Mr Newton, taken on Saturday. The man's face cannot be seen. Mr Thorpe, who died in 2014, was accused of hiring a hitman to murder Mr Scott but was acquitted at an Old Bailey trial in 1979. The fresh investigation was launched by Gwent Police in 2015 after new claims emerged. But the police's belief that Newton - who was convicted of shooting Mr Scott's dog in 1975 - had died, led the Crown Prosecution Service to close it last year. Gwent Police told documentary makers enquiries made as part of the investigation had ""indicated Newton was deceased"". But they added: ""We have now revisited these enquiries and have identified information which indicates that Newton may still be alive."" The force said it planned to assess if Mr Newton ""is able to assist the investigation"". When asked on Saturday night about the Mail on Sunday's claims to have tracked Mr Newton to Surrey, Gwent Police said it had ""lines of inquiry open"" but would not provide further comment ""at this time"". This video can not be played A look at the Jeremy Thorpe scandal, the focus of a new BBC drama with Hugh Grant Jeremy Thorpe was the MP for North Devon for 20 years, and leader of the Liberal Party between 1967-76. He died in 2014 He was offered a cabinet post after the February 1974 election by then-Prime Minister Edward Heath In late 1960 or early 1961 he met Norman Scott, who worked for one of Mr Thorpe's friends in Oxfordshire. Mr Scott said the two were lovers, at a time when homosexuality was illegal Mr Scott spent years attempting to reveal the pair's relationship to the public, then claimed Mr Thorpe conspired with colleagues to have him assassinated In 1975, Andrew Newton shot Mr Scott's Great Dane, Rinka, on a rural road in Exmoor, but failed to kill Mr Scott after his gun jammed Newspapers began reporting Mr Scott's claims after he spoke about the relationship in court, meaning they were protected from libel laws Mr Thorpe resigned as leader of the Liberal Party in 1976 over the reports, but denied Mr Scott's allegations. He lost his seat in North Devon in 1979 Mr Thorpe, along with three co-defendants, stood trial. Ex-Liberal MP Peter Bessell, and the failed assassin Newton, gave details of the alleged plot. A jury acquitted all four in 1979 BBC Panorama journalist Tom Mangold, who has investigated the case since the 1970s, said the 2015 investigation hinged on the story of a man he had met called Dennis Meighan. Mr Meighan told the veteran reporter he was originally approached to carry out the murder - but he claimshis police statement was later doctoredto remove incriminating references to the Liberal Party and to Mr Thorpe. A Very 'bone-chilling' English Scandal Hugh Grant, politics and a murdered dog Revealed: Letter that silenced Thorpe Following Gwent Police's admission that Newton could still be alive, Mr Mangold insisted the investigation ""must start again"". And reacting to the news, Mr Scott, 78, told the documentary: ""I just don't think anyone's tried hard enough to look for him. I really don't. ""There must be people who knew him and there would surely be a record of him dying. ""I thought [Gwent Police] were doing something at last, and soon found out that absolutely they weren't, they were continuing the cover up as far as I can see."" Jeremy Thorpe, a former leader of the Liberal Party, was acquitted of conspiracy to murder his ex-lover in 1979 The programme includes unearthed footage from a Panorama programme from 1979 that was never broadcast for legal reasons, after Mr Thorpe and his three co-defendants were acquitted of conspiracy to murder. The director general at the time kept a master copy of the programme but ordered all other copies to be destroyed. But journalist Tom Mangold kept his copy of the report.

"China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims over territory in the South China Sea Countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has grown in recent years. In particular, China's sweeping claims - which include sovereignty claims over land parcels and their adjacent waters - have angered competing claimants like Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. The other countries have staked claims on islands and various zones in the sea, such as the Paracels and the Spratlys. China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols. The US says it does not take sides in territorial disputes, but has sent military ships and planes near disputed islands in what it calls ""freedom of navigation"" operations. Japan, which has no direct stake in the South China Sea, also provides ships and military equipment to claimants like Vietnam and the Philippines. There are fears that the area is becoming a flashpoint, with potentially serious global consequences. The Paracels and the Spratlys are two island chains claimed in whole or in part by a number of countries The South China Sea is a major shipping route. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development estimates that over 21% of global trade, amounting to $3.37 trillion, transited through these waters in 2016. It is also home to rich fishing grounds that provide for the livelihoods of millions of people across the region. More than half of the world's fishing vessels operate in this area. Although largely uninhabited, the Paracels and the Spratlys may have reserves of natural resources around them. There has been little detailed exploration of the area, so estimates are largely extrapolated from the mineral wealth of neighbouring areas. China claims by far the largest portion of territory in an area demarcated by its so-called ""nine-dash line"". The line comprises nine dashes which extends hundreds of miles south and east from its most southerly province of Hainan. A map issued by Beijing shows the two island groups falling entirely within its territory In 1947, Chinaissued a map,externaldetailing its claims, and insists history backs up its claims - Beijing says its right to the area goes back centuries to when the Paracel and Spratly island chains were regarded as integral parts of the Chinese nation. These claims are mirrored by Taiwan. However, critics say China has not been specific about what exactly its claim includes, and that the nine-dash line that appears on Chinese maps encompassing almost the entirety of the South China Sea includes no coordinates. It is also not clear whether China claims only land territory within the nine-dash line, or all the maritime space within it as well. Both the Philippines and China lay claim to the Scarborough Shoal, or Huangyan Island as it is known in China Vietnam hotly disputes China's historical account, saying China had never claimed sovereignty over the islands before the 1940s. Vietnam says it has actively ruled over both the Paracels and the Spratlys since the 17th Century - and has the documents to prove it. The other major claimant to the area is the Philippines, which invokes its geographical proximity to the Spratly Islands as the main basis of its claim for part of the grouping. Both the Philippines and China also lay claim to the Scarborough Shoal (known as Huangyan Island in China) - a little more than 100 miles (160km) from the Philippines and 500 miles from China. Malaysia and Brunei also lay claim to territory in the South China Sea that they say falls within their economic exclusion zones, as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS. Brunei does not claim any of the disputed islands, but Malaysia claims a small number of islands in the Spratlys. The most serious trouble in recent decades has flared between Vietnam and China, and there have also been stand-offs between the Philippines and China. Some of the incidents include: In 1974, the Chinese seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing more than 70 Vietnamese troops. In 1988, the two sides clashed in the Spratlys, with Vietnam again coming off worse, losing about 60 sailors. In early 2012, China and the Philippines engaged in a lengthy maritime stand-off, accusing each other of intrusions in the Scarborough Shoal. Unverified claims that the Chinese navy sabotaged two Vietnamese exploration operations in late 2012 led tolarge anti-China protestson Vietnam's streets. In January 2013, Manila said it was taking China to a UN tribunal under the auspices of the UN Convention on the Laws of the Sea, to challenge its claims. In May 2014, the introduction by China of a drilling rig into waters near the Paracel Islands led to multiple collisions between Vietnamese and Chinese ships. In June 2019, Manila accused a Chinese trawler of ramming a Filipino fishing boat with 22 people on board. The Filipinos were rescued by the Vietnamese. In early 2023, the Philippines said Chinese vessels have been shining lasers at Filipino boats to temporarily blind their crew. They also accuse the Chinese of dangerous manoeuvres by sailing too close or blocking the Filipinos' path. Claimant countries have been banning films depicting contested territorial claims in the South China Sea. Most recently,Vietnam banned the upcoming Barbie film- due for release in July 2023 - over its portrayal of a map that includes the nine-dash line. Senators in the Philippines also criticised the map's inclusion in the movie. It should come with ""an explicit disclaimer that the nine-dash line is a figment of China's imagination"", according to one lawmaker. Korean pop super groupBlackpink also came under fire in Vietnamin July 2023 after their concert promoter's website featured a map with Beijing's nine-dash line. Allow Twitter content?

In 2019,DreamWorks' animated children's movie Abominablealso incurred the ire of several South East Asian countries. Vietnam pulled the film, Malaysia cut the scene depicting the map, while the Philippines called for a DreamWorks boycott. Abominable is the first co-production between the US company and China's Pearl Studio production firm. In 2018, Vietnamese censors cut a second-long clip in Crazy Rich Asians featuring a designer bag with a world map that showed the disputed area under Beijing's control. China prefers bilateral negotiations with the other parties. But many of its neighbours argue that China's relative size and clout give it an unfair advantage. Some countries have argued that China should negotiate with Asean (the Association of South East Asian Nations), a 10-member regional grouping that consists of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. However, China is opposed to this, while Asean is also divided over how to resolve the dispute. China has opposed negotiations with Asean, a 10-member regional grouping The Philippines has sought international arbitration instead. In 2013, it announced it would take China to an arbitration tribunal under the auspices of the UN Convention on the Laws of the Sea, to challenge its claims. In July 2016, the tribunal backed the Philippines' case, saying China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights. China had boycotted the proceedings and called the ruling ""ill-founded"". It says it will not be bound by it.

"Ben Whishaw (background) and Hugh Grant in A Very English Scandal The opening episode of A Very English Scandal - documenting the rise and fall of politician Jeremy Thorpe - has received broad praise from critics. The BBC mini-series stars Hugh Grant in ""revelatory"" form as the Liberal Party leader, with Ben Whishaw as his ex-lover Norman Scott. Viewers joked thatthe Paddington co-starsturn as lovers meant the family films had taken an ""unexpected turn"". Here is a round-up of reaction to the ""funny"" yet ""chilling"" debut episode. Ahead of broadcast of the Russell T Davies adaptation, much had been made of the decision to cast Grant - previously typecast as a romcom actor - in the role of Thorpe. The Guardian,externalsuggests the gamble has paid off with Grant ""never less than wholly convincing and compelling"" and ""clearly having the time of his actorly life,"" writes Lucy Mangan. Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw previously co-starred in Paddington 2 ""Everything (bar the stutter) that made him a romcom star is still there, but now there is everything else too,"" she says. ""He handles the comic scenes and moments, which are sprinkled liberally throughout, with the deftness you'd expect, but never loses sight of the underlying nervousness, fear and venality underlying the politician's moves,"" Mangan continues. Grant is aided by Davies' dialogue, adapted from John Preston's novel of the same name,says Digital Spy,external- capturing the ""tragedy and farce"" of the scandal prior to the partial legalisation of homosexuality in 1967. A gay affair, a bungled plot and a dead dog on Exmoor were the ingredients of what came to be dubbed ""the trial of the century"". Thorpe - leader of the Liberal Party - became the first British politician to be tried for conspiracy and incitement to murder - charged over an assassination plot against his secret lover Norman Scott. The real Jeremy Thorpe (left) died in 2014, while Norman Scott lives on However, it was a Great Dane called Rinka that ended up being shot on Exmoor in October 1975, by a man whom Scott believed had been sent to kill him. A police investigation into the Exmoor incident led to Thorpe and three associates being charged. Thorpe was acquitted but his career never recovered. He died in 2014, aged 85, after a long battle with Parkinson's. Read the full story. The Telegraph,externalis similarly effusive calling Hugh Grant ""both charming and bone-chilling in this brilliant take on the Thorpe affair"". The paper's Jasper Rees argues Grant's portrayal embodies ""everything that is perfectly loathsome about some Establishment figures: entitlement and charm masking the ruthless guile of a predator."" The depiction of Thorpe's double-life is enabled with ""spiffing joie de vivre"" through Alex Jenning's performance as fellow MP Peter Bessell - the confidant turned witness in Thorpe's eventual trial for conspiracy to murder Scott. And whileThe Times' review,externalnotes the real-life Scott, now 78, reportedly ""hates"" the way Whishaw portrays him as a ""mincing weakling,""The Independent,externalsees Whishaw's take as the puppy-eyed model to be ""pitifully believable"". However, critical response to Whishaw's performance on social media quickly became dwarfed by comparisons to his role in Paddington. The 37-year-old voiced the much-loved bear in the 2014 reboot and last year's sequel, in which Grant, 57, played villain Phoenix Buchanan. Allow Twitter content?

"Experts say China is developing weaponry tailored for export to specific markets, including some deemed too sensitive for Western manufacturers China's modernisation of its armed forces is proceeding faster than many analysts expected. Now, according to experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies - the IISS - in London, it is China and no longer Russia, that increasingly provides the benchmark against which Washington judges the capability requirements for its own armed forces. This is especially true in terms of air and naval forces - the focus of China's modernisation effort. Events in Europe mean that for the US Army, it is still largely Russian capabilities that provide the benchmark threat. This trend has been chronicled in the Military Balance, the annual assessment of global military capabilities and defence spending, published by the IISS since 1959. Of course the transformation of the Chinese military has been under way for some time. But now a significant way-point has been reached - or is very close - that will make it the ""peer competitor"" for Washington. Ahead of the publication of this year's Military Balance later this week, I sat down with a group of IISS experts to try to tease out more of the details of this trend, providing a powerful narrative to the annual compendium's tables and statistics. How does China's military spending compare? Military facelift a sign of bigger changes How China is ruled: Military Affairs Commission China's progress and technical abilities are remarkable - from ultra-long-range conventional ballistic missiles to fifth generation fighter jets. Last year the first hull of China's latest warship - the Type 55 cruiser - was put into the water. Its capabilities would give any Nato navy pause for thought. China is working on its second aircraft carrier. It is revamping its military command structure to give genuine joint headquarters involving all the key services. In terms of artillery, air defence and land attack it has weapons that out-range anything the US can deploy. Since the late 1990s, when it received an influx of advanced Russian technology, the Chinese Navy has recapitalised the bulk of its surface and sub-surface fleets. This video can not be played China's first domestically built aircraft carrier was launched in April 2017 In the air, its new single-seat fighter, the J-20, is said by the Chinese to be in operational service. It is what is known in the trade as a ""fifth generation fighter"", meaning that it incorporates stealth technology; it has a supersonic cruising speed; and highly integrated avionics. IISS experts remain sceptical. ""The Chinese Air Force"", they say, ""still needs to develop suitable tactics to operate the low-observable jet and must come up with doctrines to mix these 'fifth generation' warplanes with earlier 'fourth generation models'. ""Still, China's progress is clear,"" they say, ""you can add to these aircraft a whole range of capable air-to-air missiles that are every bit on a par with those in Western arsenals."" This year's Military Balance devotes a whole chapter to developments in Chinese and Russian air-launched weapons which they see as a key test for western dominance. The US and its allies have waged air campaigns since the end of the Cold War and have lost very few aircraft. But this dominance, according to the IISS, may be increasingly challenged. China, for example, is developing a very long-range air-to-air missile intended specifically to strike at tanker and command and control aircraft that now orbit out of harm's way; essential but vulnerable elements in any air operation. The authors of the Military Balance argue China's air-to-air missile developments by 2020, ""will likely force the US and its regional allies to re-examine not only their tactics, techniques and procedures, but also the direction of their own combat-aerospace development programmes"". On land the Chinese army is lagging behind in this modernisation effort according to the IISS. Only about half of its equipment is serviceable in terms of modern combat. But even here progress is being made. China has set a goal of 2020 as the date to achieve both ""mechanisation"" and what it calls ""informisation"". Quite what China means by this is latter term is unclear, but Beijing has been watching the developing role of information in warfare and seeking to adapt this to its own particular circumstances. An armed Chinese drone of the type for sale to other countries China has one clear strategic aim in mind to which many of its new weapons systems are tailored. In the event of a conflict, this is to push US military power as far away from its shores as possible, ideally deep into the Pacific. This strategy is known in military jargon as ""anti-access area denial"" - sometimes abbreviated as A2AD. This explains China's focus on long-range air and maritime systems that can hold the US Navy's carrier battle groups at risk. Growing concern over China's naval might Why is the South China Sea contentious? World power 'threatened' by Chinese AI So as a military player China has pretty well joined the Premier League. But this though is not the end of Beijing's global military impact. It is also pursuing an ambitious arms export strategy. Often China is willing to sell advanced technologies that other countries either do not have, or are unwilling to sell to all but their closest allies. The market for armed drones is a case in point. This is a rapidly spreading technology that raises huge questions about the boundary between peace and war. The US, which was one of the pioneers in this field, has refused to sell sophisticated armed drones to anyone except a limited number of its closest Nato allies like the United Kingdom. France, which already operates US-supplied Reaper drones, has plans to arm drones as well. China has had no such constraints, displaying impressive unmanned aerial vehicles alongside the various munitions that they can carry at arms shows around the world. The IISS Military Balance says that China has sold its armed UAVs to a number of countries including Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Myanmar, among others. This is a very good example of unintended consequences. Washington's reluctance to sell this technology leaves the field open to Beijing. Inevitably this has a wider role in the spread of such weapons, encouraging other countries who operate UAVs solely for intelligence gathering purposes to seek armed variants as well. US and Western arms exporters see China as a growing commercial threat. Compared with even a decade ago, there is a serious Chinese presence in the marketplace, offering good quality equipment. China, as the armed UAV example illustrates, is also willing to enter markets which many Western manufacturers, or their governments, see as being too sensitive. And as the IISS experts told me, China tends to win on all aspects of the deal. Typically Chinese weaponry will give you 75% of the capability of the available Western technology for 50% of the price. In business terms it's a strong offer. The Thai army testing out a newly purchased Chinese-manufactured VT4 main battle tank in January 2018 China's ground warfare exports are less impressive. They still have to compete for customers with countries like Russia and Ukraine. But when Kiev couldn't meet the timeframe for a tank deal with Thailand in 2014, the Thais bought Chinese VT4 tanks instead. Last year Thailand went back for more. IISS experts say that China is also trying to develop weaponry tailored to specific markets. They point to a new light tank for example intended for African countries, whose roads and infrastructure would not be able to cope with many of the heavier models offered by others. China's growing role as a source of sophisticated weaponry is something that is worrying many countries and not just its neighbours. Western air forces have enjoyed some three decades of dominance. But the ""anti-access"" strategy of the Chinese has provided weapons that could easily be employed by others to do the same thing. A Western European country may never face China in a conflict, but it could well face sophisticated Chinese weapons systems in the hands of others. As one IISS expert put it, ""the perception that you will enter a low-risk environment when intervening overseas, now needs to be questioned.""

"Ben Whishaw (background) and Hugh Grant in A Very English Scandal The makers of A Very English Scandal, a BBC drama about shamed politician Jeremy Thorpe, explain why his story is still relevant. A gay affair, a bungled plot and a dead dog on Exmoor were the ingredients of what came to be dubbed ""the trial of the century"". At its centre was Jeremy Thorpe - leader of the Liberal Party, a pillar of the establishment and the first British politician to be tried for conspiracy and incitement to murder. Now, almost 40 years on from Thorpe's sensational acquittal, the story behind the case is being retold in a three-part BBC drama. Directed by Stephen Frears and written by Russell T Davies, A Very English Scandal stars Hugh Grant as Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Norman Scott, the ex-lover he was accused of trying to have killed. Based onJohn Preston's 2016 book,external, the dramatisation begins with Thorpe meeting and seducing Scott, a young and sexually inexperienced worker at a horse stables. Once the affair has run its course, Thorpe finds Scott to be a persistent thorn in his side who poses a serious threat to his political ambitions. Grant previously worked with Stephen Frears on Florence Foster Jenkins At the end of episode one, Thorpe is seen exhorting a colleague (played by Alex Jennings) to arrange Scott's death, coldly reasoning that ""it's no worse than shooting a sick dog"". And it was a dog - a Great Dane called Rinka - that ended up being shot on Exmoor in October 1975, by a man whom Scott believed had been sent to kill him. ""It was an absolutely idiotic story, unless you're the dog,"" says Frears. ""But at the bottom of it all was murderousness. ""It's a wonderful, very funny and ridiculous story about corruption in public life."" ""But it's also very sad,"" says Russell T Davies, of Doctor Who and Queer as Folk fame. ""Lives were ruined by this. ""These events were so devastating, people fell out of history. The story still creates controversy, even after all these years."" Whishaw's voice was heard in Paddington and its sequel, in which Grant also appeared Grant remembers the case being ""a riveting and juicy business"" that was ""a source of much sniggering"" when he was in school. ""I love things that are funny and sad at the same time, which rejoice in eccentricity and the oddness of people,"" he continues. Yet the star of Notting Hill and Love, Actually admits to being perplexed when Frears first approached him about the project. ""Stephen rang me up and I said 'Which part?'"" the actor recalls. ""I thought he maybe wanted me to play Rinka the dog."" Not a wholly absurd idea given Grant's recent role in Paddington 2 as a washed-up thespian reduced to appearing in dog food commercials, dressed as a dog. The canine that eventually landed the Rinka role was a source of some frustration to Whishaw, who provided the voice of Paddington and played Q in the recent James Bond films. ""Great Danes, I have learned, are not so clever,"" sighs the actor. ""They're quite highly strung and not that smart."" The real Jeremy Thorpe (left) died in 2014, while Norman Scott lives on Whishaw is however full of praise for the real Scott, now 78, who met with the actor during the course of the production. ""Stephen said I should meet the real Norman so I did,"" Whishaw says. ""It was nice to see him and hear how he recalls these events."" A police investigation into the Exmoor incident led to Thorpe and three associates being charged with conspiring to murder Scott. Scott gave evidence at their 1979 trial, during which he was infamously vilified by the presiding judge as ""a sponger, a whiner and a parasite"". Sir Joseph Cantley's remarks were seized upon by the satirical comedian Peter Cook, who took to the stage shortly afterwards to delivera merciless skewering of a biased judge,external. Frears said he had offered the judge's part to Sir Ian McKellen, but was turned down because ""he knew Peter Cook had nailed it."" Whishaw admits to feeling outrage on Scott's behalf. ""But I didn't want it to be the story of a man who was or saw himself as a victim,"" he continues. ""He was always portrayed as pathetic and a 'fairy' but that's not true. He's more complicated than that, and so is the story."" The drama marks Stephen Frears' (left) first collaboration with Russell T Davies Grant, for his part, acknowledges there are comparisons to be drawn between Thorpe's fall from grace and his own trials by media. ""I suppose there's a little parallel because I've been in the middle of a maelstrom of press attention,"" he says, alluding to the time he was arrested with a prostitute in 1995. ""But what was more difficult was getting my head round a guy, brought up with such privilege, actually uttering the words: 'Let's kill him'. ""For me, it was the changing of the guard and the last hurrah of the establishment. You see Thorpe's world greying and fading as Norman's comes alive."" Thorpe was acquitted but his career never recovered. He died in 2014, aged 85, after a long battle with Parkinson's. Obituary: Jeremy Thorpe Revealed: Letter that silenced Thorpe Four years on, Davies says his role as a writer ""is to understand why these mad things happened and to get inside these people's heads"". ""This drama could not be more relevant,"" he continues. ""Wherever there's money and conservatism and a family, there are always secrets and lies. ""I think what we've made is very forgiving to both men,"" he concludes. ""In the end, it's just a great piece of history."" A Very English Scandal begins on BBC One on 20 May at 21:00 BST.

"Gay rights campaigners protested about the way homosexuality was treated in the trial It was dubbed ""the trial of the century"" - a dashing, charismatic political leader accused of conspiring to murder his former gay lover in a bizarre, ill-fated plot. But why did Jeremy Thorpe - leader of the Liberal Party and pillar of the Establishment - not go into the witness box to defend himself from charges he vehemently denied? The BBC has obtained a document that sheds new light on the decision by Mr Thorpe's lawyers not to let him give evidence at the Old Bailey in 1979, seen at the time as a high risk manoeuvre that might have led to a lengthy prison sentence for their client. It is a passionate four-page letter from Mr Thorpe to an American man called Bruno sent after they had met in San Francisco in 1961, which Mr Thorpe wrote is ""the one city where a gay person can let down his defences and feel free and unhunted"". The prosecution at the trial had a copy, and if Mr Thorpe had given evidence he would have faced questioning about his sexuality which he wanted to avoid. I received the ""Bruno letter"" and connected records from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation after making an FOI request under American Freedom of Information law. In it, Mr Thorpe also said of San Francisco: ""If I'm driven out of public life in Britain for a gay scandal I shall settle in SF!"" He asked Bruno to write to him at the House of Commons ""marked Personal!"", and discussed how they could meet again, adding: ""I must get on to SF on some mission, which the British or American taxpayers will pay for!!"" Pages one and three in the FBI's copy of Thorpe's letter to ""Bruno"" Pages two and four in the FBI's copy of Thorpe's letter to ""Bruno"" Mr Thorpe, a former leader of the Liberal party, and three others were acquitted of conspiring to murder his former lover, Norman Scott, in one of the most famous court cases in British political history. The trial arose from a bizarre incident on Exmoor in which Mr Scott's dog Rinka had been shot dead. The prosecution asserted that the real plan had been to kill Mr Scott himself, whom Mr Thorpe wanted to silence because he was telling others about their past relationship, a relationship which the former Liberal leader persistently denied. Obituary: Jeremy Thorpe Heath, Thorpe and the lost coalition of 1974 During the court case, many observers were stunned when Mr Thorpe's legal team announced he would not give any evidence in his own defence. This meant that he avoided being cross-examined by the prosecution and personally having to respond to a range of uncomfortable topics. They included evidence of mysterious financial transactions and remarks he had made about wanting Mr Scott dead, which were part of the alleged conspiracy; but also evidence of his affairs at a time when, until 1967, male homosexuality had been illegal. Prosecution lawyers had notified Mr Thorpe's barrister George Carman and solicitor Sir David Napley that they had significant information on his other gay relationships, including the missive to Bruno. Jeremy Thorpe arriving for his trial According to the biography of Mr Carman, written by his son Dominic, the barrister was already inclined to think that Mr Thorpe should not give evidence and the Bruno document ""removed any doubt"" he had that it was the right decision. The significance of the letter is confirmed in an earlier book on the Thorpe affair, Rinkagate, in which the journalists Simon Freeman and Barrie Penrose state: ""Any lingering doubts that Carman and Napley might have had were removed when the prosecution showed them a sexually explicit letter from Thorpe to a friend called Bruno... Carman and Napley agreed it would be a catastrophe for Thorpe if the letter became public, which would definitely happen if he gave evidence."" The decision not to go into the witness box was Mr Thorpe's legal right. The reason he later gave in his own memoirs was that giving evidence ""would have prolonged the trial unnecessarily for at least another 10 to 14 days"". Hugh Grant plays Mr Thorpe in a new BBC drama After the not-guilty verdict, it was widely considered to have been a clever strategy from his legal team. The three key prosecution witnesses all faced significant doubts over their credibility, and they failed to convince the jury. However, in public relations terms it was much less successful. Mr Thorpe's acquittal did not seem to clear him in the court of public opinion. His reputation never recovered from the allegations in the case and the widespread feeling they had not been satisfactorily answered, until he died in 2014. Interest in the trial has recently been reawakened by the forthcoming BBC One series,A Very English Scandal, which dramatises the events of the Thorpe-Scott affair and the ramifications of their falling out. The FBI found the letter in Bruno's possession when they arrested him in 1963 for breaking a probation order he had earlier received for theft. As it indicated the writer was a British member of parliament, the document was passed to the authorities in London, although the FBI's files show they mistakenly thought Mr Thorpe was a Labour rather than a Liberal MP. The US Attorney General, Robert Kennedy, brother of the then president, wanted personally to inform someone whose name is redacted from the FBI's release but given the context, was probably in the UK government. According to the FBI records, Mr Kennedy said: ""The British can't afford another disclosure of this kind."" This was presumably a reference to the Profumo and Vassall sex scandals which had shaken the British establishment at that time. War Secretary John Profumo resigned after the disclosure of his affair with Christine Keeler, a young model also involved with a Russian spy. British diplomat John Vassall was caught after years of passing secrets to the Russians, having been blackmailed by the KGB because of his then illegal homosexuality. In due course the Thorpe scandal was to become equally sensational.

"Beijing has been turning islands into military bases China is deploying missiles in the disputed South China Sea to intimidate and coerce its neighbours, US Defence Secretary James Mattis has said. Speaking in Singapore, General Mattis said Beijing's actions called into question its broader goals. A Chinese military official dismissed the comments as ""irresponsible"". Six countries have competing claims in the sea, but tensions have increased in recent years and China has backed its claim with island-building and patrols. Mr Mattis also said the issue of US troops in South Korea was ""not on the table"" at this month's summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. The US wanted complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, he added. South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo also told the Shangri-La Dialogue security summit that US forces in South Korea was a ""separate issue from North Korea's nuclear issue"". There are currently about 28,500 US troops based in South Korea. Trump says summit with Kim is back on What does Kim Jong-un really want? The political gamble of the 21st Century Mr Mattis told the security summit that Beijing had deployed military hardware including anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles and electronic jammers to locations across the South China Sea. ""Despite China's claims to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,"" Gen Mattis said. Why is the South China Sea contentious? China's 'globalised' military power Gen Mattis said the Trump administration wanted a constructive relationship with China but would compete vigorously if necessary. He also said the US recognised that China had a role to play in the region. But speaking at the same conference, China's Lt Gen He Lei said: ""Any irresponsible comments from other countries cannot be accepted."" Beijing's actions were aimed at ""national defence"", he added in quotes reported by AFP. The South China Sea, a key trade route, is subject to overlapping claims by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. China has been building small islands and other maritime features into military facilities there. Last monthChina said it had for the first time landed bombers on Woody Islandin the Paracel Islands, prompting US warnings that it was destabilising the region.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: âItâs a get-to-know-you situationâ Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore on 12 June is back on, the US president says, a week after it was scrapped. Mr Trump made the announcement after talks with a senior North Korean envoy at the White House. The envoy, General Kim Yong-chol, hand-delivered a letter from the North Korean leader to President Trump. Mr Trump at first said the letter was ""very interesting"" but later said he had not yet opened it. He also said the issue of formally ending the Korean War would be on the table in Singapore. The 1950-53 conflict only ended with a truce, not a final peace treaty. Kim Jong-un's right hand man What does Kim Jong-un really want? The political gamble of the 21st Century ""We'll be meeting on June 12th in Singapore. It went very well,"" President Trump told reporters on the White House lawn. ""We've got to know their people very well,"" he added. Mr Trump cautioned that the summit might not achieve a final deal on the North's controversial nuclear programme. This video can not be played US-North Korea: Trump gets an unusually large letter ""I never said it goes in one meeting. I think it's going to be a process, but the relationships are building and that's very positive,"" he said. The historic meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un would be the first between sitting US and North Korean leaders. President Trump has offered to help rebuild the North's economy if it scraps its nuclear weapons. Kim Jong-un says he is committed to ""denuclearisation"" in some form but his precise demands are unclear. 16 May:North Korea says it may pull out of the summit, accusing the US of reckless statements and sinister intentions 24 May:Donald Trump cancels the summit, blaming ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" from the North 26 May:Kim Jong-un and South Korea's Moon Jae-in meet for surprise talksat the demilitarised border between the two countries 1 June:Senior North Korean envoy General Kim Yong-chol delivers a letter from Mr Kim in person at the White House. Mr Trump says the summit on 12 June is back on This video can not be played Singapore has been getting ready for the US-North Korea summit Gen Kim Yong-chol's visit to Washington came a day after he met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York. Mr Pompeo described their talks about denuclearisation ""substantive"". ""President Trump and I believe Chairman Kim is the kind of leader who can make those kinds of decisions. And that in the coming weeks and months, we will have the opportunity to test whether or not this is the case,"" he said. Mr Kim's letter reportedly expresses his interest in meeting without making any significant concessions or threats in regards to denuclearisation,the Wall Street Journal reports,external, citing a foreign government official who was briefed on the contents. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington This is Trump diplomacy, unfolding in real time. If it's not what the world expects, if it's statecraft as we've never seen it before, that's because this is a president unlike any the American people have elected before. From ""fire and fury"" to a relationship ""as good as it's been in a long time"". The summit is on, then it's off, now it's on again. The president, as witnessed by his impromptu 16 minute question-and-answer session with gathered reporters, is basking in the world's spotlight as he conducts these historic negotiations. Passing legislation is hard. Coping with the Russia investigation is infuriating. Welcoming to the White House the ""second most powerful man in North Korea"", as Mr Trump called Kim Yong-chol, is comparatively easy. Even as Mr Trump heralded the progress being made, he was downplaying expectations for the upcoming summit, which he said was never planned to end in some grand signing ceremony. For the moment, it appears the Singapore meeting will be only a first step - a chance for a historic photo-op and a hope for breakthroughs to come. For a president who many thought last year was barrelling toward war, however, that appears more than enough. North Korea has carried out six nuclear tests and numerous tests of ballistic missiles, all the while maintaining a barrage of belligerent rhetoric against its enemies, particularly the US. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on It claims to have developed anuclear weapon small enough to be carried by a long-range missile, although this remains unverified. Previous attempts to negotiate with North Korea have failed, but earlier this year Pyongyang held direct talks with Seoul andthe two Korean leaders held a historic summit in April. With relations thawing, the US has pledged to help rebuild North Korea's economy if it agrees to give up its nuclear weapons. But the US wants denuclearisation first and it is unclear whether Mr Kim will agree to fully abandon his nuclear arsenal. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

"Mr Pammal Ashwin was working at Kettering General Hospital in May 2014 when he injected the patient A hospital consultant is to be suspended from the medical register for nine months for injecting a patient's eye with the wrong form of a drug. Mr Pammal Ashwin admitted using an undiluted form of the drug Ocriplasmin, which should have been diluted, to treat a patient's eye condition at Kettering General Hospital in May 2014. A tribunal was told that the patient later suffered a retinal detachment. It ordered that Mr Ashwin be suspended and his case then reviewed. The Medical Practitioners and Tribunal Service hearing was told that the retinal detachment - when the thin layer at the back of your eye becomes loose - may have been caused by the use of the undiluted drug. The tribunal found that Mr Ashwin had failed to tell the patient he was using the undiluted dose and did not tell the hospital when it investigated the case. Mr Ashwin had no issues with his work before or since the event in 2014, it was told.

"This video can not be played A dedicated team has been formed to log data collected around England More than 400 beaches will be checked weekly in a bid to tackle the ""scourge"" of discarded plastic, the Environment Agency (EA) has said. The new unit will log data from water sampling teams around England about the amount and type of plastic found. It hopes to identify the worst-hit beaches and use its findings to better regulate the problem. More than eight million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year. The damage to marine wildlife was highlighted on the BBC's Blue Planet II, which helped to provoke a range of measures from the government and community groups. The EA's dedicated monitoring team was formed aftera Â£750,000 investmentin tackling plastic pollution was announced in January. Fishing nets and false teeth: Meet the debris hunters Guide: Why is plastic a problem? Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Kirstie Edwards, lead co-ordinator for Plastic Free Falmouth, said: ""After storms and in the summer months there's a huge increase in plastic drink bottles and generic wrappers such as crisps and ice creams. ""We also find a lot of broken-up plastic - fragments of tampon holders, bottle lids, brightly coloured parts of old buckets. ""The biggest problem is that every tide brings new litter and plastic to be cleaned. ""We encourage people to do mini beach cleans as much as they can and use 'the rule of three' - take a minimum of three pieces home. Based in the south west, the team will analyse data collected by its current team ofbathing water samplers.,external Head of the new plastics and sustainability team Bruce Newport said the new initiative gave them ""another level of detail"". ""If we find beaches that are heavily contaminated with plastic we will work with community groups, non-government organisations and we will actually work with local companies. ""Depending what needs to be done we can support or regulate to try and reduce the scourge of plastic which is hitting our beaches causing many many problems,"" he said. Environment agency officers are carrying out the monitoring alongside their water quality sampling More than eight million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year and about 90% of seabirds have eaten it. Mr Newport added: ""Having a clean beach not only is good for wildlife, not only is it good for people who come here - it's good for our economy as well. ""By being responsible with the use of plastics we can achieve that. And having a plastic-free coastline is our ambition."" Checking beaches for plastic pollution.
