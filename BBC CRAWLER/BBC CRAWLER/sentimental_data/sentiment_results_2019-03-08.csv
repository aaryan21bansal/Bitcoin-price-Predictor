"This video can not be played Families of those who died have described the pain they have been through The pilot of a jet that crashed at the Shoreham Airshow killing 11 men has been found not guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. Andrew Hill's ex-military jet exploded in a fireball on the A27 in Sussex on 22 August 2015. The former RAF pilot, 54, denied deliberately beginning a loop manoeuvre despite flying too low and too slowly. Karim Khalil QC, defending, argued Mr Hill had been suffering from ""cognitive impairment"" when the jet crashed. Mr Hill, from Sandon, near Buntingford, Hertfordshire, was also formally acquitted of a count - that was not put in front of the jury - of negligently or recklessly endangering the safety of an aircraft. The Old Bailey jury deliberated for seven hours over three days and there were gasps from the families in the courtroom with many in tears as the verdicts were read out. Shoreham pilot: 'Aviation fuel runs through his veins' Who were the Shoreham air crash victims? Judge Mr Justice Edis told the relatives: ""I am enormously impressed and grateful for the dignified way you have all behaved. ""I can see that you are upset and you are absolutely entitled to be but despite being upset you have behaved in a way which does you great credit."" This video can not be played The Hawker Hunter crashed into A27 in Shoreham In a statement Sue and Phil Grimstone, whose son Matthew died in the crash, said: ""There seems to be no justice for our son Matthew and all 11 men who died in such tragic circumstances. The couple said the case had raised questions about the safety of aerobatic air displays ""when there is now doubt concerning any pilot's ability to avoid becoming cognitively impaired"". They added: ""Matthew had no interest in air shows, he could not have cared less. Knowing he died because an aircraft was being flown for fun, for the entertainment of others makes it even harder to bear."" Oliver Morriss, nephew of victim Mark Reeves, said his family felt ""complete devastation at the most surprising not guilty verdict"". He added: ""We feel that the success of Mr Hill's defence of cognitive impairment could establish a worrying precedent and have far-reaching consequences."" On the steps of the court, Mr Hill read out the names of all 11 victims and said: ""A number of people were injured. I'm truly sorry for the part I played in their deaths and it's they I will remember for the rest of my life."" This video can not be played Pilot Andy Hill acquitted over Shoreham Airshow deaths The court had heard the Hawker Hunter jet ""disintegrated"" upon impact, creating a ""massive fireball"" when it hit the ground. Mr Hill, a British Airways captain at the time, had been performing a manoeuvre known as a bent loop before his jet crashed on to the A27. Prosecutor Tom Kark QC, acknowledged Mr Hill was an experienced pilot but said he had been known to take risks and the jet was ""probably as much as 1,000ft below the height required"" at the top of the loop. The Old Bailey was told that the defendant had a ""cavalier attitude to safety"". But Mr Hill said he took a ""very structured, disciplined approach"" to display flying and sometimes held back from flights he was not comfortable with carrying out. The former RAF instructor claimed he had blacked out in the air, having experienced ""cognitive impairment"" brought on by hypoxia possibly due to the effects of G-force. He ""miraculously escaped"" when the aircraft broke up and he was thrown into a ditch, the jury heard. He suffered head injuries and fractures to his ribs and spine and was placed in an induced coma before being discharged a month later. The prosecution argued Andy Hill was flying too low to complete a manoeuvre while performing at the Shoreham Airshow in 2015 Mr Hill told the Old Bailey he had no memory from three days before the crash to when he woke from his coma and had spent the last three years ""trying to resolve what happened"". In 2017 a report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch found the disaster was caused by pilot error after the plane was too slow and too low during the loop manoeuvre. Rebecca Smith from Irwin Mitchell lawyers, which represents 17 people affected by the crash, including some bereaved families and of the injured, said: ""Attention will now to turn to the inquest where the entirety of the Shoreham Airshow tragedy can be fully examined."" Sarah Stewart, a partner at Stewarts, who represent many of the bereaved families, called for a wider investigation. ""The bereaved families have had to painfully re-live the circumstances of their loved ones' death again and again. ""The families want answers and a verdict will go some way towards that. But it is only one part of the jigsaw."" The organisers of the Shoreham Airshow have denied any responsibility for the crash. Colin Baker, director of the event, said: ""I feel pretty satisfied that what we did in the preparation for the air show and during the air show was all that could be done. ""We very much regret what happened but I really don't think we could have done anything different prior to the accident to avoid it.""

"This video can not be played Jussie Smollett: What Chicago Police say happened US actor Jussie Smollett has been charged by a grand jury in Chicago on 16 counts, accused of falsely claiming to police that he had been the victim of a hate crime. Prosecutors had previously charged him with one count of filing a false report. The 36-year-old African-American actor told police he had been the victim of a homophobic and racist assault. Police say he staged the attack in an attempt to further his acting career. Last month he was suspended from the Empire TV show he starred in. Timeline of events 'I'm the gay Tupac' Sources told NBC and CNN Mr Smollett had apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence. Mr Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack on 29 January. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand. He was charged with making a false statement to police and, on Thursday, a grand jury returned 16 counts of disorderly conduct against him. At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor's bail at $100,000 (Â£76,000). Mr Smollett denies all the charges against him and will appear in court on 16 March. His lawyers have said they will ""mount an aggressive defence"" of Mr Smollett, who they described as ""a young man of impeccable character"". Mr Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago. He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck - a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans. He also claimed the men said ""this is Maga country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"". Officers began to grow suspicious when they were unable to find any footage of the incident, despite reviewing more than 50 surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses. But investigators say they managed to use a ride-sharing app to track and identify two brothers who were filmed near the scene. The men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, flew to Nigeria after the alleged attack. On their return they were held for almost 48 hours. Officials said they were released without charge after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"". One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer, and both had worked as extras on Empire. Police say they have a cheque, signed by Mr Smollett, which showed that he had agreed to pay the brothers $3,500. Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mr Smollett told at least one of the brothers that he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary on the show. According to the Huffington Post, he was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role. In a press conference, Supt Johnson called the alleged scheme ""shameful"", adding: ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?"" He also accused Mr Smollett of taking ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"". Mr Smollett turned himself in shortly afterwards.

"This video can not be played Meghan: Men should not be threatened by equality The Duchess of Sussex said she would like her unborn child to be a feminist, whether they are a girl or a boy. Speaking on a panel to mark International Women's Day, Meghan said she had recently been watching a documentary on feminism. ""One of the things they said during pregnancy was 'I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism',"" she told an audience at King's College London. ""I loved that - boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that's the case."" Meghan and Harry expecting baby Meghan: From actress to duchess She went on to say that ""men can understand that they can be feminists"" and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them. The duchess's comments were made after she was asked about how her baby bump was treating her, to which she replied ""very well"". Meghan was taking part in a discussion organised by the Queen's Commonwealth Trust L-R: Journalist Anne McElvoy (chairwoman); Angeline Murimirwa from the Campaign for Real Education; campaigner Chrisann Jarrett; Meghan; singer Annie Lennox; model Adwoa Aboah; former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard Speaking in a panel discussion of leading feminists and other national figures, Meghan also revealed she does not read newspapers or engage with Twitter to avoid getting ""muddled"" by the ""noise"". She was asked by the chairwoman, Anne McElvoy, senior editor of The Economist, how she responded to newspaper headlines describing her feminism as ""trendy"". The duchess said: ""I don't read anything - it's much safer that way. ""But equally, that's just my own personal preference because I think positive or negative, it can all sort of just feel like noise to a certain extent these days, as opposed to getting muddled with that to focus on the real cause. ""So for me, I think the idea of making the word feminism trendy, that doesn't make any sense to me personally, right? This is something that is going to be part of the conversation forever."" Prince Harry and Meghan are expecting their first baby in spring Others speakers on the panel, which was organised by the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, included singer Annie Lennox and former prime minister of Australia, Julia Gillard. Meghan's participation in the discussion on gender equality came after she was made the trust's new vice-president. The duchess and Prince Harry are expecting their first baby in the spring.

"The US economy created the lowest number of jobs for a year-and-a-half in February, well below forecasts. Just 20,000 new jobs were created last month against expectations of a 180,000 increase, official figures show. It is the lowest growth in non-farm payrolls since September 2017 when employment was affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. However, the small rise followed a sharp increase in new jobs in January, which was revised up to 311,000. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the expectation for 180,000 new positions in February was too high because the figures at the beginning of the year doubled-counted government workers who took second jobs during the US Government shutdown. How much has the shutdown hit the US economy? Trump doesn't understand economics, says former Fed chair He said that average new jobs growth over a three-month period was 186,000 which ""is entirely respectable"". ""Indicators of labour demand have softened a bit but are nothing like weak enough to suggest that the February number is indicative of a new trend; we expect a return to the high 180,000 in March,"" he added. Official data showed that the number of people ending part-time jobs or on temporary leave dropped by 225,000. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics said: ""This decline reflects, in part, the return of federal workers who were furloughed in January due to the partial government shutdown."" The figures also showed that growth in average earnings picked up to an annual rate of 3.4%, from 3.1% the month before, while the unemployment rate fell, dropping to 3.8% from 4% in January. President Donald Trump said rising wages were ""great for the American worker"", adding: ""I don't know if they expected to see it."" US President Donald Trump praised wage growth before departing for Alabama on Friday The construction sector saw the worst performance in February, with employment falling by 31,000 jobs compared with an increase of 53,000 in January. Kully Samra, vice president at Charles Schwab, said that despite the weak job creation last month ""the outlook for the US economy remains strong relative to the rest of the world"". ""The question is whether businesses are becoming more cautious because of weaker economic data and the return of volatility; or is the economy weakening a result of reduced business confidence?,"" he added. However, Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The sharp slowdown in payroll employment growth in February provides further evidence that economic growth has slowed in the first quarter. ""That adds weight to our view that the Fed will not be raising interest rates this year."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 212.81 points, or 0.8%, at 25,260.42. Investors were disappointed by the jobs data and asteep fall in Chinese exports amid a trade war with the US.

"National Beverage Corp makes La Croix drinks The billionaire chief executive of a US firm has been lambasted for comparing managing a soft drinks brand to ""caring for someone who becomes handicapped"". Nick Caporella, the boss of National Beverage Corp. made the comment as he revealed falling quarterly results. He said: ""Brands do not see or hear, so they are at the mercy of their owners or care providers."" But a number of civil rights organisations called his remarks ""ugly"", ""bizarre"" and ""offensive"". Katherine Carroll, policy director at the Center for Disability Rights, said Mr Caporella's statement was ""downright bizarre"", adding that ""it is just another example of people just really getting it wrong about disabled people and how we live"". How to talk about disability without being awkward Full transcript: 'Disabled people make the best entrepreneurs' 'Shopping can be so embarrassing for me' Howard Rosenblum, chief executive at the National Association of the Deaf, said it was unfortunate that Mr Caporella ""would say something so inappropriate, offensive, and misguided"". He said: ""His comment reflects his ignorant and incorrect understanding of people with disabilities, many of whom are highly successful people who are doctors, attorneys, scientists, writers, actors, chief executives, business entrepreneurs, parents, grandparents, and much more. ""Given the economic power of many people with disabilities and their families and loved ones, his comment has dragged down the so-called ""dignity and special character"" of the National Beverage Corporation brand."" A spokesperson for National Beverage, said Mr Caporella's intentions were ""very honourable'. ""What he means is that a person who is handicapped or disabled has a need for tender care and love. He looks at the brand in the same manner."" He added that Mr Caporella, who is worth $2.4bn according to Forbes, ""has long had an affinity for the downtrodden in society"" which is reflected in the businessman's philanthropic work. But Robert Schoenfeld, executive board member at Disabled in Action of Metropolitan New York said: ""I think it was a very poor thing to say, it was a very ugly think to say."" Mr Caporella, who founded National Beverage in 1985, was speaking about the company's LaCroix brand of flavoured sparkling water amid results which showed a near 40% fall in profits to $24.8m and a drop in sales for the three months to 26 January. Mr Caporella said the fall in quarterly sales and profits was a result of ""injustice"". Shares in National Beverage are down 15.79% Last year, a lawsuit claimed that National Beverage's use of ""all natural"" and ""100% natural"" on its LaCroix products was ""intentionally misleading"" because it allegedly uses synthetic chemical ingredients.

"Maradona is in touch with his three children in Cuba Argentina football legend Diego Maradona is to acknowledge paternity of three Cuban children, his lawyer says. This means the 58-year-old World Cup winner, who once denied any children other than with his former wife, is now the official father of eight children. Maradona will travel to Havana to take paternity tests and publicly recognise the children later this year, lawyer Matias Morla said. The children, reportedly from two mothers, will be able to take his name. Maradona spent several years in the country between 2000 and 2005 undergoing treatment for a cocaine habit. He befriended then-President Fidel Castro during his stint in the country and got a tattoo of the leader's face on his leg. Maradona struck up a friendship with the Communist leader during his time in Cuba The former footballer is now working as coach at Mexican club Dorados de Sinaloa. Maradona once denied having any children besides Giannina, 29, and Dalma, 31, both daughters of his ex-wife Claudia VillafaÃ±e, whom he divorced in 2003 after nearly 20 years of marriage. However he has since recognised Diego Junior, 32, and Jana, 22, after court battles with their mothers.

"Scotland's largest teachers' union has called off its planned strike ballot after an improved pay offer was made. The ballot of EIS members was due to get under way on Monday. However, the new offer from the Scottish government was discussed by the union's national council this morning and the union will urge members to accept it. The EIS is calling the development a ""significant success for Scotland's teachers."" Scotland's Education Secretary John Swinney said he had ""looked again"" at the pay offer and decided to ""increase the funding"". The new offer is for: A 3% rise effective from last April A 7% rise this April A further 3% rise next April This represents a compound increase of 13.51% over the course of the three years. The offer means a teacher who has not been promoted could earn more than Â£41,000 by next year -  about Â£5,000 more than they earn just now. The EIS received a letter outlining the new offer this morning ahead of a meeting of its national council. The 11th-hour improvement follows a campaign by the EIS which has continued for more than a year. EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said, ""The EIS launched the Value Education, Value Teachers campaign in January last year, with the aim of securing a fair pay settlement for Scotland's teachers. ""Throughout the campaign, it became increasingly clear that - in addition to pay - teachers also have serious concerns about issues such as the recruitment and retention of teachers, professional development, workload, and the level of support for pupils with Additional Support Needs. ""These issues then became a factor in the ongoing discussions via the SNCT."" Mr Flanagan said the offer also includes; additional commitments aimed at tackling workload supporting teacher professional development and enhancing the teacher leadership programme. He added: ""Taking all of these elements together, it represents a package that the EIS is now recommending to Scotland's teachers. ""This offer represents a significant success for Scotland's teachers, and for Scottish education. It has been secured through strong campaigning under the Value Education, Value Teachers banner, and delivered through the committed collective stand taken by Scotland's teachers. ""By standing together and remaining united, our members have secured a strong deal for Scotland's teachers which will also deliver stability and security for Scottish education."" Education minister Mr Swinney welcomed the union's decision to suspend the ballot. He said: ""The Scottish government and Cosla made a strong offer to teachers which, by a narrow margin, was rejected. Given the importance we place on valuing teachers and improving the attractiveness of the profession, I have looked again at the investment the Scottish government is making."" Mr Swinney believed that the fresh offer would provide the ""stability we need to make the reform Scotland's education system needs and deliver the best possible outcomes for our young people"". The NASUWT union intends to ballot its members on strike action later this month over concerns which include pay and workload. However, because of the size of the EIS, if its members accept the pay offer there would appear to be no possibility of change to this latest offer. By Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland education correspondent Campaigning included a rally in George Square Strike action is the ultimate weapon for any trade union. For professionals like teachers, it can be a particularly difficult step to take. Some in the profession today remember the bitter, long-running teachers dispute of the 1980s all too well - either as young teachers or as pupils. To maintain the analogy of a strike as the nuclear option, some in the profession were clearly hopeful that moving to ""Defcon 1"" - the imminent threat of action - would prove enough to secure an improved pay offer. And so it has proved. Two previous pay offers had previously been described as final. The government and councils clearly pulled out all the stops to avoid a teachers' strike. The Scottish government wants to be judged on education. It knew all too well that few would judge its record on actual education policy if they saw teachers on a picket line and children getting days off school. Both sides will be hoping now that the debate can move back on to education policy and practice - efforts to raise attainment and close the gap between how well children from relatively rich and poor backgrounds do. Genuine disagreements still exist - not least over standardised assessments in Primary 1. Unions will be keen to ensure that efforts to deal with concerns about workload and resourcing are about more than good intent. But after a 14 month campaign, it looks like peace has broken out.

"Nine people were injured when the carriages flew off the rollercoaster and fell 30ft to the ground The owners of a Lanarkshire theme park ride which crashed injuring nine people, have been fined Â£65,000 over health and safety breaches. Seven children were among the injured at M&Ds in Strathclyde Park in June 2016 when the Tsunami rollercoaster derailed at 40mph. Five gondolas plunged 30ft to the ground. M&Ds pleaded guilty to charges relating to the Health and Safety at Work Act at Hamilton Sheriff Court on Friday. The Tsunami never reopened and was dismantled in February 2017 The theme park would have been fined Â£100,000 but for their guilty plea. Sheriff Thomas Millar told the court a ""place of enjoyment and entertainment"" on that day became ""a place of terror"". The charge alleged that M&D Leisure had failed to ensure that the rollercoaster was maintained, in efficient working order and in good repair. It said weld repairs on axles of the passenger cars were inadequate, leading to the failure of the axle suspension on the five-car yellow train. The car came off the track and fell to the ground ""to the danger of the lives of seven children and two adults."" A Health and Safety Executive investigation found that the welding metal and the axle metal were incompatible. HM Inspector of Safety, Martin McMahon said: ""We found nine out of the 10 axles on the Tsunami had been given this weld overlay repair and in the end six of them detached from the ride causing it to crash onto the ground."" The Tsunami was a high-speed rollercoaster in which the gondolas were often inverted After the judgement, Matthew Taylor, a director of M&D's issued a statement. He said: ""My brother Douglas and I have been in business together for more than 50 years and this is the first incident of this type that we've ever been involved in. ""We are devastated as both a family and a business, and our heart goes out to everyone who has been affected by the accident. ""Our customers shape every part of our business and our thoughts have always been with those who were injured and their families. ""We've co-operated fully with the inquiries at every stage to ascertain what caused this accident and how to prevent it happening again in the future. ""Each and every ride within the theme park has always been subject to a daily safety check and annual independent inspection. ""We have now introduced a new, more detailed, maintenance recording system which records any work carried out to ensure that repairs can be traced accurately."" The Tsunami was one of the fastest rides at the park But the father of one of the more seriously hurt children said he was disappointed in the fine. Outside the court, the man - who can't be named because the crash victims are under 18 - spoke to BBC news. He said: ""For a company bragging a turnover of Â£8m to be fined Â£65,000 is disappointing. ""Seeing what my son went through initially and for months and years after, I am bitterly disappointed. ""It's been a hard battle for him and us. When he was in a coma - it was hard to watch our child on a ventilator - and then when he came off it, struggling with his injuries, it was heartbreaking. ""Two years eight months later looking for some sort of justice, I don't think we received that today."" The Health and Safety Executive completed a 15-month investigation into the crash in September 2017. HSE completes probe into M&Ds rollercoaster crash Several victims have received compensation payouts, while others are still in the process of pursuing claims. In October 2017, it emerged M&Ds received a Â£1.4m insurance payout for the closure of the Strathclyde Park site. Nine passengers, most of them children, were on board the inverted rollercoaster when five gondolas detached from their rails at a bend and fell to the ground. Among those who were injured were a 12-year-old boy with chest, abdominal and leg injuries and an 11-year-old boy who had serious arm and hand injuries. The gondola cars came of the rails on the Tsunami rollercoaster The Tsunami, which travelled at up to 40mph through corkscrew turns and loops, never reopened and it was finally dismantled in February 2017. It emerged that an inspector who passed the ride as safe 16 days before the accident had been subsequently banned. M&D's rollercoaster crash: Safety inspector banned The theme park was shut for investigations but a partial reopening was sanctioned just four days after the accident. It was fully reopened to the public just over three weeks later. Robert McCutcheon was one of the first on the scene after the gondolas crashed to the ground. A former paramedic, the 31-year-old from Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Galloway, jumped straight into the aftermath. He told the BBC Scotland news website: ""It was a free-for-all. There was no organisation and no response from staff. ""I went under the cars to a young boy who was in a bad way."" Robert McCutcheon was one of the first on the scene to help when the rollercoaster derailed Mr McCutcheon stayed with an 11-year-old boy whose wrist was snapped. He plugged the bleeding artery in his arm and immobilised his head. But he said the scene was chaos with no co-ordination to the initial rescue efforts. He said: ""At one point some parents at the scene started rocking the collapsed ride to try to free other victims, but didn't realise they were putting the boy at further risk. ""Myself and another man, Ian Holmes, stayed there until everyone was taken to hospital."" Mr McCutcheon expected the theme park to be closed almost immediately. He said: ""I am surprised it has taken this long. I would have expected it to be shut down and M&Ds to face severe consequences regarding health and safety and at the very least heavy financial consequences. ""I have never been back.""

"Police said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"" in the woman's home, including limes stuffed with written curses A 37-year-old mother has been jailed after becoming the first person in the UK to be convicted of female genital mutilation (FGM). The Ugandan woman mutilated her three-year-old daughter at their family home in east London in 2017. She was jailed for 11 years for the FGM and a further two years for indecent images and extreme pornography. Sentencing at the Old Bailey, Mrs Justice Whipple said the act was ""a barbaric and sickening crime"". ""FGM has long been against the law and let's be clear FGM is a form of child abuse"", she added. The mother was born in Uganda but has lived in the UK for a number of years. FGM is banned in both countries, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. The judge said it was not known why, contrary to her culture, the woman inflicted FGM on her child, although witchcraft was a possibility. Spells and curses intended to deter police investigations were found at the woman's home before her trial. During the trial, the woman claimed that in August 2017 her daughter climbed up to get a biscuit and ""fell on metal and it's ripped her private parts"". Medics alerted police to the girl's injuries after they treated her at Whipps Cross Hospital in Leytonstone. The child ""lost a significant amount of blood as a result of the injuries... delivered and inflicted on her"", jurors were told. Includes ""the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" Practised in 30 countries in Africa and some countries in Asia and the Middle East An estimated three million girls and women worldwide are at risk each year About 125 million victims estimated to be living with the consequences It is commonly carried out on young girls, often between infancy and the age of 15 Often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, to prepare a girl or woman for adulthood and marriage and to ensure ""pure femininity"" Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility and increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths Source:World Health Organization,external The woman's former partner, a 43-year-old Ghanaian man, was cleared of involvement in the FGM offence. But he pleaded guilty to two charges of possession of an indecent image of a child and two charges of possessing extreme pornography. Mrs Justice Whipple sentenced him to 11 months in prison, although he has already served his time on remand. While the parents were on bail, police searched the mother's home and said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"". Prosecutor Caroline Carberry QC said two cow tongues were ""bound in wire with nails and a small blunt knife"" embedded in them. Forty limes and other fruit were found containing pieces of paper with names written on them, including those of police officers and a social worker involved in the investigation. Police also found two cow tongues with metal screws in them Sentencing the woman, who cannot be named to protect the victim's identity, the judge said: ""[FGM] is a barbaric practice and a serious crime. It's an offence which targets women, particularly inflicted when they are young and vulnerable."" On the psychological effect on the victim, she told the defendant: ""This is a significant and lifelong burden for her to carry. ""You betrayed her trust in you as her protector."" The case is only the fourth FGM prosecution brought to court in the UK. The previous cases led to acquittals. John Cameron, head of the NSPCC's Childline, said: ""Some cultures consider FGM a necessary part of bringing up a young girl. There may even be pressures for families to conform. ""The truth is it is a horrific form of child abuse and a criminal offence which has no place in today's society. ""If we want to protect girls from this dangerous and potentially life changing practice we need to talk about FGM, encourage people to seek help and advice and report any concerns if they believe a child has been cut or is about to be."" The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for FGM, Commander Ivan Balhatchet, said: ""Female genital mutilation is a barbaric and violent crime - a violation of human rights - often with lifelong consequences, committed by the people children should be able to trust the most."" Lynette Woodrow, of the CPS, said: ""FGM is an extremely serious form of child abuse and today's sentence underlines that fact. ""We hope that this conviction encourages those who have experienced FGM, or have suspicions about FGM offences, to come forward knowing that we will treat everyone with sensitivity and respect.""

"This video can not be played PM Theresa May: ""Now is the moment for us to act"" Theresa May has asked the EU for ""one more push"" to get her Brexit deal through Parliament and warned that, if it fails, ""we may never leave at all"". The prime minister said the UK had tabled ""serious"" proposals to resolve the deadlock over the Irish backstop. Warning of a ""moment of crisis"" if the deal was rejected again, the PM told EU leaders: ""Let's get it done."" The EU said it would give ""legal force"" to assurances already made that the UK could not be stuck in a customs union. Setting out the EU's position on Twitter, chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""not interested in the blame game"" and talks would continue over the weekend. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said what the EU was offering amounted to a ""legal beefing-up of existing promises"". Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and the DUP, the party Mrs May's government relies on for a majority in Parliament, were both dismissive of Mr Barnier's proposal. Mr Barclaytweeted,external: ""With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments. The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides"" While Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of the DUP, said Mr Barnier's proposal regarding the backstop ""disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity"" of the UK, and it was neither ""realistic nor sensible"". He said the EU's proposal ""demonstrates that they have a one-sided approach and a lack of understanding about the divisions in Northern Ireland"". The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Deadline looms as UK pushes for Brexit deal No breakthrough in Brexit talks, says EU MPs will vote for a second time on the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the EU on Tuesday - after it wasdefeated by a historic marginin a Commons vote in January. If they reject it again, they will get the option of either leaving without a deal or delaying the exit date. In a speech to a green energy firm in Lincolnshire, Mrs May said she understood the ""genuine concerns"" about the backstop but appealed to MPs to recognise that the deal as a whole respected the 2016 referendum result and would ensure the UK's long-term prosperity. ""Back it and the UK will leave the EU,"" she said. ""Reject it and no-one knows what will happen. We may not leave the EU for many months. We may leave without the protections a deal provides, we may never leave at all."" It was in neither side's interest to prolong the uncertainty by ""carry on arguing"" about Brexit, she said, claiming any delay beyond 29 March only risked ""creating new problems"". ""It needs one more push to address the specific concerns of our Parliament,"" she said. ""So let's not hold back and do what is necessary for MPs to back the deal. ""Because if MPs reject the deal, nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis."" She suggested the British people, to whom Brexit ""belonged"", had ""moved on"" and ""are ready for this to be settled"", adding: ""Everyone now wants to get it done."" But former Conservative minister Dominic Grieve, who backs a referendum to endorse the terms of Brexit, said it was ""hard to see"" how Parliament would agree to the current deal. Speaking at the Scottish Labour conference, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister sounded ""desperate"" in her speech. ""If she cannot get her botched Brexit deal through Parliament next week, it will represent an unprecedented failure in British political history. ""The utter mess the government has made of the Brexit negotiations, and their reckless abandon when it comes to people's jobs and livelihoods, is absolutely unforgiveable. ""Having already failed once to get her deal through, I want to make it clear to the PM that if she fails again, it will be the end of the road for her deal."" The SNP said the deal on offer was ""fundamentally flawed"" and would damage the Scottish economy. ""Theresa May must stop passing the buck and take personal responsibility for the Brexit crisis created as a result of her own intransigence,"" said its Westminster leader Ian Blackford. Thefirst Commons vote, in January, saw the deal rejected by 432 votes to 202, the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. Mrs May is seeking legally enforceable changes to the backstop - a controversial insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - but there have been few visible signs of progress. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Leading Brexiteers are looking for reassurances that the backstop - which would see the UK aligned with EU customs rules until the two sides' future relationship is agreed or alternative arrangements worked out - will not endure indefinitely. On Friday the EU said it was prepared to include a number of existing commitments relating to the application of the backstop in a legally-binding document. Michel Barnier tweeted that the UK ""will not be forced into [a] customs union against its will"" as it could choose to exit the proposed ""single customs territory"" on its own. But Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs territory, subject to many of its rules and regulations - something the government has previously said would threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK. There will also be a reminder that the UK can suspend parts of the backstop if an independent arbitration panel rules that the EU is not behaving in good faith. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was ""not really a concession"" as the suggestion that Great Britain could leave the backstop - and become free to diverge from EU rules - while leaving Northern Ireland behind, had already been rejected. Any extension to the Article 50 process, under which the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, would need the unanimous approval of the EU. Two former prime ministers, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, have called for a delay of a year to allow for a ""public consultation"" on the way ahead and to ensure an orderly exit. But Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against any delay, tellingNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast: ""Wherever we are, and I very much hope we land it with a deal, but if we don't get a deal and we exit without a deal, Britain will succeed and thrive - I don't have a moment's doubt about that. ""But we need to deliver Brexit and ensure that's it's done. I personally believe 29th March is the best day for making sure that is delivered upon.""

"The US economy created the lowest number of jobs for a year-and-a-half in February, well below forecasts. Just 20,000 new jobs were created last month against expectations of a 180,000 increase, official figures show. It is the lowest growth in non-farm payrolls since September 2017 when employment was affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. However, the small rise followed a sharp increase in new jobs in January, which was revised up to 311,000. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the expectation for 180,000 new positions in February was too high because the figures at the beginning of the year doubled-counted government workers who took second jobs during the US Government shutdown. How much has the shutdown hit the US economy? Trump doesn't understand economics, says former Fed chair He said that average new jobs growth over a three-month period was 186,000 which ""is entirely respectable"". ""Indicators of labour demand have softened a bit but are nothing like weak enough to suggest that the February number is indicative of a new trend; we expect a return to the high 180,000 in March,"" he added. Official data showed that the number of people ending part-time jobs or on temporary leave dropped by 225,000. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics said: ""This decline reflects, in part, the return of federal workers who were furloughed in January due to the partial government shutdown."" The figures also showed that growth in average earnings picked up to an annual rate of 3.4%, from 3.1% the month before, while the unemployment rate fell, dropping to 3.8% from 4% in January. President Donald Trump said rising wages were ""great for the American worker"", adding: ""I don't know if they expected to see it."" US President Donald Trump praised wage growth before departing for Alabama on Friday The construction sector saw the worst performance in February, with employment falling by 31,000 jobs compared with an increase of 53,000 in January. Kully Samra, vice president at Charles Schwab, said that despite the weak job creation last month ""the outlook for the US economy remains strong relative to the rest of the world"". ""The question is whether businesses are becoming more cautious because of weaker economic data and the return of volatility; or is the economy weakening a result of reduced business confidence?,"" he added. However, Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The sharp slowdown in payroll employment growth in February provides further evidence that economic growth has slowed in the first quarter. ""That adds weight to our view that the Fed will not be raising interest rates this year."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 212.81 points, or 0.8%, at 25,260.42.

"Manning was found guilty of leaking thousands of military documents Former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has been jailed for refusing to testify before an investigation into Wikileaks. A Virginia judge ordered her taken into custody until the grand jury's work is finished or she decides to testify. Manning said she shared everything she knows during her court-martial. Manning was found guilty in 2013 of charges including espionage for leaking secret military files to Wikileaks, but her sentence was commuted. Manning, 31, told US District Judge Claude Hilton that she would ""accept whatever you bring upon me"", but would not testify,the Associated Press reported,external. Her lawyers had reportedly asked that she be confined at home due to medical issues, but the judge said US Marshals would address her care needs.

"Manning was found guilty of leaking thousands of military documents Former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has been jailed for refusing to testify before an investigation into Wikileaks. A Virginia judge ordered her taken into custody until the grand jury's work is finished or she decides to testify. Manning said she shared everything she knows during her court-martial. Manning was found guilty in 2013 of charges including espionage for leaking secret military files to Wikileaks, but her sentence was commuted. Manning, 31, told US District Judge Claude Hilton that she would ""accept whatever you bring upon me"", but would not testify,the Associated Press reported,external. Her lawyers had reportedly asked that she be confined at home due to medical issues, but the judge said US Marshals would address her care needs. US prosecutors have been investigating Wikileaks for years, and in November prosecutors inadvertently revealed possible charges against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, in court documents from a separate case. On Friday, Manning said in a statement: ""I will not comply with this, or any other grand jury."" ""Imprisoning me for my refusal to answer questions only subjects me to additional punishment for my repeatedly-stated ethical objections to the grand jury system."" Allow Twitter content?

""Chelsea gave voluminous testimony during her court martial. She has stood by the truth of her prior statements, and there is no legitimate purpose to having her rehash them before a hostile grand jury."" Manning was arrested in Iraq in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos and diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy website. While Manning said she only did so to spark debates about  foreign policy, US officials said the leak put lives at risk. She was sentenced to 35 years after being found guilty of 20 charges related to the leak, but only served seven before former President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017. Her sentence was the longest given for a leak in US history. Mr Obama said it was ""disproportionate"" to her crimes. Republicans criticised the Democratic president's decision at the time. Then-Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan said Mr Obama had set ""a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won't be held accountable"",the New York Times reported.,external President Donald Trump has called Manning an ""ungrateful traitor"" who ""should never have been released from prison"".

"A no-deal Brexit threatens billions of pounds of chemical imports, the head of the Chemical Industries Association, Stephen Elliott, has warned. He says secondary legislation, needed to copy EU regulations into UK law, contains ""significant gaps"". The loophole could halt UK imports of chemicals by EU-registered companies from countries outside the EU, he says. ""Put simply, the drugs don't work, the cars don't run and the planes don't fly without chemicals and chemistry."" Unless the law is changed, he says, the import of ""billions of pounds worth of chemicals,"" used across UK manufacturing, would have to come to a sudden halt if the UK left the EU with no deal on 29 March. In a statement, the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the government was working closely with industry stakeholders to ensure they are prepared in the event of a no-deal Brexit: ""Our approach will maintain regulatory standards, provide continuity for business and reduce the risk of interruption in supply chains,"" it said. The UK imports roughly Â£33bn of chemicals from the EU every year, and about Â£27bn from the rest of the world. Part of the problem is the huge amount of work that needs to be done, and the speed with which legislation is being pushed through parliament as a result. How ready is UK government for no deal? Brexit study warns over chemical industry ""I think the average politician is not one hundred per cent across all the details of where the gaps are, so it's left to business to pick up the pieces,"" says Allie Renison, who heads Europe and Trade Policy at the Institute of Directors. There is plenty of expertise in the system, Ms Renison adds, but civil servants are trying to create entire regulatory systems that have not existed before. ""Taking the chemicals regulatory framework as an example, that's a big change that no-one has any experience of doing, and the government is in a rush to get it all passed before Brexit day."" The uncertainty in the political process has percolated down through the industry. At Robinson Brothers, a 150-year-old chemicals company in West Bromwich, the managing director Adrian Hanrahan struggles to put a figure on the amount of money he has had to spend to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. ""But,"" he says, ""if you put a number on time, it's been hellishly expensive."" An enormous of amount of time has been spent on the administration and paperwork of preparing for no deal. ""We could employ ten people to keep us on the straight and narrow,"" Mr Hanrahan says, ""but we're a small company, and it's quite difficult."" Robinson Brothers has also spent hundreds of thousands of pounds stockpiling extra supplies of the odorant that gives gas its distinctive smell. The company normally holds six weeks stock, but it is increasing that to four months. Brexit basics: What is the backstop? ""You can't distribute gas without it,"" Mr Hanrahan says, and ""networks are panicking."" ""We've got twitchy as well,"" he says, ""because we're under contract to supply, and we want to make sure we fulfil our obligations."" Everyone in the industry is determined to provide continuity of supply of all the chemicals on which the UK depends, but the Chemicals Industry Association is worried about disruption if some imports can't take place.

"Shamima Begum with her third child Jerrah, who died on Thursday The baby son of Shamima Begum - who fled London to join the Islamic State group - has died, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces has said. The group, which runs the camp where the teenager has been living, confirmed the death on Friday. The baby died of pneumonia, according to a medical certificate. He was less than three weeks old. A UK government spokesman said the death of any child was ""tragic and deeply distressing for the family"". The spokesman said the government had consistently advised against travelling to Syria and would ""continue to do whatever we can to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and travelling to dangerous conflict zones"". Ms Begum left the UK in 2015 with two friends and was found in a Syrian refugee camp in mid-February. She wanted to return to Britain but was stripped of her citizenship. Her husband, a Dutch IS fighter called Yago Riedijk, is being held at a nearby prison and has been informed of the baby's death. Why countries face a dilemma over IS children Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? What was life like for the IS couple? A paramedic working for the Kurdish Red Crescent in the camp told the BBC that the baby, called Jarrah, had been suffering from breathing difficulties. He was taken to a doctor on Thursday morning before being transferred to hospital, along with his mother, but died at 13:30 local time that day, the medical worker added. Ms Begum has since returned to the camp and her child was buried there yesterday. Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, east London, in 2015 to join the Islamic State group in Syria Speaking to the BBC before it was confirmed that the baby had died, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Sadly there are probably many children, obviously perfectly innocent, who have been born in this war zone. ""I have nothing but sympathy for the children that have been dragged into this. This is a reminder of why it is so, so dangerous for anyone to be in this war zone."" Ms Begum, 19, gave birth to her son last month, shortly after being tracked down by a journalist in a Syrian refugee camp. She had reportedly left Baghuz - IS's last stronghold. Ms Begum said she had previously lost two other children and named her newborn son Jarrah after her firstborn. This video can not be played ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" As her child was born before she was deprived of UK citizenship by the Home Office, the baby would still be considered British. Mr Javidpreviously saidthat the revocation of Ms Begum's citizenship would not apply to her son, explaining: ""Children should not suffer, so if a parent does lose their British citizenship it does not affect the rights of their child."" The lawyer representing the family of Ms Begum, Tasnime Akunjee,also confirmed,externalthe death. Inan interview with the BBCafter the birth of Jarrah, Ms Begum said she did not regret travelling to Syria - although she added that she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She also said that she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK After Ms Begum was stripped of her citizenship,her family wroteto the home secretary to say they planned to challenge the decision and asked for assistance to bring her baby to the UK. Earlier this week, Mr Akunjeetweeted a screenshot of the reply,externalthat they had received from the Home Office. It told them that the possibility of bringing the baby to the UK was a matter for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and that they would need permission from Ms Begum. The FCO is obliged to consider requests for consular assistance, the letter added. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said it might have been possible for the government to get the baby out of Syria, although that could have been ""politically difficult"". ""The government's position that it's impossible to go and get people out of these camps because it's too dangerous is repeatedly shown to be not entirely accurate, because journalists are able to get to these camps relatively safely. ""Working with the Red Crescent there for example, it should be possible to go and get people from the camps if there was a political will."" How many IS foreign fighters are left? Tales from inside the chaos left by IS Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent and friend of Ms Begum's family, told BBC Newsnight: ""We've failed, as a country, to safeguard the child. ""This was an entirely avoidable death of a British citizen. The family reached out to the Home Office, requested help, the Home Office sent a reply saying you've come to the wrong department. ""There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. I think it's shocking how the home secretary has treated this situation."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott also criticised the actions of the Home Office.She tweeted:,external""It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane."" Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK four years ago Kirsty McNeill, head of policy, advocacy and campaigns at the charity Save the Children, said ""all children associated with IS are victims of the conflict and must be treated as such"". She added: ""It is possible the death of this baby boy and others could have been avoided. The UK and other countries of origin must take responsibility for their citizens inside north-east Syria.""

"Andy Hill was known as ""The Prof"" by colleagues at BA and the RAF Andrew Hill has been cleared of 11 counts of manslaughter after crashing an eight-tonne jet on to a busy road in a failed aerobatic loop. Who is the pilot at the centre of the deadliest air show disaster in Britain in more than 60 years? Eighteen months before Andy Hill crashed an ex-military jet and killed 11 men outside the Shoreham Airshow, the former RAF and British Airways pilot's aerobatic prowess featured in an episode of ITV drama Midsomer Murders. His home-built plane simulated an out-of-control dive, in which the pilot narrowly avoided a crowd of spectators after pushing his aircraft to the limit. An air traffic controller warned the fictional pilot: ""You are headed for the crowds."" It would prove to be a tragic foreshadowing. When the 1950s Hawker Hunter struck queuing traffic on 22 August 2015, it became the deadliest air show accident in Britain since31 people lost their lives at Farnborough in 1952,external. For Mr Hill, who miraculously escaped with his life after being thrown from the cockpit, it was a dark chapter in a decades-long love affair with flying. ""He has aviation fuel running through his veins,"" said Sean Maffett, an air show commentator who regularly worked with Mr Hill. ""He is an extraordinary man, there is no question about it."" This video can not be played Shoreham Airshow pilot simulated mayday flight Andrew Grenville Hill, who was born in March 1964, was educated at the prestigious Tonbridge School in Kent and began his flying career aged 17 when he took to the skies as part of a Royal Navy scholarship. A little over three years later, in 1984, he joined the RAF, fresh from the University Air Squadron at Cambridge University, where he had studied computer science at Christ's College. His record shows him to be among the most skilled of his peers and, in his own words, he was ""creamed off the top"" to fly a Harrier jump jet - viewed as one of the most difficult planes to master. ""The Harrier Force was the top of the pile - that's where the best guys went,"" said Bob Marston, a former Harrier flying instructor and RAF pilot of more than 40 years, and the author of Harrier Boys. ""They have to have the best physical co-ordination to master the aeroplane and they need workload capacity to be able to multitask."" Stationed in West Germany in the final throes of the Cold War, his days would likely have been taken up flying training drills from camouflaged launch sites, preparing to strike ""Soviet tanks coming en masse over the border from East Germany"", Mr Marston said. Mr Hill flew the Harrier jet during his time in the RAF Mr Hill later flew preventative sorties out of Incirlik, Turkey, as part of the northern Iraq no-fly zone intended to protect Iraqi Kurds from Saddam Hussein's forces after the First Gulf War. Within three years of joining the RAF, he had qualified to instruct new pilots in the use of the Jet Provost and went on to teach basic flying skills to new recruits at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire. However, he did not only excel in the air. Combining his twin passions of computing and aviation, Mr Hill developed a digital version of the Harrier's operating manual that was cleared for use by the MoD. ""That was an exceptional piece of work,"" said Maj George Bacon, who flew for both the RAF and the Army Air Corps in a career spanning more than four decades. Shoreham Airshow pilot acquitted over deaths 'As soon as I wake up every day I miss him' Shoreham pilot in TV mayday flight Mr Hill was an ""outstandingly talented pilot and he is of course a very intelligent man as well,"" he said. ""It probably makes him a little more introvert than the average... probably verging on the nerdy."" This sideline in computer programming was presumably the source of his nickname, ""The Prof"", that had its origins in the RAF but would follow him into his commercial career with British Airways, which he joined in 1996, after a year with Virgin. He was promoted to captain six years later, flying passenger jets on both short and long-haul flights around the world. Mr Hill captained an Airbus jetliner for British Airways For Mr Hill, aviation was more than a day job. In 2003, he began once again to pilot the Jet Provost, flying a former military model from an airfield in North Weald, Essex, and soon began instructing civilian pilots. In late 2005, together with his wife Ellen, a fellow BA pilot, he embarked on a self-build project, assembling a single-engine plane in the double garage of their home. The couple documented their progress on a now-deleted website, uploading stage-by-stage photos as they assembled the parts of the Van's RV8, which were shipped from the manufacturer in Oregon. Having completed the plane, which bore the registration tag ""G-Hilz"" on its wing, in October 2007, Mr Hill regularly flew from his Hertfordshire farmhouse, using it to commute to North Weald Airfield. BBC News has learned that he took off and landed on a 500-metre grass field next to his home near Sandon. The RV8Tors garnered fans with their close-quarters aerobatic displays In 2008, he obtained permission from the Civil Aviation Authority to perform aerobatic displays in the home-built plane. With experienced display pilot Alister Kay, he launched a two-man formation flying team, known as the RV8Tors, a punning portmanteau of ""RV8"" and ""aviators"". The pair flew their matching planes at air shows and weddings, describing their ""daredevil"" performances as ""thrilling and unforgettable"". By 2012, they were estimated to have flown in front of nearly three million people. The duo's fast-paced formations picked up a devout following on the air show circuit and they became known for their signature finale, a smoke-trail heart. Air show regulars were among the more than 1,900 people to join a Facebook group, entitled Support for Andy Hill, in the days after the crash. Alongside supportive messages, which continued throughout the trial, members of the group sent cards to the Hills' home address and even posed beside a Hawker Hunter holding a banner that read ""Get well soon, Andy Hill"" three months after the crash. Andy Hill's self-built plane simulated an out-of-control flight on ITV's Midsomer Murders Mr Hill had begun to fly the Hawker Hunter with a display group called Team Viper in 2011. The outfit was led by Dan Arlett, who was described at Mr Hill's trial as one of the RAF's most experienced fighter pilots who now helps prepare the next generation of frontline airman by posing as hostile aircraft in simulated dogfights. Giving evidence during the trial, Mr Arlett, an RAF squadron leader, said Mr Hill was ""probably the most diligent of all the team"". He told the jury that air show pilots flew well-drilled displays, within the confines of their abilities. ""You are not showcasing yourself,"" he said. ""You are showcasing the aircraft."" The Hawker Hunter, seen here during the Aden Emergency in 1967, flew in conflicts throughout the second half of the 1900s So, why does a commercial airline pilot, who has unlimited access to a plane that can take off and land on a personal airstrip, spend his weekends flying public displays? ""Going to air shows is quite a lot of hassle,"" said Mr Maffet, who is known as the official commentator of the Vulcan bomber. ""It's hard work and there is no money in it. I think the fascination with flying is such that people do get the bug. ""They can do this extraordinary stuff that most of us mere mortals can't begin to understand. I think that's what it is that drives them on."" The two weeks before the crash demonstrate Hill's dedication, performing eight displays at five different air shows. In the 90 days before, he flew in 33 displays and practice displays. While he was renowned among air show fans for his dazzling aerobatics, he was known for more mundane reasons to his BA colleagues, who preserved his military nickname, The Prof. Showing technical savvy first displayed when he digitised the Harrier's manual, Mr Hill designed a software package that allowed BA pilots to automatically book their desired shifts. Known as EasyBid, it was used by more than 1,900 pilots at its peak. Mr Hill first displayed a Hawker Hunter with Team Viper Catherine Burton, the most experienced female BA captain at the time of her retirement in 2017, said that, as a result of the software, he was more widely known than a typical pilot. ""At one point, I'd guess at least 75% of our pilots were his customers,"" she said. ""He was well-liked for his excellent customer service in the software line."" But the evidence of the Crown Prosecution Service was at odds with the picture of the conscientious and scholarly pilot. During the trial, prosecutors pointed to previous air shows at which Mr Hill allegedly infringed rules, withone display drawn to a halt over safety fears,external. He was, the court heard,""reckless"" and ""cavalier"". Mr Hill denied allegations that, during the 2015 Shoreham display, heknowingly committed to the diveand engaged the plane's ""flaps"" in an attempt tocomplete a tighter loop, instead of abandoning the manoeuvre when it became clear he was too low. So, with all his experience and technical knowledge, did Mr Hill believe he could get away with what, to most pilots, would appear impossible? Mr Bacon doesn't think so.

Mr Bacon, who has kept in regular touch with Mr Hill since he came out of a coma in September 2015, said he had been living in a ""period of purgatory"".

"Shamima Begum with her third child Jerrah, who died on Thursday The baby son of Shamima Begum - who fled London to join the Islamic State group - has died, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces has said. The group, which runs the camp where the teenager has been living, confirmed the death on Friday. The baby died of pneumonia, according to a medical certificate. He was less than three weeks old. A UK government spokesman said the death of any child was ""tragic and deeply distressing for the family"". The spokesman said the government had consistently advised against travelling to Syria and would ""continue to do whatever we can to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and travelling to dangerous conflict zones"". Ms Begum left the UK in 2015 with two friends and was found in a Syrian refugee camp in mid-February. She wanted to return to Britain but was stripped of her citizenship. Her husband, a Dutch IS fighter called Yago Riedijk, is being held at a nearby prison and has been informed of the baby's death. Why countries face a dilemma over IS children Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? What was life like for the IS couple? A paramedic working for the Kurdish Red Crescent in the camp told the BBC that the baby, called Jarrah, had been suffering from breathing difficulties. He was taken to a doctor on Thursday morning before being transferred to hospital, along with his mother, but died at 13:30 local time that day, the medical worker added. Ms Begum has since returned to the camp and her child was buried there yesterday. Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, east London, in 2015 to join the Islamic State group in Syria Speaking to the BBC before it was confirmed that the baby had died, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Sadly there are probably many children, obviously perfectly innocent, who have been born in this war zone. ""I have nothing but sympathy for the children that have been dragged into this. This is a reminder of why it is so, so dangerous for anyone to be in this war zone."" Ms Begum, 19, gave birth to her son last month, shortly after being tracked down by a journalist in a Syrian refugee camp. She had reportedly left Baghuz - IS's last stronghold. Ms Begum said she had previously lost two other children and named her newborn son Jarrah after her firstborn. This video can not be played ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" As her child was born before she was deprived of UK citizenship by the Home Office, the baby would still be considered British. Mr Javidpreviously saidthat the revocation of Ms Begum's citizenship would not apply to her son, explaining: ""Children should not suffer, so if a parent does lose their British citizenship it does not affect the rights of their child."" The lawyer representing the family of Ms Begum, Tasnime Akunjee,also confirmed,externalthe death. Inan interview with the BBCafter the birth of Jarrah, Ms Begum said she did not regret travelling to Syria - although she added that she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She also said that she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK After Ms Begum was stripped of her citizenship,her family wroteto the home secretary to say they planned to challenge the decision and asked for assistance to bring her baby to the UK. Earlier this week, Mr Akunjeetweeted a screenshot of the reply,externalthat they had received from the Home Office. It told them that the possibility of bringing the baby to the UK was a matter for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and that they would need permission from Ms Begum. The FCO is obliged to consider requests for consular assistance, the letter added. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said it might have been possible for the government to get the baby out of Syria, although that could have been ""politically difficult"". ""The government's position that it's impossible to go and get people out of these camps because it's too dangerous is repeatedly shown to be not entirely accurate, because journalists are able to get to these camps relatively safely. ""Working with the Red Crescent there for example, it should be possible to go and get people from the camps if there was a political will."" How many IS foreign fighters are left? Tales from inside the chaos left by IS Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent and friend of Ms Begum's family, told BBC Newsnight: ""We've failed, as a country, to safeguard the child. ""This was an entirely avoidable death of a British citizen. The family reached out to the Home Office, requested help, the Home Office sent a reply saying you've come to the wrong department. ""There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. I think it's shocking how the home secretary has treated this situation."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott also criticised the actions of the Home Office.She tweeted:,external""It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane."" Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK four years ago Kirsty McNeill, head of policy, advocacy and campaigns at the charity Save the Children, said ""all children associated with IS are victims of the conflict and must be treated as such"". She added: ""It is possible the death of this baby boy and others could have been avoided. The UK and other countries of origin must take responsibility for their citizens inside north-east Syria.""

"Cemeren Yilmaz, 16, suffered massive internal injuries, a fractured skull and brain damage, a court heard The murder of a 16-year-old boy at the hands of a rival gang was filmed on Snapchat, a court has heard. Cemeren Yilmaz died following two cardiac arrests and brain damage after an attack in the Ashmead Road area of Bedford in September, a jury was told. He had told his brother he expected to be attacked by rival gang members, St Albans Crown Court heard. Aaron Miller, 20, of Tavistock Street, Bedford, and three 15-year-olds, who cannot be named, deny murder. Opening the case, Prosecutor Stuart Trimmer QC said the background to the case concerned the ""hostility"" between two rival Bedford gangs. He told the jury Cemeren met up with friends in Ashmead Road on 16 September, and at about 21:00 BST ran towards a group including one of the 15-year-old defendants, causing them to flee. Cemeren was seen later running away and clutching a bag, Mr Trimmer said. This may have caused the 15-year-old boy and his co-defendants ""to exact revenge,"" the QC suggested. Cemeren Yilmaz died the day after being stabbed, a jury was told After 22:00 Cemeren and Mr Miller exchanged punches and then the 15-year-old who had earlier run from the scene joined in the attack on Cemeren, Mr Trimmer said. The jury was told the pair were part of a group who chased Cemeren, who then fell to the pavement having been tripped or fallen. ""The Crown say they both aimed vicious kicks towards Cemeren, before the 15-year-old produces a knife and bends down and thrusts it towards Cemeren,"" he said. Cemeren stabbed Mr Miller in the back and ran away before being caught again and attacked by the pair while lying on the grass, the court heard. Mr Miller and the 15-year-old then made off and the other two 15-year-old defendants turned up with a hammer, using it on Cemeren as well as kicking him, and one of them recorded a Snapchat video of the attack on a mobile phone, the jury was told. Mr Trimmer said it was the combination of the two attacks that caused the death of Cemeren, who died in hospital the following day. The trial continues.

"A no-deal Brexit threatens billions of pounds of chemical imports, the head of the Chemical Industries Association, Stephen Elliott, has warned. He says secondary legislation, needed to copy EU regulations into UK law, contains ""significant gaps"". The loophole could halt UK imports of chemicals by EU-registered companies from countries outside the EU, he says. ""Put simply, the drugs don't work, the cars don't run and the planes don't fly without chemicals and chemistry."" Unless the law is changed, he says, the import of ""billions of pounds worth of chemicals,"" used across UK manufacturing, would have to come to a sudden halt if the UK left the EU with no deal on 29 March. In a statement, the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the government was working closely with industry stakeholders to ensure they are prepared in the event of a no-deal Brexit: ""Our approach will maintain regulatory standards, provide continuity for business and reduce the risk of interruption in supply chains,"" it said. The UK imports roughly Â£33bn of chemicals from the EU every year, and about Â£27bn from the rest of the world. Part of the problem is the huge amount of work that needs to be done, and the speed with which legislation is being pushed through parliament as a result. How ready is UK government for no deal? Brexit study warns over chemical industry ""I think the average politician is not one hundred per cent across all the details of where the gaps are, so it's left to business to pick up the pieces,"" says Allie Renison, who heads Europe and Trade Policy at the Institute of Directors. There is plenty of expertise in the system, Ms Renison adds, but civil servants are trying to create entire regulatory systems that have not existed before. ""Taking the chemicals regulatory framework as an example, that's a big change that no-one has any experience of doing, and the government is in a rush to get it all passed before Brexit day."" The uncertainty in the political process has percolated down through the industry. At Robinson Brothers, a 150-year-old chemicals company in West Bromwich, the managing director Adrian Hanrahan struggles to put a figure on the amount of money he has had to spend to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. ""But,"" he says, ""if you put a number on time, it's been hellishly expensive."" An enormous of amount of time has been spent on the administration and paperwork of preparing for no deal. ""We could employ ten people to keep us on the straight and narrow,"" Mr Hanrahan says, ""but we're a small company, and it's quite difficult."" Robinson Brothers has also spent hundreds of thousands of pounds stockpiling extra supplies of the odorant that gives gas its distinctive smell. The company normally holds six weeks stock, but it is increasing that to four months. Brexit basics: What is the backstop? ""You can't distribute gas without it,"" Mr Hanrahan says, and ""networks are panicking."" ""We've got twitchy as well,"" he says, ""because we're under contract to supply, and we want to make sure we fulfil our obligations."" Everyone in the industry is determined to provide continuity of supply of all the chemicals on which the UK depends, but the Chemicals Industry Association is worried about disruption if some imports can't take place.

"This video can not be played Karen Bradley says she's ""devastated"" to think she made pain worse for Troubles victims' families Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has described a meeting with the families of some victims of the Troubles as ""humbling"". On Friday she met relatives of people killed by security forces and apologised for controversial remarks she made about the Troubles this week. She told MPs on Wednesday thatdeaths caused by security forces in Northern Ireland were ""not crimes"". The sister of a man who was shot dead by the Army has called for her to quit. Bradley 'to deliver for those she hurt' Is NI secretary running out of road? This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Frances Meehan,whose brother Michael Donnelly was shot with a plastic bulletin 1981, said Mrs Bradley's position was ""untenable"". She was one of the people who met Mrs Bradley on Friday, as part of a delegation from the victims' group Relatives for Justice. After the meetings, Mrs Bradley said she was ""grateful"" to the families for giving her the ""opportunity to apologise personally for the offence and hurt"" that her comments had caused. ""It was humbling to listen to each of them and their personal and deeply moving stories,"" she added. ""I heard about the hurt and suffering endured over many years, about the experiences of those whose family members died at the hands of the security forces. ""The families I met today referred to unarmed civilians and 82 children who lost their lives in incidents involving the security forces."" Frances Meehan says Karen Bradley's position as Northern Ireland secretary is ""untenable"" But Ms Meehan said the Northern Ireland's secretary apology was ""not good enough for someone who is meant to represent the interests of Northern Ireland at the British cabinet"". ""It is not acceptable that Karen Bradley remains in her post and we are calling again for her to resign,"" she added. Her comments come after relatives of 10 people killed in west Belfast during the Troubles rejected an offer to meet the Northern Ireland secretary. Those who died at Ballymurphy were shot deadshortly after the introduction of internment. Internment was introduced in August 1971 against a backdrop of escalating violence and increased bombings in Northern Ireland. The new law gave the authorities the power to imprison people without trial. An inquest into their deaths has been taking place in Belfast since November. In a statement late on Thursday night, the Ballymurphy victims' families said they had been requesting a meeting with Mrs Bradley since she became the Northern Ireland secretary in January last year. ""Karen Bradley hasn't even replied to these requests,"" they said. The relatives of those killed at Ballymurphy in 1971 have called for Karen Bradley to resign PÃ¡draig Ã'Muirigh, a solicitor for the families, said he had been instructed by his clients to contact the attorney general about ""potential contempt issues that might arise"" from her comments. Ms Meehan said she understood the Ballymurphy families' position. ""They're sitting in court and they're listening to tales of their loved ones being riddled on the ground as they lay begging for help. ""They are probably very angry and would not have been able to come here to speak to Karen Bradley so I respect their decision."" Former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Hain said that if Mrs Bradley resigned it would not make any real difference to government policy in the region. He told the BBC's Inside Politics programme that her comments reflected a wider misunderstanding of the Northern Ireland conflict by the Conservative government. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' He accused the Conservatives of taking a partisan position by siding with unionism and claimed that Theresa May ""doesn't grip the Northern Ireland situation"" in the same way as previous prime ministers. In October, Lord Hain was one offour former Northern Ireland secretaries who wrote to Mrs Bradleyto express their concern about the government's handling of the legacy of the Troubles. Speaking onthe BBC's The View programme, Judith Thompson, the Northern Ireland victims' commissioner, said that some people affected by the Troubles were left in ""genuine shock"" by Mrs Bradley's remarks in the Commons. ""We can't move forward by having a bipolar political discourse, which is actually not one that is moved forward by a lack of honesty,"" added Ms Thompson. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his advice to Mrs Bradley would be: ""I think you're in the last-chance saloon on this.

"The tagline of the Accor Hotels is ""Feel welcome"" Global hotel chain Accor is investigating claims that staff at one of its Australian hotels have been racially segregating guests. Aboriginal guests at the Ibis Styles hotel in Alice Springs were purposely put in inferior rooms after a directive last June, the ABC reported on Friday. They were charged the same price as guests placed in better rooms. Accor said the alleged practice went ""completely against"" its values. ""[We] were made aware of the matter... and are taking prompt and decisive action on this incident at the highest level,"" the hotel group said in a statement to the BBC. ""We are extremely saddened and disappointed as it completely goes against our values,"" it added, saying it had a long track record of engaging with Australia's indigenous community. Paris-based Accor is one of the world's largest hotel groups, with properties in more than 100 countries. Employees at the Ibis Styles Alice Spring Oasis - located in the southern desert region of the Northern Territory - were sent an email last June instructing them to direct Aboriginal guests into one of six designated rooms, the ABC reported. One whistleblower who spoke to the national broadcaster's Background Briefing programme said this had happened ""hundreds"" of times, adding that it was ""pretty much standard"".,external ""We are now only putting hospital linen into rooms 85 to 90... these rooms are to be referred to as community rooms and we will try to limit them to just that, those coming from the communities [a local term for aboriginals from outside the town],"" the email reportedly said. The 'mind-blowing' struggle for an Aboriginal treaty Australia fails indigenous equality targets It also asked those working at reception to ""please use a touch of initiative and allocate accordingly"". The ABC sent two groups of people to the hotel as part of its investigation - the group that was made up of indigenous Australians was sent to the ""community rooms"". Both the non-indigenous and indigenous groups were charged A$129 (Â£60; $90). The ABC found stained sheets and towels, broken glass and rubbish in the patio area of room 86. One indigenous guest found chicken bones inside the bathroom. Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion called the incident ""very concerning"", saying it would be looked into. Accor told the BBC that it ""prided itself on being an inclusive organisation"", saying it had ""strict anti-discrimination policies in place"" and was proud of its relationship with the indigenous community and its indigenous employees. It said it was moving to reiterate ""the non-negotiable values of our business and specifically undertake cultural training at the hotel immediately"". Australia's languages 'share single source' Should Australia's anthem ditch the 'young and free'? The recognition and treatment of indigenous Australians remains highly controversial.

"Shamima Begum with her third child Jerrah, who died on Thursday The baby son of Shamima Begum - who fled London to join the Islamic State group - has died, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces has said. The group, which runs the camp where the teenager has been living, confirmed the death on Friday. The baby died of pneumonia, according to a medical certificate. He was less than three weeks old. A UK government spokesman said the death of any child was ""tragic and deeply distressing for the family"". The spokesman said the government had consistently advised against travelling to Syria and would ""continue to do whatever we can to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and travelling to dangerous conflict zones"". Ms Begum left the UK in 2015 with two friends and was found in a Syrian refugee camp in mid-February. She wanted to return to Britain but was stripped of her citizenship. Her husband, a Dutch IS fighter called Yago Riedijk, is being held at a nearby prison and has been informed of the baby's death. Why countries face a dilemma over IS children Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? What was life like for the IS couple? A paramedic working for the Kurdish Red Crescent in the camp told the BBC that the baby, called Jarrah, had been suffering from breathing difficulties. He was taken to a doctor on Thursday morning before being transferred to hospital, along with his mother, but died at 13:30 local time that day, the medical worker added. Ms Begum has since returned to the camp and her child was buried there yesterday. Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, east London, in 2015 to join the Islamic State group in Syria Speaking to the BBC before it was confirmed that the baby had died, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Sadly there are probably many children, obviously perfectly innocent, who have been born in this war zone. ""I have nothing but sympathy for the children that have been dragged into this. This is a reminder of why it is so, so dangerous for anyone to be in this war zone."" Ms Begum, 19, gave birth to her son last month, shortly after being tracked down by a journalist in a Syrian refugee camp. She had reportedly left Baghuz - IS's last stronghold. Ms Begum said she had previously lost two other children and named her newborn son Jarrah after her firstborn. This video can not be played ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" As her child was born before she was deprived of UK citizenship by the Home Office, the baby would still be considered British. Mr Javidpreviously saidthat the revocation of Ms Begum's citizenship would not apply to her son, explaining: ""Children should not suffer, so if a parent does lose their British citizenship it does not affect the rights of their child."" The lawyer representing the family of Ms Begum, Tasnime Akunjee,also confirmed,externalthe death. Inan interview with the BBCafter the birth of Jarrah, Ms Begum said she did not regret travelling to Syria - although she added that she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She also said that she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK After Ms Begum was stripped of her citizenship,her family wroteto the home secretary to say they planned to challenge the decision and asked for assistance to bring her baby to the UK. Earlier this week, Mr Akunjeetweeted a screenshot of the reply,externalthat they had received from the Home Office. It told them that the possibility of bringing the baby to the UK was a matter for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and that they would need permission from Ms Begum. The FCO is obliged to consider requests for consular assistance, the letter added. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said it might have been possible for the government to get the baby out of Syria, although that could have been ""politically difficult"". ""The government's position that it's impossible to go and get people out of these camps because it's too dangerous is repeatedly shown to be not entirely accurate, because journalists are able to get to these camps relatively safely. ""Working with the Red Crescent there for example, it should be possible to go and get people from the camps if there was a political will."" How many IS foreign fighters are left? Tales from inside the chaos left by IS Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent and friend of Ms Begum's family, told BBC Newsnight: ""We've failed, as a country, to safeguard the child. ""This was an entirely avoidable death of a British citizen. The family reached out to the Home Office, requested help, the Home Office sent a reply saying you've come to the wrong department. ""There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. I think it's shocking how the home secretary has treated this situation."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott also criticised the actions of the Home Office.She tweeted:,external""It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane."" Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK four years ago Kirsty McNeill, head of policy, advocacy and campaigns at the charity Save the Children, said ""all children associated with IS are victims of the conflict and must be treated as such"". She added: ""It is possible the death of this baby boy and others could have been avoided. The UK and other countries of origin must take responsibility for their citizens inside north-east Syria.""

"Police said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"" in the woman's home, including limes stuffed with written curses A 37-year-old mother has been jailed after becoming the first person in the UK to be convicted of female genital mutilation (FGM). The Ugandan woman mutilated her three-year-old daughter at their family home in east London in 2017. She was jailed for 11 years for the FGM and a further two years for indecent images and extreme pornography. Sentencing at the Old Bailey, Mrs Justice Whipple said the act was ""a barbaric and sickening crime"". ""FGM has long been against the law and let's be clear FGM is a form of child abuse"", she added. The mother was born in Uganda but has lived in the UK for a number of years. FGM is banned in both countries, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. The judge said it was not known why, contrary to her culture, the woman inflicted FGM on her child, although witchcraft was a possibility. Spells and curses intended to deter police investigations were found at the woman's home before her trial. During the trial, the woman claimed that in August 2017 her daughter climbed up to get a biscuit and ""fell on metal and it's ripped her private parts"". Medics alerted police to the girl's injuries after they treated her at Whipps Cross Hospital in Leytonstone. The child ""lost a significant amount of blood as a result of the injuries... delivered and inflicted on her"", jurors were told. Includes ""the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" Practised in 30 countries in Africa and some countries in Asia and the Middle East An estimated three million girls and women worldwide are at risk each year About 125 million victims estimated to be living with the consequences It is commonly carried out on young girls, often between infancy and the age of 15 Often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, to prepare a girl or woman for adulthood and marriage and to ensure ""pure femininity"" Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility and increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths Source:World Health Organization,external The woman's former partner, a 43-year-old Ghanaian man, was cleared of involvement in the FGM offence. But he pleaded guilty to two charges of possession of an indecent image of a child and two charges of possessing extreme pornography. Mrs Justice Whipple sentenced him to 11 months in prison, although he has already served his time on remand. While the parents were on bail, police searched the mother's home and said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"". Prosecutor Caroline Carberry QC said two cow tongues were ""bound in wire with nails and a small blunt knife"" embedded in them. Forty limes and other fruit were found containing pieces of paper with names written on them, including those of police officers and a social worker involved in the investigation. Police also found two cow tongues with metal screws in them Sentencing the woman, who cannot be named to protect the victim's identity, the judge said: ""[FGM] is a barbaric practice and a serious crime. It's an offence which targets women, particularly inflicted when they are young and vulnerable."" On the psychological effect on the victim, she told the defendant: ""This is a significant and lifelong burden for her to carry. ""You betrayed her trust in you as her protector."" The case is only the fourth FGM prosecution brought to court in the UK. The previous cases led to acquittals. John Cameron, head of the NSPCC's Childline, said: ""Some cultures consider FGM a necessary part of bringing up a young girl. There may even be pressures for families to conform. ""The truth is it is a horrific form of child abuse and a criminal offence which has no place in today's society. ""If we want to protect girls from this dangerous and potentially life changing practice we need to talk about FGM, encourage people to seek help and advice and report any concerns if they believe a child has been cut or is about to be."" The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for FGM, Commander Ivan Balhatchet, said: ""Female genital mutilation is a barbaric and violent crime - a violation of human rights - often with lifelong consequences, committed by the people children should be able to trust the most."" Lynette Woodrow, of the CPS, said: ""FGM is an extremely serious form of child abuse and today's sentence underlines that fact. ""We hope that this conviction encourages those who have experienced FGM, or have suspicions about FGM offences, to come forward knowing that we will treat everyone with sensitivity and respect.""

"This video can not be played Pictures show cracks appear in the nuclear reactor [EDF Energy] The first pictures have emerged of cracking in the graphite bricks which make up the core of nuclear reactors at Hunterston B Power Station in Ayrshire. Reactor three has not produced electricity since cracks were found to be forming more quickly than expected. About 370 hairline fractures have been discovered which equates to about one in every 10 bricks in the reactor core. Owner EDF Energy says it does intend to seek permission from the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to restart. It first has to prove it can still shut down the North Ayrshire reactor, which has not produced electricity for a year, in all circumstances. Over 350 cracks found in Hunterston B nuclear reactor The graphite bricks form the vertical channels within the reactor where the nuclear fuel is housed. They sit alongside narrower channels where control rods can be dropped into place to counteract the nuclear reaction. Tests and modelling have been undertaken to ensure that an earthquake would not distort the control channels and prevent the power station being shut down. Hairline cracks just a couple of millimetres thick have been found on 370 graphite bricks. This picture shows two such cracks - the dark vertical lines. Station Director Colin Weir told BBC Scotland: ""Nuclear safety is our overriding priority and reactor three has been off for the year so that we can do further inspections. ""We've carried out one of our biggest ever inspection campaigns on reactor three, we've renewed our modelling, we've done experiments and tests and we've analysed all the data from this to produce our safety case that we will submit to the ONR. ""We have to demonstrate that the reactor will always shut down and that it will shut down in an extreme seismic event."" The operational limit for the latest period of operation was 350 cracks but an inspection found that allowance had been exceeded. EDF plans to ask the regulator for permission to restart with a new operational limit of up to 700 cracks. The reactor core is made up of 3,000 bricks and the cracks run the full length of 1 in 10 of them The company accepts that the cracking is 'life-limiting' for the reactor but will not say what it believes to be a limit beyond which it would be unsafe to operate. Hunterston Q&A: What do cracks mean? Mr Weir added: ""We have demonstrated our operational allowance, we've demonstrated our safety allowance.  This cliff edge is still to be demonstrated.  It has got a huge safety margin before we are anywhere near a cliff edge."" When operational, the two reactors at Hunterston B provide a base-load of electricity which is enough to power 1.8 million homes. It has an advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGC) similar to those at Heysham 1 and 2, Torness, Hartlepool, Hinkley Point B and Dungeness B. The industry expects all 14 reactors to eventually be decommissioned because of the cracking. The two reactors at Hunterston B can generate enough electricity to power 1.8 million homes. Nuclear expert Prof Neil Hyatt from Sheffield University said: ""The structural integrity of the graphite core has always been known to be the ultimate limiting factor to the lifetime of these reactors. So, ultimately there may come a point in time where those reactors have to come offline and are not able to restart."" Hunterston B is expected to continue producing electricity until 2023. If it were forced into decommissioning early because of the cracks - with others following suit - it could cause serious energy supply problems. With construction of a wave of new nuclear power stations running into difficulties, it would probably mean more of our power coming from fossil fuels such as gas. Concerns have also been raised about the consequences for local jobs if Hunterston closed early. It supports around 700 posts. Councillor Tom Marshall said: ""Most of the large employers round about here have disappeared - from Greenock all the way down to Kilmarnock - and this is one of the last major employers. ""So, if it is safe to run most people locally would be happy to see it running."" Hunterston Q&A: What do cracks mean?

"This video can not be played WATCH: SpaceX Dragon capsule returns to Earth after ISS mission America's new commercial astronaut capsule has completed its demonstration flight with a successful splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean. The SpaceX Dragon vehicle left the International Space Station after being docked there for the past week, and re-entered Earth's atmosphere. It had a heat-shield to protect it from the high temperatures of re-entry. Four parachutes brought it into ""soft contact"" with water about 450km from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The mission - which had no humans aboard, only a dummy covered in sensors - went according to plan. The Dragon has set the stage for the US space agency Nasa to approve the vehicle for crewed flights. This video can not be played ISS astronaut Anne McClain went inside the Dragon capsule Not since the end of the Space Shuttle programme has the US been able to send its own astronauts into orbit. It has had to rely instead on Russia and its Soyuz spacecraft, launching from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Nasa hopes to bring this near-eight year gap in capability to an end with the introduction of two new commercial transportation systems - the Dragon and another vehicle being developed by aerospace giant Boeing. The first crewed flight of the Dragon could occur as soon as July, although this target date is likely to slip into the summer as engineers work through the post-flight analysis. Splashdown occurred at about 08:45 EST (13:45 GMT). A boat, called GO Searcher, was waiting to recover the capsule. There were cheers at mission control as the capsule landed in the Atlantic. The Dragon's owner, SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk, had previously expressed some anxiety about how the capsule would cope with re-entry, given that the vehicle's backshell, or conical upper-section, has a somewhat irregular shape that could lead to a roll instability at hypersonic speeds. The director of crew mission management at Space X, Benjamin Reed, spoke to Nasa TV moments after the capsule splashed down. ""It was an incredible journey to get to this moment,"" he said. ""The teams have just done an amazing job - both the Space X and the Nasa teams jointly. ""I can't believe how well the whole mission has gone. Pretty much everything at every point everything's been nailed all the way."" Nasa has seed-funded Boeing to produce a capsule of its own called the Starliner. This vehicle is scheduled to have its uncrewed demonstration flight in April or soon after. Ultimately, Nasa will be purchasing seats in both the SpaceX and Boeing systems to take its astronauts to the ISS. But the commercial nature of the relationship means the companies will be free to sell rides to secondary customers. These will no doubt include the space agencies of other nations, but perhaps some private space companies and individuals too. ""We're driving down costs for low-Earth orbit; we're commercialising low-Earth orbitâ¦ with human activities where Nasa can be a customer. And then we can use the tax-payer resources that are bestowed upon us to do exploration, to go further, to go back to the Moon sustainably,"" said Nasa chief Jim Bridenstine. ""We want to stay at the Moon and ultimately go on to Mars."" The GO Searcher vessel was tasked with picking Dragon crew capsules out of the water Nasa has already selected its first astronauts to fly aboard a crewed Dragon. They are Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley. ""We have a significant amount of training we need to go through that will walk through all the various phases of flight,"" Behnken said of the coming months. This will include understanding what to do if there is an emergency during their mission. One problem that could occur is a failure of the Dragon's carrier rocket during the ascent to orbit. The demonstration capsule's lift-off last Saturday was picture perfect, but some kind of booster anomaly can never be discounted. In such a scenario, a Dragon's powerful thrusters would push it away from the launcher to safety. Bob Behnken (L) and Doug Hurley will be the first crew to ride a Dragon SpaceX will practise this very procedure shortly. The team plans to take the current Dragon after its return and put it on another rocket and launch it out of the Kennedy Space Center. A minute into this flight, a deliberate abort will be commanded. The timing is significant because it's when the vehicle is experiencing maximum aerodynamic pressure. If the Dragon can stably depart in such circumstances, it ought be able to handle an escape at any stage in a flight. As with the present demo, no-one will be aboard for this hazardous test. The capsule will be used again during the upcoming in-flight abort test Dragon capsule docks with space station SpaceX capsule demo flight lifts off Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain fires Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

It has got a huge safety margin before we are anywhere near a cliff edge."" When operational, the two reactors at Hunterston B provide a base-load of electricity which is enough to power 1.8 million homes. It has an advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGC) similar to those at Heysham 1 and 2, Torness, Hartlepool, Hinkley Point B and Dungeness B. The industry expects all 14 reactors to eventually be decommissioned because of the cracking. The two reactors at Hunterston B can generate enough electricity to power 1.8 million homes. Nuclear expert Prof Neil Hyatt from Sheffield University said: ""The structural integrity of the graphite core has always been known to be the ultimate limiting factor to the lifetime of these reactors. So, ultimately there may come a point in time where those reactors have to come offline and are not able to restart."" Hunterston B is expected to continue producing electricity until 2023. If it were forced into decommissioning early because of the cracks - with others following suit - it could cause serious energy supply problems. With construction of a wave of new nuclear power stations running into difficulties, it would probably mean more of our power coming from fossil fuels such as gas. Concerns have also been raised about the consequences for local jobs if Hunterston closed early. It supports around 700 posts. Councillor Tom Marshall said: ""Most of the large employers round about here have disappeared - from Greenock all the way down to Kilmarnock - and this is one of the last major employers. ""So, if it is safe to run most people locally would be happy to see it running."" Hunterston Q&A: What do cracks mean?

"Manning was found guilty of leaking thousands of military documents Former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has been jailed for refusing to testify before an investigation into Wikileaks. A Virginia judge ordered her taken into custody until the grand jury's work is finished or she decides to testify. Manning said she shared everything she knows during her court-martial. Manning was found guilty in 2013 of charges including espionage for leaking secret military files to Wikileaks, but her sentence was commuted. Manning, 31, told US District Judge Claude Hilton that she would ""accept whatever you bring upon me"", but would not testify,the Associated Press reported,external. Her lawyers had reportedly asked that she be confined at home due to medical issues, but the judge said US Marshals would address her care needs. US prosecutors have been investigating Wikileaks for years, and in November prosecutors inadvertently revealed possible charges against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, in court documents from a separate case. On Friday, Manning said in a statement: ""I will not comply with this, or any other grand jury."" ""Imprisoning me for my refusal to answer questions only subjects me to additional punishment for my repeatedly-stated ethical objections to the grand jury system."" Allow Twitter content?

""Chelsea gave voluminous testimony during her court martial. She has stood by the truth of her prior statements, and there is no legitimate purpose to having her rehash them before a hostile grand jury."" Manning was arrested in Iraq in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos and diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy website. While Manning said she only did so to spark debates about  foreign policy, US officials said the leak put lives at risk. She was sentenced to 35 years after being found guilty of 20 charges related to the leak, but only served seven before former President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017. Her sentence was the longest given for a leak in US history. Mr Obama said it was ""disproportionate"" to her crimes. Republicans criticised the Democratic president's decision at the time. Then-Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan said Mr Obama had set ""a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won't be held accountable"",the New York Times reported.,external President Donald Trump has called Manning an ""ungrateful traitor"" who ""should never have been released from prison"".

The Â£81.5m deal is expected to provide 1,000 homes after Peabody bought the 10-acre site of the former women's jail in north London on Friday. The prisons minister said the sale will help ""replace ageing prisons with modern, purpose-built establishments"". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has been looking for a buyer sincethe prison closed in 2016.

The deal, which involves a Â£42m loan from the Mayor's Land Fund, will see at least 60% of the new homes will be ""genuinely affordable"", Peabody said. Of these 70% will be social rent, with the remainder either shared ownership or London Living Rent.

"Nine people were injured when the carriages flew off the rollercoaster and fell 30ft to the ground The owners of a Lanarkshire theme park ride which crashed injuring nine people, have been fined Â£65,000 over health and safety breaches. Seven children were among the injured at M&Ds in Strathclyde Park in June 2016 when the Tsunami rollercoaster derailed at 40mph. Five gondolas plunged 30ft to the ground. M&Ds pleaded guilty to charges relating to the Health and Safety at Work Act at Hamilton Sheriff Court on Friday. The Tsunami never reopened and was dismantled in February 2017 The theme park would have been fined Â£100,000 but for their guilty plea. Sheriff Thomas Millar told the court a ""place of enjoyment and entertainment"" on that day became ""a place of terror"". The charge alleged that M&D Leisure had failed to ensure that the rollercoaster was maintained, in efficient working order and in good repair. It said weld repairs on axles of the passenger cars were inadequate, leading to the failure of the axle suspension on the five-car yellow train. The car came off the track and fell to the ground ""to the danger of the lives of seven children and two adults."" A Health and Safety Executive investigation found that the welding metal and the axle metal were incompatible. HM Inspector of Safety, Martin McMahon said: ""We found nine out of the 10 axles on the Tsunami had been given this weld overlay repair and in the end six of them detached from the ride causing it to crash onto the ground."" The Tsunami was a high-speed rollercoaster in which the gondolas were often inverted After the judgement, Matthew Taylor, a director of M&D's issued a statement. He said: ""My brother Douglas and I have been in business together for more than 50 years and this is the first incident of this type that we've ever been involved in. ""We are devastated as both a family and a business, and our heart goes out to everyone who has been affected by the accident. ""Our customers shape every part of our business and our thoughts have always been with those who were injured and their families. ""We've co-operated fully with the inquiries at every stage to ascertain what caused this accident and how to prevent it happening again in the future. ""Each and every ride within the theme park has always been subject to a daily safety check and annual independent inspection. ""We have now introduced a new, more detailed, maintenance recording system which records any work carried out to ensure that repairs can be traced accurately."" The Tsunami was one of the fastest rides at the park But the father of one of the more seriously hurt children said he was disappointed in the fine. Outside the court, the man - who can't be named because the crash victims are under 18 - spoke to BBC news. He said: ""For a company bragging a turnover of Â£8m to be fined Â£65,000 is disappointing. ""Seeing what my son went through initially and for months and years after, I am bitterly disappointed. ""It's been a hard battle for him and us. When he was in a coma - it was hard to watch our child on a ventilator - and then when he came off it, struggling with his injuries, it was heartbreaking. ""Two years eight months later looking for some sort of justice, I don't think we received that today."" The Health and Safety Executive completed a 15-month investigation into the crash in September 2017. HSE completes probe into M&Ds rollercoaster crash Several victims have received compensation payouts, while others are still in the process of pursuing claims. In October 2017, it emerged M&Ds received a Â£1.4m insurance payout for the closure of the Strathclyde Park site. Nine passengers, most of them children, were on board the inverted rollercoaster when five gondolas detached from their rails at a bend and fell to the ground. Among those who were injured were a 12-year-old boy with chest, abdominal and leg injuries and an 11-year-old boy who had serious arm and hand injuries. The gondola cars came of the rails on the Tsunami rollercoaster The Tsunami, which travelled at up to 40mph through corkscrew turns and loops, never reopened and it was finally dismantled in February 2017. It emerged that an inspector who passed the ride as safe 16 days before the accident had been subsequently banned. M&D's rollercoaster crash: Safety inspector banned The theme park was shut for investigations but a partial reopening was sanctioned just four days after the accident. It was fully reopened to the public just over three weeks later. Robert McCutcheon was one of the first on the scene after the gondolas crashed to the ground. A former paramedic, the 31-year-old from Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Galloway, jumped straight into the aftermath. He told the BBC Scotland news website: ""It was a free-for-all. There was no organisation and no response from staff. ""I went under the cars to a young boy who was in a bad way."" Robert McCutcheon was one of the first on the scene to help when the rollercoaster derailed Mr McCutcheon stayed with an 11-year-old boy whose wrist was snapped. He plugged the bleeding artery in his arm and immobilised his head. But he said the scene was chaos with no co-ordination to the initial rescue efforts. He said: ""At one point some parents at the scene started rocking the collapsed ride to try to free other victims, but didn't realise they were putting the boy at further risk. ""Myself and another man, Ian Holmes, stayed there until everyone was taken to hospital."" Mr McCutcheon expected the theme park to be closed almost immediately. He said: ""I am surprised it has taken this long. I would have expected it to be shut down and M&Ds to face severe consequences regarding health and safety and at the very least heavy financial consequences. ""I have never been back.""

"The fire gutted the famous Mackintosh Building in June 2018 Glasgow School of Art (GSA) has been criticised by MSPs in a report into the fire which devastated the Mackintosh Building last year. Holyrood's culture committee said the school did not give sufficient priority to safeguarding the building. The blaze ripped through ""The Mack"" in June 2018 as a Â£36m restoration project, following a major fire four years earlier, was nearing completion. The GSA said it intended to ""learn lessons"" from the report. The MSPs also said a full public inquiry should be held into the circumstances surrounding the two fires at the building. Thecommittee's report,externalconcluded that prior to the first fire in 2014, the art school had not addressed the heightened risk of fire to the Mackintosh Building or carried out an adequate risk assessment. The Mackintosh building was devastated by fire just months before it was due to reopen The committee was particularly concerned about the length of time taken for a modern mist suppression system to be installed. Such a system was still not in place when the second fire broke out. Committee convener Joan McAlpine said: ""The board of Glasgow School of Art were custodians of this magnificent building, one of the most significant to Scotland's rich cultural heritage. ""They had a duty to protect Mackintosh's legacy. ""Glasgow School of Art must learn lessons from its role in presiding over the building, given that two devastating fires occurred within their estate in such a short space of time."" MSPs were also told during their inquiry that ventilation ducts which allowed the fire to take hold in 2014 were still in place at the time of last year's blaze. They had been due to be rectified at the end of the restoration project. The report also urged the GSA to take steps to repair a ""loss of trust"" with the local community. Responding to the report, Glasgow School of Art said: ""There are always lessons that can be learned, and we are happy to take forward the most appropriate and helpful as we bring this much-loved building back to life."" However, it said there were some ""factual inaccuracies"" in the report. It also added: ""The Mackintosh Building is a national (indeed international) treasure, but it is not lost and it will certainly return."" The Mackintosh Library was destroyed in the first blaze in November 2014 Representatives from Historic Environment Scotland told the hearing they could not offer any financial support for a new build of the Mackintosh building as grants are for the repair and conservation of existing historic fabric. However, bosses at the art school have said they are confident that it will be rebuilt. The committee made a number of recommendations about protecting other historically significant buildings, including: Reviewing the remit of Historic Environment Scotland (HES), giving it extended statutory powers to intervene in cases where there is a risk to an asset of national significance A review of Category A listed buildings with unique cultural or historic significance to discover if steps need to be taken to mitigate the risk of fire A Scottish government review of the powers to compel owners to put in place enhanced fire safety measures to protect buildings of national significance. Deputy convener Claire Baker added: ""If anything positive at all should come out of the loss of the Mackintosh it should be that further protection is put in place for some of Scotland's most significant historical buildings. ""Throughout our investigation, it has been clear that there are weaknesses in the policy protecting our heritage. This is why the Committee has set out some very clear steps that must be taken in order to prevent any further loss. ""Particularly key to this is giving Historic Environment Scotland further powers to intervene where there is a serious fire risk to some of Scotland's most important buildings.""

"This video can not be played Meghan: Men should not be threatened by equality The Duchess of Sussex said she would like her unborn child to be a feminist, whether they are a girl or a boy. Speaking on a panel to mark International Women's Day, Meghan said she had recently been watching a documentary on feminism. ""One of the things they said during pregnancy was 'I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism',"" she told an audience at King's College London. ""I loved that - boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that's the case."" Meghan and Harry expecting baby Meghan: From actress to duchess She went on to say that ""men can understand that they can be feminists"" and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them. The duchess's comments were made after she was asked about how her baby bump was treating her, to which she replied ""very well"". Meghan was taking part in a discussion organised by the Queen's Commonwealth Trust L-R: Journalist Anne McElvoy (chairwoman); Angeline Murimirwa from the Campaign for Real Education; campaigner Chrisann Jarrett; Meghan; singer Annie Lennox; model Adwoa Aboah; former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard Speaking in a panel discussion of leading feminists and other national figures, Meghan also revealed she does not read newspapers or engage with Twitter to avoid getting ""muddled"" by the ""noise"". She was asked by the chairwoman, Anne McElvoy, senior editor of The Economist, how she responded to newspaper headlines describing her feminism as ""trendy"". The duchess said: ""I don't read anything - it's much safer that way. ""But equally, that's just my own personal preference because I think positive or negative, it can all sort of just feel like noise to a certain extent these days, as opposed to getting muddled with that to focus on the real cause. ""So for me, I think the idea of making the word feminism trendy, that doesn't make any sense to me personally, right? This is something that is going to be part of the conversation forever."" Prince Harry and Meghan are expecting their first baby in spring Others speakers on the panel, which was organised by the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, included singer Annie Lennox and former prime minister of Australia, Julia Gillard.

"Head teacher Siobhan Lowe mans the tills in the school canteen A head teacher says she has had to scrub the toilets, clean the school and work in the canteen because of school funding shortages on schools. Siobhan Lowe, head of Tolworth Girls' School in Surbiton, south London, spoke of the embarrassment of not being able to fund support for her pupils. She says she has already sold off land, cut subjects and a deputy head post to stay afloat, as budgets tightened. It comes as thousands of heads have highlighted worsening funding gaps. About 7,000 head teachers in England have written to 3.5 million parents saying that schools are facing a ""funding crisis"". They say they are angry that the education secretary has refused to meet them to discuss the issue. They say requests to talk to Damian Hinds were turned down because his time is too ""pressurised"" to meet, and that this suggested he was ""in denial"" about the cash issues facing schools. But the Department for Education said it was ""fundamentally untrue"" to say funding was not a priority. A department spokesman said Mr Hinds had negotiated an extra Â£750m for schools and was ""putting a strong case to the Treasury ahead of the next spending review"". But Ms Lowe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had been forced to make a ""phenomenal amount of cuts"" in every area of her school. ""I've reduced the number of teaching groups, I've reduced the number of options that students have, I've increased class sizes, I've cut critical services such as student support workers who work with our most vulnerable,"" she said. ""I personally have cleaned the school, washed the toilets, served in the school canteen."" She added: ""My girls are looking at me and feeling so sorry for me that they're actually picking up the Hoover and doing it with me."" Ms Lowe added she had just Â£10 per pupil per year to fund basic needs like books, and that parents were having to pay for things such as printing. ""As a head teacher, you're almost embarrassed to admit you can't support the students in your school,"" she continued. ""But why am I embarrassed? It's not my embarrassment. ""It's due to the fact that I'm not given the money to provide for the students."" Jules White, West Sussex head teacher and organiser of the schools funding campaign letter, said: ""When thousands of heads are all saying the same thing, it seems incredible that ministers are too busy to meet. ""Families have a right to know that our efforts to improve things are falling on deaf ears. ""Heads must now consider whether the refusal to meet us is either a complacent act of denial or simply a deliberate snub."" Reality Check: Is government spending record amounts on schools? Schools facing 'financial cliff edge', says think tank Head teachers stage polite protest over funding School funding 'exaggerated' by ministers, says statistics watchdog The joint letter sent home to parents, warning of the impact of cash shortages, quotes a letter to head teachers rejecting a request to talk to the education secretary or Schools Minister Nick Gibb. blaming prioritising ministerial business. Head teachers staged a ""relentlessly reasonable"" protest march in Westminster The letter is being sent to parents in areas including Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, some London boroughs, Surrey, Kent, Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk and Cumbria. The WorthLess? campaign group sending the letters staged an unprecedentedhead teachers' protest march in Westminsterlast September, with the slogan ""relentlessly reasonable"". A DFE spokesperson said the education secretary met teachers and unions ""on a regular basis"". There have been repeated complaints from schools about funding shortages, with the Institute for Fiscal Studiesshowing that per pupil spending had fallen in real terms by 8% since 2010. Earlier this year, the Education Policy Institute said almost a third of local authority secondary schools in England were unable to cover their costs, with the proportion of these schools in the red almost quadrupling in four years. This weekMPs debated school funding, after a petition warning of funding cuts received 100,000 signatures. The government has acknowledged that schools can face extra pressures, such as support for children with mental health problems, but says funding is continuing to rise to record levels. This week, however, Labour MP Jess Phillips shared a message from her son's school in Birmingham, warning that it might have toclose early on Fridays to save money. And in February, a school in Stockport said it would introduce ahalf day on Friday because of ""unsustainable"" finances. Catharine Darnton, head of Gillotts School, in Henley, Oxfordshire, said her school was also seeing rising pupil numbers without funding for more staff. Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner school in New Malden, Surrey, said schools ""now spend a significant sum and a huge amount of time on supporting students and families with all sorts of non-educational issues"", which had to come out of already over-stretched budgets.

"This video can not be played Meghan: Men should not be threatened by equality The Duchess of Sussex said she would like her unborn child to be a feminist, whether they are a girl or a boy. Speaking on a panel to mark International Women's Day, Meghan said she had recently been watching a documentary on feminism. ""One of the things they said during pregnancy was 'I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism',"" she told an audience at King's College London. ""I loved that - boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that's the case."" Meghan and Harry expecting baby Meghan: From actress to duchess She went on to say that ""men can understand that they can be feminists"" and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them. The duchess's comments were made after she was asked about how her baby bump was treating her, to which she replied ""very well"". Meghan was taking part in a discussion organised by the Queen's Commonwealth Trust L-R: Journalist Anne McElvoy (chairwoman); Angeline Murimirwa from the Campaign for Real Education; campaigner Chrisann Jarrett; Meghan; singer Annie Lennox; model Adwoa Aboah; former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard Speaking in a panel discussion of leading feminists and other national figures, Meghan also revealed she does not read newspapers or engage with Twitter to avoid getting ""muddled"" by the ""noise"". She was asked by the chairwoman, Anne McElvoy, senior editor of The Economist, how she responded to newspaper headlines describing her feminism as ""trendy"". The duchess said: ""I don't read anything - it's much safer that way. ""But equally, that's just my own personal preference because I think positive or negative, it can all sort of just feel like noise to a certain extent these days, as opposed to getting muddled with that to focus on the real cause. ""So for me, I think the idea of making the word feminism trendy, that doesn't make any sense to me personally, right? This is something that is going to be part of the conversation forever."" Prince Harry and Meghan are expecting their first baby in spring Others speakers on the panel, which was organised by the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, included singer Annie Lennox and former prime minister of Australia, Julia Gillard. Meghan's participation in the discussion on gender equality came after she was made the trust's new vice-president. The duchess and Prince Harry are expecting their first baby in the spring.

"This video can not be played WATCH: SpaceX Dragon capsule returns to Earth after ISS mission America's new commercial astronaut capsule has completed its demonstration flight with a successful splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean. The SpaceX Dragon vehicle left the International Space Station after being docked there for the past week, and re-entered Earth's atmosphere. It had a heat-shield to protect it from the high temperatures of re-entry. Four parachutes brought it into ""soft contact"" with water about 450km from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The mission - which had no humans aboard, only a dummy covered in sensors - went according to plan. The Dragon has set the stage for the US space agency Nasa to approve the vehicle for crewed flights. This video can not be played ISS astronaut Anne McClain went inside the Dragon capsule Not since the end of the Space Shuttle programme has the US been able to send its own astronauts into orbit. It has had to rely instead on Russia and its Soyuz spacecraft, launching from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Nasa hopes to bring this near-eight year gap in capability to an end with the introduction of two new commercial transportation systems - the Dragon and another vehicle being developed by aerospace giant Boeing. The first crewed flight of the Dragon could occur as soon as July, although this target date is likely to slip into the summer as engineers work through the post-flight analysis. Splashdown occurred at about 08:45 EST (13:45 GMT). A boat, called GO Searcher, was waiting to recover the capsule. There were cheers at mission control as the capsule landed in the Atlantic. The Dragon's owner, SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk, had previously expressed some anxiety about how the capsule would cope with re-entry, given that the vehicle's backshell, or conical upper-section, has a somewhat irregular shape that could lead to a roll instability at hypersonic speeds. The director of crew mission management at Space X, Benjamin Reed, spoke to Nasa TV moments after the capsule splashed down. ""It was an incredible journey to get to this moment,"" he said. ""The teams have just done an amazing job - both the Space X and the Nasa teams jointly. ""I can't believe how well the whole mission has gone. Pretty much everything at every point everything's been nailed all the way."" Nasa has seed-funded Boeing to produce a capsule of its own called the Starliner. This vehicle is scheduled to have its uncrewed demonstration flight in April or soon after. Ultimately, Nasa will be purchasing seats in both the SpaceX and Boeing systems to take its astronauts to the ISS. But the commercial nature of the relationship means the companies will be free to sell rides to secondary customers. These will no doubt include the space agencies of other nations, but perhaps some private space companies and individuals too. ""We're driving down costs for low-Earth orbit; we're commercialising low-Earth orbitâ¦ with human activities where Nasa can be a customer. And then we can use the tax-payer resources that are bestowed upon us to do exploration, to go further, to go back to the Moon sustainably,"" said Nasa chief Jim Bridenstine. ""We want to stay at the Moon and ultimately go on to Mars."" The GO Searcher vessel was tasked with picking Dragon crew capsules out of the water Nasa has already selected its first astronauts to fly aboard a crewed Dragon. They are Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley. ""We have a significant amount of training we need to go through that will walk through all the various phases of flight,"" Behnken said of the coming months. This will include understanding what to do if there is an emergency during their mission. One problem that could occur is a failure of the Dragon's carrier rocket during the ascent to orbit. The demonstration capsule's lift-off last Saturday was picture perfect, but some kind of booster anomaly can never be discounted. In such a scenario, a Dragon's powerful thrusters would push it away from the launcher to safety. Bob Behnken (L) and Doug Hurley will be the first crew to ride a Dragon SpaceX will practise this very procedure shortly. The team plans to take the current Dragon after its return and put it on another rocket and launch it out of the Kennedy Space Center. A minute into this flight, a deliberate abort will be commanded. The timing is significant because it's when the vehicle is experiencing maximum aerodynamic pressure. If the Dragon can stably depart in such circumstances, it ought be able to handle an escape at any stage in a flight. As with the present demo, no-one will be aboard for this hazardous test. The capsule will be used again during the upcoming in-flight abort test Dragon capsule docks with space station SpaceX capsule demo flight lifts off Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain fires Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her daughter Gabriella, who she saw during a temporary release from prison Jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe will be given diplomatic protection by Britain, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. It means the case will now be treated as a formal, legal dispute between the two states involved - Britain and Iran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffewas jailed for five yearsin Iran in 2016 after being convicted of spying, which she denies. Mr Hunt said the move was unlikely to be a ""magic wand"" to get her released, but was an ""important diplomatic step"". He said it ""demonstrates to the whole world that Nazanin is innocent"" and signalled to Iran ""that its behaviour is totally wrong"". The Iranian ambassador to London said the decision ""contravenes international law"". Iran refuses to recognise dual nationals so does not recognise Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's right to be represented by Britain. Diplomatic protection is a rare legal procedure in international law. States can use it to help one of their nationals whose rights have been breached in another country. It is very different to diplomatic immunity, which is something given to diplomats to ensure their safe passage and protection from prosecution. What is diplomatic protection? What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Iran 'tried to get jailed mum to spy on UK' According to the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale, her new legal status will not force Iran to change the way it treats her. But it will allow Britain to raise her case with greater ease at international forums such as the United Nations. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the decision to grant Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection ""sends a very strong message"" to Iran. Addressing the republic, he said: ""You may have disagreements with the UK, but at the heart of this is an innocent woman, vulnerable, unwell and scared. She should not be paying the price for whatever disagreements you have with the UK."" Asked if he was prepared to take Iran to international court, sanction it, or summon its ambassador, Mr Hunt said ""all these things are possible, but we would like to solve this in an amicable way"". He added that diplomatic protection had not been granted to a British citizen in 100 years. ""It's difficult to know exactly what the impact will be. But we do want the world to know the UK will not stand by while its citizens are unjustly treated."" Asked about Iran's allegation that the UK had broken international law, Mr Hunt said he ""would expect some sort of negative reaction"" from the country. This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Now this has been elevated to a formal state-to-state dispute, Britain can look for allies on the international stage to put collective pressure on Tehran. So what British diplomats hope is that this sends a clear signal to Iran that this issue is not going away, that the UK government is determined to keep pushing for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, and that it is prepared to escalate the dispute in the face of Tehran's intransigence. The granting of diplomatic protection will have no immediate impact on Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's conditions in jail in Tehran. But what diplomats hope is that it will focus minds in Tehran, not just in the foreign ministry but also among the hardliners whom officials believe will ultimately decide Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's future. The question now will be how Iran responds. Read more: What will diplomatic protection mean for Nazanin? This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard said the news she will be given diplomatic protection ""changes the stakes"" Richard Ratcliffe, who has been campaigning for his wife's release - and for the UK government to take this step - welcomed the news. He told the Today programme on Friday: ""Until yesterday, it was our problem that the British government was sympathetic with, in solidarity with, trying to help us along the way. ""Now it's also the British government's case and all the injustices that happen to Nazanin are effectively injustices to the British government."" He said he hoped the decision would allow doctors to check on his wife's health, as she had been suffering ""neurological problems"". He last spoke to her on Wednesday, he said, and the prospect of being afforded diplomatic protection meant she was ""a bit more upbeat"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who went on hunger strike in January over a lack of medical care, had been ""very low again"" recently, he said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran when she was visiting her parents with her daughter Human rights organisation Redress, which has been pushing for the UK government to grant diplomatic protection to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe for more than a year, said Mr Hunt's move was ""hugely significant"" for her and would give her hope for the future. And Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for foreign affairs, Jo Swinson, described Mr Hunt's decision as ""a promising and welcome step in the right direction"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, was a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and lived in London when she was arrested in Iran in April 2016. She was later sentenced to five years in prison for allegedly plotting against the Iranian government. She maintains her innocence, and says she was on holiday in Iran taking her daughter Gabriella to visit her parents.

"Giselle Marimon-Herrera and her daughter Allison were found dead on Thursday A teenage girl who was found dead alongside the bodies of her mother and a man in a flat in Newry, County Down, had been strangled, police have said. The bodies of Allison Marimon-Herrera, aged 15, and her mother Giselle, aged 37, were discovered by police who forced entry to the flat on Thursday. The 38-year-old man who was also found dead has yet to be identified. Detectives have started a murder inquiry but are not seeking anyone else in connection with the deaths. Murder inquiry after three found dead in flat The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) released details on Friday night of the post-mortem examinations of the three bodies. The results were ""not definitive"" about the cause of Ms Marimon-Herrera's death but there was a ""strong possibility"" that she was also strangled, police said. A post-mortem examination showed that the man died by hanging. Police cordoned off Glin Ree Court after officers found the bodies in a flat Police believe he was the woman's partner and lived in the same apartment block at Glin Ree Court in Newry. Police went to the flat after a relative reported concerns that they had not been in contact with a family member for days. The bodies were found at about 11:00 GMT on Thursday. Officers said they believe Ms Marimon-Herrera and her daughter Allison were still alive on Sunday morning. Det Supt Jason Murphy said Ms Marimon-Herrera was originally from Colombia and had arrived in Northern Ireland about four years ago. He said her daughter was born in Spain, had lived in Northern Ireland since 2017 and was a pupil at Newry High School. ""This is an unspeakable tragedy,"" he added. Staff and pupils at Newry High School were ""profoundly saddened"", said Iestyn Brown ""I believe that Giselle and Allison were still alive in the early hours of Sunday morning but family members have not been able to contact them since. ""The exact circumstances of what happened in their home remain the subject of the investigation."" Newry High School principal Iestyn Brown said that the school was ""deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of our year 11 pupil Allison"". ""Allison was a talented, kind, courteous and well-mannered pupil with a beautiful smile,"" he said. ""Both staff and pupils are profoundly saddened by her death and she will be remembered with great affection by her fellow pupils and staff alike.

"This video can not be played Karen Bradley says she's ""devastated"" to think she made pain worse for Troubles victims' families Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has described a meeting with the families of some victims of the Troubles as ""humbling"". On Friday she met relatives of people killed by security forces and apologised for controversial remarks she made about the Troubles this week. She told MPs on Wednesday thatdeaths caused by security forces in Northern Ireland were ""not crimes"". The sister of a man who was shot dead by the Army has called for her to quit. Bradley 'to deliver for those she hurt' Is NI secretary running out of road? This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Frances Meehan,whose brother Michael Donnelly was shot with a plastic bulletin 1981, said Mrs Bradley's position was ""untenable"". She was one of the people who met Mrs Bradley on Friday, as part of a delegation from the victims' group Relatives for Justice. After the meetings, Mrs Bradley said she was ""grateful"" to the families for giving her the ""opportunity to apologise personally for the offence and hurt"" that her comments had caused. ""It was humbling to listen to each of them and their personal and deeply moving stories,"" she added. ""I heard about the hurt and suffering endured over many years, about the experiences of those whose family members died at the hands of the security forces. ""The families I met today referred to unarmed civilians and 82 children who lost their lives in incidents involving the security forces."" Frances Meehan says Karen Bradley's position as Northern Ireland secretary is ""untenable"" But Ms Meehan said the Northern Ireland's secretary apology was ""not good enough for someone who is meant to represent the interests of Northern Ireland at the British cabinet"". ""It is not acceptable that Karen Bradley remains in her post and we are calling again for her to resign,"" she added. Her comments come after relatives of 10 people killed in west Belfast during the Troubles rejected an offer to meet the Northern Ireland secretary. Those who died at Ballymurphy were shot deadshortly after the introduction of internment. Internment was introduced in August 1971 against a backdrop of escalating violence and increased bombings in Northern Ireland. The new law gave the authorities the power to imprison people without trial. An inquest into their deaths has been taking place in Belfast since November. In a statement late on Thursday night, the Ballymurphy victims' families said they had been requesting a meeting with Mrs Bradley since she became the Northern Ireland secretary in January last year. ""Karen Bradley hasn't even replied to these requests,"" they said. The relatives of those killed at Ballymurphy in 1971 have called for Karen Bradley to resign PÃ¡draig Ã'Muirigh, a solicitor for the families, said he had been instructed by his clients to contact the attorney general about ""potential contempt issues that might arise"" from her comments. Ms Meehan said she understood the Ballymurphy families' position. ""They're sitting in court and they're listening to tales of their loved ones being riddled on the ground as they lay begging for help. ""They are probably very angry and would not have been able to come here to speak to Karen Bradley so I respect their decision."" Former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Hain said that if Mrs Bradley resigned it would not make any real difference to government policy in the region. He told the BBC's Inside Politics programme that her comments reflected a wider misunderstanding of the Northern Ireland conflict by the Conservative government. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' He accused the Conservatives of taking a partisan position by siding with unionism and claimed that Theresa May ""doesn't grip the Northern Ireland situation"" in the same way as previous prime ministers. In October, Lord Hain was one offour former Northern Ireland secretaries who wrote to Mrs Bradleyto express their concern about the government's handling of the legacy of the Troubles. Speaking onthe BBC's The View programme, Judith Thompson, the Northern Ireland victims' commissioner, said that some people affected by the Troubles were left in ""genuine shock"" by Mrs Bradley's remarks in the Commons. ""We can't move forward by having a bipolar political discourse, which is actually not one that is moved forward by a lack of honesty,"" added Ms Thompson. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his advice to Mrs Bradley would be: ""I think you're in the last-chance saloon on this. ""You really need to show that we can resolve these issues and move this process forward."" Bradley 'to deliver for those she hurt' Is Karen Bradley running out of road?

That attitude helped Ciara Rooney become one of the few fully-qualified female electricians in Northern Ireland - an achievement that resonates in particular on International Women's Day. Ciara found an interest in the industry through a family connection. ""My cousin had been speaking about how much he enjoyed his work and I thought, 'I'll give it a go',"" she explains. ""I did some work experience and I gained a lot of knowledge and practical experience and stuck with it."" During her studies, Ciara says she was very much outnumbered as she was the only woman in her year group. Ciara was the only woman in her year when she was studying to be an electrician That's not unusual, according to electrical regulator NICEIC. The body is hoping to change that trend through a bursary scheme for female electricians, which is being launched on Friday, International Women's Day. A 'circuit breaker' in her industry, Ciara says she was used to being around a lot of men as she grew up living with four brothers. ""At the start of the course, the boys tried to get a grasp of what they could and couldn't say around you,"" says Ciara. ""But after a few months, we were all friends and it was just normal."" Even after she qualified, Ciara says she never had any issues with male colleagues not accepting her. ""I used to work with the same squad and we would travel together, from job to job - they were like my brothers,"" she says. ""The odd time on site, you'd be dressed in yellow gear with the hood up and somebody would turn and say: 'Here mate, can you show me where the office is?' ""It would be funny then when I turned round and they realised."" Niamh Lynch started working in the industry in 2008 Niamh Lynch, from County Monaghan but working in Newry, says she ""fell into the job"" of an electrician. ""I had initially gone to college to do sports science and I just didn't like it,"" she says. ""I was doing a lot of GAA training at the time and I had planned to go to America, but the manager of my team said he didn't want to see me go, so he found me a job."" At the beginning, Niamh says she felt she had to work hard to prove herself. ""Some, not all, but some of the male employers didn't think I would be up for it, or that I would actually stick with it when it came to asking for apprenticeships,"" she says. ""But when they saw my work, that changed."" Niamh says there are very few women in the industry, but that she hopes this will change Like Ciara, Niamh was the only girl to study the trade in her year. ""It's a really interesting industry with many different aspects and avenues to it,"" she adds. ""A lot of people perceive construction and trades as being dirty and hard work - it can be, but it's not always like that."" Now a training assessor at the Northern Regional College, Ciara hopes to encourage more women to get involved in the industry. ""I couldn't recommend it highly enough as a career - and I wouldn't let anyone or thing put you off it,"" she said. ""I haven't seen another girl on a course yet, but hopefully that will change in the near future. ""It's a fantastic trade to have and you can travel anywhere in the world with it. ""So it's certainly worth looking at apprenticeships. ""Come in, qualify and make the best life you can with the trade.""

"Head teacher Siobhan Lowe mans the tills in the school canteen A head teacher says she has had to scrub the toilets, clean the school and work in the canteen because of school funding shortages on schools. Siobhan Lowe, head of Tolworth Girls' School in Surbiton, south London, spoke of the embarrassment of not being able to fund support for her pupils. She says she has already sold off land, cut subjects and a deputy head post to stay afloat, as budgets tightened. It comes as thousands of heads have highlighted worsening funding gaps. About 7,000 head teachers in England have written to 3.5 million parents saying that schools are facing a ""funding crisis"". They say they are angry that the education secretary has refused to meet them to discuss the issue. They say requests to talk to Damian Hinds were turned down because his time is too ""pressurised"" to meet, and that this suggested he was ""in denial"" about the cash issues facing schools. But the Department for Education said it was ""fundamentally untrue"" to say funding was not a priority. A department spokesman said Mr Hinds had negotiated an extra Â£750m for schools and was ""putting a strong case to the Treasury ahead of the next spending review"". But Ms Lowe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had been forced to make a ""phenomenal amount of cuts"" in every area of her school. ""I've reduced the number of teaching groups, I've reduced the number of options that students have, I've increased class sizes, I've cut critical services such as student support workers who work with our most vulnerable,"" she said. ""I personally have cleaned the school, washed the toilets, served in the school canteen."" She added: ""My girls are looking at me and feeling so sorry for me that they're actually picking up the Hoover and doing it with me."" Ms Lowe added she had just Â£10 per pupil per year to fund basic needs like books, and that parents were having to pay for things such as printing. ""As a head teacher, you're almost embarrassed to admit you can't support the students in your school,"" she continued. ""But why am I embarrassed? It's not my embarrassment. ""It's due to the fact that I'm not given the money to provide for the students."" Jules White, West Sussex head teacher and organiser of the schools funding campaign letter, said: ""When thousands of heads are all saying the same thing, it seems incredible that ministers are too busy to meet. ""Families have a right to know that our efforts to improve things are falling on deaf ears. ""Heads must now consider whether the refusal to meet us is either a complacent act of denial or simply a deliberate snub."" Reality Check: Is government spending record amounts on schools? Schools facing 'financial cliff edge', says think tank Head teachers stage polite protest over funding School funding 'exaggerated' by ministers, says statistics watchdog The joint letter sent home to parents, warning of the impact of cash shortages, quotes a letter to head teachers rejecting a request to talk to the education secretary or Schools Minister Nick Gibb. blaming prioritising ministerial business. Head teachers staged a ""relentlessly reasonable"" protest march in Westminster The letter is being sent to parents in areas including Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, some London boroughs, Surrey, Kent, Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk and Cumbria. The WorthLess? campaign group sending the letters staged an unprecedentedhead teachers' protest march in Westminsterlast September, with the slogan ""relentlessly reasonable"". A DFE spokesperson said the education secretary met teachers and unions ""on a regular basis"". There have been repeated complaints from schools about funding shortages, with the Institute for Fiscal Studiesshowing that per pupil spending had fallen in real terms by 8% since 2010. Earlier this year, the Education Policy Institute said almost a third of local authority secondary schools in England were unable to cover their costs, with the proportion of these schools in the red almost quadrupling in four years. This weekMPs debated school funding, after a petition warning of funding cuts received 100,000 signatures. The government has acknowledged that schools can face extra pressures, such as support for children with mental health problems, but says funding is continuing to rise to record levels. This week, however, Labour MP Jess Phillips shared a message from her son's school in Birmingham, warning that it might have toclose early on Fridays to save money. And in February, a school in Stockport said it would introduce ahalf day on Friday because of ""unsustainable"" finances. Catharine Darnton, head of Gillotts School, in Henley, Oxfordshire, said her school was also seeing rising pupil numbers without funding for more staff. Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner school in New Malden, Surrey, said schools ""now spend a significant sum and a huge amount of time on supporting students and families with all sorts of non-educational issues"", which had to come out of already over-stretched budgets. The Department for Education defended its record on school spending, saying it was at its ""highest-ever level, rising from almost Â£41bn in 2017-18 to Â£43.5bn by 2019-20"".

"This video can not be played How does ash dieback develop? A deadly fungus is spreading ""more quickly and lethally"" through the UK's ash trees than experts had anticipated, BBC Wales has learnt. Millions of diseased trees near buildings, roads and railways will have to be cut down. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) warned of a ""very significant impact"" on the landscape. The Welsh government announced it was setting up an expert group to advise on the issue. Landowners are already paying out thousands of pounds to hire tree surgeons, temporary traffic lights and other equipment to deal with the problem - known as ash dieback. One described the situation as a ""tragedy"". A recent survey - which split the UK into 10km grid squares - found infections had been confirmed across 80% of Wales, 68% of England, 32% of Northern Ireland and 20% of Scotland. Gavin Hogg has already felled 75 trees on his estate near Brecon Gavin Hogg, who owns the Penpont Estate near Brecon, Powys, said all the ash trees on his 2,000 acres (809 hectares) were showing signs of the incurable disease. It kills younger plants and weakens more established trees, making them vulnerable to other infections. He has already felled about 75 trees which were close to a main road. ""We have such a massive problem we are going to deal with the public safety issue first,"" he said. ""Instead of having a steady tree management programme we are now entering into crisis management where trees are being identified as dangerous and will need to come down."" Ash dieback can leave trees with a diseased trunk Wales has been particularly affected by the spread of ash dieback,which was first identified in the UK in 2012 Its proper name is Chalara dieback, named after a fungus calledChalara fraxinea Symptoms include lesions at the base of dead side shoots, wilting and lost leaves and a killing off of new growth on mature trees The disease is spread by released spores and has swept across Europe over the past 20 years, affecting about 70% of ash in woodland Ash is an important species for nesting birds, insects and fungus It does not pose a risk to human or animal health Dr Chris Jones, tree protection officer for NRW, said it was now ""endemic"". ""We're finding it in woodlands, we're finding it in roadside trees, we're finding it in hedgerows right across Wales."" He said it was important landowners - including local authorities - started to plan ahead and budget for any felling that may be required. However, for trees situated in places where they do not pose a risk to safety, the current advice is that they should be left standing in order to identify any that may show signs of resistance to the fungus. Sonia Winder says the speed and extent of the spread had not been anticipated Sonia Winder of Tillhill Forestry explained that ash trees preferred deep soil and a damp climate which meant they had thrived in Wales. The company she works for manages 50,000 acres (20,000 hectares) of woodland and is increasingly advising clients on how to deal with cases of ash dieback. ""I think everybody has been caught on the backfoot a little bit by the speed of the spread and the extent of it,"" she said. ""It has spread more quickly and more lethally than we had been led to believe in the beginning. ""If you've got trees that are close to buildings or schools or roads and you're looking at taking them down it can be very expensive and at the moment there is no help for that from Welsh Government or anybody else to assist with those costs."" Ash woodlands 'may flourish again' How orchards could help ash recover Q&A: Ash dieback Ms Winder added that ash dieback was now at a level where it could be compared with Dutch elm disease, which wiped out the vast majority of elm trees in the UK in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. As an iconic, widely recognised species, found in parks and gardens up and down the country, she said that the ash tree's loss would have a ""significant impact"". The Woodland Trust added its importance to wildlife should also not be underestimated and that planting more native trees in its place should be prioritised. The Welsh Government said it was working closely with NRW to set up an Ash Dieback Awareness Group. ""We are developing this group to discuss and communicate the latest research, management options, progress of the disease in Wales and the rest of the UK,"" said a spokesman. It is also contributing to the Tree Council's Ash Dieback action plan, which outlines ways local authorities can help manage the disease. The plan is set to be launched at the National Botanical Gardens in Carmarthenshire at the end of March.

"Scotland's largest teachers' union has called off its planned strike ballot after an improved pay offer was made. The ballot of EIS members was due to get under way on Monday. However, the new offer from the Scottish government was discussed by the union's national council this morning and the union will urge members to accept it. The EIS is calling the development a ""significant success for Scotland's teachers."" Scotland's Education Secretary John Swinney said he had ""looked again"" at the pay offer and decided to ""increase the funding"". The new offer is for: A 3% rise effective from last April A 7% rise this April A further 3% rise next April This represents a compound increase of 13.51% over the course of the three years. The offer means a teacher who has not been promoted could earn more than Â£41,000 by next year -  about Â£5,000 more than they earn just now. The EIS received a letter outlining the new offer this morning ahead of a meeting of its national council. The 11th-hour improvement follows a campaign by the EIS which has continued for more than a year. EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said, ""The EIS launched the Value Education, Value Teachers campaign in January last year, with the aim of securing a fair pay settlement for Scotland's teachers. ""Throughout the campaign, it became increasingly clear that - in addition to pay - teachers also have serious concerns about issues such as the recruitment and retention of teachers, professional development, workload, and the level of support for pupils with Additional Support Needs. ""These issues then became a factor in the ongoing discussions via the SNCT."" Mr Flanagan said the offer also includes; additional commitments aimed at tackling workload supporting teacher professional development and enhancing the teacher leadership programme. He added: ""Taking all of these elements together, it represents a package that the EIS is now recommending to Scotland's teachers. ""This offer represents a significant success for Scotland's teachers, and for Scottish education. It has been secured through strong campaigning under the Value Education, Value Teachers banner, and delivered through the committed collective stand taken by Scotland's teachers. ""By standing together and remaining united, our members have secured a strong deal for Scotland's teachers which will also deliver stability and security for Scottish education."" Education minister Mr Swinney welcomed the union's decision to suspend the ballot. He said: ""The Scottish government and Cosla made a strong offer to teachers which, by a narrow margin, was rejected. Given the importance we place on valuing teachers and improving the attractiveness of the profession, I have looked again at the investment the Scottish government is making."" Mr Swinney believed that the fresh offer would provide the ""stability we need to make the reform Scotland's education system needs and deliver the best possible outcomes for our young people"". The NASUWT union intends to ballot its members on strike action later this month over concerns which include pay and workload. However, because of the size of the EIS, if its members accept the pay offer there would appear to be no possibility of change to this latest offer. By Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland education correspondent Campaigning included a rally in George Square Strike action is the ultimate weapon for any trade union. For professionals like teachers, it can be a particularly difficult step to take. Some in the profession today remember the bitter, long-running teachers dispute of the 1980s all too well - either as young teachers or as pupils. To maintain the analogy of a strike as the nuclear option, some in the profession were clearly hopeful that moving to ""Defcon 1"" - the imminent threat of action - would prove enough to secure an improved pay offer. And so it has proved. Two previous pay offers had previously been described as final. The government and councils clearly pulled out all the stops to avoid a teachers' strike. The Scottish government wants to be judged on education. It knew all too well that few would judge its record on actual education policy if they saw teachers on a picket line and children getting days off school. Both sides will be hoping now that the debate can move back on to education policy and practice - efforts to raise attainment and close the gap between how well children from relatively rich and poor backgrounds do. Genuine disagreements still exist - not least over standardised assessments in Primary 1. Unions will be keen to ensure that efforts to deal with concerns about workload and resourcing are about more than good intent. But after a 14 month campaign, it looks like peace has broken out.

"This video can not be played WATCH: SpaceX Dragon capsule returns to Earth after ISS mission America's new commercial astronaut capsule has completed its demonstration flight with a successful splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean. The SpaceX Dragon vehicle left the International Space Station after being docked there for the past week, and re-entered Earth's atmosphere. It had a heat-shield to protect it from the high temperatures of re-entry. Four parachutes brought it into ""soft contact"" with water about 450km from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The mission - which had no humans aboard, only a dummy covered in sensors - went according to plan. The Dragon has set the stage for the US space agency Nasa to approve the vehicle for crewed flights. This video can not be played ISS astronaut Anne McClain went inside the Dragon capsule Not since the end of the Space Shuttle programme has the US been able to send its own astronauts into orbit. It has had to rely instead on Russia and its Soyuz spacecraft, launching from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Nasa hopes to bring this near-eight year gap in capability to an end with the introduction of two new commercial transportation systems - the Dragon and another vehicle being developed by aerospace giant Boeing. The first crewed flight of the Dragon could occur as soon as July, although this target date is likely to slip into the summer as engineers work through the post-flight analysis. Splashdown occurred at about 08:45 EST (13:45 GMT). A boat, called GO Searcher, was waiting to recover the capsule. There were cheers at mission control as the capsule landed in the Atlantic. The Dragon's owner, SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk, had previously expressed some anxiety about how the capsule would cope with re-entry, given that the vehicle's backshell, or conical upper-section, has a somewhat irregular shape that could lead to a roll instability at hypersonic speeds. The director of crew mission management at Space X, Benjamin Reed, spoke to Nasa TV moments after the capsule splashed down. ""It was an incredible journey to get to this moment,"" he said. ""The teams have just done an amazing job - both the Space X and the Nasa teams jointly. ""I can't believe how well the whole mission has gone. Pretty much everything at every point everything's been nailed all the way."" Nasa has seed-funded Boeing to produce a capsule of its own called the Starliner. This vehicle is scheduled to have its uncrewed demonstration flight in April or soon after. Ultimately, Nasa will be purchasing seats in both the SpaceX and Boeing systems to take its astronauts to the ISS. But the commercial nature of the relationship means the companies will be free to sell rides to secondary customers. These will no doubt include the space agencies of other nations, but perhaps some private space companies and individuals too. ""We're driving down costs for low-Earth orbit; we're commercialising low-Earth orbitâ¦ with human activities where Nasa can be a customer. And then we can use the tax-payer resources that are bestowed upon us to do exploration, to go further, to go back to the Moon sustainably,"" said Nasa chief Jim Bridenstine. ""We want to stay at the Moon and ultimately go on to Mars."" The GO Searcher vessel was tasked with picking Dragon crew capsules out of the water Nasa has already selected its first astronauts to fly aboard a crewed Dragon. They are Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley. ""We have a significant amount of training we need to go through that will walk through all the various phases of flight,"" Behnken said of the coming months. This will include understanding what to do if there is an emergency during their mission. One problem that could occur is a failure of the Dragon's carrier rocket during the ascent to orbit. The demonstration capsule's lift-off last Saturday was picture perfect, but some kind of booster anomaly can never be discounted. In such a scenario, a Dragon's powerful thrusters would push it away from the launcher to safety. Bob Behnken (L) and Doug Hurley will be the first crew to ride a Dragon SpaceX will practise this very procedure shortly. The team plans to take the current Dragon after its return and put it on another rocket and launch it out of the Kennedy Space Center. A minute into this flight, a deliberate abort will be commanded. The timing is significant because it's when the vehicle is experiencing maximum aerodynamic pressure. If the Dragon can stably depart in such circumstances, it ought be able to handle an escape at any stage in a flight. As with the present demo, no-one will be aboard for this hazardous test. The capsule will be used again during the upcoming in-flight abort test Dragon capsule docks with space station SpaceX capsule demo flight lifts off Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain fires Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"A spate of knife crime in England has been linked to an increase in the number of young people excluded from school. But in Scotland - where just five pupils were permanently removed from the classroom in 2017 - knife violence has fallen. Why has Scotland's school exclusion rate dropped - and has it had a real impact on crime? Official statistics,externalshow that more than 18,000 children were temporarily removed from their classroom in 2016/17. Just five young people were excluded permanently or ""removed from the register"". Exclusions of all kinds have dropped by 59% since 2006/07, when 44,794 children were suspended from school - 248 of them on a permanent basis. The statistics relate to publicly-funded local authority schools in Scotland, not grant-aided or independent schools, or early-learning and childcare establishments. However in EnglandDepartment for Education figures,externalshow that permanent exclusions increased by 56% between 2013/14 and 2016/17. The number of permanent exclusions across all state-funded primary, secondary and special schools stood at 7,720 in 2016/17. Reality Check: Why are 1,000 children being expelled? Young people in Scotland can only be excluded from school in the most extreme circumstances. And councils are duty-bound to provide a school education to all excluded pupils - whether that is in another local school, a school in a different education authority, or at an alternative location to school. A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said: ""We are committed to ensuring that all children and young people get the support that they need to reach their full learning potential with a focus on prevention and early intervention. ""Pupils are not 'removed from the roll' in Scotland and we expect children continue to receive an education while excluded, either at another school or alternative location."" She added: ""Our approach to knife crime, also focusing on early intervention and prevention with young people, is recognised across the UK and internationally as making a real difference in keeping people safer."" For many young people facing exclusion, their behaviour has been a ""cry for help"". Meg Thomas, who works with schools in Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, said pupils can be communicating stress they are experiencing at home. If they are excluded and sent back home, they return to that stressful place. It can also put them at risk of sexual and criminal exploitation. Ms Thomas works for Includem, a third-sector organisation that supports young people in challenging circumstances. She said that when students are at risk of exclusion, Includem often join meetings which are held with social workers, health staff, police officers. They try to uncover the root of the difficult behaviour, to help the young person understand the consequences of their actions and their own emotions. She may discover that they have experienced trauma, witnessed domestic abuse or they undiagnosed health problems. And it allows the school to understand how they can best help the student - without resorting to exclusion. Ms Thomas says it is a system which works but Includem currently only works in a small number of Scottish local authority areas. ""We need to stop getting kids excluded because we know it mean they stop entering the criminal justice system,"" she said. ""If we put the money in the right place at the right time, it will have long term cost savings across Scotland."" Research by Edinburgh University academics has found that young people who were excluded from school were much more likely to be end up in the criminal justice system and prison. But Prof Susan McVie, one of the authors of theEdinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime,external, said the link with knife crime was less clear. ""There is a connection in the sense that people who are excluded from school are more likely to be involved in carrying weapons,"" she said. They found that young people who carried weapons were twice as likely to be excluded from school as those who did not carry weapons. ""But when we looked at a whole raft of factors that might impact on whether people carried weapons, school exclusion actually turned out to be quite marginal,"" Prof McVie added. ""It wasn't the most important thing in terms of explaining people's behaviour."" Are school exclusions causing knife crime? Excluded pupils 'sucked into knife crime' How Scotland stemmed the tide of knife crime She said young people who self-harmed were more likely to carry weapons, as were those who were poorly supervised by their parents and those who felt socially-marginalised in their communities. Although there has been a reduction in violent crime in Scotland and school exclusions, she said it was very difficult to prove a causal connection. And she suggested that Scotland's experience proved there was not one single solution to the apparent surge in knife crime in England. ""We have seen big reductions in violent crime in parts of Scotland where it was very, very high,"" she said. ""But it's worth also saying we've seen big reductions in violence where it wasn't very high. It not just what was done in Glasgow around the violence reduction unit that has been effective, there's a whole raft of things, of which reducing school exclusion was one. ""But better education, better youth work, better employment opportunities for young people - there's a whole raft of things and there's no one single solution.""

"This video can not be played PM Theresa May: ""Now is the moment for us to act"" Theresa May has asked the EU for ""one more push"" to get her Brexit deal through Parliament and warned that, if it fails, ""we may never leave at all"". The prime minister said the UK had tabled ""serious"" proposals to resolve the deadlock over the Irish backstop. Warning of a ""moment of crisis"" if the deal was rejected again, the PM told EU leaders: ""Let's get it done."" The EU said it would give ""legal force"" to assurances already made that the UK could not be stuck in a customs union. Setting out the EU's position on Twitter, chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""not interested in the blame game"" and talks would continue over the weekend. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said what the EU was offering amounted to a ""legal beefing-up of existing promises"". Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and the DUP, the party Mrs May's government relies on for a majority in Parliament, were both dismissive of Mr Barnier's proposal. Mr Barclaytweeted,external: ""With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments. The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides"" While Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of the DUP, said Mr Barnier's proposal regarding the backstop ""disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity"" of the UK, and it was neither ""realistic nor sensible"". He said the EU's proposal ""demonstrates that they have a one-sided approach and a lack of understanding about the divisions in Northern Ireland"". The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Deadline looms as UK pushes for Brexit deal No breakthrough in Brexit talks, says EU MPs will vote for a second time on the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the EU on Tuesday - after it wasdefeated by a historic marginin a Commons vote in January. If they reject it again, they will get the option of either leaving without a deal or delaying the exit date. In a speech to a green energy firm in Lincolnshire, Mrs May said she understood the ""genuine concerns"" about the backstop but appealed to MPs to recognise that the deal as a whole respected the 2016 referendum result and would ensure the UK's long-term prosperity. ""Back it and the UK will leave the EU,"" she said. ""Reject it and no-one knows what will happen. We may not leave the EU for many months. We may leave without the protections a deal provides, we may never leave at all."" It was in neither side's interest to prolong the uncertainty by ""carry on arguing"" about Brexit, she said, claiming any delay beyond 29 March only risked ""creating new problems"". ""It needs one more push to address the specific concerns of our Parliament,"" she said. ""So let's not hold back and do what is necessary for MPs to back the deal. ""Because if MPs reject the deal, nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis."" She suggested the British people, to whom Brexit ""belonged"", had ""moved on"" and ""are ready for this to be settled"", adding: ""Everyone now wants to get it done."" But former Conservative minister Dominic Grieve, who backs a referendum to endorse the terms of Brexit, said it was ""hard to see"" how Parliament would agree to the current deal. Speaking at the Scottish Labour conference, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister sounded ""desperate"" in her speech. ""If she cannot get her botched Brexit deal through Parliament next week, it will represent an unprecedented failure in British political history. ""The utter mess the government has made of the Brexit negotiations, and their reckless abandon when it comes to people's jobs and livelihoods, is absolutely unforgiveable. ""Having already failed once to get her deal through, I want to make it clear to the PM that if she fails again, it will be the end of the road for her deal."" The SNP said the deal on offer was ""fundamentally flawed"" and would damage the Scottish economy. ""Theresa May must stop passing the buck and take personal responsibility for the Brexit crisis created as a result of her own intransigence,"" said its Westminster leader Ian Blackford. Thefirst Commons vote, in January, saw the deal rejected by 432 votes to 202, the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. Mrs May is seeking legally enforceable changes to the backstop - a controversial insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - but there have been few visible signs of progress. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Leading Brexiteers are looking for reassurances that the backstop - which would see the UK aligned with EU customs rules until the two sides' future relationship is agreed or alternative arrangements worked out - will not endure indefinitely. On Friday the EU said it was prepared to include a number of existing commitments relating to the application of the backstop in a legally-binding document. Michel Barnier tweeted that the UK ""will not be forced into [a] customs union against its will"" as it could choose to exit the proposed ""single customs territory"" on its own. But Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs territory, subject to many of its rules and regulations - something the government has previously said would threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK. There will also be a reminder that the UK can suspend parts of the backstop if an independent arbitration panel rules that the EU is not behaving in good faith. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was ""not really a concession"" as the suggestion that Great Britain could leave the backstop - and become free to diverge from EU rules - while leaving Northern Ireland behind, had already been rejected. Any extension to the Article 50 process, under which the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, would need the unanimous approval of the EU. Two former prime ministers, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, have called for a delay of a year to allow for a ""public consultation"" on the way ahead and to ensure an orderly exit. But Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against any delay, tellingNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast: ""Wherever we are, and I very much hope we land it with a deal, but if we don't get a deal and we exit without a deal, Britain will succeed and thrive - I don't have a moment's doubt about that. ""But we need to deliver Brexit and ensure that's it's done. I personally believe 29th March is the best day for making sure that is delivered upon.""

"US President Donald Trump's ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort has been given a 47-month prison sentence for fraud. He was convicted last year of hiding millions of dollars of income earned by his political consulting in Ukraine. The charges stem from an inquiry into alleged Russian election meddling in the 2016 US elections. None of Manafort's charges relate to allegations of collusion with Russia. Mr Trump has always denied the charge, describing the inquiry as a witch hunt. The 47-month sentence is far shorter than what was recommended by US Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Mueller is thought to be finishing up his 22-month investigation, which has dogged the Trump presidency. Manafort entered court wearing a green prison jumpsuit and in a wheelchair Manafort, 69, is due to be sentenced in another case next week related to his illegal lobbying. His sentencing marks a spectacular downfall for a Republican political guru who advised four US presidents, including Mr Trump, and foreign leaders. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Manafort - who will receive credit for time served - must also pay $24m (Â£18m) in restitution and a $50,000 fine. He addressed the court on Thursday evening in Alexandria, Virginia, saying ""the last two years have been the most difficult of my life"". ""To say I am humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement,"" he added, asking the judge to be ""compassionate"". He described his life as ""professionally and financially in shambles"". Judge TS Ellis said he was surprised that Manafort did not ""express regret for engaging in wrongful conduct"". The formerly dapper lobbyist - who entered the court wearing a green prison jumpsuit and in a wheelchair - was impassive as he learned his fate. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words What does the special counsel do? America's most mysterious public figure Judge Ellis said sentencing guidelines cited by prosecutors calling for between 19.5 and 24 years in prison were ""excessive"" compared to sentences for similar crimes. ""The government cannot sweep away the history of all these previous sentences,"" he said. ""Clearly the guidelines were way out of whack on this."" He added that Manafort had lived an ""otherwise blameless"" life where he ""earned the admiration of a number of people"". Many Democrats have reacted to the sentence with disappointment. US Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, said Manafort had ""led far from a 'blameless life'"". Allow Twitter content?

He added that he was ""not advocating for worse treatment for all"", but wished his clients would get the ""same treatment as the privileged few"". News website USA Today points out that, in the district where Manafort was sentenced,those convicted of fraud are normally jailed for an average of 36 months,external. Legal experts,externalhave also pointed out thatJudge Ellis has a history of criticising mandatory minimum sentences,external- including those for drug and gun crimes - as he believes judges should have more discretion over jail sentences. What might 'Mueller report' look like? Five big things Mueller is looking at Manafort pictured with Donald Trump at the Republican convention in July 2016 A jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted Manafort last August of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of failing to declare a foreign bank account. The judge, however, declared a mistrial on 10 other fraud-related charges. Manafort was indicted for hiding $55m in offshore bank accounts in Cyprus, money he was paid as a political consultant for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians. Prosecutors say Manafort failed to pay more than $6m in taxes, as he funded his opulent lifestyle, including a $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket and a luxury renovation of his mansion in the Hamptons. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? Manafort served three months as Trump's campaign chairman until August 2016, when he was forced to resign over his previous work in Ukraine. He was the first former Trump aide to be arrested in the special counsel investigation, in October 2017. Who's who in the Russia-Trump inquiry? His legal team has previously said he suffers from debilitating foot pain resulting from gout as a result of his incarceration. Manafort will be held in a federal facility in Cumberland, Maryland Manafort's bail was revoked for alleged witness-tampering and he has been held in solitary confinement for nine months. When news of the solitary confinement first emerged it caused controversy, with commentators describing it as a form of ""torture"". Manafort's lawyers acknowledged thatthe solitary confinement was put in place to guarantee Manafort's safety,external, but argued that he should not have been detained at all. They said Manafort was ""locked in his cell for at least 23 hours per day"" and could not adequately prepare his defence. Mr Mueller saidManafort had enjoyed privileges in solitary confinement,externalincluding ""a private, self-contained living unit, which is larger than other inmates' units, his own bathroom and shower facility, his own personal telephone, and his own workspace to prepare for trial."" According to court filings submitted by Mr Mueller's team, Mr Manafort said on monitored phone calls from jail that he was ""being treated like a 'VIP'"". Manafort has not been charged with anything related to the special counsel's investigation into an alleged Russian plot to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Manafort's lawyers had argued that the charges were outside the special counsel's remit. However, Democrats point out that a Washington DC judge last month backed the special counsel's contention that Manafort lied about his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, an aide alleged to have ties to Russian intelligence. In February, Manafort's lawyers inadvertently revealed in a court filing that their client had shared polling data about the 2016 Trump campaign with Mr Kilimnik. The president's critics also highlight that Manafort was present at a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between campaign staff and a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer promising ""dirt"" on then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump's biggest headache might not be Mueller During sentencing the judge noted that the charges do not relate to alleged Russian meddling, leading to Mr Trump to claim vindication in a tweet mischaracterising the judge's remarks.

Manafort is due to be sentenced next Wednesday in another case brought by the special counsel, this time in Washington DC. He pleaded guilty in September to two felony counts - conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice - related to his lobbying. He also agreed to co-operate with the special counsel inquiry in a deal for a possible lighter sentence. However, just two months later that plea deal collapsed as investigators said Manafort had repeatedly lied to the government. He faces a maximum of 10 years in the case. President Trump, who frequently denounces the Mueller investigation, has not ruled out granting a presidential pardon to Manafort. He said in November: ""I wouldn't take it off the table."" The special counsel is expected any day to submit his report to the US attorney general The special counsel is expected soon to submit his report to US Attorney General William Barr. The political world is feverishly anticipating findings on whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia, or if Mr Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the inquiry. Mr Trump has denied collusion and obstruction and Russia has denied election interference. Five other Trump aides have been charged in connection with Mr Mueller's investigation. None have been indicted with criminally conspiring to subvert the 2016 election. Former campaign staff Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen have all pleaded guilty.

"This video can not be played How does ash dieback develop? A deadly fungus is spreading ""more quickly and lethally"" through the UK's ash trees than experts had anticipated, BBC Wales has learnt. Millions of diseased trees near buildings, roads and railways will have to be cut down. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) warned of a ""very significant impact"" on the landscape. The Welsh government announced it was setting up an expert group to advise on the issue. Landowners are already paying out thousands of pounds to hire tree surgeons, temporary traffic lights and other equipment to deal with the problem - known as ash dieback. One described the situation as a ""tragedy"". A recent survey - which split the UK into 10km grid squares - found infections had been confirmed across 80% of Wales, 68% of England, 32% of Northern Ireland and 20% of Scotland. Gavin Hogg has already felled 75 trees on his estate near Brecon Gavin Hogg, who owns the Penpont Estate near Brecon, Powys, said all the ash trees on his 2,000 acres (809 hectares) were showing signs of the incurable disease. It kills younger plants and weakens more established trees, making them vulnerable to other infections. He has already felled about 75 trees which were close to a main road. ""We have such a massive problem we are going to deal with the public safety issue first,"" he said. ""Instead of having a steady tree management programme we are now entering into crisis management where trees are being identified as dangerous and will need to come down."" Ash dieback can leave trees with a diseased trunk Wales has been particularly affected by the spread of ash dieback,which was first identified in the UK in 2012 Its proper name is Chalara dieback, named after a fungus calledChalara fraxinea Symptoms include lesions at the base of dead side shoots, wilting and lost leaves and a killing off of new growth on mature trees The disease is spread by released spores and has swept across Europe over the past 20 years, affecting about 70% of ash in woodland Ash is an important species for nesting birds, insects and fungus It does not pose a risk to human or animal health Dr Chris Jones, tree protection officer for NRW, said it was now ""endemic"". ""We're finding it in woodlands, we're finding it in roadside trees, we're finding it in hedgerows right across Wales."" He said it was important landowners - including local authorities - started to plan ahead and budget for any felling that may be required. However, for trees situated in places where they do not pose a risk to safety, the current advice is that they should be left standing in order to identify any that may show signs of resistance to the fungus. Sonia Winder says the speed and extent of the spread had not been anticipated Sonia Winder of Tillhill Forestry explained that ash trees preferred deep soil and a damp climate which meant they had thrived in Wales. The company she works for manages 50,000 acres (20,000 hectares) of woodland and is increasingly advising clients on how to deal with cases of ash dieback. ""I think everybody has been caught on the backfoot a little bit by the speed of the spread and the extent of it,"" she said. ""It has spread more quickly and more lethally than we had been led to believe in the beginning. ""If you've got trees that are close to buildings or schools or roads and you're looking at taking them down it can be very expensive and at the moment there is no help for that from Welsh Government or anybody else to assist with those costs."" Ash woodlands 'may flourish again' How orchards could help ash recover Q&A: Ash dieback Ms Winder added that ash dieback was now at a level where it could be compared with Dutch elm disease, which wiped out the vast majority of elm trees in the UK in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. As an iconic, widely recognised species, found in parks and gardens up and down the country, she said that the ash tree's loss would have a ""significant impact"". The Woodland Trust added its importance to wildlife should also not be underestimated and that planting more native trees in its place should be prioritised. The Welsh Government said it was working closely with NRW to set up an Ash Dieback Awareness Group. ""We are developing this group to discuss and communicate the latest research, management options, progress of the disease in Wales and the rest of the UK,"" said a spokesman. It is also contributing to the Tree Council's Ash Dieback action plan, which outlines ways local authorities can help manage the disease. The plan is set to be launched at the National Botanical Gardens in Carmarthenshire at the end of March.

"US President Donald Trump's ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort has been given a 47-month prison sentence for fraud. He was convicted last year of hiding millions of dollars of income earned by his political consulting in Ukraine. The charges stem from an inquiry into alleged Russian election meddling in the 2016 US elections. None of Manafort's charges relate to allegations of collusion with Russia. Mr Trump has always denied the charge, describing the inquiry as a witch hunt. The 47-month sentence is far shorter than what was recommended by US Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Mueller is thought to be finishing up his 22-month investigation, which has dogged the Trump presidency. Manafort entered court wearing a green prison jumpsuit and in a wheelchair Manafort, 69, is due to be sentenced in another case next week related to his illegal lobbying. His sentencing marks a spectacular downfall for a Republican political guru who advised four US presidents, including Mr Trump, and foreign leaders. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Manafort - who will receive credit for time served - must also pay $24m (Â£18m) in restitution and a $50,000 fine. He addressed the court on Thursday evening in Alexandria, Virginia, saying ""the last two years have been the most difficult of my life"". ""To say I am humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement,"" he added, asking the judge to be ""compassionate"". He described his life as ""professionally and financially in shambles"". Judge TS Ellis said he was surprised that Manafort did not ""express regret for engaging in wrongful conduct"". The formerly dapper lobbyist - who entered the court wearing a green prison jumpsuit and in a wheelchair - was impassive as he learned his fate. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words What does the special counsel do? America's most mysterious public figure Judge Ellis said sentencing guidelines cited by prosecutors calling for between 19.5 and 24 years in prison were ""excessive"" compared to sentences for similar crimes. ""The government cannot sweep away the history of all these previous sentences,"" he said. ""Clearly the guidelines were way out of whack on this."" He added that Manafort had lived an ""otherwise blameless"" life where he ""earned the admiration of a number of people"". Many Democrats have reacted to the sentence with disappointment. US Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, said Manafort had ""led far from a 'blameless life'"". Allow Twitter content?

He added that he was ""not advocating for worse treatment for all"", but wished his clients would get the ""same treatment as the privileged few"". News website USA Today points out that, in the district where Manafort was sentenced,those convicted of fraud are normally jailed for an average of 36 months,external. Legal experts,externalhave also pointed out thatJudge Ellis has a history of criticising mandatory minimum sentences,external- including those for drug and gun crimes - as he believes judges should have more discretion over jail sentences. What might 'Mueller report' look like? Five big things Mueller is looking at Manafort pictured with Donald Trump at the Republican convention in July 2016 A jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted Manafort last August of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of failing to declare a foreign bank account. The judge, however, declared a mistrial on 10 other fraud-related charges. Manafort was indicted for hiding $55m in offshore bank accounts in Cyprus, money he was paid as a political consultant for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians. Prosecutors say Manafort failed to pay more than $6m in taxes, as he funded his opulent lifestyle, including a $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket and a luxury renovation of his mansion in the Hamptons. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? Manafort served three months as Trump's campaign chairman until August 2016, when he was forced to resign over his previous work in Ukraine. He was the first former Trump aide to be arrested in the special counsel investigation, in October 2017. Who's who in the Russia-Trump inquiry? His legal team has previously said he suffers from debilitating foot pain resulting from gout as a result of his incarceration. Manafort will be held in a federal facility in Cumberland, Maryland Manafort's bail was revoked for alleged witness-tampering and he has been held in solitary confinement for nine months. When news of the solitary confinement first emerged it caused controversy, with commentators describing it as a form of ""torture"". Manafort's lawyers acknowledged thatthe solitary confinement was put in place to guarantee Manafort's safety,external, but argued that he should not have been detained at all. They said Manafort was ""locked in his cell for at least 23 hours per day"" and could not adequately prepare his defence. Mr Mueller saidManafort had enjoyed privileges in solitary confinement,externalincluding ""a private, self-contained living unit, which is larger than other inmates' units, his own bathroom and shower facility, his own personal telephone, and his own workspace to prepare for trial."" According to court filings submitted by Mr Mueller's team, Mr Manafort said on monitored phone calls from jail that he was ""being treated like a 'VIP'"". Manafort has not been charged with anything related to the special counsel's investigation into an alleged Russian plot to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Manafort's lawyers had argued that the charges were outside the special counsel's remit.

"The fire gutted the famous Mackintosh Building in June 2018 Glasgow School of Art (GSA) has been criticised by MSPs in a report into the fire which devastated the Mackintosh Building last year. Holyrood's culture committee said the school did not give sufficient priority to safeguarding the building. The blaze ripped through ""The Mack"" in June 2018 as a Â£36m restoration project, following a major fire four years earlier, was nearing completion. The GSA said it intended to ""learn lessons"" from the report. The MSPs also said a full public inquiry should be held into the circumstances surrounding the two fires at the building. Thecommittee's report,externalconcluded that prior to the first fire in 2014, the art school had not addressed the heightened risk of fire to the Mackintosh Building or carried out an adequate risk assessment. The Mackintosh building was devastated by fire just months before it was due to reopen The committee was particularly concerned about the length of time taken for a modern mist suppression system to be installed. Such a system was still not in place when the second fire broke out. Committee convener Joan McAlpine said: ""The board of Glasgow School of Art were custodians of this magnificent building, one of the most significant to Scotland's rich cultural heritage. ""They had a duty to protect Mackintosh's legacy. ""Glasgow School of Art must learn lessons from its role in presiding over the building, given that two devastating fires occurred within their estate in such a short space of time."" MSPs were also told during their inquiry that ventilation ducts which allowed the fire to take hold in 2014 were still in place at the time of last year's blaze. They had been due to be rectified at the end of the restoration project. The report also urged the GSA to take steps to repair a ""loss of trust"" with the local community. Responding to the report, Glasgow School of Art said: ""There are always lessons that can be learned, and we are happy to take forward the most appropriate and helpful as we bring this much-loved building back to life."" However, it said there were some ""factual inaccuracies"" in the report. It also added: ""The Mackintosh Building is a national (indeed international) treasure, but it is not lost and it will certainly return."" The Mackintosh Library was destroyed in the first blaze in November 2014 Representatives from Historic Environment Scotland told the hearing they could not offer any financial support for a new build of the Mackintosh building as grants are for the repair and conservation of existing historic fabric. However, bosses at the art school have said they are confident that it will be rebuilt. The committee made a number of recommendations about protecting other historically significant buildings, including: Reviewing the remit of Historic Environment Scotland (HES), giving it extended statutory powers to intervene in cases where there is a risk to an asset of national significance A review of Category A listed buildings with unique cultural or historic significance to discover if steps need to be taken to mitigate the risk of fire A Scottish government review of the powers to compel owners to put in place enhanced fire safety measures to protect buildings of national significance. Deputy convener Claire Baker added: ""If anything positive at all should come out of the loss of the Mackintosh it should be that further protection is put in place for some of Scotland's most significant historical buildings. ""Throughout our investigation, it has been clear that there are weaknesses in the policy protecting our heritage. This is why the Committee has set out some very clear steps that must be taken in order to prevent any further loss. ""Particularly key to this is giving Historic Environment Scotland further powers to intervene where there is a serious fire risk to some of Scotland's most important buildings.""

"This video can not be played PM Theresa May: ""Now is the moment for us to act"" Theresa May has asked the EU for ""one more push"" to get her Brexit deal through Parliament and warned that, if it fails, ""we may never leave at all"". The prime minister said the UK had tabled ""serious"" proposals to resolve the deadlock over the Irish backstop. Warning of a ""moment of crisis"" if the deal was rejected again, the PM told EU leaders: ""Let's get it done."" The EU said it would give ""legal force"" to assurances already made that the UK could not be stuck in a customs union. Setting out the EU's position on Twitter, chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""not interested in the blame game"" and talks would continue over the weekend. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said what the EU was offering amounted to a ""legal beefing-up of existing promises"". Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and the DUP, the party Mrs May's government relies on for a majority in Parliament, were both dismissive of Mr Barnier's proposal. Mr Barclaytweeted,external: ""With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments. The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides"" While Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of the DUP, said Mr Barnier's proposal regarding the backstop ""disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity"" of the UK, and it was neither ""realistic nor sensible"". He said the EU's proposal ""demonstrates that they have a one-sided approach and a lack of understanding about the divisions in Northern Ireland"". The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Deadline looms as UK pushes for Brexit deal No breakthrough in Brexit talks, says EU MPs will vote for a second time on the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the EU on Tuesday - after it wasdefeated by a historic marginin a Commons vote in January. If they reject it again, they will get the option of either leaving without a deal or delaying the exit date. In a speech to a green energy firm in Lincolnshire, Mrs May said she understood the ""genuine concerns"" about the backstop but appealed to MPs to recognise that the deal as a whole respected the 2016 referendum result and would ensure the UK's long-term prosperity. ""Back it and the UK will leave the EU,"" she said. ""Reject it and no-one knows what will happen. We may not leave the EU for many months. We may leave without the protections a deal provides, we may never leave at all."" It was in neither side's interest to prolong the uncertainty by ""carry on arguing"" about Brexit, she said, claiming any delay beyond 29 March only risked ""creating new problems"". ""It needs one more push to address the specific concerns of our Parliament,"" she said. ""So let's not hold back and do what is necessary for MPs to back the deal. ""Because if MPs reject the deal, nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis."" She suggested the British people, to whom Brexit ""belonged"", had ""moved on"" and ""are ready for this to be settled"", adding: ""Everyone now wants to get it done."" But former Conservative minister Dominic Grieve, who backs a referendum to endorse the terms of Brexit, said it was ""hard to see"" how Parliament would agree to the current deal. Speaking at the Scottish Labour conference, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister sounded ""desperate"" in her speech. ""If she cannot get her botched Brexit deal through Parliament next week, it will represent an unprecedented failure in British political history. ""The utter mess the government has made of the Brexit negotiations, and their reckless abandon when it comes to people's jobs and livelihoods, is absolutely unforgiveable. ""Having already failed once to get her deal through, I want to make it clear to the PM that if she fails again, it will be the end of the road for her deal."" The SNP said the deal on offer was ""fundamentally flawed"" and would damage the Scottish economy. ""Theresa May must stop passing the buck and take personal responsibility for the Brexit crisis created as a result of her own intransigence,"" said its Westminster leader Ian Blackford. Thefirst Commons vote, in January, saw the deal rejected by 432 votes to 202, the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. Mrs May is seeking legally enforceable changes to the backstop - a controversial insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - but there have been few visible signs of progress. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Leading Brexiteers are looking for reassurances that the backstop - which would see the UK aligned with EU customs rules until the two sides' future relationship is agreed or alternative arrangements worked out - will not endure indefinitely. On Friday the EU said it was prepared to include a number of existing commitments relating to the application of the backstop in a legally-binding document. Michel Barnier tweeted that the UK ""will not be forced into [a] customs union against its will"" as it could choose to exit the proposed ""single customs territory"" on its own. But Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs territory, subject to many of its rules and regulations - something the government has previously said would threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK. There will also be a reminder that the UK can suspend parts of the backstop if an independent arbitration panel rules that the EU is not behaving in good faith. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was ""not really a concession"" as the suggestion that Great Britain could leave the backstop - and become free to diverge from EU rules - while leaving Northern Ireland behind, had already been rejected. Any extension to the Article 50 process, under which the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, would need the unanimous approval of the EU. Two former prime ministers, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, have called for a delay of a year to allow for a ""public consultation"" on the way ahead and to ensure an orderly exit. But Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against any delay, tellingNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast: ""Wherever we are, and I very much hope we land it with a deal, but if we don't get a deal and we exit without a deal, Britain will succeed and thrive - I don't have a moment's doubt about that. ""But we need to deliver Brexit and ensure that's it's done. I personally believe 29th March is the best day for making sure that is delivered upon.""

"Ayub Hassan was described as ""very kind and handsome"" by a family friend Four people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a teenage boy was stabbed to death in west London. Seventeen-year-old Ayub Hassan was found with multiple stab wounds to the chest in Lanfrey Place, West Kensington, on Thursday afternoon. He was taken to hospital but died soon after. His family has been informed. The Met said four teenagers had been arrested on suspicion of murder and are in custody. Two of them are aged 15, and the other suspects are 17 and 18. Four males aged 18, 17, 15 and 15 have been arrested on suspicion of murder Ayub was a former student at West London College who said they were ""deeply saddened"" by his death. ""We wish to convey our heartfelt condolences to his family and many friends as they deal with the tragic loss of a loved one,"" a spokeswoman for the college said. Flowers have been laid near where the 17-year-old was found Neighbour Rosie Hayes said she noticed ""a group of four guys"" near her home who ""started calling for help"" so she and another person went to assist them where they found the victim. ""They were upset and maybe a little bit aggressive too. There was obviously a bit of an argument going on... they didn't know how to deal with the situation,"" she said. Amina Osman, who said she was a family friend, described the 17-year-old as ""very kind and handsome"". While laying flowers at the scene, she told reporters this was ""the fourth attempt on his life."" Flowers have been laid near where the 17-year-old was found Ch Supt Rob Jones said the killing would have a ""devastating effect... not only on the victim's loved ones, but also on the wider community"". He added there would be a heightened visible police presence in the area ""to prevent any potential further incidents.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: SpaceX Dragon capsule returns to Earth after ISS mission America's new commercial astronaut capsule has completed its demonstration flight with a successful splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean. The SpaceX Dragon vehicle left the International Space Station after being docked there for the past week, and re-entered Earth's atmosphere. It had a heat-shield to protect it from the high temperatures of re-entry. Four parachutes brought it into ""soft contact"" with water about 450km from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The mission - which had no humans aboard, only a dummy covered in sensors - went according to plan. The Dragon has set the stage for the US space agency Nasa to approve the vehicle for crewed flights. This video can not be played ISS astronaut Anne McClain went inside the Dragon capsule Not since the end of the Space Shuttle programme has the US been able to send its own astronauts into orbit. It has had to rely instead on Russia and its Soyuz spacecraft, launching from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Nasa hopes to bring this near-eight year gap in capability to an end with the introduction of two new commercial transportation systems - the Dragon and another vehicle being developed by aerospace giant Boeing. The first crewed flight of the Dragon could occur as soon as July, although this target date is likely to slip into the summer as engineers work through the post-flight analysis. Splashdown occurred at about 08:45 EST (13:45 GMT). A boat, called GO Searcher, was waiting to recover the capsule. There were cheers at mission control as the capsule landed in the Atlantic. The Dragon's owner, SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk, had previously expressed some anxiety about how the capsule would cope with re-entry, given that the vehicle's backshell, or conical upper-section, has a somewhat irregular shape that could lead to a roll instability at hypersonic speeds. The director of crew mission management at Space X, Benjamin Reed, spoke to Nasa TV moments after the capsule splashed down. ""It was an incredible journey to get to this moment,"" he said. ""The teams have just done an amazing job - both the Space X and the Nasa teams jointly. ""I can't believe how well the whole mission has gone. Pretty much everything at every point everything's been nailed all the way."" Nasa has seed-funded Boeing to produce a capsule of its own called the Starliner. This vehicle is scheduled to have its uncrewed demonstration flight in April or soon after. Ultimately, Nasa will be purchasing seats in both the SpaceX and Boeing systems to take its astronauts to the ISS. But the commercial nature of the relationship means the companies will be free to sell rides to secondary customers. These will no doubt include the space agencies of other nations, but perhaps some private space companies and individuals too. ""We're driving down costs for low-Earth orbit; we're commercialising low-Earth orbitâ¦ with human activities where Nasa can be a customer. And then we can use the tax-payer resources that are bestowed upon us to do exploration, to go further, to go back to the Moon sustainably,"" said Nasa chief Jim Bridenstine. ""We want to stay at the Moon and ultimately go on to Mars."" The GO Searcher vessel was tasked with picking Dragon crew capsules out of the water Nasa has already selected its first astronauts to fly aboard a crewed Dragon. They are Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley. ""We have a significant amount of training we need to go through that will walk through all the various phases of flight,"" Behnken said of the coming months. This will include understanding what to do if there is an emergency during their mission. One problem that could occur is a failure of the Dragon's carrier rocket during the ascent to orbit. The demonstration capsule's lift-off last Saturday was picture perfect, but some kind of booster anomaly can never be discounted. In such a scenario, a Dragon's powerful thrusters would push it away from the launcher to safety. Bob Behnken (L) and Doug Hurley will be the first crew to ride a Dragon SpaceX will practise this very procedure shortly. The team plans to take the current Dragon after its return and put it on another rocket and launch it out of the Kennedy Space Center. A minute into this flight, a deliberate abort will be commanded. The timing is significant because it's when the vehicle is experiencing maximum aerodynamic pressure. If the Dragon can stably depart in such circumstances, it ought be able to handle an escape at any stage in a flight. As with the present demo, no-one will be aboard for this hazardous test. The capsule will be used again during the upcoming in-flight abort test Dragon capsule docks with space station SpaceX capsule demo flight lifts off Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain fires Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"Andy Hill was known as ""The Prof"" by colleagues at BA and the RAF Andrew Hill has been cleared of 11 counts of manslaughter after crashing an eight-tonne jet on to a busy road in a failed aerobatic loop. Who is the pilot at the centre of the deadliest air show disaster in Britain in more than 60 years? Eighteen months before Andy Hill crashed an ex-military jet and killed 11 men outside the Shoreham Airshow, the former RAF and British Airways pilot's aerobatic prowess featured in an episode of ITV drama Midsomer Murders. His home-built plane simulated an out-of-control dive, in which the pilot narrowly avoided a crowd of spectators after pushing his aircraft to the limit. An air traffic controller warned the fictional pilot: ""You are headed for the crowds."" It would prove to be a tragic foreshadowing. When the 1950s Hawker Hunter struck queuing traffic on 22 August 2015, it became the deadliest air show accident in Britain since31 people lost their lives at Farnborough in 1952,external. For Mr Hill, who miraculously escaped with his life after being thrown from the cockpit, it was a dark chapter in a decades-long love affair with flying. ""He has aviation fuel running through his veins,"" said Sean Maffett, an air show commentator who regularly worked with Mr Hill. ""He is an extraordinary man, there is no question about it."" This video can not be played Shoreham Airshow pilot simulated mayday flight Andrew Grenville Hill, who was born in March 1964, was educated at the prestigious Tonbridge School in Kent and began his flying career aged 17 when he took to the skies as part of a Royal Navy scholarship. A little over three years later, in 1984, he joined the RAF, fresh from the University Air Squadron at Cambridge University, where he had studied computer science at Christ's College. His record shows him to be among the most skilled of his peers and, in his own words, he was ""creamed off the top"" to fly a Harrier jump jet - viewed as one of the most difficult planes to master. ""The Harrier Force was the top of the pile - that's where the best guys went,"" said Bob Marston, a former Harrier flying instructor and RAF pilot of more than 40 years, and the author of Harrier Boys. ""They have to have the best physical co-ordination to master the aeroplane and they need workload capacity to be able to multitask."" Stationed in West Germany in the final throes of the Cold War, his days would likely have been taken up flying training drills from camouflaged launch sites, preparing to strike ""Soviet tanks coming en masse over the border from East Germany"", Mr Marston said. Mr Hill flew the Harrier jet during his time in the RAF Mr Hill later flew preventative sorties out of Incirlik, Turkey, as part of the northern Iraq no-fly zone intended to protect Iraqi Kurds from Saddam Hussein's forces after the First Gulf War. Within three years of joining the RAF, he had qualified to instruct new pilots in the use of the Jet Provost and went on to teach basic flying skills to new recruits at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire. However, he did not only excel in the air. Combining his twin passions of computing and aviation, Mr Hill developed a digital version of the Harrier's operating manual that was cleared for use by the MoD. ""That was an exceptional piece of work,"" said Maj George Bacon, who flew for both the RAF and the Army Air Corps in a career spanning more than four decades. Shoreham Airshow pilot acquitted over deaths 'As soon as I wake up every day I miss him' Shoreham pilot in TV mayday flight Mr Hill was an ""outstandingly talented pilot and he is of course a very intelligent man as well,"" he said. ""It probably makes him a little more introvert than the average... probably verging on the nerdy."" This sideline in computer programming was presumably the source of his nickname, ""The Prof"", that had its origins in the RAF but would follow him into his commercial career with British Airways, which he joined in 1996, after a year with Virgin. He was promoted to captain six years later, flying passenger jets on both short and long-haul flights around the world. Mr Hill captained an Airbus jetliner for British Airways For Mr Hill, aviation was more than a day job. In 2003, he began once again to pilot the Jet Provost, flying a former military model from an airfield in North Weald, Essex, and soon began instructing civilian pilots. In late 2005, together with his wife Ellen, a fellow BA pilot, he embarked on a self-build project, assembling a single-engine plane in the double garage of their home. The couple documented their progress on a now-deleted website, uploading stage-by-stage photos as they assembled the parts of the Van's RV8, which were shipped from the manufacturer in Oregon. Having completed the plane, which bore the registration tag ""G-Hilz"" on its wing, in October 2007, Mr Hill regularly flew from his Hertfordshire farmhouse, using it to commute to North Weald Airfield. BBC News has learned that he took off and landed on a 500-metre grass field next to his home near Sandon. The RV8Tors garnered fans with their close-quarters aerobatic displays In 2008, he obtained permission from the Civil Aviation Authority to perform aerobatic displays in the home-built plane. With experienced display pilot Alister Kay, he launched a two-man formation flying team, known as the RV8Tors, a punning portmanteau of ""RV8"" and ""aviators"". The pair flew their matching planes at air shows and weddings, describing their ""daredevil"" performances as ""thrilling and unforgettable"". By 2012, they were estimated to have flown in front of nearly three million people. The duo's fast-paced formations picked up a devout following on the air show circuit and they became known for their signature finale, a smoke-trail heart. Air show regulars were among the more than 1,900 people to join a Facebook group, entitled Support for Andy Hill, in the days after the crash. Alongside supportive messages, which continued throughout the trial, members of the group sent cards to the Hills' home address and even posed beside a Hawker Hunter holding a banner that read ""Get well soon, Andy Hill"" three months after the crash. Andy Hill's self-built plane simulated an out-of-control flight on ITV's Midsomer Murders Mr Hill had begun to fly the Hawker Hunter with a display group called Team Viper in 2011. The outfit was led by Dan Arlett, who was described at Mr Hill's trial as one of the RAF's most experienced fighter pilots who now helps prepare the next generation of frontline airman by posing as hostile aircraft in simulated dogfights. Giving evidence during the trial, Mr Arlett, an RAF squadron leader, said Mr Hill was ""probably the most diligent of all the team"". He told the jury that air show pilots flew well-drilled displays, within the confines of their abilities. ""You are not showcasing yourself,"" he said. ""You are showcasing the aircraft."" The Hawker Hunter, seen here during the Aden Emergency in 1967, flew in conflicts throughout the second half of the 1900s So, why does a commercial airline pilot, who has unlimited access to a plane that can take off and land on a personal airstrip, spend his weekends flying public displays? ""Going to air shows is quite a lot of hassle,"" said Mr Maffet, who is known as the official commentator of the Vulcan bomber. ""It's hard work and there is no money in it. I think the fascination with flying is such that people do get the bug. ""They can do this extraordinary stuff that most of us mere mortals can't begin to understand. I think that's what it is that drives them on."" The two weeks before the crash demonstrate Hill's dedication, performing eight displays at five different air shows. In the 90 days before, he flew in 33 displays and practice displays. While he was renowned among air show fans for his dazzling aerobatics, he was known for more mundane reasons to his BA colleagues, who preserved his military nickname, The Prof. Showing technical savvy first displayed when he digitised the Harrier's manual, Mr Hill designed a software package that allowed BA pilots to automatically book their desired shifts. Known as EasyBid, it was used by more than 1,900 pilots at its peak. Mr Hill first displayed a Hawker Hunter with Team Viper Catherine Burton, the most experienced female BA captain at the time of her retirement in 2017, said that, as a result of the software, he was more widely known than a typical pilot. ""At one point, I'd guess at least 75% of our pilots were his customers,"" she said. ""He was well-liked for his excellent customer service in the software line."" But the evidence of the Crown Prosecution Service was at odds with the picture of the conscientious and scholarly pilot. During the trial, prosecutors pointed to previous air shows at which Mr Hill allegedly infringed rules, withone display drawn to a halt over safety fears,external. He was, the court heard,""reckless"" and ""cavalier"". Mr Hill denied allegations that, during the 2015 Shoreham display, heknowingly committed to the diveand engaged the plane's ""flaps"" in an attempt tocomplete a tighter loop, instead of abandoning the manoeuvre when it became clear he was too low. So, with all his experience and technical knowledge, did Mr Hill believe he could get away with what, to most pilots, would appear impossible? Mr Bacon doesn't think so. ""I wouldn't conclude that,"" he said. ""I've never known him as an arrogant person."" Mr Hill was said to have been living in a ""period of purgatory"" since waking from a coma in September 2015 He was thrown from the cockpit of the Hawker Hunter after it crashed Mr Hill has not spoken publicly about the disaster - save for giving evidence at his own trial - and those closest to him have declined to comment. Mr Bacon, who has kept in regular touch with Mr Hill since he came out of a coma in September 2015, said he had been living in a ""period of purgatory"". ""At one stage when I was chatting to him I almost thought this guy was close to having a complete breakdown and may even be close to taking his own life,"" he said. ""I think he has had to work really hard to give himself enough confidence to even stand on the witness stand."" In the intervening years, his life in the sky has been on hold and neither of his two pilot licences is currently valid. Now cleared of manslaughter by gross negligence, he is free to walk from court and may soon be back in the cockpit. ""Frankly, I think he will probably have a very quiet life,"" Mr Bacon said. ""He'll carry on flying in his spare time, but I doubt that he will go back to fast jet displays."" Shoreham pilot cleared over crash deaths Turn Blue Monday Orange at Littlehampton Wave!

"Head teacher Siobhan Lowe mans the tills in the school canteen A head teacher says she has had to scrub the toilets, clean the school and work in the canteen because of school funding shortages on schools. Siobhan Lowe, head of Tolworth Girls' School in Surbiton, south London, spoke of the embarrassment of not being able to fund support for her pupils. She says she has already sold off land, cut subjects and a deputy head post to stay afloat, as budgets tightened. It comes as thousands of heads have highlighted worsening funding gaps. About 7,000 head teachers in England have written to 3.5 million parents saying that schools are facing a ""funding crisis"". They say they are angry that the education secretary has refused to meet them to discuss the issue. They say requests to talk to Damian Hinds were turned down because his time is too ""pressurised"" to meet, and that this suggested he was ""in denial"" about the cash issues facing schools. But the Department for Education said it was ""fundamentally untrue"" to say funding was not a priority. A department spokesman said Mr Hinds had negotiated an extra Â£750m for schools and was ""putting a strong case to the Treasury ahead of the next spending review"". But Ms Lowe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had been forced to make a ""phenomenal amount of cuts"" in every area of her school. ""I've reduced the number of teaching groups, I've reduced the number of options that students have, I've increased class sizes, I've cut critical services such as student support workers who work with our most vulnerable,"" she said. ""I personally have cleaned the school, washed the toilets, served in the school canteen."" She added: ""My girls are looking at me and feeling so sorry for me that they're actually picking up the Hoover and doing it with me."" Ms Lowe added she had just Â£10 per pupil per year to fund basic needs like books, and that parents were having to pay for things such as printing. ""As a head teacher, you're almost embarrassed to admit you can't support the students in your school,"" she continued. ""But why am I embarrassed? It's not my embarrassment. ""It's due to the fact that I'm not given the money to provide for the students."" Jules White, West Sussex head teacher and organiser of the schools funding campaign letter, said: ""When thousands of heads are all saying the same thing, it seems incredible that ministers are too busy to meet. ""Families have a right to know that our efforts to improve things are falling on deaf ears. ""Heads must now consider whether the refusal to meet us is either a complacent act of denial or simply a deliberate snub."" Reality Check: Is government spending record amounts on schools? Schools facing 'financial cliff edge', says think tank Head teachers stage polite protest over funding School funding 'exaggerated' by ministers, says statistics watchdog The joint letter sent home to parents, warning of the impact of cash shortages, quotes a letter to head teachers rejecting a request to talk to the education secretary or Schools Minister Nick Gibb. blaming prioritising ministerial business. Head teachers staged a ""relentlessly reasonable"" protest march in Westminster The letter is being sent to parents in areas including Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, some London boroughs, Surrey, Kent, Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk and Cumbria. The WorthLess? campaign group sending the letters staged an unprecedentedhead teachers' protest march in Westminsterlast September, with the slogan ""relentlessly reasonable"". A DFE spokesperson said the education secretary met teachers and unions ""on a regular basis"". There have been repeated complaints from schools about funding shortages, with the Institute for Fiscal Studiesshowing that per pupil spending had fallen in real terms by 8% since 2010. Earlier this year, the Education Policy Institute said almost a third of local authority secondary schools in England were unable to cover their costs, with the proportion of these schools in the red almost quadrupling in four years. This weekMPs debated school funding, after a petition warning of funding cuts received 100,000 signatures. The government has acknowledged that schools can face extra pressures, such as support for children with mental health problems, but says funding is continuing to rise to record levels. This week, however, Labour MP Jess Phillips shared a message from her son's school in Birmingham, warning that it might have toclose early on Fridays to save money. And in February, a school in Stockport said it would introduce ahalf day on Friday because of ""unsustainable"" finances. Catharine Darnton, head of Gillotts School, in Henley, Oxfordshire, said her school was also seeing rising pupil numbers without funding for more staff. Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner school in New Malden, Surrey, said schools ""now spend a significant sum and a huge amount of time on supporting students and families with all sorts of non-educational issues"", which had to come out of already over-stretched budgets. The Department for Education defended its record on school spending, saying it was at its ""highest-ever level, rising from almost Â£41bn in 2017-18 to Â£43.5bn by 2019-20"".

"The 1984-85 miners' strike saw a heavy police presence at the picket lines Did undercover police officers infiltrate the National Union of Mineworkers during the 1980s strike? Former miners hope that question will be answered by the current public inquiry into covert policing in the UK. The suspicion that specially-trained police spies were active in Wales during the 1984-85 strike has hung over mining communities for years. One former senior NUM member says he knows of at least one person who left Wales suddenly once the strike ended. In 1968 the Metropolitan Police set up an undercover unit called the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS). Part of Special Branch, its purpose was to infiltrate protest groups. After it emerged in 2013 that SDS officers hadspied on the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, Theresa May - then Home Secretary - set up the Undercover Policing Inquiry (UCPI) into how covert policing operations were run. The NUM has been given core participant status at the inquiry, along with organisations like London Greenpeace, Reclaim the Streets and Cardiff Anarchist Network. Core participants can give evidence and hope to find out if, and to what extent, they were spied on. Undercover policing inquiry 'to take eight years' Miners' strike police inquiry 'would have been a witch hunt' Strikers' phones were monitored, papers reveal One former high-ranking miners' representative told BBC Wales Investigates he believes a handful of specially-trained undercover officers were active in Wales during the miners' strike. Tyrone O'Sullivan, former NUM branch secretary, says he and other miners are convinced that undercover officers infiltrated their ranks during the strike - and were feeding information to the police, and ultimately back to the government. Former NUM branch chairman Tyrone O'Sullivan believes police were trained to infiltrate the miners ""We were a huge threat (to the government). They spent billions to defeat us,"" said Mr O'Sullivan. ""They tapped our phones, they infiltrated into us. That didn't happen because of the strike, it started years before. ""You can't do it (infiltrate the community) a week before the strike - you can do it two years before the strike. You can be part of the community that way."" Mr O'Sullivan, now chairman of Goitre Anthracite Ltd, owners of Tower Colliery near Hirwuan, says he has strong suspicions about one individual, who he is not naming. ""Definitely now, at the time no, but with what happened after the strike we thought there was a reason for this. He'd gone away too soon, he'd left too soon. He'd left a girl he had made so many promises to. ""I think it was very well organised - it wasn't the PC up the street. This was a far larger organisation. These people were trained purposely not only to undermine miners but to infiltrate everything."" Former Labour minister Kim Howells, who was an official for the south Wales miners during the strike, said there were ""conspiracy theories around"" during the time, including that people's phones were being tapped. ""We just assumed that they were listening or else that there were people within the ranks of miners or miners' families who the police were getting information from,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Good Morning Walesprogramme. The Metropolitan Police declined to comment on the NUM allegations, as they are part of the UCPI. Thepublic inquiry,external, which began in 2015, is not expected to publish its findings until at least 2023.

"Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe denies the charge of plotting against the Iranian government The decision by the British government to give Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe formal diplomatic protection marks a significant escalation in the UK's campaign to secure the release of the British-Iranian dual national who is detained in Tehran. It is an extremely rare diplomatic and legal move that signals the UK is no longer treating the case as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran. It means that the government believes Iran's treatment of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - her lack of access to due process and medical treatment - has failed to meet international standards. As such, she should be given the formal protection of the British state. So when British diplomats raise her case with Iranian counterparts in the future, they will no longer be representing just the interests of a UK citizen but also those of the British state. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Iran 'tried to get jailed mum to spy on UK' This theoretically opens up the possibility of Britain taking some kind of international legal action against Iran. This could range from requesting inquiries, demanding negotiations, even suing for compensation for an ""internationally wrongful act"". But Foreign Office sources indicated they were unlikely to go down this route. Few diplomats want the case snarled up in the International Court of Justice for many years. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran when she was visiting her parents with he infant daughter Instead, the assertion of diplomatic protection will give the UK new ways of raising the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe in international forums like the United Nations. Most countries prefer to avoid getting involved in bilateral rows about complicated consular cases. But now this has been elevated to a formal state-to-state dispute, Britain can look for allies on the international stage to put collective pressure on Tehran. So what British diplomats hope is that this sends a clear signal to Iran that this issue is not going away, that the UK government is determined to keep pushing for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, and that it is prepared to escalate the dispute in the face of Tehran's intransigence. The 41-year-old has dual British and Iranian citizenship The granting of diplomatic protection will have no immediate impact on Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's conditions in jail in Tehran. It is not the same as the diplomatic immunity given to envoys and diplomats to ensure their safe passage and protection from prosecution in a foreign land. And the mechanism cannot be used to force Iran to do anything. But what diplomats hope is that it will focus minds in Tehran, not just in the foreign ministry but also among the hardliners whom officials believe will ultimately decide Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's future. Mr Hunt met Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter, Gabriella, during a visit to Iran in November last year Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that diplomatic protection ""is unlikely to be a magic wand that leads to an overnight result"". But he said it showed the whole world that ""Nazanin is innocent and the UK will not stand by when one of its citizens is treated so unjustly"". The question now will be how Iran responds. Officials say Iran does not like being put under international pressure. And there is always a risk that this plunges relations between Tehran and London into the deep freeze. This is one reason why the British government has, until now, been reluctant to play the diplomatic protection card, fearing that it might make things worse. But diplomats say that the lack of any progress and the refusal of Iran even to give Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe the proper medical treatment she needs has left them with little choice but to escalate. They say Iran will not be surprised by the British move. The question is whether it will respond positively to the pressure or step up the confrontation. Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has told the BBC that Iran forced her to sign a false confession before allowing her to fly home to the UK. She was freed in March, along with fellow British-Iranian national Anoosheh Ashoori, six years after being arrested on spying charges. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe said the Iranian authorities would not let her board her plane home until she had signed the last-minute false confession. A UK official was with her when she signed the statement ""under duress"", she told the BBC. The former political prisoner said she wanted to make sure people knew she had been forced to sign, to prevent the Iranian regime from exploiting her ""dehumanising"" confession. I was forced to sign a false confession - Nazanin Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran while visiting the country with her daughter Gabriella in 2016. Before her arrest, she lived in London with her daughter and husband. She worked as a project manager for the charity Thomson Reuters Foundation and had been previously employed by BBC Media Action, an international development charity. Iranian authorities alleged Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was plotting to topple the government in Tehran, but no official charges were ever made public. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said she was leading a ""foreign-linked hostile network"", and sentenced her to five years in prison. She has always denied the accusations she faced, and insisted she had taken her baby daughter to visit her parents and celebrate the Iranian new year. Both the Thomson Reuters Foundation and BBC Media Action issued statements confirming that she was not working in Iran but was on holiday. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe spent the final year of her prison term on parole at her parents' home in Tehran. But in April 2021, shewas sentenced to a further year in prisonand a one-year travel ban, after being found guilty of propaganda against the Iranian government. Shesubsequently lost an appealagainst this second conviction. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was freed after months of talks between Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Iranian counterpart. Along withanother released British-Iranian, Anoosheh Ashoori, she arrived at RAF Brize Nortonin the early hours of Thursday 17 Marchthis year. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori shortly after disembarking at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire Anotherdual national prisoner, Morad Tahbaz, was briefly released on furlough at the same time, but returned to prison just two days later. It was claimed by Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard, that she was being held in order to force the UK into settling a multi-million pound dispute, which dates back to the 1970s. Iran said the UK owed Â£400m as a result of a cancelled order for 1,500 Chieftain tanks. Announcing Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, Ms Truss said this debt had been settled ""in parallel"", and ""in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations"". She said that negotiations had been taking place over the past few months with Iran, with the help of the Gulf state of Oman. Why has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe been freed now?

"This video can not be played Families of those who died have described the pain they have been through The pilot of a jet that crashed at the Shoreham Airshow killing 11 men has been found not guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. Andrew Hill's ex-military jet exploded in a fireball on the A27 in Sussex on 22 August 2015. The former RAF pilot, 54, denied deliberately beginning a loop manoeuvre despite flying too low and too slowly. Karim Khalil QC, defending, argued Mr Hill had been suffering from ""cognitive impairment"" when the jet crashed. Mr Hill, from Sandon, near Buntingford, Hertfordshire, was also formally acquitted of a count - that was not put in front of the jury - of negligently or recklessly endangering the safety of an aircraft. The Old Bailey jury deliberated for seven hours over three days and there were gasps from the families in the courtroom with many in tears as the verdicts were read out. Shoreham pilot: 'Aviation fuel runs through his veins' Who were the Shoreham air crash victims? Judge Mr Justice Edis told the relatives: ""I am enormously impressed and grateful for the dignified way you have all behaved. ""I can see that you are upset and you are absolutely entitled to be but despite being upset you have behaved in a way which does you great credit."" This video can not be played The Hawker Hunter crashed into A27 in Shoreham In a statement Sue and Phil Grimstone, whose son Matthew died in the crash, said: ""There seems to be no justice for our son Matthew and all 11 men who died in such tragic circumstances. The couple said the case had raised questions about the safety of aerobatic air displays ""when there is now doubt concerning any pilot's ability to avoid becoming cognitively impaired"". They added: ""Matthew had no interest in air shows, he could not have cared less. Knowing he died because an aircraft was being flown for fun, for the entertainment of others makes it even harder to bear."" Oliver Morriss, nephew of victim Mark Reeves, said his family felt ""complete devastation at the most surprising not guilty verdict"". He added: ""We feel that the success of Mr Hill's defence of cognitive impairment could establish a worrying precedent and have far-reaching consequences."" On the steps of the court, Mr Hill read out the names of all 11 victims and said: ""A number of people were injured. I'm truly sorry for the part I played in their deaths and it's they I will remember for the rest of my life."" This video can not be played Pilot Andy Hill acquitted over Shoreham Airshow deaths The court had heard the Hawker Hunter jet ""disintegrated"" upon impact, creating a ""massive fireball"" when it hit the ground. Mr Hill, a British Airways captain at the time, had been performing a manoeuvre known as a bent loop before his jet crashed on to the A27. Prosecutor Tom Kark QC, acknowledged Mr Hill was an experienced pilot but said he had been known to take risks and the jet was ""probably as much as 1,000ft below the height required"" at the top of the loop. The Old Bailey was told that the defendant had a ""cavalier attitude to safety"". But Mr Hill said he took a ""very structured, disciplined approach"" to display flying and sometimes held back from flights he was not comfortable with carrying out. The former RAF instructor claimed he had blacked out in the air, having experienced ""cognitive impairment"" brought on by hypoxia possibly due to the effects of G-force. He ""miraculously escaped"" when the aircraft broke up and he was thrown into a ditch, the jury heard. He suffered head injuries and fractures to his ribs and spine and was placed in an induced coma before being discharged a month later. The prosecution argued Andy Hill was flying too low to complete a manoeuvre while performing at the Shoreham Airshow in 2015 Mr Hill told the Old Bailey he had no memory from three days before the crash to when he woke from his coma and had spent the last three years ""trying to resolve what happened"". In 2017 a report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch found the disaster was caused by pilot error after the plane was too slow and too low during the loop manoeuvre. Rebecca Smith from Irwin Mitchell lawyers, which represents 17 people affected by the crash, including some bereaved families and of the injured, said: ""Attention will now to turn to the inquest where the entirety of the Shoreham Airshow tragedy can be fully examined."" Sarah Stewart, a partner at Stewarts, who represent many of the bereaved families, called for a wider investigation. ""The bereaved families have had to painfully re-live the circumstances of their loved ones' death again and again. ""The families want answers and a verdict will go some way towards that. But it is only one part of the jigsaw."" The organisers of the Shoreham Airshow have denied any responsibility for the crash. Colin Baker, director of the event, said: ""I feel pretty satisfied that what we did in the preparation for the air show and during the air show was all that could be done. ""We very much regret what happened but I really don't think we could have done anything different prior to the accident to avoid it.""

"Mr Ghosn was seen in overalls and orange reflective braces A lawyer for former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn has apologised for disguising his client in a workman's outfit to leave Japanese detention. Takashi Takano said his ""amateur plan"" had backfired. Mr Ghosn was widely identified and photographed as he left prison on bail on Wednesday. Afterwards, the getup - overalls, a cap and a face mask - was derided on Japanese TV and online. Mr Ghosn is charged with financial misconduct and breach of trust. He denies all wrongdoing.

"A spate of knife crime in England has been linked to an increase in the number of young people excluded from school. But in Scotland - where just five pupils were permanently removed from the classroom in 2017 - knife violence has fallen. Why has Scotland's school exclusion rate dropped - and has it had a real impact on crime? Official statistics,externalshow that more than 18,000 children were temporarily removed from their classroom in 2016/17. Just five young people were excluded permanently or ""removed from the register"". Exclusions of all kinds have dropped by 59% since 2006/07, when 44,794 children were suspended from school - 248 of them on a permanent basis. The statistics relate to publicly-funded local authority schools in Scotland, not grant-aided or independent schools, or early-learning and childcare establishments. However in EnglandDepartment for Education figures,externalshow that permanent exclusions increased by 56% between 2013/14 and 2016/17. The number of permanent exclusions across all state-funded primary, secondary and special schools stood at 7,720 in 2016/17. Reality Check: Why are 1,000 children being expelled? Young people in Scotland can only be excluded from school in the most extreme circumstances. And councils are duty-bound to provide a school education to all excluded pupils - whether that is in another local school, a school in a different education authority, or at an alternative location to school. A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said: ""We are committed to ensuring that all children and young people get the support that they need to reach their full learning potential with a focus on prevention and early intervention. ""Pupils are not 'removed from the roll' in Scotland and we expect children continue to receive an education while excluded, either at another school or alternative location."" She added: ""Our approach to knife crime, also focusing on early intervention and prevention with young people, is recognised across the UK and internationally as making a real difference in keeping people safer."" For many young people facing exclusion, their behaviour has been a ""cry for help"". Meg Thomas, who works with schools in Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, said pupils can be communicating stress they are experiencing at home. If they are excluded and sent back home, they return to that stressful place. It can also put them at risk of sexual and criminal exploitation. Ms Thomas works for Includem, a third-sector organisation that supports young people in challenging circumstances. She said that when students are at risk of exclusion, Includem often join meetings which are held with social workers, health staff, police officers. They try to uncover the root of the difficult behaviour, to help the young person understand the consequences of their actions and their own emotions. She may discover that they have experienced trauma, witnessed domestic abuse or they undiagnosed health problems. And it allows the school to understand how they can best help the student - without resorting to exclusion. Ms Thomas says it is a system which works but Includem currently only works in a small number of Scottish local authority areas. ""We need to stop getting kids excluded because we know it mean they stop entering the criminal justice system,"" she said. ""If we put the money in the right place at the right time, it will have long term cost savings across Scotland."" Research by Edinburgh University academics has found that young people who were excluded from school were much more likely to be end up in the criminal justice system and prison. But Prof Susan McVie, one of the authors of theEdinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime,external, said the link with knife crime was less clear. ""There is a connection in the sense that people who are excluded from school are more likely to be involved in carrying weapons,"" she said. They found that young people who carried weapons were twice as likely to be excluded from school as those who did not carry weapons. ""But when we looked at a whole raft of factors that might impact on whether people carried weapons, school exclusion actually turned out to be quite marginal,"" Prof McVie added. ""It wasn't the most important thing in terms of explaining people's behaviour."" Are school exclusions causing knife crime? Excluded pupils 'sucked into knife crime' How Scotland stemmed the tide of knife crime She said young people who self-harmed were more likely to carry weapons, as were those who were poorly supervised by their parents and those who felt socially-marginalised in their communities. Although there has been a reduction in violent crime in Scotland and school exclusions, she said it was very difficult to prove a causal connection. And she suggested that Scotland's experience proved there was not one single solution to the apparent surge in knife crime in England. ""We have seen big reductions in violent crime in parts of Scotland where it was very, very high,"" she said. ""But it's worth also saying we've seen big reductions in violence where it wasn't very high. It not just what was done in Glasgow around the violence reduction unit that has been effective, there's a whole raft of things, of which reducing school exclusion was one. ""But better education, better youth work, better employment opportunities for young people - there's a whole raft of things and there's no one single solution.""

"A cot was seen taken to the area where baby Pearl was discovered in Heywood The mother of a baby girl whose body was found in woodland had faced police probes over the deaths of two of her other children, an inquest has heard. The baby, named Pearl by detectives, wasdiscovered in Bluebell Woodsin Heywood, Greater Manchester, in April. Four of Leah Howarth's children, including Pearl, were deceased with three investigated but no further action taken, Rochdale Coroner's Court heard. A coroner recorded a narrative verdict. Baby Pearl's parents Shane Hutchinson, 48, and Ms Howarth were arrested in July on suspicion of murder, concealing a birth and preventing a lawful burial but later released with no further action. It emerged during the hearing there was an investigation into the sudden and unexpected death of a child in 2001 and the body of a newborn baby boy found in a plastic bag in the bathroom of Ms Howarth's then home in Fleetwood, Lancashire, in 2015. Giving evidence at Pearl's inquest, Ms Howarth, 33, told the court she thought she had a miscarriage on 25 December 2017 in the caravan in Heywood she shared with her then boyfriend Mr Hutchinson. She told the coroner she was ""in and out of consciousness"" but recalled bleeding and did not believe she had had a baby. She said she had no idea how Pearl came to be at Bluebell Woods four months later. Mr Hutchinson said when he returned home to the caravan Ms Howarth had ""blood all over"" telling him she had had a miscarriage. He said he helped clean up the blood and flushed what he now knew to be the placenta down the toilet. When asked by the coroner how his daughter ended up in Bluebell Woods he replied: ""Because she put her there. ""No-one else knew about her daughter."" Pathologist Dr Charles Wilson told the inquest he did not believe Pearl's body had been at the woodland for long because decomposition would have been greater. The medical cause of death was unascertained. Recording a narrative verdict, Manchester North senior coroner Joanne Kearsley concluded Pearl was delivered on 25 December 2017 at between 32 and 40 weeks in a viable pregnancy but because of decomposition it was not possible to know whether she was born alive or stillborn. She added her delivery was concealed and she was stored in an unknown place until or around 4 April.

"The 1984-85 miners' strike saw a heavy police presence at the picket lines Did undercover police officers infiltrate the National Union of Mineworkers during the 1980s strike? Former miners hope that question will be answered by the current public inquiry into covert policing in the UK. The suspicion that specially-trained police spies were active in Wales during the 1984-85 strike has hung over mining communities for years. One former senior NUM member says he knows of at least one person who left Wales suddenly once the strike ended. In 1968 the Metropolitan Police set up an undercover unit called the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS). Part of Special Branch, its purpose was to infiltrate protest groups. After it emerged in 2013 that SDS officers hadspied on the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, Theresa May - then Home Secretary - set up the Undercover Policing Inquiry (UCPI) into how covert policing operations were run. The NUM has been given core participant status at the inquiry, along with organisations like London Greenpeace, Reclaim the Streets and Cardiff Anarchist Network. Core participants can give evidence and hope to find out if, and to what extent, they were spied on. Undercover policing inquiry 'to take eight years' Miners' strike police inquiry 'would have been a witch hunt' Strikers' phones were monitored, papers reveal One former high-ranking miners' representative told BBC Wales Investigates he believes a handful of specially-trained undercover officers were active in Wales during the miners' strike. Tyrone O'Sullivan, former NUM branch secretary, says he and other miners are convinced that undercover officers infiltrated their ranks during the strike - and were feeding information to the police, and ultimately back to the government. Former NUM branch chairman Tyrone O'Sullivan believes police were trained to infiltrate the miners ""We were a huge threat (to the government). They spent billions to defeat us,"" said Mr O'Sullivan. ""They tapped our phones, they infiltrated into us. That didn't happen because of the strike, it started years before. ""You can't do it (infiltrate the community) a week before the strike - you can do it two years before the strike. You can be part of the community that way."" Mr O'Sullivan, now chairman of Goitre Anthracite Ltd, owners of Tower Colliery near Hirwuan, says he has strong suspicions about one individual, who he is not naming. ""Definitely now, at the time no, but with what happened after the strike we thought there was a reason for this. He'd gone away too soon, he'd left too soon. He'd left a girl he had made so many promises to. ""I think it was very well organised - it wasn't the PC up the street. This was a far larger organisation. These people were trained purposely not only to undermine miners but to infiltrate everything."" Former Labour minister Kim Howells, who was an official for the south Wales miners during the strike, said there were ""conspiracy theories around"" during the time, including that people's phones were being tapped. ""We just assumed that they were listening or else that there were people within the ranks of miners or miners' families who the police were getting information from,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Good Morning Walesprogramme. The Metropolitan Police declined to comment on the NUM allegations, as they are part of the UCPI. Thepublic inquiry,external, which began in 2015, is not expected to publish its findings until at least 2023.

"Head teacher Siobhan Lowe mans the tills in the school canteen A head teacher says she has had to scrub the toilets, clean the school and work in the canteen because of school funding shortages on schools. Siobhan Lowe, head of Tolworth Girls' School in Surbiton, south London, spoke of the embarrassment of not being able to fund support for her pupils. She says she has already sold off land, cut subjects and a deputy head post to stay afloat, as budgets tightened. It comes as thousands of heads have highlighted worsening funding gaps. About 7,000 head teachers in England have written to 3.5 million parents saying that schools are facing a ""funding crisis"". They say they are angry that the education secretary has refused to meet them to discuss the issue. They say requests to talk to Damian Hinds were turned down because his time is too ""pressurised"" to meet, and that this suggested he was ""in denial"" about the cash issues facing schools. But the Department for Education said it was ""fundamentally untrue"" to say funding was not a priority. A department spokesman said Mr Hinds had negotiated an extra Â£750m for schools and was ""putting a strong case to the Treasury ahead of the next spending review"". But Ms Lowe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had been forced to make a ""phenomenal amount of cuts"" in every area of her school. ""I've reduced the number of teaching groups, I've reduced the number of options that students have, I've increased class sizes, I've cut critical services such as student support workers who work with our most vulnerable,"" she said. ""I personally have cleaned the school, washed the toilets, served in the school canteen."" She added: ""My girls are looking at me and feeling so sorry for me that they're actually picking up the Hoover and doing it with me."" Ms Lowe added she had just Â£10 per pupil per year to fund basic needs like books, and that parents were having to pay for things such as printing. ""As a head teacher, you're almost embarrassed to admit you can't support the students in your school,"" she continued. ""But why am I embarrassed? It's not my embarrassment. ""It's due to the fact that I'm not given the money to provide for the students."" Jules White, West Sussex head teacher and organiser of the schools funding campaign letter, said: ""When thousands of heads are all saying the same thing, it seems incredible that ministers are too busy to meet. ""Families have a right to know that our efforts to improve things are falling on deaf ears. ""Heads must now consider whether the refusal to meet us is either a complacent act of denial or simply a deliberate snub."" Reality Check: Is government spending record amounts on schools? Schools facing 'financial cliff edge', says think tank Head teachers stage polite protest over funding School funding 'exaggerated' by ministers, says statistics watchdog The joint letter sent home to parents, warning of the impact of cash shortages, quotes a letter to head teachers rejecting a request to talk to the education secretary or Schools Minister Nick Gibb. blaming prioritising ministerial business. Head teachers staged a ""relentlessly reasonable"" protest march in Westminster The letter is being sent to parents in areas including Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, some London boroughs, Surrey, Kent, Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk and Cumbria. The WorthLess? campaign group sending the letters staged an unprecedentedhead teachers' protest march in Westminsterlast September, with the slogan ""relentlessly reasonable"". A DFE spokesperson said the education secretary met teachers and unions ""on a regular basis"". There have been repeated complaints from schools about funding shortages, with the Institute for Fiscal Studiesshowing that per pupil spending had fallen in real terms by 8% since 2010. Earlier this year, the Education Policy Institute said almost a third of local authority secondary schools in England were unable to cover their costs, with the proportion of these schools in the red almost quadrupling in four years. This weekMPs debated school funding, after a petition warning of funding cuts received 100,000 signatures. The government has acknowledged that schools can face extra pressures, such as support for children with mental health problems, but says funding is continuing to rise to record levels. This week, however, Labour MP Jess Phillips shared a message from her son's school in Birmingham, warning that it might have toclose early on Fridays to save money. And in February, a school in Stockport said it would introduce ahalf day on Friday because of ""unsustainable"" finances. Catharine Darnton, head of Gillotts School, in Henley, Oxfordshire, said her school was also seeing rising pupil numbers without funding for more staff. Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner school in New Malden, Surrey, said schools ""now spend a significant sum and a huge amount of time on supporting students and families with all sorts of non-educational issues"", which had to come out of already over-stretched budgets. The Department for Education defended its record on school spending, saying it was at its ""highest-ever level, rising from almost Â£41bn in 2017-18 to Â£43.5bn by 2019-20"".

"This video can not be played Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness Schools and workplaces in Venezuela have closed as an electricity blackout continues into a second day. The power cuts, which started on Thursday afternoon, have been caused by issues at a major hydroelectric plant. The government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has blamed the opposition, accusing them of sabotage. It comes amid rising tensions over opposition efforts - backed by the US and some Latin American countries - to remove Mr Maduro from power. In pictures: Lights go out on Venezuela Venezuela crisis in nine charts Venezuela's exodus Commuters in Caracas were plunged into almost complete darkness during rush hour on Thursday before the blackout extended to other areas. The lack of electricity has caused flights to be diverted from the main airport in Caracas, from where thousands of workers were forced to walk home. The problems stem from the Guri dam plant and have affected the telephone network and metro in Caracas. State television on Friday said power had been restored in some parts of the capital. However, local media reports say 15 of the country's 23 states have been affected by the blackouts, as well as Caracas. Venezuela depends on its vast hydroelectric infrastructure, rather than its oil reserves, for its domestic electricity supply. But decades of underinvestment has damaged the major dams, and sporadic blackouts are commonplace. People walked home after workplaces and schools closed People in Caracas queued up outside banks as the power cut continued Mr Maduro has accused opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan GuaidÃ³ of trying to mount a coup with the help of ""US imperialists"". Mr GuaidÃ³ said on Twitter that the blackout was a matter of ""chaos, concern and anger"" and ""evidence of the usurper's inefficiency"", adding that ""light would return"" once Mr Maduro was removed from power. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also weighed in, blaming the ""Maduro regime's incompetence"". ""No food. No medicine. Now, no power. Next, no Maduro,"" he tweeted. Allow Twitter content?

By Will Grant, BBC News, Caracas In a country where food is scarce and prices exorbitantly high for many ordinary people, there is currently a lot of food rotting and going to waste in switched-off fridges. Venezuela has seen blackouts before, often. But few last as long or are as widespread as this one. The country's politicians - from President Nicolas Maduro to opposition leader, Juan Guaido - are blaming each other via Twitter. The sense of confusion has only added to the growing stress for Venezuelans over the conflict in their country. Blackouts are nothing new in Venezuela. Critics say they have been getting worse since the nationalisation of the power grid in 2007. In 2016, the problem reached such a critical level that the government declared a 60-day nationwide state of emergency. In an attempt to stem the country's chronic power shortages, the government has periodically enforced controlled blackouts, where they would switch the power off for up to six hours at a time. Critics say that far from helping, this has caused perishable food to go bad and crime to run rampant. And when unplanned blackouts - such as the latest one - have happened, officials have blamed a number of different outside forces. Last October, Electricity Minister Luis Motta Dominguez posted on Instagram that outages were caused by ""animals such as rats, mice, snakes, cats, squirrels"" getting into the hydroelectric system's substations  - before adding that ""of course iguanas are included"".

A few months earlier another senior official, Lisandro Cabello, said the power cuts were caused by the country's position near the Equator. He said the fact that ""we are very close to the Sun"" means more intensive use of power in Venezuela than in other countries. Mr Maduro took over the presidency when his late mentor Hugo Chavez died in 2013. In recent years Venezuela has experienced an economic collapse, with severe food shortages and inflation reaching at least 800,000% last year. The Maduro government is becoming increasingly isolated as more and more countries blame it for the economic crisis, which has prompted more than three million people to leave Venezuela.

He has been recognised as interim president by more than 50 countries but Mr Maduro retains the support of his close allies Russia, Cuba and China, among others.

"A man who fell from a bridge near London Euston - bringing the station to a standstill - had fled from police minutes earlier. Officers were called to the railway terminal to reports of a passenger behaving aggressively on board a train. When it arrived, the man ""made off"", triggering a search, British Transport Police (BTP) said. He fell from the bridge about 50 minutes later and sustained ""serious injuries"", the force added. There were reports of a trespasser on the tracks after police were called at about 17:00 GMT on Thursday. Large crowds of commutersgathered at the station while services were halted. A BBC journalist travelling from Euston said their train manager announced the delays were ""caused by a man who ran on to the track at Euston, climbed up a bridge and then jumped on to the top of a train"". The train manager said the man had suffered an electric shock and was in hospital, they added. National Rail said power to overhead lines was switched off while emergency services attended the scene. All lines have since reopened and a normal service has resumed. Virgin Trains, West Midlands Trains and London Overground services operate at Euston. Virgin said it expected to operate a full service on Friday. BTP said the incident had been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

"Catriona O'Carroll's dad says she 'lives, breathes and sleeps football' Two sisters are making round trips of more than 300 miles every two weeks to play football. Charlotte, 13, and Catriona, 12, O'Carroll travel from their home in Barra to Glasgow on Fridays to train with Glasgow City FC's under 15s. They play for the team on Saturdays and Charlotte flies back home to the Western Isles on Sundays. Meanwhile, Catriona stays on in Glasgow for training with a Scotland women's under 14 regional squad on Mondays. The girls signed for Glasgow City's training academy in June last year after they were spotted by a scout. Charlotte is a striker and Catriona a midfielder. Charlotte, 13, and Catriona, 12, play for Glasgow City under 15s Since January, Catriona has been receiving one-to-one training at Scotland's national stadium, Hampden, during the day on Mondays before joining an under 14 regional squad for training in the evenings. She flies home on Tuesday mornings to get back to home and her school work. Islander, 13, signs for St Johnstone Boy's 320-mile trip to play for team The sisters, who also play football in Barra, come from a football-loving family. Their dad John, a builder, is an SFA-qualified referee and coaches boys' football. He accompanies his daughters on their trips to Glasgow. The sisters' brothers Michael, seven, and John, 10, also play football and big sister Kayleanne, 22 and a hotel manager, was known to kick a ball around in her youth. The siblings are passionate Liverpool FC supporters. The sisters make their trip to Glasgow every two weeks The sisters play football in Barra when not on their travels Every second week, John accompanies his daughters for their football training in Glasgow. One of Catriona's trips for practise with Scotland at Hampden was followed by BBC Scotland's The Nine. However, it turned out to be one of those occasions where the journey did not go as planned, increasing the distance involved to make it a round trip of 500 miles. The flight from Barra's famous beach runway to Glasgow was cancelled after they had arrived at the airport. Catriona and dad John catching a ferry during one of their trips to Glasgow Catriona says the journeys can sometimes be tough John and Catriona had to then take a mini bus to catch a ferry to Eriskay and then a taxi to Benbecula's airport for a flight to Glasgow. The journey took five hours. John says that as Catriona's football career progresses and the level of training and games become harder she will have to spend more time away from home. Her dad says: ""She will have to be here (Glasgow) a day or two days early because if you have an important game you have to be prepare mentally and physically. You have to be rested."" Dad John accompanies his daughters on their trips to Glasgow Mum Eileen says funding the journeys can be a challenge Mum Eileen, a primary school teacher who runs her own dance school with about 60 pupils, concedes the trips are expensive. She adds: ""We've been lucky enough to get a small amount of funding, but really it is just ourselves trying to fund this."" Catriona says the journeys to and from home can be tough. Catriona, John, Michael and Charlotte on a visit to Liverpool FC's Anfield stadium ""Sometimes when it gets really hard I think: 'Why don't I just move?' she says. ""But then I think I don't want to do that because all my friends are on Barra, and I would miss them."" John says upping sticks and moving to Glasgow would not be easy. ""We'd have to uproot the whole family,"" he says. ""We got a life here in Barra. ""But we'll keep making the journeys because of their love for football. ""Catriona especially just lives, breathes, sleeps football,"" he says, adding that he had to stop her kicking a ball around inside the flat they stay in while in Glasgow for fear of disturbing their neighbours.

"This video can not be played PM Theresa May: ""Now is the moment for us to act"" Theresa May has asked the EU for ""one more push"" to get her Brexit deal through Parliament and warned that, if it fails, ""we may never leave at all"". The prime minister said the UK had tabled ""serious"" proposals to resolve the deadlock over the Irish backstop. Warning of a ""moment of crisis"" if the deal was rejected again, the PM told EU leaders: ""Let's get it done."" The EU said it would give ""legal force"" to assurances already made that the UK could not be stuck in a customs union. Setting out the EU's position on Twitter, chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""not interested in the blame game"" and talks would continue over the weekend. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said what the EU was offering amounted to a ""legal beefing-up of existing promises"". Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and the DUP, the party Mrs May's government relies on for a majority in Parliament, were both dismissive of Mr Barnier's proposal. Mr Barclaytweeted,external: ""With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments. The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides"" While Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of the DUP, said Mr Barnier's proposal regarding the backstop ""disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity"" of the UK, and it was neither ""realistic nor sensible"". He said the EU's proposal ""demonstrates that they have a one-sided approach and a lack of understanding about the divisions in Northern Ireland"". The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Deadline looms as UK pushes for Brexit deal No breakthrough in Brexit talks, says EU MPs will vote for a second time on the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the EU on Tuesday - after it wasdefeated by a historic marginin a Commons vote in January. If they reject it again, they will get the option of either leaving without a deal or delaying the exit date. In a speech to a green energy firm in Lincolnshire, Mrs May said she understood the ""genuine concerns"" about the backstop but appealed to MPs to recognise that the deal as a whole respected the 2016 referendum result and would ensure the UK's long-term prosperity. ""Back it and the UK will leave the EU,"" she said. ""Reject it and no-one knows what will happen. We may not leave the EU for many months. We may leave without the protections a deal provides, we may never leave at all."" It was in neither side's interest to prolong the uncertainty by ""carry on arguing"" about Brexit, she said, claiming any delay beyond 29 March only risked ""creating new problems"". ""It needs one more push to address the specific concerns of our Parliament,"" she said. ""So let's not hold back and do what is necessary for MPs to back the deal. ""Because if MPs reject the deal, nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis."" She suggested the British people, to whom Brexit ""belonged"", had ""moved on"" and ""are ready for this to be settled"", adding: ""Everyone now wants to get it done."" But former Conservative minister Dominic Grieve, who backs a referendum to endorse the terms of Brexit, said it was ""hard to see"" how Parliament would agree to the current deal. Speaking at the Scottish Labour conference, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister sounded ""desperate"" in her speech. ""If she cannot get her botched Brexit deal through Parliament next week, it will represent an unprecedented failure in British political history. ""The utter mess the government has made of the Brexit negotiations, and their reckless abandon when it comes to people's jobs and livelihoods, is absolutely unforgiveable. ""Having already failed once to get her deal through, I want to make it clear to the PM that if she fails again, it will be the end of the road for her deal."" The SNP said the deal on offer was ""fundamentally flawed"" and would damage the Scottish economy. ""Theresa May must stop passing the buck and take personal responsibility for the Brexit crisis created as a result of her own intransigence,"" said its Westminster leader Ian Blackford. Thefirst Commons vote, in January, saw the deal rejected by 432 votes to 202, the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. Mrs May is seeking legally enforceable changes to the backstop - a controversial insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - but there have been few visible signs of progress. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Leading Brexiteers are looking for reassurances that the backstop - which would see the UK aligned with EU customs rules until the two sides' future relationship is agreed or alternative arrangements worked out - will not endure indefinitely. On Friday the EU said it was prepared to include a number of existing commitments relating to the application of the backstop in a legally-binding document. Michel Barnier tweeted that the UK ""will not be forced into [a] customs union against its will"" as it could choose to exit the proposed ""single customs territory"" on its own. But Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs territory, subject to many of its rules and regulations - something the government has previously said would threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK. There will also be a reminder that the UK can suspend parts of the backstop if an independent arbitration panel rules that the EU is not behaving in good faith. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was ""not really a concession"" as the suggestion that Great Britain could leave the backstop - and become free to diverge from EU rules - while leaving Northern Ireland behind, had already been rejected. Any extension to the Article 50 process, under which the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, would need the unanimous approval of the EU. Two former prime ministers, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, have called for a delay of a year to allow for a ""public consultation"" on the way ahead and to ensure an orderly exit. But Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against any delay, tellingNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast: ""Wherever we are, and I very much hope we land it with a deal, but if we don't get a deal and we exit without a deal, Britain will succeed and thrive - I don't have a moment's doubt about that. ""But we need to deliver Brexit and ensure that's it's done. I personally believe 29th March is the best day for making sure that is delivered upon.""

"High blood pressure affects more than one in four adults in England and contributes to 75,000 deaths every year New guidelines on diagnosing high blood pressure could mean thousands more people benefiting from treatment in England and Wales. Health bosses say offering blood-pressure-lowering drugs to more people with stage-1 hypertension would help to cut heart attacks and strokes. In total, about 450,000 men and 270,000 women could now qualify for the drugs. But some GPs expressed concerns about over-diagnosis, saying the benefits could be limited. And they said lifestyle factors, such as weight control, diet and exercise, all had an important role to play in bringing down blood pressure. At present, people with high blood pressure - a reading of 140/90mmHg or higher in clinic - are offered treatment if they have a 20% risk of cardiovascular disease over 10 years and are aged under 80.. The draft guidelines, announced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), recommend that people with a 10% risk should now qualify. Thisassessment score,externalis based on a blood test several risk factors, including: smoking obesity alcohol age sex family history NICE said it was difficult to predict the impact of lowering the threshold because some people in this group may already be taking blood-pressure-lowering drugs. 'Know your heart risk like your Pin code' Do you know your heart age? Undetected high blood pressure in new mums The long-term plan for the NHS in England contains a commitment to diagnosing high blood pressure earlier and saving lives from heart attacks and strokes. High blood pressure affects more than one in four adults in England, accounts for more than one in 10 visits to GPs and contributes to 75,000 deaths every year - but millions of people are thought to go undiagnosed. Metabolic medicine consultant Anthony Wierzbicki, who chairs the NICE guideline committee, said high blood pressure was ""by far the biggest preventable cause of death and disability in the UK through strokes, heart attacks and heart failure"". ""A rigorous evaluation of new evidence has resulted in updated recommendations around when to treat raised blood pressure that have the potential to make a real difference to the lives of many thousands of people with the condition,"" he added. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said the decision to lower the threshold for a diagnosis of hypertension, or high blood pressure, ""must not be taken lightly and must be evidence-based"". She added: ""GPs are highly trained to prescribe taking into account the guidelines but also the circumstances of the individual patient sitting in front of them, including physical, physiological and social factors that might be affecting their health."" But other experts said the guidelines did not go far enough. ""Much lower blood pressure targets are required and multiple drugs need to be used right from the start, if patients are to achieve the largest reduction in the risks of stroke and heart attack,"" said Prof Stephen MacMahon, from the University of Oxford.

"Jeremy Corbyn told Labour delegates that they must be ""united"" to get into government Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has issued a plea for unity in his speech to the party's Scottish conference in Dundee. The build-up to the conference has seen continuing disagreements within the party about its approach to Brexit and how to tackle anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn told delegates that to get into government ""we have to be united"". And he said Labour ""must lead the fight against all types of racism"" and ""root out anti-Semitism in our party and in society at large"". This came after the leader of the party's group in the Lords wrote to Mr Corbyn complaining that handling of anti-Semitism complaints had been an ""embarrassing mess"" and a ""political failure"". Labour peers say response to anti-Semitism is 'political failure' Scottish Labour row erupts ahead of conference Mr Corbyn was the main speaker on the first day of the conference in Dundee, with Scottish leader Richard Leonard to address delegates on Saturday and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell speaking on Sunday. As well as the leaders' speeches, the conference is to feature debates about healthcare, the economy, education and Scotland's place in the world - with a series of local party motions lodged on the topic of a fresh EU referendum for the latter. Richard Leonard will address the conference on Saturday The build-up to the conference - the party's first major gathering since eight MPs quit to sit as a new ""Independent Group"" at Westminster - has been hit by rows over Brexit and anti-Semitism. Former leader Kezia Dugdale complained that references to a second EU referendum had been removed from a conference report from the party's Scottish MEPs - something described as a ""genuine misunderstanding"" by a Labour source. And bosses averted a fresh row over anti-Semitism by promising to publish a statement from the party executive in lieu of an emergency debate on the topic at the conference, which some local groups had been pushing for. Mr Corbyn told delegates that Labour could get into power in London and Edinburgh, but warned them that ""to get there, we have to be united"". He continued: ""That doesn't mean we have no room for disagreement. Discussion and debate are the lifeblood of our democracy. But there is no justification for the abuse of anybody. ""Racism, religious bigotry and misogyny have no place whatsoever in our movement. ""And we will root out anti-Semitism in our party, and in society at large. We, the Labour Party, must lead the fight against all types of racism."" He later added that unity was the party's ""greatest asset"", saying: ""The only thing that can hold us back is if we were to turn our fire on each other rather than on the Tory government. ""With the Conservatives in disarray, now is the time to come together and defeat them."" Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird addressed the conference on Friday morning Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird made similar arguments in her speech on Friday morning, telling delegates that ""unity is key to any winning team"". And both politicians hit out at constitutional ""obsessions"" of other parties, contrasting Labour with the Conservatives and the SNP. Mr Corbyn said the dominance of issues like Brexit and Scottish independence ""borders almost on the obsessive"", taking attention away from other issues. He said: ""The truth about Labour is, we're not obsessed by constitutional issues like the others are. We're absolutely obsessed with tackling the problems people face in their daily lives. ""Ending insecurity at work. Ending poverty wages. Ending the cuts to our public services. ""Because we believe that the real divide in our society is not between people who voted yes or no for independence. And it's not between people who voted to remain or to leave the EU. ""The real divide is between the many - who do the work, create the wealth and pay their taxes - and the few, who set the rules, reap the rewards and dodge their taxes.""

"Head teacher Siobhan Lowe mans the tills in the school canteen A head teacher says she has had to scrub the toilets, clean the school and work in the canteen because of school funding shortages on schools. Siobhan Lowe, head of Tolworth Girls' School in Surbiton, south London, spoke of the embarrassment of not being able to fund support for her pupils. She says she has already sold off land, cut subjects and a deputy head post to stay afloat, as budgets tightened. It comes as thousands of heads have highlighted worsening funding gaps. About 7,000 head teachers in England have written to 3.5 million parents saying that schools are facing a ""funding crisis"". They say they are angry that the education secretary has refused to meet them to discuss the issue. They say requests to talk to Damian Hinds were turned down because his time is too ""pressurised"" to meet, and that this suggested he was ""in denial"" about the cash issues facing schools. But the Department for Education said it was ""fundamentally untrue"" to say funding was not a priority. A department spokesman said Mr Hinds had negotiated an extra Â£750m for schools and was ""putting a strong case to the Treasury ahead of the next spending review"". But Ms Lowe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had been forced to make a ""phenomenal amount of cuts"" in every area of her school. ""I've reduced the number of teaching groups, I've reduced the number of options that students have, I've increased class sizes, I've cut critical services such as student support workers who work with our most vulnerable,"" she said. ""I personally have cleaned the school, washed the toilets, served in the school canteen."" She added: ""My girls are looking at me and feeling so sorry for me that they're actually picking up the Hoover and doing it with me."" Ms Lowe added she had just Â£10 per pupil per year to fund basic needs like books, and that parents were having to pay for things such as printing. ""As a head teacher, you're almost embarrassed to admit you can't support the students in your school,"" she continued. ""But why am I embarrassed? It's not my embarrassment. ""It's due to the fact that I'm not given the money to provide for the students."" Jules White, West Sussex head teacher and organiser of the schools funding campaign letter, said: ""When thousands of heads are all saying the same thing, it seems incredible that ministers are too busy to meet. ""Families have a right to know that our efforts to improve things are falling on deaf ears. ""Heads must now consider whether the refusal to meet us is either a complacent act of denial or simply a deliberate snub."" Reality Check: Is government spending record amounts on schools? Schools facing 'financial cliff edge', says think tank Head teachers stage polite protest over funding School funding 'exaggerated' by ministers, says statistics watchdog The joint letter sent home to parents, warning of the impact of cash shortages, quotes a letter to head teachers rejecting a request to talk to the education secretary or Schools Minister Nick Gibb. blaming prioritising ministerial business. Head teachers staged a ""relentlessly reasonable"" protest march in Westminster The letter is being sent to parents in areas including Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, some London boroughs, Surrey, Kent, Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk and Cumbria. The WorthLess? campaign group sending the letters staged an unprecedentedhead teachers' protest march in Westminsterlast September, with the slogan ""relentlessly reasonable"". A DFE spokesperson said the education secretary met teachers and unions ""on a regular basis"". There have been repeated complaints from schools about funding shortages, with the Institute for Fiscal Studiesshowing that per pupil spending had fallen in real terms by 8% since 2010. Earlier this year, the Education Policy Institute said almost a third of local authority secondary schools in England were unable to cover their costs, with the proportion of these schools in the red almost quadrupling in four years. This weekMPs debated school funding, after a petition warning of funding cuts received 100,000 signatures. The government has acknowledged that schools can face extra pressures, such as support for children with mental health problems, but says funding is continuing to rise to record levels. This week, however, Labour MP Jess Phillips shared a message from her son's school in Birmingham, warning that it might have toclose early on Fridays to save money. And in February, a school in Stockport said it would introduce ahalf day on Friday because of ""unsustainable"" finances. Catharine Darnton, head of Gillotts School, in Henley, Oxfordshire, said her school was also seeing rising pupil numbers without funding for more staff. Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner school in New Malden, Surrey, said schools ""now spend a significant sum and a huge amount of time on supporting students and families with all sorts of non-educational issues"", which had to come out of already over-stretched budgets. The Department for Education defended its record on school spending, saying it was at its ""highest-ever level, rising from almost Â£41bn in 2017-18 to Â£43.5bn by 2019-20"".

"This video can not be played Karen Bradley says she's ""devastated"" to think she made pain worse for Troubles victims' families Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has described a meeting with the families of some victims of the Troubles as ""humbling"". On Friday she met relatives of people killed by security forces and apologised for controversial remarks she made about the Troubles this week. She told MPs on Wednesday thatdeaths caused by security forces in Northern Ireland were ""not crimes"". The sister of a man who was shot dead by the Army has called for her to quit. Bradley 'to deliver for those she hurt' Is NI secretary running out of road? This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Frances Meehan,whose brother Michael Donnelly was shot with a plastic bulletin 1981, said Mrs Bradley's position was ""untenable"". She was one of the people who met Mrs Bradley on Friday, as part of a delegation from the victims' group Relatives for Justice. After the meetings, Mrs Bradley said she was ""grateful"" to the families for giving her the ""opportunity to apologise personally for the offence and hurt"" that her comments had caused. ""It was humbling to listen to each of them and their personal and deeply moving stories,"" she added. ""I heard about the hurt and suffering endured over many years, about the experiences of those whose family members died at the hands of the security forces. ""The families I met today referred to unarmed civilians and 82 children who lost their lives in incidents involving the security forces."" Frances Meehan says Karen Bradley's position as Northern Ireland secretary is ""untenable"" But Ms Meehan said the Northern Ireland's secretary apology was ""not good enough for someone who is meant to represent the interests of Northern Ireland at the British cabinet"". ""It is not acceptable that Karen Bradley remains in her post and we are calling again for her to resign,"" she added. Her comments come after relatives of 10 people killed in west Belfast during the Troubles rejected an offer to meet the Northern Ireland secretary. Those who died at Ballymurphy were shot deadshortly after the introduction of internment. Internment was introduced in August 1971 against a backdrop of escalating violence and increased bombings in Northern Ireland. The new law gave the authorities the power to imprison people without trial. An inquest into their deaths has been taking place in Belfast since November. In a statement late on Thursday night, the Ballymurphy victims' families said they had been requesting a meeting with Mrs Bradley since she became the Northern Ireland secretary in January last year. ""Karen Bradley hasn't even replied to these requests,"" they said. The relatives of those killed at Ballymurphy in 1971 have called for Karen Bradley to resign PÃ¡draig Ã'Muirigh, a solicitor for the families, said he had been instructed by his clients to contact the attorney general about ""potential contempt issues that might arise"" from her comments. Ms Meehan said she understood the Ballymurphy families' position. ""They're sitting in court and they're listening to tales of their loved ones being riddled on the ground as they lay begging for help. ""They are probably very angry and would not have been able to come here to speak to Karen Bradley so I respect their decision."" Former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Hain said that if Mrs Bradley resigned it would not make any real difference to government policy in the region. He told the BBC's Inside Politics programme that her comments reflected a wider misunderstanding of the Northern Ireland conflict by the Conservative government. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' He accused the Conservatives of taking a partisan position by siding with unionism and claimed that Theresa May ""doesn't grip the Northern Ireland situation"" in the same way as previous prime ministers. In October, Lord Hain was one offour former Northern Ireland secretaries who wrote to Mrs Bradleyto express their concern about the government's handling of the legacy of the Troubles. Speaking onthe BBC's The View programme, Judith Thompson, the Northern Ireland victims' commissioner, said that some people affected by the Troubles were left in ""genuine shock"" by Mrs Bradley's remarks in the Commons. ""We can't move forward by having a bipolar political discourse, which is actually not one that is moved forward by a lack of honesty,"" added Ms Thompson. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his advice to Mrs Bradley would be: ""I think you're in the last-chance saloon on this. ""You really need to show that we can resolve these issues and move this process forward."" Bradley 'to deliver for those she hurt' Is Karen Bradley running out of road?

"US President Donald Trump's ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort has been given a 47-month prison sentence for fraud. He was convicted last year of hiding millions of dollars of income earned by his political consulting in Ukraine. The charges stem from an inquiry into alleged Russian election meddling in the 2016 US elections. None of Manafort's charges relate to allegations of collusion with Russia. Mr Trump has always denied the charge, describing the inquiry as a witch hunt. The 47-month sentence is far shorter than what was recommended by US Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Mueller is thought to be finishing up his 22-month investigation, which has dogged the Trump presidency. Manafort entered court wearing a green prison jumpsuit and in a wheelchair Manafort, 69, is due to be sentenced in another case next week related to his illegal lobbying. His sentencing marks a spectacular downfall for a Republican political guru who advised four US presidents, including Mr Trump, and foreign leaders. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Manafort - who will receive credit for time served - must also pay $24m (Â£18m) in restitution and a $50,000 fine. He addressed the court on Thursday evening in Alexandria, Virginia, saying ""the last two years have been the most difficult of my life"". ""To say I am humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement,"" he added, asking the judge to be ""compassionate"". He described his life as ""professionally and financially in shambles"". Judge TS Ellis said he was surprised that Manafort did not ""express regret for engaging in wrongful conduct"". The formerly dapper lobbyist - who entered the court wearing a green prison jumpsuit and in a wheelchair - was impassive as he learned his fate. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words What does the special counsel do? America's most mysterious public figure Judge Ellis said sentencing guidelines cited by prosecutors calling for between 19.5 and 24 years in prison were ""excessive"" compared to sentences for similar crimes. ""The government cannot sweep away the history of all these previous sentences,"" he said. ""Clearly the guidelines were way out of whack on this."" He added that Manafort had lived an ""otherwise blameless"" life where he ""earned the admiration of a number of people"". Many Democrats have reacted to the sentence with disappointment. US Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, said Manafort had ""led far from a 'blameless life'"". Allow Twitter content?

He added that he was ""not advocating for worse treatment for all"", but wished his clients would get the ""same treatment as the privileged few"". News website USA Today points out that, in the district where Manafort was sentenced,those convicted of fraud are normally jailed for an average of 36 months,external. Legal experts,externalhave also pointed out thatJudge Ellis has a history of criticising mandatory minimum sentences,external- including those for drug and gun crimes - as he believes judges should have more discretion over jail sentences. What might 'Mueller report' look like? Five big things Mueller is looking at Manafort pictured with Donald Trump at the Republican convention in July 2016 A jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted Manafort last August of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of failing to declare a foreign bank account. The judge, however, declared a mistrial on 10 other fraud-related charges. Manafort was indicted for hiding $55m in offshore bank accounts in Cyprus, money he was paid as a political consultant for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians. Prosecutors say Manafort failed to pay more than $6m in taxes, as he funded his opulent lifestyle, including a $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket and a luxury renovation of his mansion in the Hamptons. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? Manafort served three months as Trump's campaign chairman until August 2016, when he was forced to resign over his previous work in Ukraine. He was the first former Trump aide to be arrested in the special counsel investigation, in October 2017. Who's who in the Russia-Trump inquiry? His legal team has previously said he suffers from debilitating foot pain resulting from gout as a result of his incarceration. Manafort will be held in a federal facility in Cumberland, Maryland Manafort's bail was revoked for alleged witness-tampering and he has been held in solitary confinement for nine months. When news of the solitary confinement first emerged it caused controversy, with commentators describing it as a form of ""torture"". Manafort's lawyers acknowledged thatthe solitary confinement was put in place to guarantee Manafort's safety,external, but argued that he should not have been detained at all. They said Manafort was ""locked in his cell for at least 23 hours per day"" and could not adequately prepare his defence. Mr Mueller saidManafort had enjoyed privileges in solitary confinement,externalincluding ""a private, self-contained living unit, which is larger than other inmates' units, his own bathroom and shower facility, his own personal telephone, and his own workspace to prepare for trial."" According to court filings submitted by Mr Mueller's team, Mr Manafort said on monitored phone calls from jail that he was ""being treated like a 'VIP'"". Manafort has not been charged with anything related to the special counsel's investigation into an alleged Russian plot to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Manafort's lawyers had argued that the charges were outside the special counsel's remit. However, Democrats point out that a Washington DC judge last month backed the special counsel's contention that Manafort lied about his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, an aide alleged to have ties to Russian intelligence. In February, Manafort's lawyers inadvertently revealed in a court filing that their client had shared polling data about the 2016 Trump campaign with Mr Kilimnik. The president's critics also highlight that Manafort was present at a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between campaign staff and a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer promising ""dirt"" on then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump's biggest headache might not be Mueller During sentencing the judge noted that the charges do not relate to alleged Russian meddling, leading to Mr Trump to claim vindication in a tweet mischaracterising the judge's remarks.

Manafort is due to be sentenced next Wednesday in another case brought by the special counsel, this time in Washington DC. He pleaded guilty in September to two felony counts - conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice - related to his lobbying. He also agreed to co-operate with the special counsel inquiry in a deal for a possible lighter sentence. However, just two months later that plea deal collapsed as investigators said Manafort had repeatedly lied to the government. He faces a maximum of 10 years in the case. President Trump, who frequently denounces the Mueller investigation, has not ruled out granting a presidential pardon to Manafort. He said in November: ""I wouldn't take it off the table."" The special counsel is expected any day to submit his report to the US attorney general The special counsel is expected soon to submit his report to US Attorney General William Barr. The political world is feverishly anticipating findings on whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia, or if Mr Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the inquiry. Mr Trump has denied collusion and obstruction and Russia has denied election interference. Five other Trump aides have been charged in connection with Mr Mueller's investigation. None have been indicted with criminally conspiring to subvert the 2016 election. Former campaign staff Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen have all pleaded guilty. Long-time Trump adviser Roger Stone has pleaded not guilty.

"Alba RodrÃ­guez was one of three women released on Thursday El Salvador's supreme court has freed three women jailed for 30 years after being accused of aborting their babies. The women say they suffered miscarriages but were convicted of aggravated homicide. They were welcomed by well-wishers and activists near the capital San Salvador on Thursday. Alba RodrÃ­guez and MarÃ­a del TrÃ¡nsito Orellana had both served nine years, while Cinthia RodrÃ­guez had spent more than 11 years in prison. The Central American country has some of the world's strictest abortion laws. The mothers being criminalised in El Salvador Women found to have had an abortion face between two and eight years' imprisonment, but this can rise to up to 40 years if they are found guilty of aggravated homicide. Dozens of women have been given jail sentences for the deaths of their foetuses in cases where they said they had suffered miscarriages or stillbirths. ""I am happy, happy to recover my freedom, happy for everything that I've been waiting for for a long time,"" Cinthia RodrÃ­guez told reporters outside the prison. They were informed of the court's decision to commute their sentences in a letter from the country's deputy justice and security minister on the eve of International Women's Day. MarÃ­a del TrÃ¡nsito Orellana (L), Cinthia RodrÃ­guez (C) and Alba RodrÃ­guez pictured before their release According to a local activist group, the ACDATEE, the court found that the women were serving ""disproportionate and immoral"" sentences and that their families had been negatively impacted by their imprisonment. Campaigners say at least 30 women jailed for abortions under the country's strict abortion laws have been freed following retrials and reviews in the past 10 years, but around 20 women remain in prison.

"This video can not be played WATCH: SpaceX Dragon capsule returns to Earth after ISS mission America's new commercial astronaut capsule has completed its demonstration flight with a successful splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean. The SpaceX Dragon vehicle left the International Space Station after being docked there for the past week, and re-entered Earth's atmosphere. It had a heat-shield to protect it from the high temperatures of re-entry. Four parachutes brought it into ""soft contact"" with water about 450km from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The mission - which had no humans aboard, only a dummy covered in sensors - went according to plan. The Dragon has set the stage for the US space agency Nasa to approve the vehicle for crewed flights. This video can not be played ISS astronaut Anne McClain went inside the Dragon capsule Not since the end of the Space Shuttle programme has the US been able to send its own astronauts into orbit. It has had to rely instead on Russia and its Soyuz spacecraft, launching from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Nasa hopes to bring this near-eight year gap in capability to an end with the introduction of two new commercial transportation systems - the Dragon and another vehicle being developed by aerospace giant Boeing. The first crewed flight of the Dragon could occur as soon as July, although this target date is likely to slip into the summer as engineers work through the post-flight analysis. Splashdown occurred at about 08:45 EST (13:45 GMT). A boat, called GO Searcher, was waiting to recover the capsule. There were cheers at mission control as the capsule landed in the Atlantic. The Dragon's owner, SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk, had previously expressed some anxiety about how the capsule would cope with re-entry, given that the vehicle's backshell, or conical upper-section, has a somewhat irregular shape that could lead to a roll instability at hypersonic speeds. The director of crew mission management at Space X, Benjamin Reed, spoke to Nasa TV moments after the capsule splashed down. ""It was an incredible journey to get to this moment,"" he said. ""The teams have just done an amazing job - both the Space X and the Nasa teams jointly. ""I can't believe how well the whole mission has gone. Pretty much everything at every point everything's been nailed all the way."" Nasa has seed-funded Boeing to produce a capsule of its own called the Starliner. This vehicle is scheduled to have its uncrewed demonstration flight in April or soon after. Ultimately, Nasa will be purchasing seats in both the SpaceX and Boeing systems to take its astronauts to the ISS. But the commercial nature of the relationship means the companies will be free to sell rides to secondary customers. These will no doubt include the space agencies of other nations, but perhaps some private space companies and individuals too. ""We're driving down costs for low-Earth orbit; we're commercialising low-Earth orbitâ¦ with human activities where Nasa can be a customer. And then we can use the tax-payer resources that are bestowed upon us to do exploration, to go further, to go back to the Moon sustainably,"" said Nasa chief Jim Bridenstine. ""We want to stay at the Moon and ultimately go on to Mars."" The GO Searcher vessel was tasked with picking Dragon crew capsules out of the water Nasa has already selected its first astronauts to fly aboard a crewed Dragon. They are Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley. ""We have a significant amount of training we need to go through that will walk through all the various phases of flight,"" Behnken said of the coming months. This will include understanding what to do if there is an emergency during their mission. One problem that could occur is a failure of the Dragon's carrier rocket during the ascent to orbit. The demonstration capsule's lift-off last Saturday was picture perfect, but some kind of booster anomaly can never be discounted. In such a scenario, a Dragon's powerful thrusters would push it away from the launcher to safety. Bob Behnken (L) and Doug Hurley will be the first crew to ride a Dragon SpaceX will practise this very procedure shortly. The team plans to take the current Dragon after its return and put it on another rocket and launch it out of the Kennedy Space Center. A minute into this flight, a deliberate abort will be commanded. The timing is significant because it's when the vehicle is experiencing maximum aerodynamic pressure. If the Dragon can stably depart in such circumstances, it ought be able to handle an escape at any stage in a flight. As with the present demo, no-one will be aboard for this hazardous test. The capsule will be used again during the upcoming in-flight abort test Dragon capsule docks with space station SpaceX capsule demo flight lifts off Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain fires Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"Catriona O'Carroll's dad says she 'lives, breathes and sleeps football' Two sisters are making round trips of more than 300 miles every two weeks to play football. Charlotte, 13, and Catriona, 12, O'Carroll travel from their home in Barra to Glasgow on Fridays to train with Glasgow City FC's under 15s. They play for the team on Saturdays and Charlotte flies back home to the Western Isles on Sundays. Meanwhile, Catriona stays on in Glasgow for training with a Scotland women's under 14 regional squad on Mondays. The girls signed for Glasgow City's training academy in June last year after they were spotted by a scout. Charlotte is a striker and Catriona a midfielder. Charlotte, 13, and Catriona, 12, play for Glasgow City under 15s Since January, Catriona has been receiving one-to-one training at Scotland's national stadium, Hampden, during the day on Mondays before joining an under 14 regional squad for training in the evenings. She flies home on Tuesday mornings to get back to home and her school work. Islander, 13, signs for St Johnstone Boy's 320-mile trip to play for team The sisters, who also play football in Barra, come from a football-loving family. Their dad John, a builder, is an SFA-qualified referee and coaches boys' football. He accompanies his daughters on their trips to Glasgow. The sisters' brothers Michael, seven, and John, 10, also play football and big sister Kayleanne, 22 and a hotel manager, was known to kick a ball around in her youth. The siblings are passionate Liverpool FC supporters. The sisters make their trip to Glasgow every two weeks The sisters play football in Barra when not on their travels Every second week, John accompanies his daughters for their football training in Glasgow. One of Catriona's trips for practise with Scotland at Hampden was followed by BBC Scotland's The Nine. However, it turned out to be one of those occasions where the journey did not go as planned, increasing the distance involved to make it a round trip of 500 miles. The flight from Barra's famous beach runway to Glasgow was cancelled after they had arrived at the airport. Catriona and dad John catching a ferry during one of their trips to Glasgow Catriona says the journeys can sometimes be tough John and Catriona had to then take a mini bus to catch a ferry to Eriskay and then a taxi to Benbecula's airport for a flight to Glasgow. The journey took five hours. John says that as Catriona's football career progresses and the level of training and games become harder she will have to spend more time away from home. Her dad says: ""She will have to be here (Glasgow) a day or two days early because if you have an important game you have to be prepare mentally and physically. You have to be rested."" Dad John accompanies his daughters on their trips to Glasgow Mum Eileen says funding the journeys can be a challenge Mum Eileen, a primary school teacher who runs her own dance school with about 60 pupils, concedes the trips are expensive. She adds: ""We've been lucky enough to get a small amount of funding, but really it is just ourselves trying to fund this."" Catriona says the journeys to and from home can be tough. Catriona, John, Michael and Charlotte on a visit to Liverpool FC's Anfield stadium ""Sometimes when it gets really hard I think: 'Why don't I just move?' she says. ""But then I think I don't want to do that because all my friends are on Barra, and I would miss them."" John says upping sticks and moving to Glasgow would not be easy. ""We'd have to uproot the whole family,"" he says. ""We got a life here in Barra. ""But we'll keep making the journeys because of their love for football. ""Catriona especially just lives, breathes, sleeps football,"" he says, adding that he had to stop her kicking a ball around inside the flat they stay in while in Glasgow for fear of disturbing their neighbours.

"New summer train timetables will come into force on 19 May, with 1,000 services added to relieve overcrowding. Rail bosses will be hoping that the introduction will be more successful than last year's fiasco, when a similar exercise caused severe disruption on the country's train network. The Rail Delivery Group said the industry had ""learned the lessons"" from 2018's timetable changes. It said it had ""high confidence"" that services would be ready.

"Keely Deininger, here with models, says she has had challenges with cash flow and time management Keely Deininger loved her job in design at a Marks and Spencer supplier. But she gave it up to look after her three children: ""One day, I called my mother and asked her to look after the children. I took a plane to Vietnam. Once there, she started designing clothes: ""I became an accidental entrepreneur overnight."" Her story is part of a report that suggests the UK economy could be given a Â£250bn boost if women's start-ups were given the same funding as men. The government-commissioned report estimates there are 1.1 million ""missing"" female-run firms and sets out eight ways of boosting the number of female entrepreneurs. The funding for Keely Deininger's Angel Face business came from a colleague, rather than a formal loan from a bank or venture capital fund. She had no company name or business plan and had done no research before she started her company. ""I have faced many challenges along my journey; cash flow being one of them, being incredibly time-poor another. ""I ran my business between school runs, karate lessons, shopping, making the dinner and putting three kids to bed. For me, it is now a priority to support other mothers to be successful in the workforce,"" she says. The government-commissioned report - the Rose report - suggests that one way to get more women, regardless of whether they are mothers, into the workforce or starting businesses is to create a code asking them to report gender funding. Alison Rose, who led the review, said the shortfall was hurting the economy. Ms Rose, the head of Royal Bank of Scotland's corporate, commercial and private banking business, said: ""I firmly believe that the disparity that exists between female and male entrepreneurs is unacceptable and holding the UK back."" Alison Rose says there are more than one million missing businesses because of the barriers to female entrepreneurs ""The unrealised potential for the UK economy is enormous,"" said Ms Rose, who is also deputy chief executive of NatWest. Ms Rose was commissioned in September by Robert Jenrick, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, to examine whether there were unfair obstacles preventing women setting up businesses. Mr Jenrick said: ""Today's striving businesswomen are too often facing barriers to setting up and growing their own enterprise. These barriers don't just hold back women, they hold back every single one of us."" Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would encourage more companies to look at the gender split of the companies they invested in. NatWest, owned by RBS, is to be the first signatory to the code, which commits financial investors to setting out gender funding, while the Treasury will establish a new ""investing in female entrepreneurs code"" to show a gender split of the investments they make annually. Women 'half as likely' as men to start a business Gender pay gap grows at hundreds of big firms Released on International Women's Day, the report said that 6% of UK women run their own businesses compared with 15% in Canada, almost 11% in the US and more than 9% in Australia and the Netherlands. It calculates that even if the UK achieved the same average share of women entrepreneurs as other countries, some Â£200bn could be added to the value of the economy. That rises to Â£250bn - the equivalent of four years' economic growth -  if women were backed to the same extent as men. According to the report, in the UK, for every 10 male entrepreneurs there are fewer than five female entrepreneurs. A survey for the review found access to funding is the number one barrier, mentioned by almost twice as many women as men. The report said only one in three UK entrepreneurs is female, which it describes as ""a gender gap equivalent of 1.1 million missing businesses"". Female-led businesses are also smaller than those run by men and less likely to grow. Small businesses run by men are five times more likely to reach a Â£1m turnover than female-run small businesses. The report describes the UK as the ""start-up capital of Europe"", with a 5.1% growth rate in the number of new businesses between 2013-2017. But, it said, female-led businesses receive less funding than those headed by men at every stage of their development. A survey of 1,500 men and women conducted for the review found that access to funding is the number one barrier, mentioned by almost twice as many women as men. Among the other recommendations is making UK banks and investment funds help their wealthy clients invest in female-run businesses and encourage UK-based entrepreneurs to back female entrepreneurs. This initiative is to be led by Alexandra Daly, founder of fund specialists AA Advisors. An ""expert in resident"" programme could be offered to entrepreneurs. The report also suggested banks should design products to help parent entrepreneurs manage family care.

"Ms Daniels says the result is a win for her A US federal judge has dismissed porn actress Stormy Daniels' lawsuit seeking to annul a hush money agreement she had with President Donald Trump. The agreement prevented her from discussing an alleged 2006 fling with Mr Trump - but Mr Trump had already agreed not to enforce it. Mr Trump has denied having an affair with Ms Daniels. His former lawyer Michael Cohen has said the $130,000 (Â£100,000) payment was made to help Mr Trump get elected. Last month Mr Cohen told Congress that Mr Trump had reimbursed him for the payment ""as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws"". Mr Trump has denied wrongdoing. How damaging are Cohen allegations? NDAs: What are non-disclosure agreements? Trump insults Stormy Daniels over lawsuit The decision in favour of Mr Trump by Los Angeles Federal Judge James Otero followsthe failure of Ms Daniels' defamation case against Mr Trump last year- a case over which Judge Otero also presided. She had sued the US president after he mocked her claim that a stranger had threatened her to keep quiet. Ms Daniels said the latest ruling amounted to the end of the non-disclosure agreement. ""More than a year ago when I was being threatened with a 20 million lawsuit, I asked a judge to toss out this illegal NDA. Glad I stood my ground and kept fighting,"" she said on Twitter.

"Head teacher Siobhan Lowe mans the tills in the school canteen A head teacher says she has had to scrub the toilets, clean the school and work in the canteen because of school funding shortages on schools. Siobhan Lowe, head of Tolworth Girls' School in Surbiton, south London, spoke of the embarrassment of not being able to fund support for her pupils. She says she has already sold off land, cut subjects and a deputy head post to stay afloat, as budgets tightened. It comes as thousands of heads have highlighted worsening funding gaps. About 7,000 head teachers in England have written to 3.5 million parents saying that schools are facing a ""funding crisis"". They say they are angry that the education secretary has refused to meet them to discuss the issue. They say requests to talk to Damian Hinds were turned down because his time is too ""pressurised"" to meet, and that this suggested he was ""in denial"" about the cash issues facing schools. But the Department for Education said it was ""fundamentally untrue"" to say funding was not a priority. A department spokesman said Mr Hinds had negotiated an extra Â£750m for schools and was ""putting a strong case to the Treasury ahead of the next spending review"". But Ms Lowe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had been forced to make a ""phenomenal amount of cuts"" in every area of her school. ""I've reduced the number of teaching groups, I've reduced the number of options that students have, I've increased class sizes, I've cut critical services such as student support workers who work with our most vulnerable,"" she said. ""I personally have cleaned the school, washed the toilets, served in the school canteen."" She added: ""My girls are looking at me and feeling so sorry for me that they're actually picking up the Hoover and doing it with me."" Ms Lowe added she had just Â£10 per pupil per year to fund basic needs like books, and that parents were having to pay for things such as printing. ""As a head teacher, you're almost embarrassed to admit you can't support the students in your school,"" she continued. ""But why am I embarrassed? It's not my embarrassment. ""It's due to the fact that I'm not given the money to provide for the students."" Jules White, West Sussex head teacher and organiser of the schools funding campaign letter, said: ""When thousands of heads are all saying the same thing, it seems incredible that ministers are too busy to meet. ""Families have a right to know that our efforts to improve things are falling on deaf ears. ""Heads must now consider whether the refusal to meet us is either a complacent act of denial or simply a deliberate snub."" Reality Check: Is government spending record amounts on schools?

There have been repeated complaints from schools about funding shortages, with the Institute for Fiscal Studiesshowing that per pupil spending had fallen in real terms by 8% since 2010. Earlier this year, the Education Policy Institute said almost a third of local authority secondary schools in England were unable to cover their costs, with the proportion of these schools in the red almost quadrupling in four years. This weekMPs debated school funding, after a petition warning of funding cuts received 100,000 signatures. The government has acknowledged that schools can face extra pressures, such as support for children with mental health problems, but says funding is continuing to rise to record levels. This week, however, Labour MP Jess Phillips shared a message from her son's school in Birmingham, warning that it might have toclose early on Fridays to save money. And in February, a school in Stockport said it would introduce ahalf day on Friday because of ""unsustainable"" finances. Catharine Darnton, head of Gillotts School, in Henley, Oxfordshire, said her school was also seeing rising pupil numbers without funding for more staff. Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner school in New Malden, Surrey, said schools ""now spend a significant sum and a huge amount of time on supporting students and families with all sorts of non-educational issues"", which had to come out of already over-stretched budgets. The Department for Education defended its record on school spending, saying it was at its ""highest-ever level, rising from almost Â£41bn in 2017-18 to Â£43.5bn by 2019-20"".

"The Queen has posted a photo on the official royal family Instagram account for the first time. She was applauded after sharing an image of a letter from 19th century inventor and mathematician Charles Babbage to Prince Albert. The Queen used an iPad to share the photo as she looked at exhibits in the Science Museum's summer exhibition - Top Secret. The museum's director said it was a ""nerve-wracking moment"". The Queen's post read: ""In the letter, Babbage told Queen Victoria and Prince Albert about his invention, the Analytical Engine, upon which the first computer programmes were created by Ada Lovelace, a daughter of Lord Byron. ""Today, I had the pleasure of learning about children's computer coding initiatives and it seems fitting to me that I publish this Instagram post at the Science Museum, which has long championed technology, innovation and inspired the next generation of inventors.""
