"This video can not be played Hong Kong protests: Thousands march against extradition bill Hundreds of thousands of people are protesting in Hong Kong against a controversial extradition bill, despite the bill having been suspended. The densely-packed crowds are demanding that the bill - which would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China - be completely scrapped. The region's leader, Carrie Lam, on Sunday apologised for causing ""disputes in society"" over the bill. A day earlier she delayed the bill plans after mass protests this week. Many protesters, who fear increased Chinese influence over Hong Kong, are calling on Ms Lam to resign over the unrest. The protests have so far remained peaceful, in contrast to the previous major demonstration on Wednesday which saw clashes between protesters and police that injured dozens. By early Sunday afternoon, large crowds had gathered in the city's Victoria Square, many wearing black or carrying white flowers. Organisers said they hoped more than a million people would attend, though no formal estimates of the crowd have yet been made. Many of the protesters have been demanding Carrie Lam's resignation The progress of the march was slow, as the large numbers of people blocked many streets and crowded train stations. Many held white flowers to mourn a protester who fell to his death on Saturday from a ledge, where hours earlier he had unfurled an anti-extradition banner. Allow Twitter content?

As darkness fell, protesters started to take over major roads and crossings and surrounded the legislative council building. They carried placards that read ""the students did not riot"", in response to police labelling Wednesday's student protests a riot - an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail. All you need to know about the protests Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained There was scepticism among some protesters about Ms Lam's decision to suspend the bill. ""Carrie Lam has ignored the feelings of Hong Kongers,"" Mr Ma, a 67-year-old protester, told the BBC. He said Ms Lam had ""acted like it was no big deal"" after a reported million people marched last week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Secondly, we are marching for the students who were brutally treated by the police. We need to get justice for them."" Chloe Yim, 20, who had joined the protests for the first time, said: ""If Carrie sees so many people come out, and still doesn't listen - she's being an autocrat who doesn't listen to people. Hong Kong people can't accept that."" Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong The government had hoped to reduce public anger by announcing a pause in the legislation on Saturday. That has patently failed, as at least hundreds of thousands took to the streets again. For the chief executive, the demonstrations will have taken on a particularly personal bent, as protesters chanted ""Carrie Lam - resign!"" throughout during the day. The government is now trying to strike a conciliatory tone - in a statement, it said it understood the protesters views ""have been made out of love and core for Hong Kong"". It promised the chief executive would adopt a more ""sincere and humble attitude"" towards public criticism. But this is too little, too late for many protesters, who insist they won't settle for anything less than the bill being completely withdrawn. The scenes are reminiscent of 2003 - when half a million people protested against proposed national security legislation. The unpopular chief executive at the time, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned months later. But even if Ms Lam resigns, there's no guarantee that protesters will be satisfied with whoever replaces her - especially as, under Hong Kong's political system, the leader is elected by a small panel filled with allies of the Beijing government. Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. On Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. Chinaâs history of extraordinary rendition Will the bill damage Hong Kong's star status? There were clashes and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police have been accused by some rights groups of excessive force. Much of the public anger has been directed at Ms Lam, the region's elected chief executive - who is firmly supported by Beijing. This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised protests this week Part of that anger comes from a tearful address after Wednesday's violence in whichshe labelled the protests ""organised riots""â a label rejected by the hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters. Ms Lam remained hidden from public view for days, until her announcement on Saturday the she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". But she stopped short of saying the bill would be permanently shelved. Profile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong On Sunday, she followed this up with a statement apologising for ""her government's work that has led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people"". This video can not be played Carrie Lam expressed 'deep sorrow' over extradition law controversy There has been speculation among analysts about Ms Lam's future amid the continued protests, but China's foreign ministry publicly backed her on Saturday. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War -which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China.It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts The Hong Kong handover in a nutshell A timeline of Hong Kong's history It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region. But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs.

"The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) has said removing the backstop from the Withdrawal Agreement, would be ""effectively the same as no deal"". Leo Varadkar was responding to comments from some candidates seeking to replace Theresa May as prime minister. Many contenders have proposed changes to the backstop, even though the EU says it is not up for renegotiation. Mr Varadkar said: ""If we don't have that (the backstop), there is no deal"". As Tories line up, what now for backstop? New ideas for the Brexit border backstop Could technology solve the Irish border problem? Varadkar warns of Brexit 'miscalculation' The backstop has proven to be one of the most controversial parts of Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreementwith the EU. It is an insurance agreement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. The Irish border has been one of the most contentious issues surrounding Brexit Many Conservative MPs have concerns that it could ""trap"" the UK, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals with the rest of the world. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who prop up the government, also do not want to see Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK. Speaking onIrish National Broadcaster RTÃ's Marian Finucane programme,external, the taoiseach said it was ""alarming"" some leading Conservatives were suggesting a no-deal Brexit. ""It's a legal guarantee and legally operable guarantee that we will never see a hard border again,"" Mr Varadkar said of the backstop. He also responded to calls for a time limit to be attached to the backstop. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue ""The difficulties we have with a time limit, is effectively you are saying there will or could be a hard border once that time limit expires - that isn't a backstop,"" he said. ""What we are open to, and always have been open to, is alternative arrangements that perhaps could avoid a hard border, through procedures and technologies and so on. ""What we expect, and I don't think it's unreasonable - we want to see that fleshed out, we want to see it exist, it demonstrated before we are willing to give up the backstop. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) ""What people are saying is, 'give up the backstop' which we know will work legally and operationally in return for something that doesn't yet exist but might exist in the future. ""I can't do that to the border communities."" Mr Varadkar also said he was ""concerned at the idea, and there is an idea there in Westminster, in London, that somehow Theresa May was a bad negotiator and got a bad deal. ""That's not true. She was a good negotiator, she had a good team. ""She probably got the best deal that she could get given that a country leaving the EU doesn't have much leverage. ""The fact that the failure of the House Of Commons to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement somehow means they are going to get a better deal, that is just not how the European Union works,"" he said.

"The group died of asphyxiation after inhaling toxic fumes from the sewer Seven people have died whilst cleaning a hotel sewer in western India, according to local police. The four sanitation workers and three staff at Darshsan Hotel fell unconscious and died on Friday night after inhaling toxic fumes. Their bodies have been recovered in the village of Fartikui, and the hotel owner has been charged over the deaths. Gujarati authorities have pledged financial assistance to the victims' next of kin. According to police, the incident began after one sanitary worker entered the septic tank. When he did not return from the tank or respond to calls, his three colleagues went in to find him.

"India has said that, from Sunday, it will impose tariffs on 28 US products, including almonds and apples. The new duties, some as high as 70%, are in response to Washington's refusal to exempt Delhi from higher taxes on steel and aluminium imports. Earlier this month, US President Trump alsoannounced the US was withdrawing India's preferential trade treatment. Tariffs of up to 120% were announced by India in June last year, but trade talks had delayed their implementation. In an announcement on Friday,India's Ministry of Finance said the decision was in the ""public interest"",external. An earlier list had also listed a 29th item - artemia, a type of shrimp - but this was removed. Is trade spoiling the Trump-Modi bromance? India no longer fastest-growing economy US-India bilateral trade was worth $142bn (Â£111bn) in 2018, a sevenfold increase since 2001, according to US figures. But $5.6n worth of Indian exports - previously duty-free in the US - will be hit now the country has lost preferential treatment under America's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). This video can not be played Sujitha Rajendrababu tells the BBC how getting a job at a car factory has changed her life The move is the latest push by the Trump administration to redress what it considers to be unfair trading relationships with other countries. Tensions have since been rising between the two countries. Last year, India retaliated against US tariff hikes on aluminium and steel by raising its own import duties on a range of goods. President Trump has also threatened to impose sanctions if India purchases oil from Iran and if it goes ahead with plans to buy Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles. The latest tariffs from India come just days before country's Foreign Minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, is due to meet his US counterpart, Mike Pompeo, at a G20 summit in Japan.

"Exam board Edexcel has launched an investigation into how part of an A-level maths paper was leaked online. Blacked-out images of two questions were shared on social media on Thursday afternoon. Pearson, which runs Edexcel, said the images were circulated ""in a very limited way"" shortly before Friday's Maths Paper 3 exam. It reassured students no-one would be advantaged or disadvantaged and they would not have to re-sit the paper. Students react: 'I cried in the car on the way home' The questions were first posted on Twitter in a now deleted post; the account holder urged students to get in touch, offering the whole paper for Â£70. It is the third year in a row that A-level maths questions from an Edexcel paper were revealed online ahead of the exam. ""To come out [of the exam] and find that there were screenshots of a group chat, where there were pictures of the whole paper - and not just blacked-out images - was extremely disheartening. ""If the grade boundaries go up because everyone that cheated performed much better, all of us that actually put in the work for the past two years will not receive the grades we need. ""We also don't understand how Edexcel are going to find out who cheated and who didn't, as pictures circulated quickly online - so people may have received it without even asking for it. ""Stressing over maths A-level has been an awful addition to an already stressful exam period, and has affected the quality of revision for my exams in the following days. ""I really hope it's third time lucky for Edexcel and they can sort this leak out, because students have lost all faith in this exam board."" The leaks in 2017 and 2018 were investigated by the police andevidence was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration over whether criminal charges should be brought. Pearson said it had taken action to identify the source of this week's breach and was ""determined to identify the individual involved"". After visiting a small group of exam centres, the company said it had identified one centre deemed to be ""in serious breach of correct practice"". Earlier this year, Pearson said it would be trialling a scheme where microchips were placed in exam packs to track the date, time and location of the bundles. A-level leak referred to prosecutors Exam chief's regret over A-level leaks Hundreds of students have signed a petition calling for Edexcel to take the leak into consideration when they set grade boundaries. One student who sat the exam told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""frustrated"" to hear about the leak. ""After I came out of the exam, I was speaking to someone and they said  'those leaked questions on Twitter came up on the paper' - and I was like, 'what leaked questions?'"". ""I'm not frustrated because I feel like I absolutely failed the paper, it wasn't that kind of frustration,"" he added. ""It's more the frustration that I've spent two years studying maths A-level only to realise that some students, through some sort of opportunity, could have not learnt anything for two years - and just spent Â£70 and got an A-level."" Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says schools and exam boards face a number of new challenges. ""We are in a new age [of] technology,"" said Mr Barton. ""Social media, the ability of young people to have phones in exams... all of that has changed the territory,"" he told the BBC. ""We place far too much emphasis on the sheer number of exams we expect young people to do,"" he added.

"European eels are one of the UK's most endangered species Dealers looking to illegally export European eels from the UK have been exposed by BBC Countryfile. Posing as a UK fisherman who had legally caught the eels on the River Severn in Gloucestershire, presenter Joe Crowley was approached by Chinese and Russian buyers and a UK exporter. They were prepared to pay up to seven times the normal catch price if the eels could be sent out of the EU. An export ban on the endangered species has been in place since 2010. Organised crime gangs are said to be smuggling about 350 million live baby eels - or 'glass' eels - every year to Asia, where they are farmed and sold as a delicacy. Andrew Kerr, of the Sustainable Eel Group said the illegal trade in glass eels, also known as elvers, was estimated to be worth about Â£3bn a year. Mr Kerr told the BBC: ""It's the most trafficked animal by number and by value. The Sustainable Eel Group's Andrew Kerr said the illegal trade was estimated to be worth about Â£3bn a year ""It leaves here at one Euro each and then one year later, having been grown in the 900 eel farms of inland China, it's worth 10 Euros - and that's pretty tempting. ""This is the greatest wildlife crime on the planet."" The illegal trade has previously been focused on stocks in France and Spain but now smugglers have turned their attention to the UK, where glass eels can only be caught by licensed fishermen. Countryfile's investigations team posted an advert on an online trading website, offering live eels caught in the River Severn for sale. One buyer from China offered more than Â£1,000 per kilo for the eels to be shipped to Malaysia, despite acknowledging that the export would be illegal. The current price for eels bought and sold legitimately within the EU is about Â£150 per kilo. Another buyer from Russia asked for the catch to be sent to Lithuania legally where he would then arrange for the eels to be moved over the border to Russia. The team was also approached by a UK-based commodities trader who said he had a client in Asia who was looking for glass eels to be exported to South Korea. When later confronted, he said he knew that it was illegal to export eels, that he did not have a buyer in South Korea and that he was only ""speculating"". Ian Guildford of the National Wildlife Crime Unit described it as a ""major crime"" He added that he had never exported glass eels and had no intention of doing so. Since the 1970s, the numbers of eels reaching Europe is thought to have declined by about 90%. Today they are protected as an endangered species by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). They are also named on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. But campaigners are concerned that a lack of monitoring is allowing glass eels to be moved between EU member states and beyond, with few traceability checks enforced or records kept. Ian Guildford, of the National Wildlife Crime Unit, said it was often hard to convince other enforcement agencies to take the crime seriously. He said: ""This is major crime and, once we can get people to understand the severity of the problem, then we might get somewhere.""

"This video can not be played Carrie Lam expressed 'deep sorrow' over extradition law controversy The Hong Kong government has suspended its highly controversial plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, Chief Executive Carrie Lam has announced. She had previously refused to scrap the bill despite mass protests from Hong Kong residents. ""I feel deep sorrow and regret that deficiencies in our work â and various other factors â have stirred up substantial controversies,"" she said. Protesters expressed concern at increased Chinese influence. Ms Lam said she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". She also admitted that the ""explanation and communication"" of the bill had not been adequate. She said her goal was ""the greatest interests of Hong Kong"", which involved first restoring peace and order. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. 'Shield Girl':  The new face of the protests All you need to know about the protests Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained Will the bill damage Hong Kong's star status? Ms Lam said that the urgency felt to pass the bill before the legislative year ends ""perhaps no longer exists"". No date has been set for ""the next step forward"", she said. Hundreds of thousands of people have protested against the plans Hundreds of thousands of people have protested against the bill and further demonstrations were planned for Sunday. Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Protest leaders said that despite Ms Lam's announcement, they would continue their demonstrations until the bill was cancelled, not just delayed. Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong It was a striking U-turn from a leader who previously struck a defiant tone. Mere days ago, Ms Lam had vowed to press ahead with the unpopular legislation â now she has promised to ""listen to different views from society"". But for many protesters, the damage has already been done, and the move to delay - but not cancel - the legislation is unlikely to assuage their concerns. One protester told me he believed the government was ""trying to divert attention away until opposition calms down - and then they'll try to re-do the whole process again"". Others said they would still take part in a march against the proposal planned for Sunday. ""Our final goal is to cancel the law, not to pause it. I think there will still be many people coming out tomorrow,"" a student leader told me. Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. China's foreign ministry publicly backed Ms Lam after her announcement. Profile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong ""The Chinese Central Government expresses its support, respect and understanding for the [Hong Kong] government's decision,""spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement,external. Amid the international debate on Hong Kong, he also warned that its ""affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no interference from any country, organization or individual"". Conversely, Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt applauded the Hong Kong government for ""heeding concerns of the brave citizens"" who objected to the changes. Allow Twitter content?

The changes would allow for criminal extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau - decided on a case-by-case basis by Hong Kong courts. Hong Kong officials, including Ms Lam, say the bill is necessary to protect the city against criminals. But many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised protests Opposition activists also cite the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions and forced confessions in mainland China. It comes after a high-profile case where a Hong Kong man was accused of murdering his girlfriend on holiday in Taiwan but could not be extradited. Yet Taiwanese officials are against the changes - due to their own concerns about the impact they could have. Taiwan is in effect independent, but China considers it a breakaway province. The government there has even said it would not accept the extradition of the accused man if it was under the proposed new rules. ""I'm deeply upset by the assault on freedom and human rights in Hong Kong,"" Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Joseph Wu, tweeted. ""Chief Executive Carrie Lam must listen to the people and take full responsibility. Blaming Taiwan is immoral, shameful and unacceptable. Embrace democracy and stand on the right side of history!"" A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. Then on Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. Tensions boiled over and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets, have been accused of excessive force by some rights groups.

It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region. But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts The Hong Kong handover in a nutshell A timeline of Hong Kong's history People in Hong Kong are worried that the extradition bill could bring Hong Kong more decisively under China's control. Hong Kong officials had said its courts would have the final say whether to grant extradition requests. Ms Lam's government had also said suspects accused of political and religious crimes would not be extradited, insisting legally binding human rights safeguards would also be in place.

"The Catholic Church in Scotland needs to revamp its measures for protecting young and vulnerable people, an independent review has concluded. The review said a better resourced and independent safeguarding service was a ""crucial step to promote transparency and restore credibility"". Baroness Liddell of Coatdyke, who led the review, said a ""a good start has been made"" by the Catholic Church. But she said cultural change was still needed within the organisation. Former altar boy sues over rapes by priest 'Biggest obstacle is church itself' says bishop The independent review group was set up to consider the response of the Catholic Church in Scotland to the recommendations of the 2015McLellan Commission reportinto how the church responds to allegations of abuse. In its first report, the independent group said they had found a willingness to change in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church but progress still had to be made. The group said the Catholic Church should give ""detailed and urgent consideration to the creation of a strengthened, resourced and independent Scottish Catholic Safeguarding Service (SCSS) with appropriate professional support as a crucial step to promote transparency and restore credibility"". It said investment was needed to create a professional safeguarding service and that much could be learned from the organisational changes made in the Catholic Church of Ireland. It added: ""The leadership of the church must take ownership of driving the change necessary to gain a level of confidence that lessons have been learned. ""Monitoring progress is essential, but without cultural change the job will be only half done"". A review of whistle blowing procedures was also recommended. Baroness Liddell led the review of the Catholic Church's response to the McLellan Commission The group also recommended each diocese should have an independent person to whom survivors can turn for advice, adding ""much still needs to be done to ensure victims of abuse are seen, heard and supported by the church and the process of healing begins to take place"". Baroness Liddell, a former Scottish Secretary, said: ""The review group have concluded that there is a need to again review the SCSS to ensure it is properly resourced and empowered to give standardised and unconditional support and scrutiny to every diocese in ensuring high quality safeguarding practice and the right culture. ""We have found a willingness to adopt that change, but true progress can only come about as a result of deep analysis of strengths and weaknesses."" Bishop Joseph Toal, who oversees the work of the SCSS, said:  ""We welcome their report and we shall take time to give it serious consideration. ""Since setting up the independent review group, we have taken steps to improve safeguarding practices in all eight dioceses in Scotland. ""We are determined to apply what we learn, both from the steps we have already taken and from the group's report, and to ensure that the highest standards of safeguarding practice are met throughout the church in Scotland.""

"Protesters were removed from the rig by police using helicopters and boats Greenpeace activists have vowed to continue attempts to prevent an oil rig from reaching the North Sea. The Transocean rig was towed out of the Cromarty Firth on Friday night aftera six-day occupation by protesterswas ended by the police. The rig is heading to the Vorlich oil field east of Aberdeen. But Greenpeace said its Arctic Sunrise ship is now sailing towards the 27,000 tonne rig ""to play her part in thwarting BP's plans"". BP, which has contracted the Transocean-operated rig, served Greenpeace with a court order to prevent Arctic Sunrise from joining the protest in the Cromarty Firth, north of Inverness. A spokesperson said: ""Given Greenpeace's repeated interference and reckless actions directed at our lawful business and their continued illegal defiance for court orders and police action, we have issued the injunction as a precautionary measure to protect the safety of people and operations."" Greenpeace was served with an interdict to prevent its ship the Arctic Sunrise from joining the protest in the Cromarty Firth but the vessel is now heading towards the North Sea But Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven said: ""For nearly a week, our brave activists strained every sinew to stop this BP rig from drilling new oil wells and fuelling the climate emergency. ""And it's not over, our ship the Arctic Sunrise is sailing towards Scotland ready to play her part in thwarting BP's plans. ""They say we're reckless and irresponsible. We say there's nothing as reckless and irresponsible as pushing the world closer to a climate catastrophe. ""For as long as BP remains determined to look for more oil, there will be people determined to stop them."" The rig was due to be towed from the Cromarty Firth on Sunday night but left about midnight on Friday according to Greenpeace A total of 14 people were arrested in connection with the occupation of the oil rig between 9 June and Friday, including a man and a woman who had re-occupied the structure after the original protesters had been removed. A BP spokesman previously said: ""BP supports debate, discussion and peaceful demonstration, but the irresponsible actions of this group are putting themselves and others unnecessarily at risk, while ignoring court orders and police action. ""We share the protesters' concerns about climate change, we support the Paris Agreement and are committed to playing our part to advance the energy transition. ""However, progress to a lower-carbon future will depend on coming together, understanding each other's perspectives and working to find solutions, not dangerous PR stunts that exacerbate divisions and create risks to both life and property.""

"The number of British people who own a second home, buy-to-let or overseas property has doubled since 2001, says think tank the Resolution Foundation. While the number of millennials who own a home continues to fall, one in 10 people now own an additional property. Just 37% of people born in the 1980s managed to buy a home at the age of 29, compared with half of those born in the 1960s. Wealth from owning a second home has risen since 2001 to almost Â£1 trillion. Buy-to-let property is now the most common form of property wealth, having grown by 58% since 2006-08, the report found. However, when looking at the number of people who can afford an additional property, millennials match the property ownership rates of other generations. This suggests that only younger people who are rich can afford a second home - a sign, according to the foundation, that property wealth is not distributed fairly across the country. The Resolution Foundation wants to see policymakers step in to reform the housing market, in particular buy-to-let, in order to rebalance the housing market back towards first-time buyers. ""The sheer scale of additional property wealth is an important driver of rising wealth gaps across Britain,"" says George Bangham, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation. ""While young people in particular are less likely to own their own home than previous generations, those that do own are more likely to have more than one property. ""And as the huge stock of second homes, buy-to-let and overseas properties starts to be passed on to younger generations, Britain risks becoming a country where getting ahead in life depends as much on what you inherit, as what you earn."" Chris Norris, director of policy and practice at the National Landlords Association, defended second home owners. ""There is a distinct difference between those who have a second home for personal use, leaving it empty for long periods of time, and those who have invested in a rental property which provides a valued home for someone else,"" he said. ""Far from the stereotype of the wealthy property baron, most private landlords invest in residential property to provide for their future and their family's in the form of supplementing a pension or establishing a business."" Meanwhile, the government said it was helping first-time buyers get on the housing ladder. ""The Government is determined to ensure that a new generation can realise the dream of homeownership,"" a spokesman said. ""Last year saw the highest number of first-time buyers in more than a decade. Since 2015, we have helped more than 300,000 people to purchase a home through schemes such as Help to Buy.""

"Nearly half of the British Army's latest intake of officer cadets were privately educated, the BBC has found. A Freedom of Information request has revealed 49% of those who entered the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst in January came from fee-paying schools. The Sutton Trust, which aims to improve social mobility, said those at the top of the armed forces were seven times more likely to go to private schools. The Army said it was ""increasing our outreach to those in state education"". The figures stand in contrast to the Royal Navy, which saw 64% of its officer cadets entering the Royal Navy College, at Dartmouth, from state schools. The Royal Air Force says it does not collate information on education background. However, 35% of its officer cadets entering Cranwell College in March had previously served in the ranks. The very top jobs in both the RAF and the Royal Navy have recently been given to men educated at state schools. But that has very rarely been the case for the Army. Sandhurst College is where all officers in the British Army are trained to take on the responsibility of leading soldiers Recent heads of the Army have more commonly attended one of Britain's elite public schools. The last Army chief of the general staff to have been taught at a state school was way back in the early 1950s. There are a number of factors that may explain why change may have been slow. Combined Cadet Forces (CCF) in schools offer pupils a taste of military life and can be a gateway to a career in the military. But another Freedom of Information request has revealed there are nearly as many cadet forces in fee-paying schools as in the state system: 194 private schools have a CCF compared to 205 state schools. Around 7% of the UK population is privately educated, rising to 18% at sixth form level. Eton, one of the most expensive schools in the country, even had a full time guards officer to run its cadet force - paid for by the Army - until the role was axed in 2016. The Ministry of Defence has now set up a programme to increase the number of cadet forces in deprived areas of the country. There is another reason why the military's close ties with private education will prove hard to break. There's a financial incentive to continue the tradition. The Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA) is, as the name suggests, designed to give service personnel stability for their children while they move around the country or abroad. The Ministry of Defence contributes around Â£80m a year towards the boarding school fees of service personnel. The allowance is available to all service personnel who meet the criteria. But it is officers who make the most use of it, even though they are a smaller proportion of the armed forces. Last year, 2,720 children of officers received the allowance - compared to 1,765 children of those serving in the ranks. The allowance is capped at Â£21,000 per child, per year. Given that there are few state schools with boarding facilities most of that money subsidises private school fees - including some of the most elite in the country - including Eton, Harrow and Marlborough College. The Duke of Cambridge, who attended Sandhurst, inspects cadets in December last year And why does this matter? The armed forces say they want to reflect the society they represent. They have set targets for the proportion of women and ethnic minorities - 15% for women and 10% BAME by 2020. But there has been limited change at the top. Major General Paul Nanson, from the Army, said ""Sandhurst, like the Army, is all about equal opportunity and maximising potential."" He added: ""At the Academy we worry less about which university or school an individual went to; more about their leadership potential."" The Army says it has a separate scheme for older soldiers to be promoted from the ranks. So-called late entry officers account for about 20% of all Army Officers. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson added: ""We are a diverse employer wishing to attract and offer careers to people from a wide range of backgrounds. ""We are increasing our outreach to those in state education to ensure that everyone is aware of the opportunities a career in the armed forces offer."" It is claimed the Duke of Wellington once said the Battle of Waterloo was won on the ""playing fields of Eton"". Two hundred years on and much has changed. But the British Army is still heavily reliant on its cadre of privately-educated officers.

"Grand Union said it would get to London Paddington from Cardiff in 90 minutes A new express train service would cut journey times from Cardiff to London by 20 minutes if it is given the go-ahead. The proposed open-access service by Grand Union Trains would run alongside current Great Western Railway trains to Paddington station. Operating on the south Wales mainline, the service would stop at fewer stations, making it a quicker journey. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said it wasaware of the proposal,externaland early talks had started. The hourly service would operate between London Paddington and Cardiff Central and could be live by December 2020. It would stop at Severn Tunnel Junction in Monmouthshire, a station which is not currently served by Great Western's London service. The service would run from Cardiff Central, to Newport, Severn Tunnel Junction and Bristol Parkway, then to London Paddington. It will also stop at Cardiff Parkway when it opens. Ian Yeowart has successfully operated similar rail services before Grand Union said their service would take one and a half hours - by not stopping at Swindon, Didcot and Reading - in comparison to Great Western's half-hourly service, which takes more than two hours. The firm's managing director Ian Yeowart said: ""The trains we offer will be faster, more comfortable, we'll offer some competition so that will have a downward pressure on price. ""We look for places that deserve a better rail service and can support a better rail service."" Trains will operate with nine coaches, offering first class, standard class and a buffet car. New rail services will 'boost economy' 'Stop blame game on rail disruption' New Â£5bn Wales rail franchise starts Mr Yeowart said he has also been in talks with the Welsh Government about other improvements to rail services. ""We're not just talking about trains, we're also talking about potential infrastructure at Severn Tunnel Junction and at Cardiff Central Station so there's a lot of exciting things to happen,"" he added. ""We also plan to base the entire operation in south Wales so there would be about 135 new jobs to come into the area if we're successful."" The new train service would not call at Swindon, Didcot and Reading They propose using second-hand 140mph (225 km/h) trains formed of nine coaches and a driving trailer, which have been used by London and North Eastern Railway on the East Coast Main Line. Prof Stuart Cole, a former director of Wales Transport Research Centre at the University of Glamorgan, said Mr Yeowart had a ""proven record"" in this field. ""He's been in this business before, last time it was very successful,"" he said. ""He's gone for the most profitable and busiest part of the line, it's extra trains on the market and we can see what prices come to the market."" Ken Skates, the Welsh Government's minister for economy and transport, said: ""[We] welcome the ambition being shown by Grand Union Trains to address this by proposing the operation of a new, fast, limited stop, high quality service which would provide an alternative option for passengers to travel between the two capital cities."" Under track access rules, other rail operators are able to provide a service if a route is not deemed congested, and the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) approves an application. The application will now be subject to a 28 day consultation period.

"This video can not be played Carrie Lam expressed 'deep sorrow' over extradition law controversy The Hong Kong government has suspended its highly controversial plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, Chief Executive Carrie Lam has announced. She had previously refused to scrap the bill despite mass protests from Hong Kong residents. ""I feel deep sorrow and regret that deficiencies in our work â and various other factors â have stirred up substantial controversies,"" she said. Protesters expressed concern at increased Chinese influence. Ms Lam said she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". She also admitted that the ""explanation and communication"" of the bill had not been adequate. She said her goal was ""the greatest interests of Hong Kong"", which involved first restoring peace and order. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. 'Shield Girl':  The new face of the protests All you need to know about the protests Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained Will the bill damage Hong Kong's star status? Ms Lam said that the urgency felt to pass the bill before the legislative year ends ""perhaps no longer exists"". No date has been set for ""the next step forward"", she said. Hundreds of thousands of people have protested against the plans Hundreds of thousands of people have protested against the bill and further demonstrations were planned for Sunday. Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Protest leaders said that despite Ms Lam's announcement, they would continue their demonstrations until the bill was cancelled, not just delayed. Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong It was a striking U-turn from a leader who previously struck a defiant tone. Mere days ago, Ms Lam had vowed to press ahead with the unpopular legislation â now she has promised to ""listen to different views from society"". But for many protesters, the damage has already been done, and the move to delay - but not cancel - the legislation is unlikely to assuage their concerns. One protester told me he believed the government was ""trying to divert attention away until opposition calms down - and then they'll try to re-do the whole process again"". Others said they would still take part in a march against the proposal planned for Sunday. ""Our final goal is to cancel the law, not to pause it. I think there will still be many people coming out tomorrow,"" a student leader told me. Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. China's foreign ministry publicly backed Ms Lam after her announcement. Profile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong ""The Chinese Central Government expresses its support, respect and understanding for the [Hong Kong] government's decision,""spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement,external. Amid the international debate on Hong Kong, he also warned that its ""affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no interference from any country, organization or individual"". Conversely, Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt applauded the Hong Kong government for ""heeding concerns of the brave citizens"" who objected to the changes. Allow Twitter content?

The changes would allow for criminal extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau - decided on a case-by-case basis by Hong Kong courts. Hong Kong officials, including Ms Lam, say the bill is necessary to protect the city against criminals. But many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised protests Opposition activists also cite the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions and forced confessions in mainland China. It comes after a high-profile case where a Hong Kong man was accused of murdering his girlfriend on holiday in Taiwan but could not be extradited. Yet Taiwanese officials are against the changes - due to their own concerns about the impact they could have. Taiwan is in effect independent, but China considers it a breakaway province. The government there has even said it would not accept the extradition of the accused man if it was under the proposed new rules. ""I'm deeply upset by the assault on freedom and human rights in Hong Kong,"" Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Joseph Wu, tweeted. ""Chief Executive Carrie Lam must listen to the people and take full responsibility. Blaming Taiwan is immoral, shameful and unacceptable. Embrace democracy and stand on the right side of history!"" A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. Then on Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. Tensions boiled over and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets, have been accused of excessive force by some rights groups. This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters Until Saturday's announcement, Ms Lam had not spoken publicly sinceshe labelled the protests ""organised riots""during a tearful address. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War -which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China.It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region. But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts The Hong Kong handover in a nutshell A timeline of Hong Kong's history People in Hong Kong are worried that the extradition bill could bring Hong Kong more decisively under China's control. Hong Kong officials had said its courts would have the final say whether to grant extradition requests. Ms Lam's government had also said suspects accused of political and religious crimes would not be extradited, insisting legally binding human rights safeguards would also be in place.

"Nearly half of the British Army's latest intake of officer cadets were privately educated, the BBC has found. A Freedom of Information request has revealed 49% of those who entered the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst in January came from fee-paying schools. The Sutton Trust, which aims to improve social mobility, said those at the top of the armed forces were seven times more likely to go to private schools. The Army said it was ""increasing our outreach to those in state education"". The figures stand in contrast to the Royal Navy, which saw 64% of its officer cadets entering the Royal Navy College, at Dartmouth, from state schools. The Royal Air Force says it does not collate information on education background. However, 35% of its officer cadets entering Cranwell College in March had previously served in the ranks. The very top jobs in both the RAF and the Royal Navy have recently been given to men educated at state schools. But that has very rarely been the case for the Army. Sandhurst College is where all officers in the British Army are trained to take on the responsibility of leading soldiers Recent heads of the Army have more commonly attended one of Britain's elite public schools. The last Army chief of the general staff to have been taught at a state school was way back in the early 1950s. There are a number of factors that may explain why change may have been slow. Combined Cadet Forces (CCF) in schools offer pupils a taste of military life and can be a gateway to a career in the military. But another Freedom of Information request has revealed there are nearly as many cadet forces in fee-paying schools as in the state system: 194 private schools have a CCF compared to 205 state schools. Around 7% of the UK population is privately educated, rising to 18% at sixth form level. Eton, one of the most expensive schools in the country, even had a full time guards officer to run its cadet force - paid for by the Army - until the role was axed in 2016. The Ministry of Defence has now set up a programme to increase the number of cadet forces in deprived areas of the country. There is another reason why the military's close ties with private education will prove hard to break. There's a financial incentive to continue the tradition. The Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA) is, as the name suggests, designed to give service personnel stability for their children while they move around the country or abroad. The Ministry of Defence contributes around Â£80m a year towards the boarding school fees of service personnel. The allowance is available to all service personnel who meet the criteria. But it is officers who make the most use of it, even though they are a smaller proportion of the armed forces. Last year, 2,720 children of officers received the allowance - compared to 1,765 children of those serving in the ranks. The allowance is capped at Â£21,000 per child, per year. Given that there are few state schools with boarding facilities most of that money subsidises private school fees - including some of the most elite in the country - including Eton, Harrow and Marlborough College. The Duke of Cambridge, who attended Sandhurst, inspects cadets in December last year And why does this matter? The armed forces say they want to reflect the society they represent. They have set targets for the proportion of women and ethnic minorities - 15% for women and 10% BAME by 2020. But there has been limited change at the top. Major General Paul Nanson, from the Army, said ""Sandhurst, like the Army, is all about equal opportunity and maximising potential."" He added: ""At the Academy we worry less about which university or school an individual went to; more about their leadership potential."" The Army says it has a separate scheme for older soldiers to be promoted from the ranks. So-called late entry officers account for about 20% of all Army Officers. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson added: ""We are a diverse employer wishing to attract and offer careers to people from a wide range of backgrounds. ""We are increasing our outreach to those in state education to ensure that everyone is aware of the opportunities a career in the armed forces offer."" It is claimed the Duke of Wellington once said the Battle of Waterloo was won on the ""playing fields of Eton"". Two hundred years on and much has changed.

"The rinderpest virus, shown here infecting a cell, is highly contagious in cattle Scientists have destroyed the UK's laboratory stocks of a virus that once caused devastating cattle losses. These stocks accounted for most of the world's lab samples of rinderpest, which were held at The Pirbright Institute in Surrey. Rinderpest and the deadly smallpox virus are the only diseases to have been eradicated from the face of the Earth. BBC News had exclusive access to the destruction of the final samples. Dr Carrie Batten, from The Pirbright Institute, described the moment as ""the end of an era"". ""Rinderpest was devastating and by removing the stocks that are held globally you are essentially reducing the risk dramatically,"" she said. Rinderpest devastated cattle in Africa during the 1890s. Millions of people died from starvation. Dr Michael Baron, honorary fellow at the institute, said the end of rinderpest would mark the beginning of a new war on other diseases. ""The success we have achieved with rinderpest has been one of the main drivers for people saying we can do this with other animal diseases and other human diseases such as polio, mumps and measles. These diseases are eradicable and this should be done,"" he explained. This video can not be played Inside the lab where they study the world's most deadly diseases The rinderpest virus is responsible for one of the worst catastrophes in history. During an outbreak in the 1890s, it killed between 80% and 90% of cattle in eastern and southern Africa. This caused mass starvation in the region. Millions of people died as a result. In Ethiopia alone, one-third of the human population was wiped out. The toll in lives was on a scale matched only by the Black Death in Europe. A vaccination campaign eventually brought the disease under control until it wasdeclared to have been eradicated in the wild in 2011. But thousands of samples of the virus remained in 40 laboratories across 36 countries. If there happened to be an accident, the disease could potentially leak out and cause devastation once again. To prevent this, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) approved a few highly secure labs and encouraged other institutes to send their rinderpest samples to these facilities. Among them is the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, which has led efforts to record the genetic information contained in each sample and then destroy it. Researchers have been reluctant to destroy lab samples of deadly viruses in case they are needed to create a vaccine should the disease ever re-emerge. But a digital record of the virus's genetic code means that this is no longer an issue. And so Pirbright has been able to destroy all its samples which account for most of the laboratory rinderpest virus in the world. Dr Samia Metwally, of the FAO, hopes that Pirbright's success will encourage other holding facilities to follow suit so that it is completely eliminated from the face of the Earth. ""This is a huge step by Pirbright. It sets a precedent for other countries to do the same."" Dr Monique Eloit, the OIE's director-general, told BBC News that she was ""very happy"" about the development. ""All the work done by farmers, veterinarians and scientists for such a long time is on track to minimise the risk of the re-emergence of rinderpest,"" she said. The government's chief vet, Dr Christine Middlemiss, welcomed the news. ""It is such a devastating disease. 100% of susceptible animals become infected and die from the virus. So to have that removed as a threat is fantastic,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Carrie Lam expressed 'deep sorrow' over extradition law controversy The Hong Kong government has suspended its highly controversial plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, Chief Executive Carrie Lam has announced. She had previously refused to scrap the bill despite mass protests from Hong Kong residents. ""I feel deep sorrow and regret that deficiencies in our work â and various other factors â have stirred up substantial controversies,"" she said. Protesters expressed concern at increased Chinese influence. Ms Lam said she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". She also admitted that the ""explanation and communication"" of the bill had not been adequate. She said her goal was ""the greatest interests of Hong Kong"", which involved first restoring peace and order. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. 'Shield Girl':  The new face of the protests All you need to know about the protests Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained Will the bill damage Hong Kong's star status? Ms Lam said that the urgency felt to pass the bill before the legislative year ends ""perhaps no longer exists"". No date has been set for ""the next step forward"", she said. Hundreds of thousands of people have protested against the plans Hundreds of thousands of people have protested against the bill and further demonstrations were planned for Sunday. Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Protest leaders said that despite Ms Lam's announcement, they would continue their demonstrations until the bill was cancelled, not just delayed. Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong It was a striking U-turn from a leader who previously struck a defiant tone. Mere days ago, Ms Lam had vowed to press ahead with the unpopular legislation â now she has promised to ""listen to different views from society"". But for many protesters, the damage has already been done, and the move to delay - but not cancel - the legislation is unlikely to assuage their concerns. One protester told me he believed the government was ""trying to divert attention away until opposition calms down - and then they'll try to re-do the whole process again"". Others said they would still take part in a march against the proposal planned for Sunday. ""Our final goal is to cancel the law, not to pause it. I think there will still be many people coming out tomorrow,"" a student leader told me. Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. China's foreign ministry publicly backed Ms Lam after her announcement. Profile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong ""The Chinese Central Government expresses its support, respect and understanding for the [Hong Kong] government's decision,""spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement,external. Amid the international debate on Hong Kong, he also warned that its ""affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no interference from any country, organization or individual"". Conversely, Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt applauded the Hong Kong government for ""heeding concerns of the brave citizens"" who objected to the changes. Allow Twitter content?

The changes would allow for criminal extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau - decided on a case-by-case basis by Hong Kong courts. Hong Kong officials, including Ms Lam, say the bill is necessary to protect the city against criminals. But many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised protests Opposition activists also cite the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions and forced confessions in mainland China. It comes after a high-profile case where a Hong Kong man was accused of murdering his girlfriend on holiday in Taiwan but could not be extradited. Yet Taiwanese officials are against the changes - due to their own concerns about the impact they could have. Taiwan is in effect independent, but China considers it a breakaway province. The government there has even said it would not accept the extradition of the accused man if it was under the proposed new rules. ""I'm deeply upset by the assault on freedom and human rights in Hong Kong,"" Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Joseph Wu, tweeted. ""Chief Executive Carrie Lam must listen to the people and take full responsibility. Blaming Taiwan is immoral, shameful and unacceptable. Embrace democracy and stand on the right side of history!"" A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. Then on Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. Tensions boiled over and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets, have been accused of excessive force by some rights groups. This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters Until Saturday's announcement, Ms Lam had not spoken publicly sinceshe labelled the protests ""organised riots""during a tearful address. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War -which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China.It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region. But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts The Hong Kong handover in a nutshell A timeline of Hong Kong's history People in Hong Kong are worried that the extradition bill could bring Hong Kong more decisively under China's control. Hong Kong officials had said its courts would have the final say whether to grant extradition requests. Ms Lam's government had also said suspects accused of political and religious crimes would not be extradited, insisting legally binding human rights safeguards would also be in place.

"Social media users are posting pictures of wilted or bloodied bauhinia flowers to express solidarity with protesters in Hong Kong. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have been used to share news, pictures and messages of support alongside the images, as well as hashtags such as #FightForHongKong and #HongKongProtest. Activists' attempts to storm government buildings gave way to the worst violence in the city for decades on Wednesday. Previously, days of protests had seen more than a million people take to Hong Kong's streets for predominantly peaceful demonstrations against plans which would permit extradition requests from authorities in mainland China. Hong Kong extradition protests leave city in shock Who are the protesters? Why are there protests in Hong Kong? Since sovereignty of the former British colony reverted to China in 1997, when the bauhinia blakeana, or Hong Kong orchid tree, was incorporated onto the territory's new flag, it has retained judicial and economic independence under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". But many in Hong Kong worry the territory could be brought more decisively under China's control if the extradition bill passes. Allow Twitter content?

"""He abused his power. I was young, I loved being able to go to shows and he used that because he knew that I would be easily led."" Rachel says that in 2011, when she was 18, a music industry figure raped her. She says until recently he was still working in the industry on the team of a ""pretty big band"". We've changed her name to protect her identity. She's just one of several fans who've been speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat, telling us stories of how ""groupie"" culture has led to them being sexually abused. A warning: this article contains details of alleged sexual assaults which you may find upsetting. We shared what we heard with the group that represents the industry - UK Music. It told us it takes sexual abuse and harassment ""extremely seriously"" and has signed up to codes of practices aimed at stopping ""bullying, harassment and discrimination"". ""I started a friendship with him back when I was like 14,"" Rachel says about the man. She doesn't know exactly how old he was, but says there were ""rumours"" he was older than 30. He would use his position to get her into shows for free and introduce her to bands she liked. But then, after a night at the pub, they went back to his flat. ""I basically remember waking up laying on the side of his bed with him having sex with me. I remember pushing him off. I'm crying at this point and he just kept going and kept going."" She has no doubt that the way the music industry works contributed to what happened to her. ""It's an easy preying ground for these people to find fans that want that little bit more - they want that backstage pass, they want to meet the band, they want to get in for free. ""They can say: 'If you do this for me then I'll give it to you'. And some people have that mindset that if you say no they feel like they deserve it anyway. ""It's always been seen that being a groupie is just part of being in a band or in the music industry. When really it's not OK."" We've also heard stories from fans who say they've been abused by musicians themselves. In 2017, Zoeaccused the lead singerof pop-punk band Moose Blood of stealing nude photos from her phone and sharing them in the band's WhatsApp group. Moose Blood have always denied this andlast year announcedthey were taking a break from music, blaming ""serious false accusations"" against them. Regardless of whether it's true or not, Zoe told us the situation only came about because she was such a big fan. Moose Blood on stage in 2016 ""I didn't realise it was a bad thing because they were my favourite band and I was a bit flattered by the attention. ""I was just thinking: 'Oh my God, my favourite band are here in my house', so I just didn't react to it the way I probably should have. ""I think bands need to take full responsibility and realise their status and the effect they can have on their fans."" Newsbeat tried to contact several bands and musicians - including Moose Blood - who say they have been falsely accused of sexual misconduct. None of them agreed to be interviewed. Laura did, though. She's a musician and, again, we've changed her name. She told us about a time she says someone from a well-known band approached her group of friends. ""He snatched my phone out of my hand and he was like: 'Oh I'm just putting my number in'. ""Then he literally grabbed me by my throat, slammed me against the wall and shoved his tongue down my throat."" The band in question deny that this ever happened. Laura says what shocked her most was how she was treated. ""I was told by a few people in the industry that I shouldn't talk about my experience as it could jeopardise my career in music. ""It's like a massive manipulation because if the music industry is full of people that want to cover it up then these crimes are just going to keep happening."" So what is the industry doing? We met up with Dexter Hubbard, who runs Fearless Records in the UK, to find out. Dexter Hubbard says issues in the industry ""are being dealt with head-on now"" He ""confidently but not arrogantly"" describes Fearless as ""one of the leading labels"" when it comes to emo and post-hardcore music. But, like a lot of labels, they've had bands on their roster who've been accused of sexual misconduct. Regardless of whether those accusations are true, Dexter told us the industry is ""taking the problem seriously"". ""Everybody just has to have honest conversations about what is expected. With our bands we underline the importance of the standards they need to set for themselves as well as us as a label. ""As an issue it has come to the forefront in recent years and the conversation is more upfront."" Another person who thinks things are ""getting better"" is Janine Shilstone, singer from the band Vukovi. Janine says she knows women who work in the industry who've had ""horrific things"" happen to them Their single C.L.A.U.D.I.A has been been getting support from the likes of Annie Mac on BBC Radio 1 - and it's about an experience Janine had with an industry figure who is ""quite high-up"". She says she noticed the man ""testing the water"" with various women - and then he tried it on with her. Janine says when she rejected him, he said: ""Do you know who I am? I will ruin you."" She told us she also knows a few women in bands who've had ""horrific things"" happen to them. We met up with Janine after a soundcheck for one of Vukovi's gigs in London ""It blows my mind. A girl shouldn't be told: 'You just have to adapt and you just have to accept that's the way it is'. ""It shouldn't be like that and it has been for so long. But I do feel like things are starting to change a bit."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

"Exam board Edexcel has launched an investigation into how part of an A-level maths paper was leaked online. Blacked-out images of two questions were shared on social media on Thursday afternoon. Pearson, which runs Edexcel, said the images were circulated ""in a very limited way"" shortly before Friday's Maths Paper 3 exam. It reassured students no-one would be advantaged or disadvantaged and they would not have to re-sit the paper. Students react: 'I cried in the car on the way home' The questions were first posted on Twitter in a now deleted post; the account holder urged students to get in touch, offering the whole paper for Â£70. It is the third year in a row that A-level maths questions from an Edexcel paper were revealed online ahead of the exam. ""To come out [of the exam] and find that there were screenshots of a group chat, where there were pictures of the whole paper - and not just blacked-out images - was extremely disheartening. ""If the grade boundaries go up because everyone that cheated performed much better, all of us that actually put in the work for the past two years will not receive the grades we need. ""We also don't understand how Edexcel are going to find out who cheated and who didn't, as pictures circulated quickly online - so people may have received it without even asking for it. ""Stressing over maths A-level has been an awful addition to an already stressful exam period, and has affected the quality of revision for my exams in the following days. ""I really hope it's third time lucky for Edexcel and they can sort this leak out, because students have lost all faith in this exam board."" The leaks in 2017 and 2018 were investigated by the police andevidence was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration over whether criminal charges should be brought. Pearson said it had taken action to identify the source of this week's breach and was ""determined to identify the individual involved"". After visiting a small group of exam centres, the company said it had identified one centre deemed to be ""in serious breach of correct practice"". Earlier this year, Pearson said it would be trialling a scheme where microchips were placed in exam packs to track the date, time and location of the bundles. A-level leak referred to prosecutors Exam chief's regret over A-level leaks Hundreds of students have signed a petition calling for Edexcel to take the leak into consideration when they set grade boundaries. One student who sat the exam told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""frustrated"" to hear about the leak. ""After I came out of the exam, I was speaking to someone and they said  'those leaked questions on Twitter came up on the paper' - and I was like, 'what leaked questions?'"". ""I'm not frustrated because I feel like I absolutely failed the paper, it wasn't that kind of frustration,"" he added. ""It's more the frustration that I've spent two years studying maths A-level only to realise that some students, through some sort of opportunity, could have not learnt anything for two years - and just spent Â£70 and got an A-level."" Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says schools and exam boards face a number of new challenges. ""We are in a new age [of] technology,"" said Mr Barton. ""Social media, the ability of young people to have phones in exams... all of that has changed the territory,"" he told the BBC. ""We place far too much emphasis on the sheer number of exams we expect young people to do,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Iranian TV footage shows a burning tanker In the hours after two apparent attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday, the US military released video footage which it said proved Iran was behind them. The footage was said to show Iranian special forces removing a mine which had failed to explode. The footage, though far from conclusive, was used by the US to make a more compelling case than earlier assertions of Iranian complicity in attacks in the region, which had not been accompanied by any evidence. But a key question remains - what would be Iran's motive in attacking a Japanese and a Norwegian tanker carrying petrochemicals from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to Singapore and Taiwan? Gulf of Oman tanker 'attacks': What we know Iran, the US and the Gulf: What now? Tanker attacks: Your questions answered Iran has come under massive economic pressure over the past year, since US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and re-imposed some of the most aggressive sanctions in US foreign policy history - targeting Iran's oil sales, wider energy industry, shipping, banking, insurance and more. Some of the sanctions, because of their secondary nature, are designed to dissuade other nations from purchasing Iranian oil, the exports of which bring in about 30% of Iran's revenue. And they have managed to bring down Iran's oil exports by more than a third. This video can not be played Security correspondent Frank Gardner looks at the evidence the US says proves Iran's involvement in attacks on two tankers So far, Iran has in response pursued a policy of strategic patience. But if it was behind Thursday's attacks, what we may be seeing is the end of that policy. The strategic patience may have run out. Iran clearly changed tack last month after the US suspended sanctions waivers which had allowed certain countries to buy oil from Iran - significantly accelerating the Trump administration's goal of driving down Iran's exports to zero. Iran's response was to scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal and to announce that, if Iran could not export its oil, no other country would be allowed to export theirs. About 30% of the world's seaborne oil transports travel through the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic sea passage in the Gulf, on Iran's south coast. Iran has made threats in relation to the strait before - but never acted on them. Even back in 2012, when the EU imposed an oil embargo against Tehran as part of a broader sanction regime adopted against the country because of the nuclear impasse, Tehran refrained from closing the passage. But the re-imposition of sanctions recently by the US has significantly ratcheted up the pressure on Iran, pressure that would go some way to explaining why it might seek to threaten the international oil trade, while its own oil sits bounded by its borders. The risk of such a strategic move is significant - the fallout is potential military escalation with the US and its allies in the region. It is not a gamble that would have been made quickly or lightly. It would have been taken by consensus by all the main heads of the different Iranian political institutions, with Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards (IRGC) playing a significant part given their influence over all regional dossiers, and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, having the final say over all matters of security and international affairs. If Iran is indeed behind these attacks, it would demonstrate that the country's key decision makers feel the risk of military escalation is one worth taking because of the lack of alternative options. Iran may suspect that the risk is lower than it first seems, because Mr Trump does not want a war. Recent statements by the US president suggested that despite his bellicosity, he is open for talks with Iran without pre-conditions. The Iranians will also be mindful however that Mr Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton, a long-time critic of Iran, has openly called for the US to confront Iran. If strategic patience is in fact at an end, Iran may feel that only by displaying the range and scale of its potential destabilising activities - including disruption of the international oil trade it has been barred from - can it increase its leverage with the US, and pull itself out from under the punishing sanctions its old foe has imposed.

"Mariam Moustafa had a stroke and died in hospital a month after the attack Two members of a girl gang who attacked a student at a bus stop in a row over a boy have been sentenced. Mariam Moustafa, 18, fell into a coma after she was punched several times by a ""pack"" of assailants last February. She died of a stroke a month later, but pathologists could not legally link the attack with her death, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Mariah Fraser, 20, was given an eight-month sentence and Britania Hunter, 18, given a 12-month community order. Both previously admitted affray. A third accused, a 16-year-old girl who cannot be named and also pleaded guilty, was remanded back to the youth court for sentencing. Six female defendants were charged after Miss Moustafa, an engineering student, was attacked in Nottingham city centre while one of her friends tried to protect her. They included three other teenage girls aged 18, 17 and 16, who will be sentenced later this month. During sentencing, Nottingham Crown Court heardthe attack was ""fuelled by social media"". Fraser (left), Hunter (right) and four teenagers admitted carrying out the attack Opening the facts of the case on Thursday, prosecutor Luke Blackburn said the six were not charged with manslaughter because pathologists could not legally link the attack to Miss Moustafa's death. The hearing was told Fraser and Hunter were part of a group who filmed the attack on Miss Moustafa and watched as two others, aged 16 and 18, hit her. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Mr Blackburn said footage showed Miss Moustafa, an Egyptian national, looking ""frightened, passive and, towards the end, obviously unwell"". Judge Gregory Dickinson QC called the defendants aggressive and cowardly and said: ""This was not an attack motivated by hostility to race or religion. It was to do with a boy."" Mohamed Moustafa said he was not informed of a court hearing in April where the three admitted affray Ch Supt Rob Griffin said: ""These girls showed persistent aggression towards Mariam and what was even more disgusting was that there was filming of what happened and this footage was shared on social media."" Miss Moustafa's father, Mohamed Moustafa,said the family had not been informed about a hearingin April where Fraser, Hunter and the 16-year-old admitted affray a week before their trial. The Crown Prosecution Service subsequently apologised. After the sentencing, he said his family ""are not safe in this country"". ""I have been doing my best for all of my family - telling them to keep safe, don't do anything wrong in this country, don't attack anyone, but after court today... nobody can protect my family,"" he said.

"Cody Barlow's decision to use his truck to send a powerful message of support A heterosexual Oklahoma man's rainbow-coloured tailgate tribute to Pride Month has been embraced and highlighted by the LGBT community in Oklahoma and beyond. Using mailbox letters to write 'Not all country boys are bigots' across the back of his pick-up truck, Cody Barlowposted a photo of his creation,externalon his Facebook and Instagram pages, adding that it was important to him because he has family and friends who are LGBT. ""Countless people have dealt with hatred and judgement simply for who they are, and/or who they love, for far too long,"" he wrote. Cody, a US Navy veteran living in Hulbert, said in his post: ""Obviously doing this isn't going to change the minds of those who are intolerant, but hopefully it can help drown out the hatred with love."" Cody Barlow wants to break down stereotypes Expecting some negativity from his post, Cody vowed to keep the message displayed for the entire month of June to show his support, in the hope that at least one person who needs the support would get it. ""I hope everyone finds their inner strength to finally live life loud and proud without regard for the negativity of ignorant people. Happy pride month!"" Cody told the BBC he wasn't expecting his posts to gain such viral fame and he was overwhelmed by the reaction. His post has been shared more than 80,000 times and garnered 20,000 comments, mostly showering Cody with praise for his positive attitude. Cody says: ""I never anticipated that it would go so far and reach so many people. ""It's a culmination of several years of becoming more exposed to friends, family, co-workers, people whom I've served with and others who are from the LGBTQ+ community and seeing and hearing the hatred and violence that they face."" The 28-year-old university student says he wanted to try to help people be able to express key parts of their identity and be comfortable with expressing their love and this also, in part, motivated him to go buy several rolls of brightly coloured duct tape and create the rainbow design of the Pride flag on his truck. In his original posting, he stated: ""I live in a rural area in Oklahoma, surrounded by small towns in every direction, and I'm sure this is not a very welcome message around here, but this is going to be displayed on my truck for the entire month of June in support of pride month."" Cody told the BBC that he wanted to break down any perceived stereotypes of ""countryfolks as racist, homophobic and bigoted"". He said: ""When I was young I didn't know too much about the LGBTQ+ community; it wasn't something we were taught about and people weren't hugely open. My family has always been open-minded and as I grew older and friends started coming out to me and I got to know more people on deployment and elsewhere, I learned a lot more about the challenges the communities face."" Cody said he wanted to be a strong ally and use any privileges he had to help people. ""I definitely plan to keep the flag on for the rest of the month but I'm open to keep it on for a bit longer. People have been asking me to come out to their Pride parades in July."" One Facebook user, Mike Arnold, a 68-year-old gay married man,wrote,external: ""Thank you for growing up to be a really stand up guy. You must make your family very proud. You certainly do for those of us who grew up in rural areas like yours."" The reaction to Cody's message was generally positive Mike stressed they would be ""nowhere without the love and support of our straight friends - many of whom are or are being adopted into our families"". John in Dallas appreciated the ""simple act of tolerance,external"" that meant so much to him while Joey added: ""You have a friend in Colorado,external."" Cody's Facebook friend list has shot up to more than 5,000 people and he says at one point he was getting 1,000 requests a day from strangers keen to connect with him. Calls for a 'Straight Pride Parade' cause stir Chinese broadcaster censors LGBT symbols at Eurovision No tip for US waitress with LGBT tattoo While the majority of the reaction has been positive, there have been others who have questioned Cody's actions. But Cody says: ""These remarks have mainly been on social media. Everyone who has come up to me in person has been really positive. ""I think those who have been negative, perhaps they feel a false sense of safety by posting remarks rather than say anything face-to-face. ""But I don't let their negativity affect me.
