"Mike Pence said he abandoned the game because kneeling during the anthem ""disrespects our soldiers"" US Vice-President Mike Pence has walked out of a National Football League (NFL) game after several players refused to stand for the US national anthem. Mr Pence said he could not be present at an event that ""disrespects our soldiers, our flag"" after abandoning the game in his home state of Indiana. President Donald Trumptweeted,externalthat he had asked Mr Pence to leave if players kneeled and said he was ""proud of him"". Kneeling at NFL games has become a form of protest against racial injustice. Mr Trump has criticised players sharply for the protests and pressed the NFL to ban them. What's really driving Trump in his NFL feud? Decoding the NFL protests ""I left today's Colts game because @POTUS [President Trump] and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our flag, or our National Anthem,"" Mr Pencetweeted,externalon Sunday. ByAnthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Mike Pence travelled quite a ways - from Nevada to Indianapolis then back west to California - to make a statement. There's little doubt the vice-president, despite his earlier tweet about looking forward to attending an NFL game in his home state, planned to walk out early. The matchup involved the San Francisco 49ers, whose then-quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, started the kneeling protests. Mr Pence's media pool was told the vice-president might be making a quick exit. And Mr Pence's press statement, followed by a presidential tweet of approval, appeared shortly after Mr Pence left. Next come the questions. Was that statement worth the vice-president's time? And how much did that trip cost US taxpayers? Trump's supporters are already celebrating the move, helping the vice-president burnish his standing with his boss's loyal base. Some of the NFL players were clearly irritated by what they saw as a political publicity stunt. Americans, according to polls, are split. They're not happy about the NFL protests, but they don't like Mr Trump's eagerness to stoke the flames of controversy. Now - as tensions rise in North Korea and yet another hurricane slams into the US - Mr Pence is joining the anthem fray. Mr Pence's departure came after players from the visiting San Francisco 49ers did not stand during the anthem before the game against the Indianapolis Colts. ""While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the flag,"" Mr Pence added. Allow Twitter content?

He had earlier tweeted that he and his wife Karen were looking forward to the game in a tweet in which he used of photo of then both wearing Colts shirts. That the photo appeared also to have been used in 2014 has in part helped fuel critics' claims his walk out was a publicity stunt. His team won the game 26-23. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump has previously said that his comments condemning the NFL protests have ""nothing to do with race"". But his criticism of the protests has appeared to galvanise players, This video can not be played Why America's sports stars are taking a knee Recent protests have involved players kneeling, linking arms or staying in the locker room during the Star-Spangled Banner. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stirred controversy last year when he first knelt for the anthem to highlight the treatment of black Americans after a series of police shootings. Since then, more and more public figures in the US have been ""taking a knee"" at big events and using the hashtag#TakeAKnee,externalon social media.

"Ryan Gosling, Denis Villeneuve, Ana de Armas and Harrison Ford at the Paris premiere of Blade Runner 2049 Blade Runner 2049 has made far less than expected on its opening weekend at the US box office. The $31.5m (Â£24.1m) total will be a major disappointment for distributor Warner Bros, which had projected ticket sales of between $45m and $50m. Its 163-minute running time, limiting the number of screenings, was said to be one factor in the under-performance. But it was still the weekend's most popular movie in the US. It topped the UK box office, with sales above Â£6m. The sequel to the 1982 cult classic, which also stars Harrison Ford as well as Ryan Gosling, cost Sony and Alcon Entertainment $150m to make. Despite strong advance ticket sales and glowing reviews from many critics, the movie made $12.7m on Thursday night and Friday, $11.4m on Saturday and a projected $7.4m on Sunday from just over 4,000 cinemas. This video can not be played Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford star in the sequel of Blade Runner Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore, said: ""The core of enthusiastic and loyal 'Blade Runner' fans were over 25 and predominantly male, and propelled the film as expected to the top spot, but a lengthy running time and lesser interest among females made it tougher for the film to reach the original weekend box office projections."" Men over 25 accounted for half the audience, according to PostTrack, with women over 25 making up 27%. Jeff Goldstein, of Warner Bros, said  Blade Runner 2049 had disappointed in smaller cities and in the South and Midwest, where the running time and baseball playoffs appeared to have deterred moviegoers. ""We did well in the major and high-profile markets,"" he said. ""Alcon and Denis [Villeneuve, the director] made an amazing movie. The audience for it was narrower than we anticipated."" Harrison Ford at the film's Madrid premiere Globally, the film took $50.2m and claimed the number one spot in 45 of its 63 markets,Screen Daily reported,external. That tally was higher than the $44.6m for The Martian, starring Matt Damon, on its opening weekend in 2015. The movie was directed by Ridley Scott, who also made the original Blade Runner and was an executive producer on 2049. The Chinese comedy Never Say Die took $66m globally to top the international box office, pushing Kingsman: The Golden Circle into second place. The remake of the Stephen King killer clown thriller It has now taken $305m in the US, and almost as much internationally, to top the $600m mark globally, making it the most successful horror film.

"McDonalds sent the out-of production sauce to the show's creators before announcing its return A McDonald's PR stunt to bring back a rare dipping sauce left thousands of fans disappointed, with police called to some US restaurants on Saturday. The Szechuan sauce, which was only made in 1998 to promote the film Mulan, has become well known after featuring in the popular cartoon Rick and Morty. In July the chain sent a large bottle of the sauce to the show's creators. They then announced it would come back for one day on 7 October, but fans were left disappointed after stores ran out. In one video, police can be seen holding back people chanting ""we want sauce"". Officers also attended other stores because hundreds of people turned up. Allow Twitter content?

"There is continuing speculation that Theresa May is coming under pressure to carry out a cabinet reshuffle - and move Boris Johnson to another job. Butthe Daily Telegraph says,externalallies of the foreign secretary have warned that he will ""just say no"" if the prime minister tries to sack him. According to the paper, sources say that firing him would undermine Brexit and destabilise the government. Instead, the paper says the prime minister is being urged by members of her cabinet to remove Chancellor Philip Hammond for ""making Brexit hard"" and being ""miserable"". The Times reports,externalone ex-senior minister saying Mr Johnson is not the problem and it is Mr Hammond who has been stirring Tory divisions on Brexit. The former minister claims the chancellor is trying to force Mrs May into an ""endless no-change transition deal"". The Guardian says,externalBrexit-supporting politicians have told the paper that concerns about the chancellor are being widely discussed on the Tory backbenches. But, it says, a cabinet ally of Mr Hammond has warned that ""realism is no sin when it comes to Brexit"". The Daily Mail and the Sun are aghast at news that the Office for National Statistics is considering making it optional for people to declare their sex in the next census. The move is aimed at recognising transgender people. The Sun rejects,externalthe idea as crazy - pointing out that the information is needed to determine how many men and women make up the population. Inthe Mail's view,external, if we don't even know such a fundamental fact, the whole purpose of the census is undermined. The old pound coin ceases to be legal tender next Sunday - butthe Daily Telegraph reports,externalthat thousands of shops and businesses will ignore the deadline. It says a trade association representing 170,000 small shops has advised its members to continue taking the round coins if customers don't have any other change. The Mail reports,externalthat the old coins are already being rejected by some supermarket self-service checkouts. For its lead,the Daily Mirror says,externalthe vast majority of households in England no longer have weekly bin collections. The paper reports that 76% of council areas have a 14-day wait - and six local authorities have even reduced collections to one in every three weeks. According to the paper, young families are having to resort to paying for private collections. Finally, the dining room is doomed - according to Mary Berry.

""We have given up our dining room finally,"" she said.

"Airbnb, the accommodation website, paid less than Â£200,000 in UK corporation tax last year despite collecting Â£657m of rental payments for property owners. The commissions the company earns in the UK are booked by its Irish subsidiary, but it also has two UK subsidiaries. One unit made a pre-tax profit, but the other did not incur UK corporation tax because deductions resulted in a loss. Airbnb said in a statement: ""We follow the rules and pay all the tax we owe."" One of the British subsidiaries, Airbnb Payments UK, handles payments between landlords and travellers for countries other than the United States, China and India. That unit made a pre-tax profit of Â£960,000 and paid Â£188,000 in UK corporation tax - Â£8,000 less than in 2015. The other British subsidiary, Airbnb UK, markets the website and app to British consumers. It reported a Â£463,000 pre-tax profit last year but because it gave shares to staff, which are tax-deductable, there was no corporation tax bill. Airbnb said: ""Our UK office provides marketing services and pays all applicable taxes, including VAT. The Airbnb model is unique and boosted the UK economy by Â£3.46bn last year alone."" The tax arrangements of other technology giants have come underunder closer scrutinyin recent years. One of the most vocal critics has been EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. She has taken aim at the likes of Apple, Amazon and others for where they book the revenues and profits of their European activities. Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, has also asked why Airbnb paid tens of thousand of euros in French corporation tax despite a turnover in the millions. The company, founded in San Francisco in 2008, has disrupted the hotel industry by linking travellers with landlords who generally want to rent out a spare room or an entire property for short-term stays. It has become one of the most successful examples of the digital economy, with an estimated value of about $24bn. However, Airbnb has faced a growing backlash in cities includingBarcelona, Berlin and Paris, where politicians have taken steps to stop landlords renting properties to tourists rather than local residents. While Airbnb has long been linked with a stock market listing, it remains privately owned. It takes a 3% commission from landlords for each booking, and also charges fees to travellers. In the UK last year Airbnb catered for 5.9m travellers and had 168,000 listings.

"This video can not be played Edward Cairney and Avril Jones spoke to the BBC in 2017 about Margaret Flemingâs disappearance The couple who cared for missing woman Margaret Fleming have spoken for the first time since her disappearance was reported almost a year ago. Police said Margaret, who has learning difficulties, had not been seen by anyone except her carers - Eddie Cairney and Avril Jones - since 1999. The couple told BBC Scotland Margaret had fled when police arrived because she had a ""persecution complex"". They said she had come to ""no harm"" and had spoken to her recently. A police spokeswoman confirmed that they knew of no independent sighting of Margaret since 17 December 1999 at a family gathering. But Mr Cairney, 75, said that over the past year she had been in London and Poland and was now working as a gangmaster. He said that despite her learning difficulties Margaret was recruiting cheap agricultural labour in the south of England. Margaret became a missing person in October last year after police visited the five-bedroom cottage on the Clyde coast at Inverkip, Inverclyde, in connection with inquiries from a benefits agency. Mr Cairney said Margaret had slipped ""out of the door"" when the police called because she was scared of authority. Asked if he had seen her since, Mr Cairney said: ""Yes, she has been here once. Not here, not to the house, but we have seen her once."" He said this was within a month of her being reported missing. Margaret Fleming was reported missing in October 2016 38343790 ""When we saw her she was just the way she left, contrary to earlier days, she was clean and behaved, she had stopped this shouting and bawling at you."" He said he had spoken to Margaret on the phone since then. He told the BBC: ""She has come to no harm unless she has got harmed in the past couple of weeks."" Margaret had first gone to live with the couple at their secluded home, looking out over the Clyde estuary, in the late 1990s after her father died and her relationship with her mother broke down. Mr Cairney said he had known her father, who he described as a ""crooked lawyer"", and had known Margaret since she was a child. The police said that Margaret, who will now be 36, has not been seen by anyone but the two carers since 1999, when she was 19. Before that she had attended a local college but had since never had a job and had no presence in the online world. They have not managed to trace any friends from the past 18 years. It is understood Margaret Fleming had lived in the Inverkip house since 1999 Police began a search of the house in November last year which they then extended into the garden, where excavation work was carried out on half an acre of land. By April this year, the search had concluded. Officers said Margaret ""could have had an accident, possibly wanted to be missing or even something more sinister"". The original police contact was sparked by a call from a benefits agency. It appears that Margaret's Disability Living Allowance (DLA) was being replaced by a Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and she was required to attend an assessment. Mr Cairney told the BBC that Margaret had a ""persecution complex"" and was afraid of authority. He said she ran off when the police arrived at the house. Mr Cairney said: ""I turned around to get Margaret and she was gone, out of the door. ""There was police at the back, police at the front, she could not get out of that door without being seen. ""I don't know which way she went. She must have just walked right through them."" The back garden of the house Margaret Fleming shared with her carers was dug up Mr Cairney described Margaret as a ""happy person but she had fits of being very morose"". He said: ""She was short, fat, dirty, she would not clean herself."" When asked if he had heard from her since she went missing, he said: ""Yes I have. ""I've heard her on the phone but the police took the phones away so she wouldn't know how to contact us. ""The first time that I knew where she was she was in London. ""I told the police that. I told the police where she could be found in the next six hours and they didn't do anything about it."" He said over the year since Margaret was reported missing she had been in Poland and London. ""I have got no idea how many other places. She has been doing a gangmaster, do you know what that is? ""In spite of her difficulties she has become a person who recruits and hires out agricultural workers."" Asked to confirm if he meant that she worked for a gangmaster, Mr Cairney replied: ""No, she has become a gangmaster. She is hiring people."" Eddie Cairney in the house the couple shared with Margaret When asked if Margaret had told him what she was doing, Mr Cairney said: ""We knew from people in the area that she was around because obviously she did not disappear and we would not try to get her."" The couple said that the police did not believe their story. ""They didn't believe us or they wanted to disbelieve us,"" Mr Cairney said. A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: ""This case remains a missing person inquiry, and at this time we continue to appeal to people with any information on Margaret's whereabouts, or anyone who knows her - who has not yet spoken to police - to come forward to police. ""Officers were asked to attend Margaret's home on behalf of a partner agency. Officers attended the house on Friday 28 October 2016, and it is then that she was reported missing."" She said the search of the house and garden failed to find any trace of her. The spokeswoman confirmed that the last independent sighting of Margaret was on 17 December 1999 at a family gathering. ""This, along with facts such as her having no trace of any job, few friends that are contactable, and no evidence of her contact with partner agencies and local services has led us to become very concerned for her whereabouts and wellbeing,"" she said. ""The case has been widely reported in the media and although we have carried out extensive inquiries during this almost year-long investigation, we have no information on anyone who has seen Margaret after 17 December 1999."" October 1995 -It is believed Ms Fleming lived with her father in Port Glasgow before he died. 1997 -She then lived with her grandparents and mother but moved in with the carers in 1997. She is thought to have been estranged from her mother since then. 17 December 1999 -Family party.

They appealed for people who knew her when she was at James Watt College in Greenock 20 years ago to contact them. Police launch a large-scale search with police divers deployed and officers are spotted combing a large area of ground near the electricity sub-station in the hillside above the A78. Police say they have limited information and are unable to issue a recent photograph. Local residents say they have never seen Margaret. 26 November- Despite numerous appeals and searches by specialist police teams, including the mounted unit, divers and dog branch, there has been no trace of Margaret. Ch Insp Elliot Brown said: ""This has been one of the most challenging missing person inquiries of my career because of Margaret's secluded lifestyle."" 30 November-Police search the home of the carers 12 December-Search moves from the house to the garden.Police say that, apart from her carers, the last independent sighting of Margaret was on 17 December 1999, at a family gathering. Officers say they have no trace of her having a job, no friends have come forward and she had had no contact with any agencies. Det Ch Insp Paul Livingstone said: ""Margaret's carers have said that they believe she has a private side to her life and that she may have friends that they are not aware of."" 13 December- Police start to dig up garden. 16 December-Drone footage shows garden being dug up 17 December-Police make fresh appeal exactly 17 years after Margaret was last seen. 21 December-Drones banned from flying over the site 28 April 2017- Police say search of house, garden and surrounding area is complete but investigations are ongoing 10 August 2017-A demolition order is served on the house.Inverclyde Council said the property was in a ""serious state of disrepair"" and was ""unfit for human habitation"".

"Kim Yo-jong (circled) has often appeared alongside her brother North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un has given his sister more power by promoting her to the nation's top decision-making body. Kim Yo-jong, the youngest daughter of late leader Kim Jong-il, will be replacing her aunt as a member of the Workers Party's Politburo. Ms Kim, 30, was referred to as a senior party official three years ago. The Kim family has ruled North Korea since the country was established following the Second World War in 1948. Ms Kim, who has frequently appeared alongside her brother in public and is thought to have been responsible for his public image, was already influential as vice-director of the propaganda and agitation department. She is blacklisted by the US over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea. Her promotion was announced by Mr Kim at a party meeting on Saturday as part of a reshuffle involving dozens of other top officials. When Ms Kim was given a key post at the country's rare ruling party congress last year, it was widely expected that she would take up an important role in the country's core leadership. Who is Kim Yo-jong? Among other announcements made on Saturday was the decision to promote Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho - who last month referred to US President Donald Trump as ""President Evil"" at a UN meeting - to a full vote-carrying member of the Politburo. Mr Ri has recently accused Mr Trump of declaring war on North Korea and said that if the president continues with his ""dangerous"" rhetoric the US will become an""inevitable"" target for missile strikes. The promotions come as a defiant Mr Kim once again made it clear that North Korea's nuclear weapons programme would continue despite sanctions and threats.

"This video can not be played Video shows the spot where the cocaine was hidden on board the boat Nearly four tonnes of cocaine worth an estimated $260m (Â£200m) have been seized by international law enforcement officers in the Atlantic. The drugs were found on a boat between Portugal's Madeira and Azores islands. Officials found 165 individual packages of cocaine weighing 23kg - a total of 3.7 tonnes - concealed beneath the vessel's cooking area. It is not clear where the drugs were being taken to. The Comoros-flagged vessel was towed into the Spanish port of CÃ¡diz on Friday after Spanish officials received intelligence from the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA). The crew, from Turkey and Azerbaijan, were arrested. The cocaine was hidden beneath the vessel's galley Spanish officers made the seizure after a tip-off from the UK The operation was jointly conducted by Spanish customs and police and the NCA under the overall co-ordination of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre-Narcotics (MAOC-N) in Lisbon. ""Seizing this quantity of cocaine represents a major disruption to international crime groups, depriving them of revenue potentially running into the hundreds of millions of pounds,"" NCA spokesman Mark Blackwell said. Two men found guilty of smuggling Â£512m of cocaine There have been two other big Atlantic drug busts in recent months. Thirteen Spanish citizens of Moroccan origin were arrested on Monday over what is believed to be a record seizure of cocaine in the North African country, officials there said.

"This video can not be played Peruvian Nobel laureate calls for 'unity' in Spain At least 350,000 people gathered in Barcelona, capital of Catalonia, for a rally against independence from Spain. They waved Spanish and Catalan flags and carried banners saying ""Together we are stronger"" and ""Catalonia is Spain"". It was the largest such rally in Catalonia amid the furore over last week's disputed independence referendum. Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy has warned he would not rule out anything ""within the law"" to halt Catalan secession. Similar rallies were held across Spain on Saturday. The final results from the referendum in the wealthy north-eastern region suggested 90% of the 2.3 million people who voted backed independence. Turnout was 43%. The pro-unity rally comes days before Catalan leaders could declare independence from Spain There have been several claims of irregularities, and many ballot boxes were seized by Spanish police. Nearly 900 people were injured as the police, trying to enforce a Spanish court ban on the vote, attempted to disperse voters. Thirty-three police officers were also hurt. Catalan Spaniards fear loss of identity Distressed police officer photo goes viral Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Police in Barcelona said 350,000 people turned out for Sunday's rally; organisers put the figure at 950,000. Among them were former government minister Josep Borrell, who said his fellow Catalans needed to recover their level-headedness, and nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa. ""You need more than a coup plot to destroy what has been built over 500 years of history,"" Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian-Spanish novelist, told the crowds. One of those attending the rally was 72-year-old Araceli Ponze. She told Reuters: ""We feel both Catalan and Spanish. ""We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want."" Similar unity rallies were held across Spain on Saturday This video can not be played Voters in Catalonia explain why their reasons for backing or rejecting independence Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the regional parliament on Tuesday at 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT). Spain's Constitutional Court suspended a Catalan parliament session that had been planned for Monday. There had been speculation that independence would be declared unilaterally at the parliament's next sitting, but an MP from Mr Puigdemont's party said the current plan was to stop short of this. Marta Pascal told the BBC that the leader would make a ""symbolic statement"". He would recognise the referendum and say that a large percentage of Catalans wanted independence, before talking about setting off along a path leading to independence, Ms Pascal added. In an interview with El PaÃ­s newspaper on Saturday, Spain's prime minister retained the tough line he and his government have taken over the referendum. ""The government will ensure that any declaration of independence will lead to nothing,"" Mariano Rajoysaid,external. He also said he planned to keep extra police, deployed to Catalonia before the referendum, in the region until the crisis is over. And he rejected calls for early national elections. Asked whether he was prepared to invoke Article 155 of Spain's constitution, which allows the national parliament to intervene in the running of an autonomous region, Mr Rajoy said: ""I don't rule out absolutely anything that is within the law."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister who lost a referendum on independence from the UK in 2014, said on Sunday that the only way to resolve the crisis was with ""both sides coming together to try to find a way forward... that respects the rule of law, democracy and the right to choose"". Spain eases firms' exit from Catalonia Mariano Rajoy - the prime minister who lost Catalonia? On Saturday, thousands of people calling for Spanish unity attended rallies in the capital Madrid. Other demonstrations - including in Barcelona - were also held urging political dialogue.

"Mr Corker announced his retirement last week US President Donald Trump has had an ill-tempered exchange with a leading Republican senator, aggravating already poor relations between the two men. Foreign Relations Committee head Bob Corker was a ""negative voice"" and ""largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal"", Mr Trump tweeted. Mr Corker hit back that the White House had become an ""adult day care centre"". He was considered for the job of secretary of state by Mr Trump last year but they have since clashed. Analysts suggest Mr Trump's tirade on Sunday morning may have been prompted by Mr Corker's message of support last week for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, which was also seen as a jab at the president. He was quoted by media as saying that Mr Tillerson was ""in an incredibly frustrating place"" where he ""ends up not being supported in the way that I hope a secretary of state would be supported"". On Wednesday Mr Tillersondenied rumoursthat he was about to resign. Last month Mr Corker announced that he would not seek re-election at next year's mid-term elections. He has been an ardent supporter of the 2015 agreement to curb Iran's development of nuclear weapons. Mr Trump has sharply criticised the deal on many occasions andis expected to de-certify itnext week. Mr Trump said he refused to endorse Mr Corker for re-election In a series oftweets,external, Mr Trump said: ""Senator Bob Corker 'begged' me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said 'NO' and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement). ""He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said 'NO THANKS.' He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal! ""Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!"" Mr Corkerresponded,external: ""It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. ""Someone obviously missed their shift this morning."" The two men previously clashed in August when the senator criticised Mr Trump's response to the clashes between white supremacists and anti-fascist demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia.

"I have done something so stupid I still can't believe it. Maybe I had fallen under the influence of the 10-headed demon Ravana. The vanquishing of Ravana by Lord Rama is the excuse for Dussehra, one of the wildest of all Hindu festivals. Towering wicker effigies of Ravana and his henchmen - complete with curling moustaches and wicked smiles - are filled with fireworks, ready to be burned in the climax of a re-enactment of Lord Rama's great victory. Last year my wife and I took our four children to the biggest Dussehra celebration in Delhi, at the Ramlila Maidan, a vast field outside the gates of the old city. As the sunlight turned a delicious gold, we joined the jostling queues. But Ravana's malign influence isn't enough to explain what follows. I blame the fairground, too. There's an Indian concept calledjugaad. It means a simple, cheap solution to a complex problem. Basically - it means bodging it. The rides appliedjugaadwith breathtaking abandon. It was as my 14 and 15-year-old daughters and I tottered, giggling nervously, from a terrifying, harness-free spin on a juddering big wheel that I noticed the sheet laid out on the dry mud. Crouched on it was a man offering temporary tattoos. Now, I have always hated tattoos. I live in fear of my children getting some ugly doodle etched into their perfect skin. That's why I thought it would be so funny to surprise my wife, Bee, with a fake one. ""How about a heart with her name in it for her birthday?"" I said. I promise I hadn't had anything to drink. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST ""They wash off, yes?"" I asked the tattoo man. ""Yes, yes, yes,"" he said. ""Temporary, yes?"" ""Yes, yes, yes."" ""Not real tattoos?"" ""Yes, yes, yes."" I felt the chrome nozzle of his little machine.  I couldn't feel a needle. He showed me a pot of ink. Well, you'd need ink for a temporary tattoo, wouldn't you? I pointed to a heart on one of the laminated sheets with pictures of his craft, and then at the letters B, E, E. ""Yes, yes, yes,"" he said and took my arm firmly. Before I knew it, he was already at work, and here's the thing: it didn't hurt. Everyone I know who has ever had a tattoo says it hurt. All I felt was a prickle. That said, it did worry me, but by then the tattoo man had already inked out a rough heart - and I do mean rough - in the middle of my upper arm. It must have taken all of 30 seconds. He started on the letters. First an L. Hold on a secondâ¦ Then a smaller heart - an O. Now I was really worried.  I tried to pull my arm away. ""No, no, no,"" said the tattoo man, pulling back. With a sharp tug I got my arm free and wiped in desperation at the ink. But beneath my fingers I could feel my skin was slightly raised. The blue-black ink didn't even smudge. ""What have you done?"" my wife wanted to know when we found her in the crowd and showed her my arm. My daughters were doubled up with glee. Who wouldn't laugh when your dad has just got himself a tattoo by mistake? Justin Rowlatt and his wife Bee The first fireworks exploded in the sky. Ravana was about to be put to the torch. I was already rushing for the exit. ""There must be a way to get rid of this thing,"" I told myself. There wasn't. And here's some advice you probably don't need - never follow home tattoo removal instructions from the internet. Flushing it with gin - the only alcohol to hand - didn't make any difference. Salification - literally rubbing salt in the wound - didn't work either. Nothing worked. I now have a white scar as well as a cheap tattoo. My wife was more worried about the risk of blood-borne infection, which is how I came to be sitting in front of a doctor in one of Delhi's hospitals. So how risky is a street tattoo like this, I wanted to know? ""Oh, infection is very, very, very common,"" he told me with a huge smile. He said as well as hepatitis B and C, there was also the risk of HIV. ""Really?"" I asked. ""Oh, this is a very, very, very common way to get HIV. I see it all the time.  All the time,"" he said, apparently delighted. Two weeks later, the results of the blood test came through. It was clear. I have booked another test to make sure that is still the case. The tattoo, however, isn't going anywhere. Ugly as it is, I'm keeping it - a permanent reminder to be less impetuous.

"An image of Pakistani actress Mahira Khan and her co-star Ranbir Kapoor smoking went viral, with many taking aim at Khan Can men get away with things that women can't? Three stories have become talking points on Pakistani social media channels - sparking questions about double standards and the treatment of men and women online. In a matter of weeks, images and videos of a Pakistani actress, a Muslim preacher, and a young girl have all shed light on what some have called hypocrisy in Pakistani culture and conservative religious beliefs. Towards the end of September, images of well-known Pakistani actress Mahira Khan were published on a celebrity gossip site. The photos, purportedly from July of this year, showed Mahira Khan smoking outside in a backless dress with an Indian male co-star, Ranbir Kapoor. Shortly after, the images began circulating on social media, and many people took aim at the actress. ""On social media things went out of control. People were lashing at Mahira Khan about her dress, her smoking, and then a lot of people were angry because she was with an Indian star,"" says Tahir Imran, BBC Urdu's social media editor. Within hours, many on the internet had turned on Khan, with some accusing her of insulting Pakistan. But amidst the criticism, there was a chorus of people speaking out in her defence. Listen to BBC Trending radio on the BBC World Service One was the Indian actor, Ranbir Kapoor, who appeared alongside her in the viral images. In astatement,externalhe wrote: ""It is very unfair the way she is being judged and spoken about. What is also sad is the inequality in judgement just because she is a woman."" Another voice who came out in defence of Mahira Khan is prominent Pakistani journalist, Asma Shirazi. Shirazi told BBC Trending that after tweeting her defence of Ms Khan, she herself faced criticism online. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""When I heard the story and saw it on the top trend I tweeted out in favour of her and pointed out that this is hypocrisy. If some woman is smoking then that is objectionable. If some man is smoking that is not objectionable,"" Shirazi says. ""This is hypocrisy,"" says Pakistani journalist Asma Shirazi about the criticism Mahira Khan faced online She adds: ""This is a double standard. They go to cinemas, they watch her movies, they admire her and love to see her naked in movies but can't stand to see a photo of her with a naked back and smoking with an Indian actor."" India and Pakistan: we are like a divorced couple How drinking tea became an act of female rebellion 100 Women 2016: The Pakistani woman defying her family Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Shortly after the images of Mahira Khan began circulating, another story developed - this time involving a well-known Muslim preacher. Nouman Ali Khan is based in Texas, and his online videos and institution, Bayyinah, have millions of followers in Pakistan and elsewhere. Known for his conservative viewpoints, Khan disapproves of men and women holding hands in public, has reservations against movies with adult themes, and encourages his followers to marry young. His reputation came into question after aFacebook post,externalby Chicago-based Muslim chaplain Omer Mozzafar said Khan ""confessed inappropriate interactions with various women,"" lied about them, and threatened lawsuits to stop them from exposing him. According to Navaid Aziz,external, a fellow Islamic scholar, these allegations have nothing to do with rape or sexual assault but are ""related to an abuse of power and authority."" Within hours, images began circulating online of a topless Nouman Ali Khan, along with allegations that he sent the picture to an unknown female. In a Facebook post, Nouman Ali Khan noted that he's been divorced for two years, that the pictures were sent to women who he says he was considering for marriage, and that he is ""imperfect"". Through a lawyer, he declined to comment further to Trending. Nouman Ali Khan, a popular Muslim preacher, was accused of sending topless pictures to an unnamed woman Unlike the vitriol aimed at Mahira Khan, online many of Khan's supporters leapt to his defence and, in some cases, hounded those who publicly criticised him. Laila Alawa, a US-based media entrepreneur, spoke out about Khan's actions, and she says was harassed online because of it - most notably by Khan's female supporters. ""Individuals on the side of Khan began attacking me and finding my personal social media platforms and just going at it,"" Alawa says. ""Seeing that rabid response from his supporters was strange and the fact that a lot of the folks attacking me personally, the most vitriolic of them all were women who believed in him."" According to the BBC's Tahir Imran, the contrast in reactions towards Nouman Ali Khan and Mahira Khan not only points towards a sexist double standard, but also a professional one. ""If he were a film star or a TV actor, things would have been different. But he's a preacher so there is this perception that he's a pious man, so a lot of people were saying these screenshots were Photoshopped."" The third story to emerge in close succession has a more sinister undercurrent. A video, which according to Tahir Imran has been shared widely in Pakistan on Facebook and Twitter, shows a young girl allegedly being inappropriately touched by an older man while in a shop. BBC Trending have not seen the video as it's no longer available in the original tweet it was shared from, and we have not been able to identify the origin of the clip or the man who appears in it. BBC Urdu says that there has been no further information regarding arrests or investigations related to the video. But some of the comments made on the video passed judgement not on the man allegedly inappropriately touching the girl, but on the girl herself. ""A lot of people were saying 'oh, she's not wearing full sleeves, she's not dressed modestly',"" says Tahir Imran. ""If you look at the initial reaction that is still there and if we talk very broadly about it, up to 50 or 70 percent of people were objecting to the girl and how she was dressing, rather than saying the contact was inappropriate,"" he says. At the same time, ""there was a huge backlash to that."" One voice that was part of the backlash is Pakistani journalist Shaista Aziz. In apost published online,externaland widely shared on social media, Aziz took aim at people blaming the young girl in the video. ""In Pakistan, girls and women must be held responsible for attracting the lustful attention of men, all men, regardless of how old the little girls are,"" she wrote. So what, if anything, can be drawn from these three stories? On the one hand there is a society's attempts to police women and even young girls, and hold them to a standard that's not applied to men, says Tahir Imran.

"The crash happened on Exhibition Road, in London's South Kensington A man arrested following a crash outside London's Natural History Museum has been released under investigation, police said. The 47-year-old had been questioned on suspicion of dangerous driving. Eleven people suffered non-life threatening injuries in the incident, involving a Black Toyota Prius, in South Kensington on Saturday. The Metropolitan Policesaid it was not ""terrorist-related""and is appealing for witnesses. London Ambulance Service said the people it treated - including the suspected driver - had mostly sustained head and leg injuries. Nine were taken to hospital. The Met said none of the injuries was believed to be life changing and the majority of those hurt had been discharged by Saturday night. This video can not be played Video shows a man being pinned to the ground near the Natural History Museum Saturday's incident at about 14:20 BST on Exhibition Road initially sparked panic in an area popular with families and tourists.

"Jamie Harron has been prevented from leaving the country and has had his passport confiscated A Scot, who is facing a three-year jail term in Dubai for putting his hand on a man in a bar, has appeared in court. Jamie Harron, from Stirling, was summoned to a hearing on Sunday after he reportedly failed to attend a previous court date in the city. The 27-year-old was arrested for public indecencyfollowing an incident at the Rock Bottom Bar in Dubai on 15 July. Despite fears he would be rearrested, Mr Harron was freed but told to remain in the city for future court dates. The electrician, who had been working in Afghanistan, was on a two-day stopover in the United Arab Emirates when the incident happened. He claims he was trying to avoid spilling his drink in the crowded club and was holding his hand out in front of him when he inadvertently ""touched a man on his hip to avoid impact"". He was reportedly locked up for five days in Al Barsha prison, before being released on bail and having his passport confiscated. Jamie Harron was at the Rock Bottom Bar when the incident reportedly happened A spokeswoman for the charity, Detained in Dubai, which is representing Mr Harron, told the BBC she had expected him to be rearrested at court on Sunday for his previous non-appearance. She expressed relief that he had been freed. However, said he still faced future court appearances for the original charges relating to public indecency and consumption of alcohol. Radha Stirling, chief executive of Detained in Dubai, said: ""Jamie is relieved he wasn't arrested at the latest hearing. It was expected that he would have to spend some time in prison."" Ms Stirling said a further court date was expected in about two weeks, although no firm date had yet been set. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was providing consular assistance on the matter. The arrest follows the case of an Edinburgh man who was also detained in Dubai after attempting to exchange a fake Â£20.

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: Planning for Brexit no deal 'goes on' Contingency plans in case the UK has to leave the EU with no deal in place are ""well under way"", a minister has said. Dominic Raab said while the UK had to ""strive for the very best outcome"" from Brexit negotiations, it had to ""prepare for all eventualities"". The Sunday Telegraph claimed there were plans to ""unlock"" billions of pounds in the new year to prepare for a ""no deal"" Brexit, if talks make no progress. Six months of Brexit negotiations have not led to a significant breakthrough. Last month Prime Minister Theresa May used a speech in Florence to set out proposals for a two-year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, in a bid to ease the deadlock. Talks had stalled over key issues including EU citizens' rights, a financial settlement and on the Northern Ireland border. UK must be prepared for no deal Brexit - UKIP leader Plan for a very hard Brexit, German firms told Will the government accept no deal? UK Brexit Secretary David Davis has since said ""decisive steps forward"" have been made - although EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said there are still ""big gaps"" between the two sides on some issues. The Sunday Telegraph reported that, if no further progress is made, Mrs May has decided to commit billions in the new year to spend on things like new technology to speed up customs checks, in case there is no trade deal and the UK has to revert to World Trade Organisation tariffs with the EU. Appearing on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Justice Minister Mr Raab was asked why there was no visible sign of preparations for no deal - such as the recruitment of more customs officers and more infrastructure at ports. He said: ""This planning goes on, it's right that it does because of the prime minister's clear point of view that we need to search and hope for the best, strive for the very best outcome from these negotiations, but prepare for all eventualities. ""What we don't do is run around advertising it demonstrably. Why? Because we want to send the right, positive tone to our EU partners. ""So we don't go talking about what happens if we end up with no deal, but quietly, assiduously, those preparations will be in place."" He added that the government wanted to see ""the best deal I think in terms of trade, security, co-operation"" but added: ""Those contingency plans are well under way."" Labour's Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry told the programme that after Brexit, Britain ""should stay as close as we can"" to the EU because it is ""good for our economy"". ""We need to leave the European Union but it is good for our economy - they're our biggest market - that we stay as close as we can. ""And the problem that the British country has is that a good half of the Tory party wants to go sailing off into the mid-Atlantic with no deal at all and that would be disastrous for our country."" EU leaders are due to decide at October's meeting of the European Council whether enough progress has been made on key issues to move on to the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU. Meanwhile two Conservative MEPs who voted to block moves towards trade talks between the UK and European Union have had the party whip removed. South West MEP Julie Girling and South East MEP Richard Ashworth were suspended from the Conservative Party after supporting a resolution in Strasbourg declaring that ""sufficient progress"" had not been made in talks to move on to discussions about the future relationship. The non-binding vote was passed by 557 votes to 92, with 29 abstentions In a letter, European Parliament Chief Whip Dan Dalton said: ""Given the seriousness of this issue, and your failure to discuss your intention to vote against the agreed position of the Conservative delegation in advance, I am therefore writing to inform you that I am suspending the Conservative whip from you until further notice."" Julie Girlingtold her local newspaper,externalshe had not voted to block trade talks but to ""focus the minds of negotiators"" and ""drive more effective negotiations"". Mr Ashworthreportedly said,externalhe was confused by the suspension: ""The vote was not about disrupting Brexit and the negotiations. We were asked a technical question about how much progress had been made and the answer for me was not enough."" The fourth round of Brexit negotiations began on 25 September, with the UK due to leave the EU in March 2019.

"This video can not be played Scotland First Minister on Catalonia: ""How can Catalans legally express their view? Nicola Sturgeon says her government will pay a so-called ""settled status"" fee of any EU citizen working in the public sector in Scotland. Prime Minister Theresa May has offered settled status to EU migrantswho have lived in the UK for five years. However, the UK government has hinted that those applying for the status will have to pay a fee. Scotland's first minister made the announcement ahead of her party's annual conference in Glasgow. The three-day conference is the party's 83rd and the first since June's general election, when the SNP lost 21 of the 56 seats it won in 2015. They included those of former leader Alex Salmond and its deputy leader Angus Robertson. What to look out for at the SNP conference Speaking on the BBC'sAndrew Marr programme, Ms Sturgeon said EU migrants had made a big contribution and their right to remain in Scotland should be guaranteed. She said: ""It appears that the UK government is going to make EU citizens apply for what they're calling settled status and possibly charge a fee for that. ""They haven't said what that fee would be, but if it's the same as it is for residents, it will be around Â£65. Nicola Sturgeon said it was time for dialogue to replace confrontation in Catalonia ""We will pay that for workers in the public sector. Why? Because it helps individuals, it helps us keep vital workers in the NHS and public services and it sends a message to EU nationals that we want them to stay here because we welcome them."" Ms Sturgeon also discussed the disputed referendum in Catalonia, but refused to say whether or not she would recognise an independentCatalonia, should its government declare independence. She told the programme: ""What I think has to be recognised is the strength of feeling in Catalonia. ""I think it's now time for dialogue to replace confrontation."" She added: ""You cannot simply say the right of a people to choose their future is illegal in all circumstances."" When pressed on whether she would back the Catalan leaders, she responded: ""We'd recognise the decisions and the statements that were made, but I'm not going to speculate here on what will happen in Catalonia before it happens. ""I'm not in control of that. It's not for me to decide what is the right future for Catalonia."" She added: ""My view is that is shouldn't be resolved by both sides going further to extreme positions. ""It should be resolved by both sides coming together to try to find a way forward in this that respects all of these principles - the rule of law, democracy and the right to choose."" Ms Sturgeon will address her party's conference on Tuesday afternoon. Her deputy and Education Secretary John Swinney opened the three-day event at the SECC byannouncing a new system of bursariesto tempt professionals from science, technology and maths subjects into teaching. He told delegates that with ""chaos on the left and chaos on the right, through it all the SNP government stands firm"" as ""a beacon of progressive, effective government, delivering for all of the people of Scotland"". By BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor There has long been a dilemma confronting the SNP when preparing for a party conference.  Do they yell Freedom and energise the faithful?  Or do they ca' canny with the aim of attracting the unpersuaded? In practice, of course, they customarily offer a bit of both.  The issue, then, is emphasis, prioritisation.  Thus far, the Glasgow conference defaults rather towards caution. I think we may reasonably pay little heed to those who point out that there is no formal debate at the conference on independence. It is not the case - not remotely the case - that the issue of Scotland's constitutional future is being ignored.  Indeed, in his opening keynote speech, John Swinney drew huge applause and cheers when he urged delegates to ""rededicate ourselves to independence."" It is rather a question of tactics. There is more of an emphasis upon what we might call, for short, the day job. Read more from Brian here.

"This video can not be played Catfish in the streets as Nate floods US cities Storm Nate has weakened to a tropical depression after bringing strong winds, heavy rain and some flooding to the south-eastern United States. It made landfall as a hurricane twice, in Louisiana and Mississippi, and is currently over Alabama. Storm surge warnings have been lifted across the region. Nate killed at least 25 people in Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras. No deaths or injuries have yet been reported in the US. Although it was not as strong as last month's Maria and Irma, the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and parts of Florida had issued warnings and evacuation orders ahead of its arrival. Film footage from Biloxi, Mississippi, where the storm made landfall, showed flooded streets and highways. Storm surges displaced boats, vehicles and even this gazebo But the waters quickly receded, leaving boats and vehicles marooned. Mayor of nearby Gulfport, Billy Hewes, told the BBC the storm surge did not appear to be as high as feared and he thought the damage there would ""be minimal"". This video can not be played UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres: ""The origin is clear - we are facing the consequences of climate change"" Mississippi emergency official Greg Flynn told AP that more than 1,000 people in the state spent the night in shelters but no major damage had been reported. In southern Alabama, the local power company said some 5,000 people were without power. Residents there had been urged to take precautions ahead of Nate's arrival. A mandatory curfew was lifted in New Orleans, Louisiana, as the threat to the city - devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - was downgraded. Harvey v Katrina: Lessons learned? How to stay safe in a hurricane Do 'Pray for...' messages make disaster relief harder? Nate was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm by the National Hurricane Center at 09:00 GMT on Sunday, and later to a tropical depression. Warnings of storm surge flooding were lifted on Sunday afternoon. Some 300 guests were in the Golden Nugget Hotel in Biloxi when the storm came Five ports along the Gulf Coast were also closed to shipping as a precaution ahead of Nate's arrival. Most oil and gas platforms in the US Gulf of Mexico also evacuated their staff, but are now planning to reopen. US President Donald Trump on Saturday issued an emergency declaration for Louisiana and Mississippi, allowing the state to seek federal help with preparation and possible relief efforts. Nate caused heavy rains, landslides and floods which blocked roads, destroyed bridges and damaged houses as ittore through central America. At least 13 people died in Nicaragua, eight in Costa Rica, three in Honduras and one in El Salvador. The tail of the storm is still causing problems in the region, where thousands have been forced to sleep in shelters and some 400,000 people in Costa Rica were reported to be without running water. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, visiting Antigua and Barbuda which were badly damaged by Hurricane Irma in September, said the international community needed to do more to help Caribbean countries hit by a series of powerful hurricanes. ""There is an increasing intensity of hurricanes, an increasing frequency, and increasing devastation,"" he told the BBC. ""The origin is clear - we are facing the consequences of climate change.""

"This video can not be played Video shows the spot where the cocaine was hidden on board the boat Nearly four tonnes of cocaine worth an estimated $260m (Â£200m) have been seized by international law enforcement officers in the Atlantic. The drugs were found on a boat between Portugal's Madeira and Azores islands. Officials found 165 individual packages of cocaine weighing 23kg - a total of 3.7 tonnes - concealed beneath the vessel's cooking area. It is not clear where the drugs were being taken to. The Comoros-flagged vessel was towed into the Spanish port of CÃ¡diz on Friday after Spanish officials received intelligence from the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA). The crew, from Turkey and Azerbaijan, were arrested. The cocaine was hidden beneath the vessel's galley Spanish officers made the seizure after a tip-off from the UK The operation was jointly conducted by Spanish customs and police and the NCA under the overall co-ordination of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre-Narcotics (MAOC-N) in Lisbon. ""Seizing this quantity of cocaine represents a major disruption to international crime groups, depriving them of revenue potentially running into the hundreds of millions of pounds,"" NCA spokesman Mark Blackwell said. Two men found guilty of smuggling Â£512m of cocaine There have been two other big Atlantic drug busts in recent months. Thirteen Spanish citizens of Moroccan origin were arrested on Monday over what is believed to be a record seizure of cocaine in the North African country, officials there said. Officials say the bust will cause traffickers major disruption Police were reported to have seized more than 2.5 tonnes of the drug, with a street value of hundreds of millions of dollars. The cocaine was thought to have come from Venezuela on its way to Europe or the United Arab Emirates. Morocco's investigations chief Abdelhak Khiam said South American drug cartels were using smuggling routes through sub-Saharan countries where he said there was ""little control"".

"Theresa May has said she is ""pretty resilient"" and it is not her style to ""hide from a challenge"" despite a mishap-strewn party conference speech. The prime ministertold the Sunday Times:,external""I am a very determined person. I am not someone who gives up."" But Downing St says the newspaper's report that she is planning a cabinet reshuffle is ""speculation"". On Friday, former party chairman Grant Shapps claimed 30 Tory MPs backed his calls for a leadership contest. It followed a conference speech in which Mrs May apologised for calling a snap general election and losing the Tory majority, only to then be plagued by a persistent cough. She was also interrupted by a prankster giving her a fake P45 and letters falling off the Conservative message in the background. Johnson tells Tories to 'get behind' May Laura Kuenssberg: Doubts out in open Theresa May says cabinet 'fully behind' her After Mr Shapps was publicly named as the Tory gathering support for a leadership contest, Mrs May insisted she was providing ""calm leadership"" with the ""full support"" of the cabinet. She then told the Sunday Times the problems during her speech had been ""really frustrating"", but added: ""Let's keep this in proportion. I had to give a long speech with a bad cough, a somewhat shaky set and a so-called comedian intent on getting his 15 minutes of fame. ""Was it uncomfortable? Certainly. But let's not get carried away!"" She added: ""The truth is, my feelings can be hurt, like everyone else, but I am pretty resilient."" Asked what she would do about Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been seen by some as disloyal after writing two articles setting out his own vision for Brexit - she said she would not ""hide from a challenge"", and would ""make sure I always have the best people in my cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available in the party"". But she added: ""I have a terrific cabinet."" Writingin the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Johnson himself suggested only ""nutters"" in the party would want to oust Mrs May, while inthe Mail on Sunday,external, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major accused ""self absorbed"" critics of undermining her. Sir John said the country ""has had enough"" of the ""disloyal behaviour we have witnessed over recent weeks"". This video can not be played Ruth Davidson: I'm not looking past 2021 Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said any politician watching Mrs May's speech would have sympathised with her,  but if she wasn't a ""weak prime minister presiding over a deeply divided party"" it would not have been an issue. But the Conservative leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, told the BBC that while there had been some ""unfortunate shenanigans"" in the party, ""the pushback has been pretty strong"" against those trying to force a leadership contest. She criticised ""tittle-tattle"" by colleagues, adding that being a politician is ""about delivering for the country, it's not and should never be about private ambition"". Of Mr Johnson, whom some Conservative figures have suggested should be sacked, she said: ""He is a big intellect, a big figure in the party and if the prime minister believes he is the right person to be foreign secretary then she has my full support."" Mr Johnson had said he was ""fully behind""the PM's Florence speech last month- designed to break the deadlock in Brexit negotiations - and she should ""hold him to that"", Ms Davidson added. Of her own leadership ambitions, Ms Davidson said she was focussed on her job as Scottish Tory leader: ""I'm looking to 2021 [Holyrood elections] and I'm not looking past it because there is quite a lot in my in-tray right now."" The Conservative former deputy PM Lord Heseltine said he believed a reshuffle was now inevitable given the prime minister's ""unenviable"" position - but it would be dangerous to return Mr Johnson to the backbenches.

"This video can not be played The chief executive of failed airline Monarch tells Today projected losses were too great to stay operating More than 60% of holidaymakers left overseas when Monarch Airlines collapsed have now flown back to the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority says. The CAA stepped in after all of Monarch's flights and holidays were cancelled, leasing and chartering planes from 16 different countries. On Saturday, 51 flights carried more than 11,000 people back to UK airports, bringing the total to 67,522. The collapse of the 50-year old company is the largest ever for a UK airline. By Sunday morning, more than 350 flights chartered or leased by the CAA had brought Monarch customers back from their destination. It said the vast majority of the 110,000 passengers who were on holiday and booked to fly home with the airline when it went into administration will be back in the UK by next weekend. The CAA called the flight operation ""the biggest peacetime repatriation effort"", and still expects it to cost close to Â£60m. The bill will be met by the government and a trust run by the UK's holiday industry licensing body Atol, which collects a levy on all holiday packages sold in the UK. The CAA also suggested Monarch passengers with Air Travel Organiser's Licence (Atol) protection should have their refunds within 28 days of submitting a claim. The organisation is expecting Â£21m worth of payouts to rectify around 32,000 claims. KPMG. the administrators for the now-defunct airline, has estimated that just 10-15% of Monarch customers have bookings protected by Atol. The scheme only covers package holidays or Monarch flight-only bookings made before 15 December 2016. Those without Atol protection will be forced to seek refunds from their credit or debit card supplier or through travel insurance. What are your rights? The rise and fall of Monarch 'Shock and anger' among passengers Four reasons why Monarch failed CAA chair Dame Deirdre Hutton earliertold the BBCit could not act before Monarch's announcement, even though it was known the firm was in difficulty. ""The regulator really can't step in until a company goes into administration, that is completely a matter for the company directors,"" she said. ""It would be neither possible nor legal for us to give out confidential financial information while a company is still operating legally. ""Monarch didn't own the planes, the planes were leased, so as soon as the company went into administration, the owners of the planes took them back and that's why we've had to acquire planes from 16 different countries."" Customers currently overseas and due to fly home between now and 15 October will be brought back to the UK at no cost to them. There is no need to cut short a stay. Travellers should checkmonarch.caa.co.uk,externalfor confirmation of their new flight details - which will be available a minimum of 48 hours in advance of their original departure time.

Nate killed at least 25 people in Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras. No deaths or injuries have yet been reported in the US. Although it was not as strong as last month's Maria and Irma, the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and parts of Florida had issued warnings and evacuation orders ahead of its arrival. Film footage from Biloxi, Mississippi, where the storm made landfall, showed flooded streets and highways. Storm surges displaced boats, vehicles and even this gazebo But the waters quickly receded, leaving boats and vehicles marooned.

"The victim said some women told her they had had a similar experience A woman who was indecently assaulted while running says she has been overwhelmed by people saying they have had similar experiences. The 48-year-old victim was grabbed by a man while jogging in Sherwood Rise, Nottingham. Nottinghamshire Police are treating the incident as a misogynistic hate crime. The suspect is Asian, about 30, 6ft (1.8m) tall, with a bald patch. He was carrying a large backpack containing tennis racquets. The woman was running along Claremont Road, Sherwood, at about 18:30 BST on Tuesday when the man grabbed her. She said: ""I started to make quite a lot of noise and really yelled at him and then carried on running. ""One of the most shocking things was how unfazed he was."" She posted what had happened on Facebook and received many messages of support from women of all ages. ""I think it is really important women speak out when this happens,"" she said. The victim said being shouted and leered at was common, but this was the first time she had been physically assaulted.

"President Temer has had a lot in his in-tray recently Voters in the south of Brazil have been asked in an informal vote whether they want to be part of a new country. The referendum was organised a week after a similar vote in Catalonia by a secessionist movement called ""The South Is My Country"". The movement said it set up polls in more than 1,000 municipalities across the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and ParanÃ¡. The group's leader, Celso Deucher, says he hopes to gather three million votes. At polling stations in the ParanÃ¡ state city, Londrina, voters told local media they were disillusioned with the federal government and a giant corruption scandal that has seen dozens of politicians and members of the business elite jailed or indicted. Acacio Fernandes Tozzini told online newspaper, RedacaÃµ Bonde: ""Our nation has reached a dramatic level of political disorder that is impossible to mend. We want to get rid of Brasilia, Brazil has reached the apex of corruption."" Others complained that the south of Brazil saw little return from taxation which mostly benefitted the poorer northern regions of the country who have bigger voting rights than the south. Paulo Mauricio Acquarole said: ""If you look at the six or seven states above us (in the northeast), altogether they don't give what the three states of the south give in taxation.  Proportionally they have the same number of votes as Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and ParanÃ¡. ""If you hear the accent of the political legislature of Brazil it is a north-eastern one."" The south of Brazil has expressed secessionist tendencies before, ever since Italy's Giuseppe Garibaldi helped it achieve a short-lived semi-independence in 1836. Last year a similar vote in October 2016 organised by ""The South Is My Country"" gathered 617,500 votes.  Over 95% of the voters in the three states said they were in favour of separation. Few Brazilians believe the separatist movement will succeed, not least because it is forbidden by the constitution which proclaims that the country is ""formed by the indissoluble union of states"". But the poll is another indicator among Brazilian voters of anger towards the federal government which they say has failed to tackle a spike in violence across the country and has been unable to overturn the worse recession in more than a century. Analysts say the corruption scandal has also destroyed support for the political ruling class leaving next year's elections wide open.

"Theresa May has said she is ""pretty resilient"" and it is not her style to ""hide from a challenge"" despite a mishap-strewn party conference speech. The prime ministertold the Sunday Times:,external""I am a very determined person. I am not someone who gives up."" But Downing St says the newspaper's report that she is planning a cabinet reshuffle is ""speculation"". On Friday, former party chairman Grant Shapps claimed 30 Tory MPs backed his calls for a leadership contest. It followed a conference speech in which Mrs May apologised for calling a snap general election and losing the Tory majority, only to then be plagued by a persistent cough. She was also interrupted by a prankster giving her a fake P45 and letters falling off the Conservative message in the background. Johnson tells Tories to 'get behind' May Laura Kuenssberg: Doubts out in open Theresa May says cabinet 'fully behind' her After Mr Shapps was publicly named as the Tory gathering support for a leadership contest, Mrs May insisted she was providing ""calm leadership"" with the ""full support"" of the cabinet. She then told the Sunday Times the problems during her speech had been ""really frustrating"", but added: ""Let's keep this in proportion. I had to give a long speech with a bad cough, a somewhat shaky set and a so-called comedian intent on getting his 15 minutes of fame. ""Was it uncomfortable? Certainly. But let's not get carried away!"" She added: ""The truth is, my feelings can be hurt, like everyone else, but I am pretty resilient."" Asked what she would do about Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been seen by some as disloyal after writing two articles setting out his own vision for Brexit - she said she would not ""hide from a challenge"", and would ""make sure I always have the best people in my cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available in the party"". But she added: ""I have a terrific cabinet."" Writingin the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Johnson himself suggested only ""nutters"" in the party would want to oust Mrs May, while inthe Mail on Sunday,external, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major accused ""self absorbed"" critics of undermining her. Sir John said the country ""has had enough"" of the ""disloyal behaviour we have witnessed over recent weeks"". This video can not be played Ruth Davidson: I'm not looking past 2021 Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said any politician watching Mrs May's speech would have sympathised with her,  but if she wasn't a ""weak prime minister presiding over a deeply divided party"" it would not have been an issue. But the Conservative leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, told the BBC that while there had been some ""unfortunate shenanigans"" in the party, ""the pushback has been pretty strong"" against those trying to force a leadership contest. She criticised ""tittle-tattle"" by colleagues, adding that being a politician is ""about delivering for the country, it's not and should never be about private ambition"". Of Mr Johnson, whom some Conservative figures have suggested should be sacked, she said: ""He is a big intellect, a big figure in the party and if the prime minister believes he is the right person to be foreign secretary then she has my full support."" Mr Johnson had said he was ""fully behind""the PM's Florence speech last month- designed to break the deadlock in Brexit negotiations - and she should ""hold him to that"", Ms Davidson added. Of her own leadership ambitions, Ms Davidson said she was focussed on her job as Scottish Tory leader: ""I'm looking to 2021 [Holyrood elections] and I'm not looking past it because there is quite a lot in my in-tray right now."" The Conservative former deputy PM Lord Heseltine said he believed a reshuffle was now inevitable given the prime minister's ""unenviable"" position - but it would be dangerous to return Mr Johnson to the backbenches. ""Brexit is the over-arching issue of our day and it is hugely damaging to the unity of the Conservative Party,"" he told the BBC. ""They can't make up their minds, either about the issues or the personality they would like to put in her [Theresa May's] place and that's the argument for the reshuffle because it could broaden the choice."" This video can not be played Lord Heseltine: May could 'open debate' on her successor To trigger a vote of confidence in the party leader, 48 of the 316 Conservative MPs would need to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. A leadership contest would then only be triggered if Mrs May lost that vote, or chose to quit.
