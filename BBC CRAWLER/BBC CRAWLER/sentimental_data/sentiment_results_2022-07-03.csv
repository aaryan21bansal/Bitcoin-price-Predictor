"The number of pubs in England and Wales continues to fall, hitting its lowest level on record, according to new research. There were 39,970 pubs in June, down by more than 7,000 since 2012, said real estate consultancy Altus Group. After struggling through Covid the industry now faced soaring prices and higher energy costs, it warned. The government said it had slashed taxes to help, but industry groups urged it to do more. Over the last decade thousands of pubs have closed as younger people drink less, supermarkets sell cheaper alcohol and the industry complains of being too heavily taxed. But in 2019 figures from the Office for National Statisticssuggested the sector was turning a corneras it expanded for the first time in a decade. It declined again during the pandemic, however, as lockdowns forced pubs to shut or implement strict social distancing rules. Landlady gives up pub as energy bills near Â£30,000 Firms warn time is running out to save UK economy Worse to come for food price rises, warns industry According to Altus, 400 pubs in England and Wales closed last year and some 200 shut in the first half of 2022 as inflation started to eat into their profits. That brought the total number of pubs down to its lowest since Altus's records began in 2005. Robert Hayton, head of Altus in the UK, said: ""Whilst pubs proved remarkably resilient during the pandemic, they're now facing new headwinds grappling with the cost of doing business in a crisis through soaring energy costs, inflationary pressures and tax rises."" According to the research, the West Midlands saw the biggest number of pub closures in the first six months of 2022, with 28 shutting. It was followed by London and the East of England which both lost 24. Altus said that pubs which had ""disappeared"" from the communities they once served had either been demolished or converted for other purposes, meaning that they were ""lost forever"". The chief executive of UK Hospitality, Kate Nicholls, said the pub closure figures were ""truly shocking but will come as no surprise to many in the industry"". ""We need the government to take urgent steps to remove barriers to growth, help to tackle the cost crisis we're facing and support more people into work and training,"" she said. ""Without this help, we could see thousands more pubs lost from their communities in the next few years."" Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), said: ""When pubs are forced to close it's a huge loss to the local community, and these numbers paint a devastating picture of how pubs are being lost in villages, towns and cities across the country. ""As a sector we have just weathered the hardest two years on memory, and we now face the challenge of extreme rising costs,"" she added. ""It's essential that we receive relief to ease these pressures or we really do risk losing more pubs year on year."" According to research from the BBPA, the British Institute of Innkeeping and UK Hospitality, only 37% of hospitality businesses are currently turning a profit. Those surveyed said the rising costs of energy, goods and labour were most to blame. In the past week, pub bosses have also warned that summer rail strikes could hit their profits by further weakening consumer demand. The government said it could not control the ""global factors"" pushing up inflation but continued to support the hospitality sector. ""We've cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance while slashing fuel duty,"" a spokesman said. ""We've also introduced a 50% business rates relief for eligible High Street businesses and prevented bill increases by freezing the business rates multiplier, saving businesses Â£4.6bn over the next five years.""

"""Relentless"" increases in the price of food may not hit their peak until next year, an industry group has warned. The Food and Drink Federation, which represents UK food and drink makers, said it usually takes 7-12 months for producers' costs to reach shop shelves. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has accelerated manufacturing costs such as energy and fertilizer. The federation's boss, Karen Betts, warned prices would ""absolutely"" get worse before they get better. Food and drink price inflation rose to 8.7% in the year to May, according to the Office for National Statistics. ""I think the peak could well be into next year and that prices could well rise some way above 10%,"" Ms Betts told the BBC. People cut back on food shopping as price rises bite Why are prices rising so quickly? Other groups, such as the Institute of Grocery Distribution, which provides analysis to major grocers, predict that prices could rise by as much as 15% as household staples such as bread, meat, dairy, fruit and vegetables become more expensive. The UK's overall inflation rate hit its highest level for 40 years in May, as the costs of energy, fuel and food continued to climb. People struggling with the rising cost of living are already cutting back on groceries or even skipping meals,according to a BBC survey of UK households. Ms Betts said that food and drink manufacturers had already seen costs rise during the pandemic due to supply and labour shortages - but the Ukraine war has worsened the situation. ""The manufacturers that I speak to are saying that at the moment all their input costs are rising, so that's everything from ingredients to raw materials, energy, labour and they can't see an end to that,"" she said. Both Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers of fertilizer, while Ukraine - known as the ""breadbasket of Europe"" - produces significant amounts of wheat, corn and sunflower oil. But the conflict is disrupting the supply of these goods, driving up prices on international markets. Meanwhile sanctions against Russia - a major oil and gas producer - have further pushed up global energy prices, hitting businesses and consumers alike. Ms Betts said there was ""usually a seven-to-12 month time lag in the prices that food manufacturers pay before those price rises are felt on shop shelves"". ""So, if it is costing more to plant and grow wheat or sunflowers for sunflower oil now then those price rises are going to take 12 months, perhaps longer to make their way into food prices in the UK,"" she said. The UK's overall inflation rate hit 9.1% in May and the Bank of England predicts it could reach 11% this year. One of the biggest concerns is that household energy bills are likely rise further in October, when the energy regulator Ofgem is expected to lift the cap on gas and electricity prices. Work and pensions secretary ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""The government knows this this is a challenging time for people. ""The spike of inflation leading to a hike in bills is largely driven by after-shocks of Covid, so the global supply chains are are still not flowing, but undoubtedly the decision we have made to tackle Putin and his invasion of Ukraine also has consequences particularly on energy costs."" She highlighted the government's package of measures to help households with energy costs, including a Â£400 discount on fuel bills for all homes.

"This video can not be played Watch: Sydney flash floods turn roads into rivers A man has died and thousands of people have been told to evacuate their homes amid torrential rain and major flooding in Australia's largest city, Sydney. Roads have been cut off, with 18 evacuation orders in western Sydney alone and warnings of more to come. ""This is a life-threatening emergency situation,"" Stephanie Cooke, emergency services minister for the state of New South Wales, said. Australia was hit by major flooding in March, killing 20 people, many in NSW. ""We are now facing dangers on multiple fronts - flash flooding, riverine flooding and coastal erosion,"" Ms Cooke told a media briefing. Her warning came as the Bureau of Meteorology said up to 350mm of rain had hit certain areas, risking flooding along the Nepean river. Sydney's main dam had also started to spill overnight - a further concern for the authorities. Ms Cooke said this was a ""rapidly evolving situation"" and warned that people should be ""prepared to evacuate at short notice"". There had been 83 flood rescues by emergency services in the past 24 hours alone, she said. ""It unfortunately shows that people aren't necessarily heeding the advice that we continue to put out multiple times a day in relation to this flooding event,"" Ms Cooke said. ""I'm respectfully asking people to avoid non-essential travel at this time."" Her warnings come as an unnamed man was killed after falling out of a kayak on the Parramatta River in western Sydney. Emergency officials attempted to revive the man after he was spotted struggling in the water by a member of the public, but he died at the scene. Experts say the flooding emergency has been worsened by climate change and a La NiÃ±a weather phenomenon. A La NiÃ±a develops when strong winds blow the warm surface waters of the Pacific away from South America and towards Indonesia. In their place, colder waters come up to the surface. In Australia, a La NiÃ±a increases the likelihood of rain, cyclones and cooler daytime temperatures. Have you been affected by the floods?

"The British Army says it is investigating after its Twitter and YouTube accounts were hacked.

An Army spokesperson added: ""Whilst we have now resolved the issue an investigation is ongoing and it would be inappropriate to comment further."" It is not clear who is behind the hacking incidents, which also saw the accounts renamed.

"Photographer Ray Hobbs was fascinated by boats near Llangwm, Pembrokeshire - with it unclear when, if ever, owners would return for some of them ""Put it on eBay, ask for anything from Â£1 to Â£100, then it becomes someone else's problem."" This was a typical response when marine biologist Dr Corina Ciocan asked: ""How do you get rid of an old boat?"" There are estimated to be about one million of all types in the UK, including kayaks, with it costing more than Â£3,000 to scrap larger vessels. It has led to warnings of a ""tidal wave of abandonments"", which could devastate marine life. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said a lack of end-of-life regulation and disposal costs can lead to boats being dumped, and it was looking at ways to tackle the problem. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it would be working with other countries to map the scale of the issue and develop guidance to improve the problem. Ship sprayed with urban artworks Hundreds of abandoned boats dumped Dr Ciocan found ""huge quantities"" of tiny fibreglass shards used to make boats in oysters and mussels, and warned of potential dangers to sea life as well as humans. She likened them to asbestos, adding: ""It took Sir David Attenborough 10 years to make us aware of plastic pollution. Unless a big name does the same on this, not much can be done."" Dr Ciocan believes it will become a real problem in the next decade, and could even lead to people dragging boats offshore, drilling holes in them and letting them sink There are currently no end-of-life boat regulations in the same way as there is legislation for cars Dr Ciocan, of Brighton University, described the fibres as ""like spikes"" that embed themselves into the organism and cannot be removed, saying a small snail looked like ""a pin cushion"" having been pierced many times. She warned of owners taking boats out to sea, drilling holes and letting them sink, if disposal routes are not created through legislation. Paddleboards and surfboards containing fibreglass are also currently unrecyclable and could pose a danger to marine life if dumped. Dr Ciocan published research on the impact at Chichester Harbour, off the coast of West Sussex and Hampshire, where boats were being repaired and crushed, adding: ""It caused an earthquake, with messages from people around the world saying it's a huge problem everywhere."" She said dismantling boats was effectively ""a very complicated process"", meaning there were few options for owners. It often involves getting rid of oils, chemicals and plastics, before you even get to the hull - layers of polyester resin that can be mixed with balsa wood and foam. Trials in the US, where boats are crushed down for cement, could provide a possible solution Natural Resources Wales is looking into the issue of boats dotted around Wales' waterways ""It needs to be incentivised, for boat owners to dispose of them in an environmentally-friendly way,"" she said. ""Usually, the older the boat, the poorer the owner. They won't have much money to spend on scientifically-proven disposal methods."" Ray Hobbs, from Burry Port, Carmarthenshire, always considered them a valuable commodity of the well-off, until he stumbled across what appeared to be a ""ship graveyard"" when walking his dog. They were around the Cleddau Estuary near Llangwm, Pembrokeshire, with it unclear how long many had been there and when, if ever, the owners would return for some of them. As a photographer, he was struck by the effects of the early morning sun and overnight frost on the vessels, but wondered: ""What will become of all these boats?

Luke Edney said one of the big issues was the ""sandwich of materials"" some boats are made of - fiberglass mixed with plastics, resins, balsa wood and foam Luke Edney of Boatbreakers, one of the UK's few disposal firms, believes there could be ""tidal wave of abandonments"" in the next 15 years.

""The longer the local authority leaves them, the worse the condition and cost to get up. It's a catch 22,"" he added. ""It's a big headache - if someone can sell the boat cheap, they will pass it on. But if they got the boat for Â£1, it has no perceived value so they could dump when they're bored of it."" The Â£5,000-a-year fee to leave a 25ft (7.5m) yacht in some harbours is also a cost some people are reluctant to pay for an ageing boat. ""Covid accelerated the situation because people haven't been able to get to some for two years, so they were finding engines wouldn't start and other issues,"" Mr Edney added. The demographic of people with boats is usually men aged 45 and up, meaning often people get too old to use them, Mr Edney said During the pandemic, many boats were left for up to two years While those on canals are regulated, he described it as a ""free for all"" on the coast, suggesting a tax every time a boat is bought or sold as a possible solution to fund recycling.

Kyrgios, 27, insisted his opponent should have been defaulted for the incident, claiming the ball hit the fan on the head, although television replays suggested otherwise. Tsitsipas had started to lose his cool towards the end of the second set after Kyrgios repeatedly berated chair umpire Damien Dumusois. ""It felt kind of a circus, in a way. We're there to play tennis,"" said the 23-year-old Greek. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Nick Kyrgios hit back at Stefanos Tsitsipas for bullying claims Kyrgios began mouthing off at Dumusois over a line call, labelling him a ""disgrace"" at one point in the long-running verbal exchanges, and was later given a warning after twice being reported by line judges for swearing. The drama continued into the third set as Tsitsipas received a point penalty for responding to an underarm serve by angrily smacking a forehand, which he said was ""aimed"" at Kyrgios' body, into the stadium scoreboard. At that point, it felt the match was teetering towards disqualification for one of them. Things settled down somewhat in the fourth set, and Kyrgios eventually clinched victory on his second match point in a frenzied atmosphere under the Court One floodlights. The pair shared a brief handshake at the net but the heat returned when they discussed the match with journalists. ""I would be pretty upset if I lost to someone two weeks in a row as well,"" said Kyrgios, who also beat Tsitsipas in Halle last month and now leads 4-1 in their head-to-head. ""Maybe he should figure out how to beat me a couple more times first."" This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Should Tsitsipas have been disqualified for this? Tsitsipas was the first one into the post-match interview room at the All England Club and, after a measured start, began to unload. The Greek described Kyrgios' chuntering as ""constant bullying"", despite the Australian having aimed his frustrations at umpire Dumusois and not his opponent. ""He bullies the opponents,"" said Tsitsipas. ""He was probably a bully at school himself. I don't like bullies. I don't like people that put other people down. ""He has some good traits in his character, as well. But he also has a very evil side to him, which if it's exposed, it can really do a lot of harm and bad to the people around him."" When those accusations were relayed to him by a reporter shortly afterwards, Kyrgios said he was ""not sure"" how he had bullied Tsitsipas. ""He was the one hitting balls at me, he was the one that hit a spectator, he was the one that smacked it out of the stadium,"" responded the world number 40. ""I didn't do anything. ""Apart from me just going back and forth to the umpire for a bit, I did nothing towards Stefanos that was disrespectful, I don't think. I was not drilling him with balls.""

"Argentina's economy minister, Martin GuzmÃ¡n, has resigned as the country's economic crisis intensifies. Mr GuzmÃ¡n had been in office since late 2019 and led negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the restructuring of Argentina's debt. He called for ""a political agreement within the governing coalition"" to choose his successor. Argentina is struggling with 60% inflation and a weak currency, as well as global food and energy price rises. Mr GuzmÃ¡n stepped down after a week of economic turmoil, with the Argentine peso sliding against the dollar. His departure leaves a big question mark over Argentina's future economic policy. In a letter to President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez , Mr GuzmÃ¡n hinted at internal divisions within the government. But it is no secret that President FernÃ¡ndez  is at odds with his deputy, Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, over how to tackle the country's economic problems. In fact, Mr GuzmÃ¡n announced his resignation while Ms FernÃ¡ndez was giving the latest in a series of high-profile speeches lambasting her own government's economic policies. Ms FernÃ¡ndez, who was herself president from 2007 to 2015, is critical of what she sees as the government's failure to ease the financial burden on ordinary Argentines. She and her supporters saw Mr GuzmÃ¡n as excessive in his efforts to reduce the budget deficit and tighten monetary policy.

"The fighting in Lysychansk sent plumes of smoke rising to the sky Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk is at the centre of competing claims, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces saying they are in control. Ukraine says its forces are enduring intense Russian shelling there but insists the city has not been seized. However, Russian-backed separatists say they have successfully entered the city and reached its centre. Russian media showed videos of separatist or Russian forces apparently parading through the streets. Russian sources have also tweeted video of the Soviet flag allegedly being placed on the city's ruined administrative centre, but that has not been verified. It is the last Ukrainian-held city in Luhansk, part of the industrial Donbas region. Russia captured the nearby city of Severodonetsk last month. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been no let-up in the assault on Lysychansk, with Russian forces approaching the besieged city from all sides. Rodion Miroshnik, ambassador to Russia of the pro-Moscow breakaway Luhansk People's Republic, told Russian television that Lysychansk had been ""brought under control"" but was ""not yet liberated"". Images of Chechen Russian soldiers inside the city were shared by defence blogger Rob Lee. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Since Russia invaded on 24 February, claiming it wanted to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine after it moved closer to Nato,thousands of civilians and combatants have been killed or wounded, whileat least 12 million people have fled their homes. Western states have responded by arming Ukraine and placing unprecedented sanctions on Russia, a nuclear superpower and global energy supplier. Can we say how many people have died in Ukraine? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Why Russia couldn't hold Snake Island In another development, railway tracks and electricity lines in the northern city of Kharkiv were damaged in a series of attacks. No casualties were reported. The southern city of Mykolaiv - on a key route to the port city of Odesa - was shaken by several explosions. The Russian defence ministry said its air force had destroyed five Ukrainian command posts and several ammunition dumps, but that claim has not been independently verified. The blasts came a day after the Russians were accused of killing more than 20 people in a missile strike on a block of flats near Odesa. Later on Saturday, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said his country's air defences had shot down Ukrainian missiles, though he did not specify where. He is a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin and allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine from Belarus in February. ""They are provoking us...  Three days ago, maybe a bit more, an attempt to strike military facilities on Belarusian territory was made from the territory of Ukraine,"" he said. ""But, thank God, the Pantsir anti-aircraft systems managed to intercept all the missiles."" He added that ""we are not seeking to fight in Ukraine"". In its latest intelligence update, the UK Defence Ministry accuses Russia of using Soviet-era anti-ship missiles ""in a secondary land attack role"" - not what they were designed for. The Kh-22 and Kh-32 missiles were ""likely"" the ones that killed many civilians in Kremenchuk and Odesa, the ministry says. Slovyansk, a major Donbas city held by Ukrainian forces, has also been shelled again by the Russians. Its mayor Vadym Lyakh said banned Russian cluster munitions killed four people there - another claim the BBC was unable to verify.

"Passengers faced delays and cancellations during Easter and the May bank holidays Airlines are expected to announce a series of cancellations to UK summer flights this week aimed at minimising disruption in the peak holiday season. A government ""amnesty"" to the rules on airport slots is in place until Friday, allowing airlines to change schedules without facing a potential penalty. Ministers told carriers to review their plans after chaos in May, blamed on a shortage of airline and airport staff. British Airways said the move would help provide ""certainty"" to customers. The UK's biggest airline, whose services from Heathrow Airport are likely to bear the brunt of this week's cancellations, said the measures would make it ""easier to consolidate some of our quieter daily flights to multi-frequency destinations well in advance, and to protect more of our holiday flights"". Airport slots provide airlines with the authorisation to take off or land at a specified time on a specified day. In usual circumstances, the carriers risk losing the slots - and taking a hit to their business - if they cancel flights. Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Airlines told to cancel flights to stop travel chaos The Department for Transport (DfT) amnesty will give airlines a short window to hand back the slots in the summer season they are not confident they will be able to operate. A DfT spokesperson said: ""This will help passengers find alternative arrangements ahead of time, rather than face the kind of last-minute cancellations seen over the Easter and half-term holidays."" That earlier disruption prompted the government and the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to write to airlines telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable... based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available"". Heathrow said the slot amnesty would ""enable airlines to make early choices to consolidate their schedules, boosting the resilience of summer operations and giving passengers the confidence they deserve ahead of their journeys"". It added: ""We encourage airlines to take this opportunity to reconsider their summer schedules without penalty and inform passengers as early as possible of any changes."" Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said it followed other measures taken by the sector. ""We will continue to work with ministers and the whole aviation ecosystem to ensure the summer peak runs as smoothly as possible for our passengers,"" he said. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said the move would also allow rival airlines to step in and fly the cancelled routes. He said: ""Carriers must surrender their slots to other airlines if they are unable to fulfil them. This will help reduce cancellations and end the unsustainable practice of airlines flying near-empty planes to retain slots."" Thousands of aviation jobs were lost during the Covid pandemic and many businesses have struggled to recruit enough new staff in time to deal with resurgent demand for travel following the easing of rules. Gatwick said it would be reducing the number of flightsduring summer because of staff shortages even before the airport slots amnesty was first set out by the government on 21 June, Heathrow to date had not announced similar plans although last weekit ordered 30 flights to be cancelled, saying it was expecting more passenger numbers than it could cope with. It comes asManchester Airport warnedit would not be able to return to its pre-pandemic standards until the autumn. Aviation industry consultant Paul Charles predicted thousands of flight cancellations would be announced this week, meaning less last-minute disruption over the summer. But he told BBC News passengers were facing a ""summer of stress"". Staffing levels remained 20-30% lower than they should be, he said, with a rise in Covid cases seeing airline and ground workers calling in sick in recent weeks. Meanwhile, passengers face the prospect of disruption from strikes involving airline staff over summer. Hundreds ofBritish Airways workers at Heathrow Airport- mostly check-in staff - have voted to go on strike in July over pay, andunions are currently consulting engineers and call centre staffat Gatwick, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle on taking action. Unions have also called forEasyJet cabin crew based in Spain to strike for nine daysthis month as part of a dispute over pay.
