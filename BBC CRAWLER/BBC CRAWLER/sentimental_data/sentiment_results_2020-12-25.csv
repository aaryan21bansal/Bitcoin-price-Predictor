"The UK's Covid vaccination programme has begun, with the over-80s and some health and care staff first in line. Two dancing partners who only became a co-habiting couple at the age of 90 were among the first in the queue in Bradford, where Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary got to hear about them. As with so many great romances, it all started for Lily Abbot and Trevor Hirst on the dance floor. They first met through Bradford's sequence dancing circuit 30 years ago, became good friends and would travel to events around the country together - Lily partnered by her husband, Wilf, Trevor with his wife, Rita. Trevor gave up after Rita died six years ago. But eventually friends persuaded him to give it another try. And whenever he turned up at the church hall, Lily would be there. She'd lost Wilf in 2006 after 55 years of marriage. ""I'd get her up to dance,"" says Trevor, ""and all the rest is history."" At the start of 2020, the year they both turned 90 - Lily, who is six days older than Trevor, calls him her ""toy boy"" - they were still living separately. ""Some of our friends said, 'Why don't you two get married?'"" she says. ""I said: 'We don't want to get married, we've both been married, we don't need to be married, we're all right.'"" Trevor has four grown-up children, Lily has two. Both are grandparents and Trevor is a great-grandparent. Then Covid arrived. ""We didn't realise the seriousness of it at first but it's been horrendous,"" says Lily. One day early on in lockdown, she and Trevor went out for a walk together and Lily fell and cracked a rib. ""Trevor said he'd come and live here because both my children and his wanted us to do that - I was frightened by my fall and he came here and I said, 'You might as well stay, rather than go home at night,'"" says Lily. Now they are ""living over the brush"", as Lily puts it. ""It's just worked out great and we are so compatible."" The race to develop a vaccine has been won, though there are still plenty of runners and riders racing around the track. Now the race to vaccinate the population is firmly under way. In Bradford we have set up four vaccine hubs across the city, one at Bradford Royal Infirmary and three in primary care. Lily and Trevor were two of our first happy customers. We know that we will need to vaccinate around 70% of the population to reach herd immunity to stop the chain of viral transmission. That will take many months and so the initial priority is to protect the most vulnerable. Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. Listen to The NHS Front Lineon BBC Soundsandthe BBC World Service Or read the previous online diary entry:'Have I got Covid for a second time?' Check out all the diary entries on the BBC Radio 4 website Age is by far the biggest predictor of severity of disease and death, so the vaccine strategy is focused on the over-80-year-olds to start with, moving then to over-70s and so on. Care home and healthcare staff are also important as they are much more likely to catch the infection and then spread it to their residents or patients. In the hospital we have been getting our weekly delivery of one tray or ""pizza box"" of 195 Pfizer vaccine vials every week. The national guidance recommended five doses per vial, allowing us to vaccinate 975 people every week. However, this is precious stuff, and it is quite possible to squeeze a sixth dose from the vials, increasing our coverage to 1,170 people every week. From next week we will ramp up to two trays and 2,340 vaccines per week. Every day our carefully choreographed vaccine hub receives the over-80s, care home workers and frontline staff. There are always some no shows, so hanging around at the end of the day for any leftover vaccine is a good strategy for staff in the hospital. Queuing for her Covid vaccination brought back memories for Lily, who has lived in Bradford all her life. She was born in Undercliffe and her parents worked in the mills. ""Bradford was wonderful in those days, the mills and the shops,"" she says. ""We didn't have a lot but it was good."" Hers was a large extended family - she had nine sisters and a brother. ""I see some similarities with the Asian families now as they have a similar thing with many relatives together,"" she says. After leaving school at 14 she took a job as a machinist. It was at work that she met Wilf, a tailor's cutter. Lily remembers Bradford's 1962 smallpox outbreak, which led to more than 200,000 people in the city being vaccinated against the disease. ""It was awful at the time but the vaccine cleared it up,"" she says. ""Having the vaccine now reminds me of that. I think people who won't go and get the vaccine are foolish, it's not fair if they don't get it but it's a personal choice."" Trevor, who worked as a wool sorter in Bradford's mills, remembers getting his smallpox vaccine, too. But he preferred the 2020 experience. ""This time round we queued with some of the others from our dancing groups and that was much more fun - we were all so excited, as it means we will be soon together again,"" he says. Lily is also crossing her fingers that the vaccine will allow them all to get together and dance. ""We are hoping that dancing will start up again, we will all be learners, having to learn again!"" she says. Sadly, that may not be possible for a while, even if all the dancers in the groups get vaccinated quickly. When someone is infected with SARS-CoV-2 they develop antibodies of one type (IgG) in their blood, and antibodies of a different type (IgA) in the mucosal membranes of their nose and throat. Vaccines administered into the arm tend to be very good at protecting us from illness, thanks to the antibodies in the blood, but may not stop transmission of the virus - for this you also need the antibodies in the nose and throat. So even after their second injection, we can't be sure that Lily and Trevor will not catch and pass on the virus to others. With the flu vaccine there is also a tendency for immunity in older people not to last a long time, and it's likely the same will be true with this vaccine. Furthermore, some of the dancers may be among the 5% of recipients not protected by the vaccine (though we hope it will reduce symptoms). I am confident that Lily and Trevor will get back on their dancing feet as herd immunity eclipses the virus and eases it out from our daily lives. After that, I am quietly hoping to see them on Strictly. Follow@docjohnwright,externaland radio producer@SueM1tchell,externalon Twitter SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Drivers are being tested before being allowed to make the crossing to France Thousands of lorry drivers waiting to cross the English Channel to France are spending Christmas Day in their cabs in Kent. Hundreds of military personnel have been deployed to help clear the backlog of about 5,000 lorries, which are waiting at Manston Airport. Drivers are allowed to travel on the condition they test negative for Covid-19 before boarding a train or ferry. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said more than 10,000 tests had been done. He said out of those lorry drivers who had been tested, 24 were positive for coronavirus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

France closed its border after the UK warned of afast-spreading variant of coronavirusbut ended its ban on Wednesday, providing people tested negative before travelling. More than 700 hauliers have been cleared for departure since France reopened its border. But about 5,000 remain unable to get home and are waiting at Manston Airport, on a closed section of the M20, and in Dover. Freight traffic has started moving through the Port of Dover French firefighters have been supporting the testing effort, and a group of Polish medics was deployed to the UK on Thursday to help test drivers. the Polish news website TVN24 has reported. Some lorry drivers have already spent nearly a week stranded following the closure of the border on Sunday. Mr Shapps said: ""We need to get the situation in Kent, caused by the French government's sudden imposition of Covid restrictions, resolved as soon as possible. ""I know it's been hard for many drivers cooped up in their cabs at this precious time of year, but I assure them that we are doing our utmost to get them home."" The UK's border with France was closed on Sunday and reopened on Wednesday The government said catering vans were providing hot food and drinks to stranded hauliers at Manston, with Kent Council and volunteer groups providing refreshments to those stuck on the M20. HM Coastguard said its teams in the Dover area had so far delivered 3,000 hot meals, 600 pizzas, 2,985 packed lunches and 17 pallets of water to those waiting. Southeastern Railway and Network Rail arranged for food to be delivered to lorry drivers stuck in Operation Stack on the M20. Seven trains carrying crates of food for the hauliers have left London in the past 48 hours, with the Salvation Army distributing the items. There are more than 250 toilets at Manston, with a further 32 portable toilets added to existing facilities already along the M20. A Port of Dover spokesman said ferry services had run throughout Christmas Eve night and would continue on Christmas Day to help ease congestion. Duncan Buchanan, from the Road Haulage Association, said: ""The most reassuring thing is that food is getting through at Manston, and I have to say a big thank you to everyone who volunteered to help.""

"Poor safety and changing weather have led to a series of accidents on Lake Albert over years A boat accident on Lake Albert on the border of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo has left at least 26 people dead. A ""strong wind"" caused the vessel to go under water, a local official told AFP news agency. Dozens of people were on board and at least 21 people were rescued, Ashraf Oromo said. A marine officer said poor safety and fast-changing weather meant accidents were common on the lake. The boat was travelling between two locations on the Ugandan side on Wednesday when strong winds blew up and it capsized. Rescuers did not expect to find any more survivors, Mr Oromo said. However, local media quoted the chief of the locality who suggested that the search was ongoing Both Congolese and Ugandan nationals were on the boat and were among the victims, Mr Tchovidong said. ""Because of failure to adhere to safety measures and fast-changing weather patterns, Lake Albert has many accidents,"" regional police marine officer Samuel Onyango told AFP. One official said that many of the victims were trying to return illegally to the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC) to avoid the coronavirus restrictions that have stopped most traffic between the DRC and Uganda, according to the Associated Press news agency. Australian saved from Antarctica in five-day mission The Nigerian blogger scouring the past to inform the future US doctor dies of Covid alleging racist hospital care Vital Adubanga, president of the Wangongo chiefdom in eastern Congo's Ituri province, said that night boats were prohibited but the ban was frequently ignored. Many of those on board were traders attempting to reach a weekly market, Mr Adubanga as well asUgandan website The Daily Monitor said.,external Lake Albert, which is Africa's seventh-largest lake, has been the scene of considerable loss of life in previous boat accidents. In 2014,more than 250 refugees diedwhen a vessel capsized while carrying far more people than its capacity.

"Chinese helicopters assisted in the mission An Australian expeditioner has been medically evacuated from Antarctica following a five-day mission involving ships, helicopters and planes. Australia, China and the US collaborated in efforts to bring the patient back home. The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) hailed the ""outstanding success"" of an operation it described as ""complex and challenging"". Details of the patient's condition were not made public. Officials said it was not related to coronavirus. The expeditioner was at Australia's Davis research station in east Antarctica when the mission began. The AAD said that ""fortunately for the operation"" a Chinese icebreaker happened to pass by. It dispatched its helicopters to transfer a team of Australians to a site some 40km (25 miles) inland, so that they could build a ski-way for a US aircraft to land on and pick up the patient. Meanwhile, the US ski-equipped Basler aircraft flew 2,200km from the US McMurdo research station to Australia's Wilkins Aerodrome to pick up an Australian doctor. Antarctic place names recognise 'modern explorers' Antarctic artwork commemorates island's dark past Coronavirus spreads to Antarctica It then flew to the ski-way near Davis, where it picked up the patient and returned to Wilkins Aerodrome. An Australian Airbus A319 transported the patient back to the Australian city of Hobart on Christmas Eve.

"On a roll: LadBaby is again joined by his wife Roxanne and their children on his latest festive hit LadBaby has become only the third act in UK chart history, after The Beatles and the Spice Girls, to score three straight Christmas number one singles. The charitable sausage roll singer fended off competition from a Mariah Carey classic, and a protest song about Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Sir Paul McCartney, meanwhile, topped the festive album chart, on Friday. ""I can't believe we've done it once, never mind three times,"" LadBaby told BBC Radio 1 presenter Katie Thistleton. His latest offering, Don't Stop Me Eatin', which is raising money for The Trussell Trust food bank charity, was a pastry take on Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. LadBaby bids for third Christmas number one Paul McCartney reveals his 'fun' lockdown album It followed his previous successful efforts, 2018's We Built This City... On Sausage Rolls; and I Love Sausage Rolls, from last year. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

""We know the British public love a sausage roll,"" the hat-trick hero continued. ""And I think after the year we've all had we just wanted to come back and make everyone smile."" His new song, which was helped along by the release of a surprise alternative version with Ronan Keating earlier this week, became the fastest selling UK single in more than three years, since Artists For Grenfell's Bridge Over Troubled Water. It also dislodged Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You at the summit. All I Want for Christmas Is Two: You got it Mariah The diva's ubiquitous hit had reigned supreme for the past fortnight, remarkablyfor the first timesince its release 26 years ago. LadBaby now finds himself in exalted company, alongside The Beatles, who dominated the Christmas number one spots between 1963-65, with I Want To Hold Your Hand, I Feel Fine, and the double A-side Daytripper / We Can Work It Out. As well as the Spice Girls, who had three in a row from 1996-98, with 2 Become 1, Too Much, and Goodbye. YouTube comedian LadBaby, whose real name is Mark Hoyle, described 2020 as ""our most important year yet"" to help people, due to the impact of coronavirus. He spoke to BBC News last week about why he and his band - aka wife Roxanne and their children - changed their minds after previously saying they wouldn't go for a third. ""We'd run out of songs with rock 'n' roll in the title, because that's been our go-to - you find a song with rock 'n' roll in the title and it's a good change [to sausage roll],"" he said. ""We wanted to choose a song that people love and can sing to,"" he continued. ""The best way is to look at karaoke songs, and Don't Stop Believin' always features highly on most karaoke lists. ""We felt like after the year everyone's had, it's a sentiment everyone needs - don't stop believing things are going to get better. It felt very fitting, so we had to weave some sausage roll magic into the lyrics.""

Justin Bieber's cover of Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree [number eight] and Liam Gallagher's All You're Dreaming Of [24], which raised money for Action for Children, also proved popular this year. McCartney III,the ""fun"" lockdown albumby former Beatle Sir Paul, gave him his first number one LP in 31 years - since 1989's Flowers In The Dirt. ""I just want to say happy Christmas, happy New Year, and a big thank you to everyone who helped get my record to number one in the album charts,"" the rock 'n' roll knight of the realm told the Official Charts Company. Taylor Swift'ssurprise new album, Evermore, was close behind him in second. Sir Paul McCartney recorded his Christmas number one album in isolation while spending lockdown with his daughter Mary, who took these photographs Also on Christmas Day, it was announced by music licensing company PPL that The Pogues' widely-debated track, Fairytale Of New York was officially the UK's most-played Christmas track of the 21st Century. Last month, Radio 1 decided tostop playing the original versionof the song in full, because its audience may be offended by some of the lyrics. (The track, which features the late Kirsty MacColl, finished sixth in this week's official singles chart, as one of 26 Christmas songs in the top 40.)

"Anastasia Yeschchenko was described as a brilliant student A Russian historian who admitted shooting and dismembering his student partner in St Petersburg has been jailed for 12 and a half years. Oleg Sokolov, 63, an expert on the Napoleonic wars, pleaded guilty to the murder of Anastasia Yeshchenko, 24. He was found drunk in a river in November 2019 with Ms Yeshchenko's severed arms in his backpack. Women's rights activists say the case shows indifference towards harassment and domestic violence in Russia. An online petition with more than 7,500 signatures accused St Petersburg State University of ignoring previous complaints from students against Sokolov. He has now been dismissed from the university and from another academic post in France. Teenage Russian 'abuse victims' face jail The dark reality of Russia's domestic violence laws 'I want to stand up for every woman experiencing abuse' In court Sokolov admitted shooting Ms Yeshchenko four times with a sawn-off shotgun, before chopping up her body with a saw and kitchen knife. A stun pistol was also found in the backpack. Police later found other body parts further downstream and in Sokolov's flat. He is said to have planned to get rid of the body before publicly taking his own life while dressed as Napoleon. This video can not be played Oleg Sokolov broke down in court and confessed to the killing Ms Yeshchenko had moved to St Petersburg to study from Krasnodar region in southern Russia, and was a postgraduate student at the time of her death. ""She was quiet, sweet and always the ideal student,"" an acquaintance told Russia's RIA news agency in November 2019. Russian media reported that her mother is a police lieutenant colonel and her father a school PE teacher. A brother once played as a goalkeeper for the national junior football team. A lawyer for the Yeshchenko family, Alexandra Baksheeva, said ""no jail term would bring [her] back"" but that they accepted the court's decision. Sokolov had been living with Ms Yeshchenko for at least three years. He organised Napoleonic re-enactments - in which he played the part of Napoleon and she also took part. He wrote dozens of historical research papers, some of them co-authored with Ms Yeshchenko. According to students quoted by AFP, Sokolov enjoyed speaking French and did impressions of Napoleon. They said he called Ms Yeshchenko ""Josephine"", after Napoleon's consort, and asked to be addressed as ""Sire"". In court Sokolov alleged that Ms Yeshchenko had attacked him with a knife during a blazing row. It was then that he shot her. Russian media say he also blamed persecution by an academic rival for his actions. Ms Yeshchenko's parents rejected his version of events.

"The post-Brexit deal will make the UK safer, Home Secretary Priti Patel says, despite concerns from police chiefs about a lack of access to data. She said the UK would be ""more secure through firmer and fairer border controls"" after 31 December. The deal allows cooperation on security and policing, but Brussels said the UK will no longer have ""direct, real-time access"" to sensitive information. This includes a major database on people and items such as stolen guns. The UK-EU trade deal - a 1,246-page document which has been seen by the BBC but not published by the government - will be voted on in Parliament on 30 December, with the UK set to exit existing trade rules the next day. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal UK 'will be less safe' without EU security deal UK to lose access to EU crime fighting tools Why the full Brexit text goes beyond Canada's deal In the run-up to the UK's separation from the European Union, police chiefsraised concerns about losing access to databasesand the European Arrest Warrant. Ms Patel said the UK would continue to be ""one of the safest countries in the world"" and she was ""immensely proud"" of the package agreed with the EU. She said: ""It means both sides have effective tools to tackle serious crime and terrorism, protecting the public and bringing criminals to justice. ""But we will also seize this historic opportunity to make the UK safer and more secure through firmer and fairer border controls."" The Home Office said the post-Brexit agreement included streamlined extradition arrangements, fast and effective exchange of national DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data and continued transfers of Passenger Name Record data. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods - but we don't know all the details yet. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. What happens next with Brexit? From July 2021, the UK will receive advance data on goods arriving from the EU into Great Britain, something which was not previously possible under EU rules. But the UK will lose access to the EU's Schengen Information System II (SIS II) database of alerts about people and items such as stolen firearms and vehicles. The EU has said it is legally impossible to offer SIS access to the UK. Earlier this month Steve Rodhouse, director general of operations for the National Crime Agency, warned that losing access to the database would mean alerts relating to around 400,000 investigations in European countries would disappear from the UK's national computer on 31 December. ""Investigations could take longer, and it could mean that serious criminals are not held to account as quickly,"" he said. BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said that while the agreement did appear to protect continued security and policing cooperation it ""downgrades what British police can achieve - and how quickly"". ""As expected, the UK will have to unplug its connection to an enormous real-time database that shares alerts on wanted or missing people,"" he said. In November, National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for Brexit, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin told peers that while contingency plans were being made the loss of access to SIS was ""still a capability gap and it will have a massive impact on us"". He said his team had checked the system 603 million times last year. Following the announcement of the deal, the NPCC said while it welcomed a deal between the UK and EU it was working with the government to ""fully understand the detail of the security agreement and how it will be implemented, and ensure we are prepared for any changes to the way we currently operate"". BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said while the UK has reached an agreement on extradition and will be able to sit in on meetings of Europol - the cross-border security agency - ""on a par with the best other countries have achieved"",the speed at which the UK gets important data and the influence it has on decisions has been reduced. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal What does Brexit mean for security in the UK?

"Flood warnings have been issued in Bedfordshire as water levels rise People in more than 1,300 properties have been urged to leave their homes as flood levels rise in Bedfordshire. Police warned of a ""really serious situation"" and have contacted people living along the River Great Ouse. Fire crews used boats to rescue people throughout Christmas Day.

"European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier attending a meeting in Brussels EU ambassadors have received a Christmas Day briefing on the post-Brexit trade deal reached with the UK. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier updated them on the agreement, reached after months of fraught talks on fishing rights and business rules. MPs will vote on the deal in Parliament on 30 December, with the UK set to exit existing trading rules on 31 December. The 1,246-page document, which includes about 800 pages of annexes and footnotes, has been seen by the BBC. A34-page summary of the deal has been published,externalon the UK government's website, but not the complete text. What will happen to EU health insurance cards? What just happened with Brexit? Labour said it was a ""thin agreement"" but they would back it as the only alternative to no deal, meaning it should win approval. The European Parliament needs to ratify the deal but it is unlikely to do so until the new year, meaning its application will formally be provisional until then. European ambassadors during the briefing of European Union member states in Brussels on 25 December Sebastian Fischer, a spokesman for the German presidency of the Council of the EU, joked ahead of the EU diplomats' meeting that he was looking forward to it ""because nothing is more fun than to celebrate Christmas among socially distanced colleagues"". Meanwhile, French Europe minister Clement Beaune said it was a ""good agreement"", adding that the EU had not accepted a deal ""at all costs"". In aChristmas video message, posted on Twitter,externalon Thursday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson brandished a draft copy of the document. Boris Johnson held up a draft of the Brexit deal in a video published by No 10 He said: ""Tonight, on Christmas Eve, I have a small present for anyone who may be looking for something to read in that sleepy post-Christmas lunch moment, and here it is, tidings, glad tidings of great joy because this is a deal. ""A deal to give certainty to business, travellers, and all investors in our country from January 1. A deal with our friends and partners in the EU."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the agreement as ""fair"" and ""balanced"", saying it was now ""time to turn the page and look to the future"". The UK ""remains a trusted partner,"" she added. Struck four and a half years after the UK voted to leave the EU, the deal will define the future relationship for decades. This video can not be played A round-up of the Brexit trade agreement According to the text of the deal, those issued with aEuropean Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before the end of 2020 can use it before its expiry date,after which, the UK will issue a new card - called the UK Global Health Insurance Card. Similar to the EHIC - which entitles people to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in any EU country, or in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - the new card will cover chronic or existing illnesses and routine maternity care as well as emergencies. The agreement says any specialised treatment, such as dialysis or cancer treatment, ""must be subject to a prior agreement between the insured person and the unit providing the treatment"" to ensure the treatment is available. Meanwhile, goods will continue to be traded free of tariffs and quotas and there will be independent arbitration to resolve future disputes. It will mean big changes for business, with the UK and EU forming two separate markets, and the end of free movement. Five thoughts on the Brexit trade deal How EU leaders reacted to post-Brexit trade deal But it will have come as a major relief to many British businesses, already reeling from the impact of coronavirus, who feared disruption at the borders and the imposition of tariffs, or taxes on imports. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who campaigned against Brexit - said the deal did not provide adequate protections for jobs, manufacturing, financial services or workplace rights and was ""not the deal the government promised"". But with no time left to renegotiate, the only choice was between ""this deal or no deal,"" he added. Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said his party needed to see the full text, but would not support a ""bad deal"". Michel Barnier leaves the EU Commission for a meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee in Brussels, Belgium, on 25 December Parliament will sit on 30 December to vote on the trade deal. Dr Joelle Grogan, senior lecturer in law at Middlesex University London, told BBC News: ""To put this in real context, if I spend the next five days before Parliament is recalled on Wednesday spending 10 hours a day just reading that document, I will have a maximum of two minutes and 30 seconds to fully understand, analyse and comment on it."" ""The clock is no longer ticking."" These were pretty much the first words out of the mouth of the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, as he announced the just sealed EU-UK trade and security agreement on Thursday. No more looming ""no-deal"" threats; no more almost painful uncertainty about future relations across the Channel. This was a historic moment. A fair and balanced deal for both sides, said the European Commission. But you'd have to have been half-asleep (or halfway through a bottle of eggnog, cava or pint of GlÃ¼hwein) to miss the stark difference in tone between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's triumphalist announcement on Thursday afternoon and the sombre statement by the European Commission. Read more from Katya. At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the agreement would ""protect jobs across this country"". He said the UK had not got all it wanted on financial services, a vital part of the UK economy, but insisted the deal was ""nonetheless going to enable our dynamic City of London to get on and prosper as never before"". A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods - but we don't know all the details yet. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. What happens next with Brexit? The prime minister also acknowledged he had been forced to give ground on his demands on fishing. Fishing makes up 0.12% of the UK's economy but the negotiations went down to the wire over what EU boats were allowed to catch in UK waters. In future, 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet, over a period of five-and-a-half years. Barrie Deas, the head of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said ""significant concessions"" meant there would be ""a lot of disappointed and frustrated fishermen"". Brexit: Firms âneed guidanceâ to keep goods moving Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI What the PM's mistake tells us about our future Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said fishing got a ""bad deal"",adding: ""Brexit is happening against Scotland's will... It's time to chart our own future as an independent, European nation."" Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford said a deal was better than no dealbut said it was ""thin"" and not what Wales was promised. The deal also means that,except for Northern Ireland,the UKwill no longer participate in the Erasmus student exchange scheme.Mr Johnson said it was being replaced with the Turing Scheme, which will include universities outside the EU. In another development following the deal announcement, the UK Mission to the EU said people with a driving licence issued in the UK would not need to use an International Drivers Licence in the EU.

"Prosecutors accused Michael Jackson of grooming children at the Neverland ranch, allegations he denied The Neverland ranch of the late pop star Michael Jackson has reportedly been sold to a billionaire investor for a quarter of its initial asking price. Ron Burkle, a former friend of Jackson, recently bought the estate in Los Olivos, California, his spokesman said. He paid $22m (Â£16.2m) for Neverland,the Wall Street Journal reported,external, citing public records and three people familiar with the deal. The 2,700-acre (1,100 hectare) compound was first listed for $100m in 2015. Michael Jackson's Neverland ranch up for sale Since then Neverland, north of Santa Barbara city, has been on and off the market, listed most recently last year for the lower price of $31m. Jackson originally paid about $19.5m for Neverland, which he named after a fictional island where children never grow up in âJM Barrie's Peter Pan story. Jackson bought the estate in 1987 but struggled to pay for it The Thriller singer bought Neverland in 1987, making it his home during the height of his fame. He turned the ranch into an entertainment complex, building a zoo and fairground on site, where he regularly entertained children and their families. In the 1990s and 2000s, Neverland became the centre of various investigations into child sexual assault allegations against Jackson. Jackson turned the ranch into a playground for children Jackson denied allegations by Santa Barbara prosecutors that he had used Neverland as a fantasy world to groom young boys. In 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of allegations he abused a 13-year-old boy at the ranch. Jackson never returned to Neverland. Four years later, in June 2009, Jackson died at another home in Los Angeles after suffering a cardiac arrest induced by a drug overdose. Since his death Jackson has been the subject of further abuse allegations, includingthose made in a documentary called Leaving Neverland in 2019. The estate had a zoo and fairground on site Neverland has been rebranded as Sycamore Valley Ranch and has undergone extensive redevelopment since Jackson's death. Mr Burkle's spokesman said the businessman saw the investment as a land banking opportunity. He spotted the estate from the air while looking at another location and contacted Tom Barrack, the founder of real-estate investment company Colony Capital LLC, to seal the sale. Mr Burkle, 68, is co-founder and managing partner of Yucaipa Companies, LLC, a private investment firm. His net worth as of 24 December 2020 was estimated to be $1.4bn,according to a profile by American business magazine Forbes,external.

"All airline passengers arriving in the US from the UK are to be required to test negative for Covid-19 within 72 hours of departure amid concerns about a new coronavirus variant. From 28 December travellers will need to provide written documentation of their test result to airlines. Other countries have shut their borders to UK flights because of the variant. But its rapid spread has also led to stricter rules in the UK, including a ban on overseas trips for many Britons. And US airlines have drastically scaled back flying to the UK and Europe, after the entry of most foreign nationals was suspended at the start of the pandemic. Health officials say there is no evidence the new variant is more deadly, or would react differently to vaccines, but it is proving to be up to 70% more transmissible. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? The decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to require testing came afterNew York City introduced quarantine rules for international travellersin response to the variant.

"On a roll: LadBaby is again joined by his wife Roxanne and their children on his latest festive hit LadBaby has become only the third act in UK chart history, after The Beatles and the Spice Girls, to score three straight Christmas number one singles. The charitable sausage roll singer fended off competition from a Mariah Carey classic, and a protest song about Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Sir Paul McCartney, meanwhile, topped the festive album chart, on Friday. ""I can't believe we've done it once, never mind three times,"" LadBaby told BBC Radio 1 presenter Katie Thistleton. His latest offering, Don't Stop Me Eatin', which is raising money for The Trussell Trust food bank charity, was a pastry take on Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. LadBaby bids for third Christmas number one Paul McCartney reveals his 'fun' lockdown album It followed his previous successful efforts, 2018's We Built This City... On Sausage Rolls; and I Love Sausage Rolls, from last year. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

""We know the British public love a sausage roll,"" the hat-trick hero continued. ""And I think after the year we've all had we just wanted to come back and make everyone smile."" His new song, which was helped along by the release of a surprise alternative version with Ronan Keating earlier this week, became the fastest selling UK single in more than three years, since Artists For Grenfell's Bridge Over Troubled Water. It also dislodged Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You at the summit. All I Want for Christmas Is Two: You got it Mariah The diva's ubiquitous hit had reigned supreme for the past fortnight, remarkablyfor the first timesince its release 26 years ago. LadBaby now finds himself in exalted company, alongside The Beatles, who dominated the Christmas number one spots between 1963-65, with I Want To Hold Your Hand, I Feel Fine, and the double A-side Daytripper / We Can Work It Out. As well as the Spice Girls, who had three in a row from 1996-98, with 2 Become 1, Too Much, and Goodbye. YouTube comedian LadBaby, whose real name is Mark Hoyle, described 2020 as ""our most important year yet"" to help people, due to the impact of coronavirus. He spoke to BBC News last week about why he and his band - aka wife Roxanne and their children - changed their minds after previously saying they wouldn't go for a third. ""We'd run out of songs with rock 'n' roll in the title, because that's been our go-to - you find a song with rock 'n' roll in the title and it's a good change [to sausage roll],"" he said. ""We wanted to choose a song that people love and can sing to,"" he continued. ""The best way is to look at karaoke songs, and Don't Stop Believin' always features highly on most karaoke lists. ""We felt like after the year everyone's had, it's a sentiment everyone needs - don't stop believing things are going to get better. It felt very fitting, so we had to weave some sausage roll magic into the lyrics."" Christmas 2020 UK top five singles Don't Stop Me Eatin' - LadBaby All I Want For Christmas Is You - Mariah Carey Last Christmas - Wham! This Christmas - Jess Glynne Boris Johnson... - The K's Christmas 2020 UK top five albums McCartney III - Sir Paul McCartney Evermore - Taylor Swift Together at Christmas - Michael Ball and Alfie Boe Classic Diamonds - Neil Diamond and LSO Music Played by Humans - Gary Barlow Elsewhere in the singles chart, an expletive-laden song about PM Boris Johnson, by an Essex synth-pop outfit (whose name we can't really mention here without losing our jobs) also made the festive top five; and was at one-point the UK's second most-downloaded song of the week. Justin Bieber's cover of Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree [number eight] and Liam Gallagher's All You're Dreaming Of [24], which raised money for Action for Children, also proved popular this year. McCartney III,the ""fun"" lockdown albumby former Beatle Sir Paul, gave him his first number one LP in 31 years - since 1989's Flowers In The Dirt. ""I just want to say happy Christmas, happy New Year, and a big thank you to everyone who helped get my record to number one in the album charts,"" the rock 'n' roll knight of the realm told the Official Charts Company. Taylor Swift'ssurprise new album, Evermore, was close behind him in second. Sir Paul McCartney recorded his Christmas number one album in isolation while spending lockdown with his daughter Mary, who took these photographs Also on Christmas Day, it was announced by music licensing company PPL that The Pogues' widely-debated track, Fairytale Of New York was officially the UK's most-played Christmas track of the 21st Century. Last month, Radio 1 decided tostop playing the original versionof the song in full, because its audience may be offended by some of the lyrics. (The track, which features the late Kirsty MacColl, finished sixth in this week's official singles chart, as one of 26 Christmas songs in the top 40.) All I Want For Christmas Is You had to settle for second place once again in that poll of the past 20 years, while Wham!'s Last Christmas finished third overall - just as it did in this week's singles chart too.

"Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked the House to vote on the stimulus measures on Monday Democrats and Republicans have blocked each other's attempts to amend a vital $900bn (Â£665bn) stimulus package after President Donald Trump sent it back to Congress demanding changes. The coronavirus economic relief, which comes with a $1.4tn federal budget attached, was agreed by both sides. But Mr Trump said one-off payments to Americans should increase from $600 to $2,000, and foreign aid should be cut. Without the bill in force, many Americans face an uncertain Christmas. Unemployment benefits are due to expire on Saturday if the bill is not enacted, and a moratorium on evictions may not be extended. Legislators could pass a stopgap bill by Monday to prevent a partial government shutdown looming a day later, but this would not include coronavirus aid and Mr Trump would still have to sign it. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home Meeting on Thursday in response to Mr Trump's intervention, Democrats in the House of Representatives blocked Republican attempts to cut foreign aid from the federal spending bill, while Republicans refused to allow the increase in coronavirus payments to $2,000. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said in a letter to colleagues: ""House Democrats appear to be suffering from selective hearing."" While the haggling continues on Capitol Hill, the president is spending Christmas at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. A White House memo said he was working ""tirelessly"" with ""many meetings and calls"", though he was spotted at his golf course on Thursday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said the lower chamber would meet again next Monday to vote on the stimulus payments for Americans. This video can not be played Trump asks Congress to amend Covid aid bill On the same day, the House is also expected to vote on an unrelated, $740bn defence spending bill, which Mr Trump vetoed on Wednesday instead of signing into law. Lawmakers plan to override the president's veto and enact the legislation anyway, but to do so they need two-thirds of votes in both the House and Senate. Mr Trump is objecting to provisions in the defence bill that limit troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Europe and remove Confederate leaders' names from military bases. The $900bn coronavirus aid relief bill - with the larger budget bill rolled in - overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives and Senate on Monday but a day later Mr Trump issued an implied veto threat, describing the package in a video statement as a ""disgrace"" full of ""wasteful"" items. He baulked at the annual aid money for other countries in the federal budget, arguing that those funds should instead go to struggling Americans. Mr Trump's decision to bat the measure back to Capitol Hill stunned lawmakers since he has largely stayed out of negotiations for a coronavirus aid bill that had stalled since last July. His top economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, had proposed the $600 payments early this month, and many have questioned why the president waited until now to object. This video can not be played ""I'm not sure how we're going to survive"" The one-off payments of $600 and the federal jobless benefits are half the sum provided by the last major coronavirus aid bill in March, which contained $2.4tn in economic relief. Mr Trump's call for more generous one-off payments to Americans has found him in rare agreement with some liberal Democrats who are usually his sworn political foes. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: ""Glad to see the President is willing to support our legislation."" But many of the president's fellow Republicans are said to be dismayed that Democrats will now depict them as Scrooges for rejecting higher spending. On a conference call Wednesday, House Republicans said Mr Trump had thrown them under a bus, according to the Associated Press news agency. Georgia starts voting in pivotal senate battle Many of them now face the dilemma of choosing between the president and party. Though conservatives are protesting over the spiralling trillion-dollar US deficit, they and the president enacted tax cuts in 2017 that added to America's overdraft. The congressional gridlock comes amid runoff votes in Georgia for two Senate seats that will determine the balance of power in Washington next year. Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are fighting for their political lives in the 5 January special election. Both had backed the aid bill spurned by Mr Trump. If Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock can flip these two seats, their party will control all of Congress and the White House once President-elect Joe Biden takes office later next month.

"This video can not be played Queenâs Christmas Speech 2020: âYou are not aloneâ The Queen has used her Christmas Day message to reassure anyone struggling without friends and family this year that they ""are not alone"". She said what many people want ""for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand"" - but ""even on the darkest nights there is hope in the new dawn"". The 94-year-old praised acts of kindness, saying the pandemic ""brought us closer"" despite causing hardship. The Queen, like so many, is spending the day apart from her family. ""Remarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer,"" the monarch said in the broadcast, adding that the Royal Family has been ""inspired"" by people volunteering in their communities. ""In the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnificently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit."" How Covid-19 has left Royal fans 'disappointed' Queen spends Christmas apart from family Deepfake queen to give Channel 4 Christmas message She lamented that ""people of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals"", but said ""we need life to go on"". The Queen highlighted Diwali celebrations last month in Windsor - where she is spending Christmas with the Duke of Edinburgh for the first time in decades -  as an example of ""joyous moments of hope and unity despite social distancing"". ""Of course for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness - some mourning the loss of those dear to them and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all they really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand,"" she added. ""If you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers."" She gave particular thanks to young people, to frontline workers, and to ""good Samaritans [who] have emerged across society, showing care and respect for all"". The Queen made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey last month ""We continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that even on the darkest nights there is hope in the new dawn,"" she said. Referring to the centenary of the Unknown Warrior's burial in Westminster Abbey, she said: ""The Unknown Warrior was not exceptional, that's the point. He represents millions like him who, throughout our history, have put the lives of others above their own and will be doing so today. ""For me, this is a source of enduring hope in difficult and unpredictable times."" This year's message was recorded in mid-December with a pared-back film crew and in accordance with government guidance. She did not utter the words ""pandemic"", ""coronavirus"" or ""Covid-19"" but they were the dominant theme of this year's Christmas speech broadcast by the Queen. Her words conveyed three particular messages. She spoke of the gratitude owed to all those who'd ""risen magnificently to the challenges of the year"", in particular to young people, frontline workers and the ""amazing achievements of modern science."" She found hope in the actions of so many ""Good Samaritans"" who'd emerged across society to offer care. There was hope too from the example of the ""Unknown Warrior"" buried at Westminster Abbey a century ago. He symbolised selfless duty: a source of ""enduring hope"" the Queen said. And finally there was reassurance for all those who are mourning or missing friends or family. This was the most touching part of the broadcast. These were people who just wanted ""a hug or a squeeze of the hand"" the Queen said. That is not language she often uses in public. She added: ""Let the light of Christmas, the spirit of selflessness, love and above all, hope, guide us in the times ahead."" The Queen and Prince Philip, 99, have been living at Windsor Castle during the pandemic with a small household staff. It is thought to be the first year the couple have not spent Christmas at their Sandringham home since the mid-1980s. The Royal Family usually spends Christmas Day together, but will not visit each other this year because of coronavirus restrictions. The Queen also worshipped privately rather than attending a church service, as she usually does - in order, it is understood, to avoid crowds of well-wishers congregating. On Christmas Day, the Royal Family tweeted a video of St George's Chapel choir singing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During that time, her eldest child,Prince Charles, 72, contracted coronavirusand displayed mild symptoms. Palace sources also told the BBC thatthe Prince William tested positive in April- though Kensington Palace refused to comment officially. The royals have spent some time together during the pandemic.

In April, as the first wave of the pandemic saw people across the country told to stay at home,she vowed that the the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the virus. In a rallying message, she lamented the ""painful sense of separation from their loved ones"" that social distancing was causing people - but said it was ""the right thing to do"". In April, the Queen said: ""We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again"" The following month, in a poignant address to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, she saidpeople's response to the virus had filled empty streets with ""love"". In last year's Christmas speech, she described 2019 - which saw intense political debate over Brexit and a number of personal events affecting the Royal Family -as ""quite bumpy"". She said the path is never ""smooth"" but ""small steps"" can heal divisions. Channel 4's alternative Christmas message willbe delivered by a deepfake of the Queenthis year.

"This video can not be played A round-up of the Brexit trade agreement ""The clock is no longer ticking."" These were pretty much the first words out of the mouth of the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, as he announced the just sealed EU-UK trade and security agreement on Thursday. No more looming ""no-deal"" threats; no more almost painful uncertainty about future relations across the Channel. This was a historic moment. A fair and balanced deal for both sides, said the European Commission. But you'd have to have been half-asleep (or halfway through a bottle of eggnog, cava or pint of GlÃ¼hwein) to miss the stark difference in tone between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's triumphalist announcement on Thursday afternoon and the sombre statement by the European Commission. For Mr Johnson, 1 January heralds some kind of rebirth for the UK outside the EU. For Brussels, this whole negotiating process has been - as summed up today by Finland's Europe minister - a damage limitation exercise. Five thoughts on the Brexit trade deal Kuenssberg: Johnson gets the deal both sides wanted to achieve What just happened with Brexit? How EU leaders reacted to post-Brexit trade deal The 2016 Brexit vote, leading to the loss of such a key member state, was a huge slap in the face for the EU. Its aim since then has been to sign a deal with the UK that protects EU business and security interests - but not so advantageous as to tempt other member states to leave the bloc. French President Emmanuel Macron commented on Thursday that the EU was right to have remained ""steadfast and united"" since the Brexit vote. He said they could all now proudly look to the future instead. Anti-Brexit signs at the gates of Downing Street in London But this is by no means the end of the EU-UK conversation. The treaty must still be ratified. And it's not only the UK parliament that wants a peek. Spare a thought for the 27 ambassadors who represent EU member states in Brussels. They're being dragged to a meeting on Christmas morning with Mr Barnier to discuss the details of the deal. The text must be approved by EU capitals before the year's end. Each country has a veto, though they're not expected to use it. Mr Barnier and team kept them on board and in the loop every step of the way, throughout the negotiations. The same goes for the European Parliament. It's expected to ratify the deal early next year. Until that moment, the agreement will be adopted provisionally, as allowed under EU law. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces new deal between UK and EU The new year is when we start to find out what Brexit really means. We don't really know what it feels like yet, what impact it will have on all our lives. The transition period kept EU-UK relations pretty much the same in practical terms but that all ends on 31 December. A far cry from the ""friction-free"" trade deal once promised by former Prime Minister Theresa May, this is the ""hardest"" of Brexits - not the costly chaos of no deal at all - but nonetheless it means out of the EU's customs union and single market. There will be considerable non-tariff barriers from 2021. Remember, the UK is a service-based economy, yet this agreement hardly deals with services at all. UK financial services must wait, possibly for months yet, for the EU to decide unilaterally what access they can have to the single market. The UK also impatiently awaits a ruling from the EU on data adequacy - how free the flow of data can be between the two sides. Despite the relief expressed by a number of EU leaders on Thursday that this trade deal was finally agreed, the bloc begins its new relationship with the UK in quite a defensive, wary frame of mind. EU leaders have not forgotten the controversial clauses the UK government introduced into its Internal Market Bill this autumn, contravening the Brexit Divorce Deal, signed with them less than a year before. It was because of that, the EU said it pushed so hard for tough retaliation mechanisms in this trade deal - in case the UK doesn't keep to its part of the bargain (and vice versa, of course). Brussels' assumption is that the UK will be keen to diverge and yank away from the EU's gravitational pull as soon as it sees fit. It was quite a remarkable achievement of both negotiating teams that they managed to marry the two sides' very different priorities. For the government: to be able to say it had protected national sovereignty after Brexit, avoiding signing up to a new Brussels rule book in exchange for a trade deal. The EU's main focus was protecting the single market from what they feared could be unfair competition from UK businesses, aggressively undercutting their European rivals. Oven-ready and cooked to perfection? Rushed to completion in a record-breaking nine months, this deal clearly won't be faultless. All those devils in the 1,800 pages of detail, some allowing different interpretations on issues by both sides, will become apparent in the coming days and months. But frankly, neither the UK nor the EU would have completed the agreement if they hadn't felt they could sell it to their domestic audiences as a big win. And that is what they are now busy doing. On both sides of the Channel. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods - but we don't know all the details yet. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work.

"The Queen will not be making her annual trip to Sandringham this Christmas For the past 32 years the Queen and other members of the Royal Family have spent Christmas at her estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. But this year, because of the coronavirus, the Queen has chosen instead tocelebrate ""quietly""at Windsor Palace. What will this mean for the Christmas regulars who gather at Sandringham? This snap of the Royals in 2017 provided Karen Anvil with an income to carry out home renovations and help her daughter Karen Anvil and her daughter Rachel are regular Christmas Day visitors to church in Sandringham. Ms Anvil shot to fame three years ago after her mobile telephone snap of the 'Fab Four' - The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Sussex - was bought by agencies and used worldwide. She describes themoney she made from it as being ""like a lottery win"". Karen Anvil, with her daughter Rachel, captured images of the Royal Family used around the world Her good fortune was repeated in 2018 when she took and sold a photo of a pregnant Meghan. ""I would have liked to have gone this year but would probably have just got pictures of them in their face masks,"" says Ms Anvil. But she admits seeing the Royal Family at Sandringham this year would have brought some much needed ""normality"" to her life. Ms Anvil works as a nursing auxiliary at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where her daughter is also employed. She says they might volunteer to work Christmas Day instead. Super Royalist Mary Relph has spoken regularly with the Queen over the decades Mary Relph, from Shouldham in Norfolk, is one of those Royal fans who gets her Christmas Day started by joining the throngs hoping to catch a glimpse, a wave or a chat with the Queen and members of her family. She isknown to the Queen by her first name, which, for someone who is not an aristocrat, politician or celebrity, is no mean feat. Mrs Relph has been turning out each year to greet Her Majesty on Christmas morning since 1988. ""Ooh it's one of the biggest events Norfolk ever has, isn't it?"" she says. She is disappointed by the cancellation of this year's gathering, but thinks the Queen has set an example to others by not going to Sandringham. ""I wasn't expecting them to come, not really, not after all the trouble with the [Covid-19] virus,"" says Mrs Relph. ""I think she's wise. I think we sort of knew with events she wouldn't come."" For her Sandringham visits, Mrs Relph is usually accompanied either by a friend from Dereham or with a Glaswegian friend she made one year amongst the crowd. She says she normally gets her own ""spot"" from which she can watch and speak to members of the Royal Family. ""I'm one of the chosen few, I think, because I've been going for so many years,"" she says. ""I don't have to stand and queue at the gates like I used to. It's wonderful. ""We spoke to Kate last year and we always ask her about the children and what they're doing."" Princess Beatrice and Eugenie usually spend Christmas with the Queen Peter Gray, 61, and his wife Stella, 60, live on the Sandringham estate in the hamlet of Babingley. Turning out to watch the Royals has been part of their Christmas morning routine for the past eight years. ""It just makes our Christmas,"" says Mrs Gray. ""It's a good start to the day. We're up there by 07:00 GMT, take a flask, mince pies, sometimes brandy!"" Her husband Peter is a keen photographer and loves snapping the Royal Family. He says his relatives in Australia wait for him to post his photos online. ""The rest of the family are going to be disappointed not to get my Royal photos this year,"" says Mr Gray. ""We get there and start queuing, start talking to people from all around the world. It's not just about seeing the royals, it's about the people from China, Canada, Australia and the US too. ""We stand by the same place each year to ensure a good spot, by the gate, as they come through. They don't normally talk to you heading into church but they do afterwards."" Peter Gray captured the Duchess of Cornwall at a previous service Prince Philip and Prince Andrew among the crowds at Sandringham Mrs Gray says she has been a royal fan ""forever"". ""I've spoken to Camilla, she's come up and said 'Merry Christmas'. Prince William has come up and said 'hello', too,"" she says. ""Prince Andrew has come up and been err, 'what are you all doing here? You should be at home'. He's quite abrupt! ""I don't think he understands why we're all out there in the freezing cold wanting to look round and see him, but we enjoy it."" She says things will be ""different"" this year, and a ""bit strange"". ""I suppose there are people for whom the day is their whole lives,"" she says. ""It's certainly a big part of our Christmas Day. But we're realists and it is what it is. ""Maybe next year."" Up to 5,000 people turn out to greet the Royal Family every Christmas Day at Sandringham Also wondering how he will fill his Christmas morning is hair salon owner Tom Tokelove, 31, who lives in Dersingham, Norfolk, with his husband Ashley. The couple and their three poodles have spent the past four Christmases ""freezing"" outside St Mary Magdalene Church. ""Why? It's such a magical morning,"" says Tom Tokelove. ""Everybody is happy. ""Even if you're not a massive royalist, it brings everyone together and it's just some way of keeping some sort of tradition."" The couple start the day with a glass of champagne before walking the 20 minutes to the estate. ""Last year we left at seven in the morning just to make sure we got there in the front of the queue,"" he says. ""We really, really wanted to see Kate and Wills. Kate said 'good morning' to myself as she glided by, looking very elegant with the children, too. ""And Charles waved and said 'Merry Christmas'."" Tom Tokelove caught the Royals including Prince George walking from church to Sandringham House last Christmas The Tokeloves usually only stop to watch the Royal Family head into church. But last year they stayed on and joined in with the carols as the service was broadcast to those outside. ""It will be a much different dog walk this year - obviously there'll be no Royals about to celebrate with,"" says Mr Tokelove. ""[We'll] probably drink much more champagne in the morning and have a more relaxed day.""

"A post-Brexit deal has been agreed between the UK and the EU. The rules that will govern how both sides trade with each other in future - and so much more - have been outlined in hundreds of pages of dense legal text. It will be scrutinised to see who has given ground and in what areas. We don't have all the answers yet, but we do know that - despite this agreement - lots of things are going to change anyway. A new era begins on 1 January 2021, ending the relationship which has existed between the UK and the EU for nearly fifty years. In general, there will be more barriers between them. The UK will no longer be part of the EU's economic zone -the single market and the customs union- and that means there will be a lot more bureaucracy and delay for businesses and travellers crossing the border. The UK is introducinga new immigration systemwhich means that free movement of people to and from the EU comes to an end. EU citizens willno longer have the automatic right to settle in the UK, and British citizens will lose the automatic right to live, work and retire in the rest of Europe. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK will stop making annual budget contributions for membership of the EU, but it will continue to pay much smaller amounts as part of thefinancial settlement (or divorce bill)for a number of years. It will also have to pay for any access it wants to European programmes, in fields such as scientific research. This is not a normal trade agreement. Trade deals are designed to make trade easier and cheaper, by bringing countries closer together. This one is pushing the two sides further apart. It ends frictionless trade between the UK and its largest trading partner, creating extra costs. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Outside the customs union, on the other hand, the UK will be able to negotiate its own trade deals around the world. The government says this is one of the big benefits of Brexit - the UK will be more nimble, able to make its own sovereign decisions. But any gains will be limited.New deals- over the next few years - will not replace trade that will be lost with the EU. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts thatover the long term, the UK economy will be 4% smaller,externalwith a new trade deal - than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU. That's a bigger long term hit to the economy than the one caused by Covid-19. But with no deal at all, it would have been even bigger. Despite the limitations set by the clock, negotiators on both sides have done an incredible job in achieving so much in such a short time. Some people thought it couldn't be done. Agreements of this kind normally take years to negotiate. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But it isn't a particularly ambitious deal for neighbours that do so much trade with each other. Scope for closer cooperation was limited by the UK government's decision to break away from EU rules as much as possible. The UK's ambitions lie elsewhere. For three years after the 2016 referendum, arguments swirled in the UK about whether the country should pursue a soft or a hard form of Brexit. Both sides agree that this is about as hard a Brexit as you can get, while still having a deal. A softer form of Brexit - leaving the EU but staying in the single market, for example, like Norway - was debated in parliament but never attracted majority support. Boris Johnson campaigned in the 2019 general election on a harder form of Brexit and won. Earlier government promises that the UK would have 'exactly the same benefits' as it had inside the EU have not been delivered, and they never could have been. Northern Ireland will have adifferent relationship with the EU than the rest of the UKfrom 1 January, because it will remain in the EU single market for goods. That was part of the plan contained in theBrexit withdrawal agreementto keep the Irish land border between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) as open as it is now. Earlier this month EU and UK negotiators reached a separate agreement on how this will work in practice. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 Goods manufactured in Northern Ireland will continue to have seamless access to the EU, but as a result new bureaucracy will emerge within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There will be document and physical checks on some food supplies, for example (although a three month grace period will begin on 1 January for many traders, before new measures are applied in full). Pets being taken from Great Britain into Northern Ireland will also need an animal health certificate from a vet. And because Northern Ireland is being treated differently, this agreement could have longer term constitutional significance for the UK. Pro-independence politicians in Scotland will continue to ask why, if Northern Ireland can stay in parts of the single market, Scotland can't do the same. Just because a deal has been done, don't assume everything is settled. The UK is going to be negotiating with the EU for years to come, on a more or less constant basis. Resolving disputes as they arise will be a persistent focus, and a likely cause of tension. Arbitration systems will probably be tested to the limit. It's also worth remembering this deal is not just about trade. As the name suggests, it is a partnership agreement, involving all sorts of other issues such as road transport, aviation, climate change policy, and security cooperation. The UK will lose full access to a series of EU databases which police forces use on a constant basis - to check on things such as criminal records, fingerprints and lists of wanted or missing people. It won't lose access altogether, which would have happened without a deal. But security officials on both sides may well press for ways to improve cooperation in the future. The agreement on Northern Ireland will also come up for review in four years' time. So the talking isn't going to stop. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Royal Christmases are usually spent at Sandringham, but the Queen will stay at Windsor Castle this year The Queen will reflect on the hardships of the pandemic in her Christmas speech later, as she and the Duke of Edinburgh spend the day apart from their family. They will celebrate Christmas at Windsor Castle and not Sandringham, as is their usual tradition. The Royal Family usually spends the day together, but will not visit each other this year because of restrictions. The Queen will also forgo her usual church service and worship privately to avoid crowds, it is understood. Her Christmas Day speech will be broadcast at 15:00 GMT.

A quiet Christmas at home with no visits by the family. That's Christmas 2020 and the Royal Family are following the restrictions like people across the country. In their case, of course, the ""homes"" are rather grand. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are at Windsor Castle with a small number of staff. Other members of the Royal Family are at their homes: the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall in Gloucestershire: the Cambridges in Norfolk. For the Queen, there won't be the normal Christmas morning excursion to church, though she is expected to share a moment of Christmas worship in the private chapel inside the castle. No details about her Christmas speech have been made public in advance, but the focus of the broadcast will inevitably be the pandemic. On Christmas Day, the Royal Family tweeted a video of St George's Chapel choir singing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The leaders of the Church of England and the Catholic Church in England and Wales have reflected on the ""darkness"" of Covid-19  - as well as selfless and heroic responses to the pandemic. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby referred to a ""year of anxiety"" in his Christmas message. At Midnight Mass at Westminster Cathedral, Cardinal Vincent Nichols talked of a ""quiet heroism"". Despiteenhanced rules,communal acts of worship are being allowed in the UK. However, some churches have chosen to live-stream their Christmas Day services without a congregation. Midnight Mass at Westminster Cathedral is normally one of the highlights of the liturgical calendar but this year, the service was held online only and started at 22:00 GMT. In his sermon,,externalCardinal Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, said: ""In the darkness of this pandemic so many of our comfortable assumptions are being shaken. ""Here we are, celebrating Christmas, yet deprived of the greetings, hugs, kisses and handshakes that normally fill this day."" He said the pandemic had tested family bonds, and that some people in care homes and hospitals who longed to see loved ones ""fade away from sheer loneliness"". The Archbishop of Canterbury during the Christmas Day service at Canterbury Cathedral in Kent But Cardinal Nichols maintained that countless acts of kindness had ""penetrated the darkness"". ""Have we not seen these months of difficulty marked by countless acts of random kindness, quiet heroism, selfless service, remarkable community efforts, all directed towards those most in need?""

"The leaders of the Church of England and the Catholic Church in England and Wales have reflected on the ""darkness"" of Covid-19  - as well as selfless and heroic responses to the pandemic. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby referred to a ""year of anxiety"" in his Christmas message. At Midnight Mass at Westminster Cathedral, Cardinal Vincent Nichols talked of a ""quiet heroism"". Despiteenhanced rules,communal acts of worship are being allowed in the UK. However, some churches have chosen to live-stream their Christmas Day services without a congregation. Midnight Mass at Westminster Cathedral is normally one of the highlights of the liturgical calendar but this year, the service was held online only and started at 22:00 GMT. In his sermon,,externalCardinal Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, said: ""In the darkness of this pandemic so many of our comfortable assumptions are being shaken. ""Here we are, celebrating Christmas, yet deprived of the greetings, hugs, kisses and handshakes that normally fill this day."" He said the pandemic had tested family bonds, and that some people in care homes and hospitals who longed to see loved ones ""fade away from sheer loneliness"". The Archbishop of Canterbury during the Christmas Day service at Canterbury Cathedral in Kent But Cardinal Nichols maintained that countless acts of kindness had ""penetrated the darkness"".

"King Felipe VI delivered the traditional annual speech from Zarzuela Palace in Madrid Spain's King Felipe VI made a veiled allusion to his self-exiled father's scandals in his Christmas address, saying ""ethics are above family ties"". It was a small interlude in a speech centring on the coronavirus pandemic, where the king thanked health workers. The former king, Juan Carlos, fled to Abu Dhabi in August as corruption allegations mounted. Juan Carlos has denied wrongdoing but his departure heightened debate about the future of the country's monarchy. There has been much speculation as to whether Felipe VI would reference the controversy in the annual speech. According to El Pais newspaper, many felt it would be impossible to ignore in an end-of-year address, though no-one was sure how he would go about acknowledging the ""elephant in the room"". Spain's ex-king Juan Carlos confirmed to be in UAE Spain's monarchy shaken by ex-king's Swiss fortune The king, his lover - and the elephant in the palace Though he did not specifically mention his father, many felt the connection was clear. ""In 2014, during my induction into parliament, I referred to the moral and ethical principles that citizens expect of us. Principles that apply to us all without exception, and that prevail over all considerations, whatever their nature may be, personal or familial,"" said the monarch. He recognised that many families were dealing with grief and spending the holidays apart. And he spoke of a ""great national effort"" was needed to overcome the difficulties Covid-19 had caused. He ruled for close to 40 years, before handing power to his son in 2014. This decision came after a corruption investigation involving his daughter's husband and a controversial elephant-hunting holiday in the middle of Spain's financial crisis. In June this year, Spain's Supreme Court launched a further investigation into Juan Carlos's alleged involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, after the ex-king lost his immunity from prosecution following his abdication. Then in August, the ex-king made the shock announcement that he was leaving Spain. He has denied all allegations against him and said he would be available for interviews with prosecutors.

"All airline passengers arriving in the US from the UK are to be required to test negative for Covid-19 within 72 hours of departure amid concerns about a new coronavirus variant. From 28 December travellers will need to provide written documentation of their test result to airlines. Other countries have shut their borders to UK flights because of the variant. But its rapid spread has also led to stricter rules in the UK, including a ban on overseas trips for many Britons. And US airlines have drastically scaled back flying to the UK and Europe, after the entry of most foreign nationals was suspended at the start of the pandemic. Health officials say there is no evidence the new variant is more deadly, or would react differently to vaccines, but it is proving to be up to 70% more transmissible. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? The decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to require testing came afterNew York City introduced quarantine rules for international travellersin response to the variant. The CDC said passengers must test negative via either a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or an antigen test.

"Intensive-care nurse MarÃ­a Irene Ramirez said she wanted to be vaccinated so she could ""stay in the line of fire"" A Mexican nurse became the first person in Latin America to receive a coronavirus jab when her country began its vaccination programme on Thursday. Mexico has received an initial shipment of 3,000 doses of the US-German Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The country has one of the highest pandemic death tolls in the world, behind only the US, Brazil and India. A short time later on Thursday, Chile and Costa Rica also began administering Pfizer-BioNTech. Covid vaccine approved for use in EU's 27 states New coronavirus variant: What do we know? In Costa Rica, the first doses of Pfizer were given to a pair of senior citizens, including 91-year-old Elizabeth Castillo Argentina also plans to start inoculations in the next few days but has chosen the Russian-produced vaccine Sputnik V for its initial phase, with a delivery of 300,000 doses arriving in the capital Buenos Aires on Thursday morning. Brazil, which has recorded the highest number of deaths in the region, is not due to start until mid-February despite a recent surge in the number of cases. President Jair Bolsonaro says he is not planning to be inoculated. He believes he has developed immunity against coronavirus as he tested positive earlier this year. In Mexico, MarÃ­a Irene Ramirez, 59, the head of the intensive care unit at Ruben LeÃ±ero Hospital in Mexico City, was the first to volunteer to be vaccinated. ""We are afraid, but we have to move on... and I want to stay in the line of fire,"" she said afterwards, according to El Universal newspaper. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? The first 3,000 doses - of 34 million purchased - arrived in Mexico on Wednesday from Belgium, where they are being manufactured. Footage of the launch was broadcast during President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's televised morning news conference. The Mexican government says it wants to vaccinate all health workers fighting the pandemic by the end of the first quarter of 2021. The country has recorded more than 1.3 million infections so far, with at least 121,000 Covid-related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins university. In Chile, President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era (centre-right) personally supervised the delivery of the first batch of the Pfizer vaccine Chile has had nearly 600,000 confirmed cases and more than 16,300 deaths; Costa Rica - nearly 163,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths; and Argentina - nearly 1.6 million cases and more than 42,300 deaths. Chile's President, Sebastian PiÃ±era, described the start of his country's national coronavirus immunisation programme as a moment of hope and excitement. Argentina's health authorities earlier this week had given Russia's Sputnik V vaccine ""emergency"" authorisation - the first Latin American nation to do so. On Thursday, the first 300,000 doses were flown in from Moscow to Buenos Aires. In Argentina, police escorted the trucks carrying Russia's Sputnik V vaccine Argentine President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez has pledged to get a Sputnik V jab to prove the vaccine is safe after criticism in the West and in Russia itself that it was registered even before large-scale clinical trials. ""There was some scepticism, but as we always say we do not want to get entangled in any type of discussion other than preserving the health of Argentines,"" said cabinet minister Santiago Cafiero. Russia has rejected the criticism, accusing the West of attempting to get rid of a rival on the world's lucrative vaccine market. Argentina has so far reported more than 1.5 million infections, with more than 42,000 deaths. LATEST GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest?

"Ivry Gitlis (centre) carried on playing well into his 90s Celebrated Israeli violinist Ivry Gitlis has died in Paris aged 98, his family has said. A hugely charismatic figure with a passion for experimentation, Gitlis has been described as one of the modern greats of classical music. He played with the world's finest orchestras but was said to be equally at home performing with rock stars and jazz virtuosos. In 1955,  he became the first Israeli musician to play in the Soviet Union. Gitlis was also a staunch advocate of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He was born in 1922 in Haifa to Jewish parents who had left what is now Ukraine. He first started playing the violin when he was six years old. ""How did I start playing? I simply wanted a violin, even though I was so small that I couldn't even play it. But I decided. I chose violin, and at age six I began,"" Gitlis was quoted as saying by AFP news agency.

A quiet Christmas at home with no visits by the family. That's Christmas 2020 and the Royal Family are following the restrictions like people across the country. In their case, of course, the ""homes"" are rather grand. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are at Windsor Castle with a small number of staff. Other members of the Royal Family are at their homes: the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall in Gloucestershire: the Cambridges in Norfolk. For the Queen, there won't be the normal Christmas morning excursion to church, though she is expected to share a moment of Christmas worship in the private chapel inside the castle. No details about her Christmas speech have been made public in advance, but the focus of the broadcast will inevitably be the pandemic. On Christmas Day, the Royal Family tweeted a video of St George's Chapel choir singing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Queen's address will mark the end of a year that saw her go for seven months- March to October - without carrying out public engagementsoutside of a royal residence. During that time, her son, thePrince of Wales, 72, contracted coronavirusand displayed mild symptoms. Palace sources also told the BBC thatthe Duke of Cambridge tested positive in April- though Kensington Palace refused to comment officially. The Queen spoke animatedly to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at a socially-distanced carol concert this month The royals have spent some time together during the pandemic. The Queen and several other senior royalsattended a socially-distanced Christmas carol concert at Windsor Castle this month. She was also joined by family members ata scaled-back Remembrance Sunday serviceat the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall in November. Streets not empty as filled with love, says Queen Queen: 'We will succeed' in fight against virus The Christmas broadcast will be the Queen's third televised address this year, which is unusual for the monarch. In April, as the first wave of the pandemic saw people across the country told to stay at home,she vowed that the the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the virus. In a rallying message, she lamented the ""painful sense of separation from their loved ones"" that social distancing was causing people - but said it was ""the right thing to do"". In April, the Queen said: ""We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again"" The following month, in a poignant address to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, she saidpeople's response to the virus had filled empty streets with ""love"". In last year's Christmas speech, she described 2019 - which saw intense political debate over Brexit and a number of personal events affecting the Royal Family -as ""quite bumpy"". She said the path is never ""smooth"" but ""small steps"" can heal divisions. This year's message will be broadcast on the BBC and ITV. Shortly afterwards, Channel 4 will air its alternative Christmas message - which willbe delivered by a deepfake of the Queen.

"European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier attending a meeting in Brussels EU ambassadors have received a Christmas Day briefing on the post-Brexit trade deal reached with the UK. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier updated them on the agreement, reached after months of fraught talks on fishing rights and business rules. MPs will vote on the deal in Parliament on 30 December, with the UK set to exit existing trading rules on 31 December. The 1,246-page document, which includes about 800 pages of annexes and footnotes, has been seen by the BBC. A34-page summary of the deal has been published,externalon the UK government's website, but not the complete text. What will happen to EU health insurance cards? What just happened with Brexit? Labour said it was a ""thin agreement"" but they would back it as the only alternative to no deal, meaning it should win approval. The European Parliament needs to ratify the deal but it is unlikely to do so until the new year, meaning its application will formally be provisional until then. European ambassadors during the briefing of European Union member states in Brussels on 25 December Sebastian Fischer, a spokesman for the German presidency of the Council of the EU, joked ahead of the EU diplomats' meeting that he was looking forward to it ""because nothing is more fun than to celebrate Christmas among socially distanced colleagues"". Meanwhile, French Europe minister Clement Beaune said it was a ""good agreement"", adding that the EU had not accepted a deal ""at all costs"". In aChristmas video message, posted on Twitter,externalon Thursday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson brandished a draft copy of the document. Boris Johnson held up a draft of the Brexit deal in a video published by No 10 He said: ""Tonight, on Christmas Eve, I have a small present for anyone who may be looking for something to read in that sleepy post-Christmas lunch moment, and here it is, tidings, glad tidings of great joy because this is a deal. ""A deal to give certainty to business, travellers, and all investors in our country from January 1. A deal with our friends and partners in the EU."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the agreement as ""fair"" and ""balanced"", saying it was now ""time to turn the page and look to the future"". The UK ""remains a trusted partner,"" she added. Struck four and a half years after the UK voted to leave the EU, the deal will define the future relationship for decades. This video can not be played A round-up of the Brexit trade agreement According to the text of the deal, those issued with aEuropean Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before the end of 2020 can use it before its expiry date,after which, the UK will issue a new card - called the UK Global Health Insurance Card. Similar to the EHIC - which entitles people to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in any EU country, or in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - the new card will cover chronic or existing illnesses and routine maternity care as well as emergencies. The agreement says any specialised treatment, such as dialysis or cancer treatment, ""must be subject to a prior agreement between the insured person and the unit providing the treatment"" to ensure the treatment is available. Meanwhile, goods will continue to be traded free of tariffs and quotas and there will be independent arbitration to resolve future disputes. It will mean big changes for business, with the UK and EU forming two separate markets, and the end of free movement. Five thoughts on the Brexit trade deal How EU leaders reacted to post-Brexit trade deal But it will have come as a major relief to many British businesses, already reeling from the impact of coronavirus, who feared disruption at the borders and the imposition of tariffs, or taxes on imports. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who campaigned against Brexit - said the deal did not provide adequate protections for jobs, manufacturing, financial services or workplace rights and was ""not the deal the government promised"". But with no time left to renegotiate, the only choice was between ""this deal or no deal,"" he added. Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said his party needed to see the full text, but would not support a ""bad deal"". Michel Barnier leaves the EU Commission for a meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee in Brussels, Belgium, on 25 December Parliament will sit on 30 December to vote on the trade deal. Dr Joelle Grogan, senior lecturer in law at Middlesex University London, told BBC News: ""To put this in real context, if I spend the next five days before Parliament is recalled on Wednesday spending 10 hours a day just reading that document, I will have a maximum of two minutes and 30 seconds to fully understand, analyse and comment on it."" ""The clock is no longer ticking."" These were pretty much the first words out of the mouth of the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, as he announced the just sealed EU-UK trade and security agreement on Thursday. No more looming ""no-deal"" threats; no more almost painful uncertainty about future relations across the Channel. This was a historic moment. A fair and balanced deal for both sides, said the European Commission. But you'd have to have been half-asleep (or halfway through a bottle of eggnog, cava or pint of GlÃ¼hwein) to miss the stark difference in tone between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's triumphalist announcement on Thursday afternoon and the sombre statement by the European Commission. Read more from Katya. At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the agreement would ""protect jobs across this country"". He said the UK had not got all it wanted on financial services, a vital part of the UK economy, but insisted the deal was ""nonetheless going to enable our dynamic City of London to get on and prosper as never before"". A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods - but we don't know all the details yet. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. What happens next with Brexit? The prime minister also acknowledged he had been forced to give ground on his demands on fishing. Fishing makes up 0.12% of the UK's economy but the negotiations went down to the wire over what EU boats were allowed to catch in UK waters. In future, 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet, over a period of five-and-a-half years. Barrie Deas, the head of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said ""significant concessions"" meant there would be ""a lot of disappointed and frustrated fishermen"". Brexit: Firms âneed guidanceâ to keep goods moving Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI What the PM's mistake tells us about our future Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said fishing got a ""bad deal"",adding: ""Brexit is happening against Scotland's will... It's time to chart our own future as an independent, European nation."" Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford said a deal was better than no dealbut said it was ""thin"" and not what Wales was promised. The deal also means that,except for Northern Ireland,the UKwill no longer participate in the Erasmus student exchange scheme.Mr Johnson said it was being replaced with the Turing Scheme, which will include universities outside the EU. In another development following the deal announcement, the UK Mission to the EU said people with a driving licence issued in the UK would not need to use an International Drivers Licence in the EU.

"Intensive-care nurse MarÃ­a Irene Ramirez said she wanted to be vaccinated so she could ""stay in the line of fire"" A Mexican nurse became the first person in Latin America to receive a coronavirus jab when her country began its vaccination programme on Thursday. Mexico has received an initial shipment of 3,000 doses of the US-German Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The country has one of the highest pandemic death tolls in the world, behind only the US, Brazil and India. A short time later on Thursday, Chile and Costa Rica also began administering Pfizer-BioNTech. Covid vaccine approved for use in EU's 27 states New coronavirus variant: What do we know? In Costa Rica, the first doses of Pfizer were given to a pair of senior citizens, including 91-year-old Elizabeth Castillo Argentina also plans to start inoculations in the next few days but has chosen the Russian-produced vaccine Sputnik V for its initial phase, with a delivery of 300,000 doses arriving in the capital Buenos Aires on Thursday morning. Brazil, which has recorded the highest number of deaths in the region, is not due to start until mid-February despite a recent surge in the number of cases. President Jair Bolsonaro says he is not planning to be inoculated. He believes he has developed immunity against coronavirus as he tested positive earlier this year. In Mexico, MarÃ­a Irene Ramirez, 59, the head of the intensive care unit at Ruben LeÃ±ero Hospital in Mexico City, was the first to volunteer to be vaccinated. ""We are afraid, but we have to move on... and I want to stay in the line of fire,"" she said afterwards, according to El Universal newspaper. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? The first 3,000 doses - of 34 million purchased - arrived in Mexico on Wednesday from Belgium, where they are being manufactured. Footage of the launch was broadcast during President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's televised morning news conference. The Mexican government says it wants to vaccinate all health workers fighting the pandemic by the end of the first quarter of 2021. The country has recorded more than 1.3 million infections so far, with at least 121,000 Covid-related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins university. In Chile, President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era (centre-right) personally supervised the delivery of the first batch of the Pfizer vaccine Chile has had nearly 600,000 confirmed cases and more than 16,300 deaths; Costa Rica - nearly 163,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths; and Argentina - nearly 1.6 million cases and more than 42,300 deaths. Chile's President, Sebastian PiÃ±era, described the start of his country's national coronavirus immunisation programme as a moment of hope and excitement. Argentina's health authorities earlier this week had given Russia's Sputnik V vaccine ""emergency"" authorisation - the first Latin American nation to do so. On Thursday, the first 300,000 doses were flown in from Moscow to Buenos Aires. In Argentina, police escorted the trucks carrying Russia's Sputnik V vaccine Argentine President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez has pledged to get a Sputnik V jab to prove the vaccine is safe after criticism in the West and in Russia itself that it was registered even before large-scale clinical trials. ""There was some scepticism, but as we always say we do not want to get entangled in any type of discussion other than preserving the health of Argentines,"" said cabinet minister Santiago Cafiero. Russia has rejected the criticism, accusing the West of attempting to get rid of a rival on the world's lucrative vaccine market. Argentina has so far reported more than 1.5 million infections, with more than 42,000 deaths. LATEST GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest?

"Businesses have given a relieved welcome to the Brexit trade deal, but warned there was more work to be done. In a statement, Number 10 said: ""The deal is fantastic news for businesses in every part of the UK."" But Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said ""the clock is still very much ticking"" for firms and called for guidance. The CBI called for urgent confirmation of grace periods to give firms time to adapt to new rules from  1 January. ""We need to ensure we keep goods moving across borders,"" said Tony Danker, CBI director-general. He said the deal ""will come as a huge relief to British business at a time when resilience is at an all-time low"". ""But coming so late in the day, it is vital that both sides take instant steps to keep trade moving and services flowing while firms adjust."" Mr Geldart echoed the CBI's concerns and said digesting the practical changes required and adapting ""in the middle of a pandemic and the festive season, while border disruptions continue, is a huge ask"" for firms. After a last-minute titanic struggle over the economic minnow that is fish, a deal has finally been landed. The relief of avoiding no-deal is the perfect Christmas present for UK business. Having avoided what they considered the calamity of no-deal, minds will now turn to the detail in nearly 2,000 pages of text. And those who do business with the EU will not have long to peruse it. Even though a deal has been done, UK traders face a new raft of paperwork and cost. More than 200 million additional customs forms will need completing at a cost of more than Â£7bn a year. Haulage companies warn that many businesses are not ready for this new normal. That is perhaps understandable when you consider they have had several previous false alarms when they've stockpiled for no reason. They've been dealing with the worst health and economic disaster in living memory and have had precious little detail on exactly what they are facing until the very last minute. The elephant not in the room and barely mentioned in the deal is services. There is no automatic access to a market worth Â£100bn to UK firms last year. A huge sigh of relief, yes - but any celebrations may be brief. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, urged the EU and UK governments to work to implement the new arrangement as soon as possible. ""They must ensure there are no tariffs from Day One and find new ways to reduce the checks and red tape that we'll see from 1 January,"" she said. Brexit trade deal is done, says UK government Stock markets and pound rise ahead of Brexit deal ""Businesses are undoubtedly relieved to hear that a deal has been agreed and will be hoping that it will now be ratified by respective parliaments across Europe,' said Richard Burge, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ""However, in on-the-ground terms for business, there are likely to still be questions unanswered and operational detail missing."" Business group Logistics UK was optimistic about the deal. ""It removes the risk of tariffs being placed on almost every item imported from the EU, which would have raised prices and slowed the rate of economic growth,"" said Elizabeth de Jong, the group's policy director. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady was scathing. ""This deal is better than nothing, but not by much. It won't protect jobs and puts hard-won workers' rights on the line."" She called on the prime minister to ""make good on his promise to level up Britain"", saying: ""He needs to act fast. There can be no more pointing the finger at the EU."" Concerns were raised over the fact that financial services did not form part of the trade deal. ""The agreement should be less criticised for what it contains than what it does not contain - namely the future of financial services,"" said Daniel Pinto, chief executive of Stanhope Capital Group. He said the City now needed to take its future in its own hands. ""Post-Brexit, it should lure international companies and revamp its regulatory framework to make it much more flexible."" Nicolas Mackel, chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, said the deal was positive news for financial services. ""While financial services has never been covered by the trade negotiations, this vital breakthrough bodes well for the conversations happening around equivalences and delegation,"" he said. ""Until now, the souring negotiating mood on the future relationship was putting these important financial footbridges across the Channel under great pressure and there was a risk of collapse.""

"This is a political victory for the prime minister with up front control ""taken back"" in a deal struck in a very short time. In economic terms, it prevents the equivalent of a low level tariff trade war with our biggest trading partner breaking out, in the middle of an historic recession and health crisis. The UK has stayed in a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Russia, as Vote Leave promised ahead of the referendum. But his manifest error in declaring there are ""no non-tariff barriers"" for trade with the EU had business leaders falling off their chairs. This is patently not the case. The government has entire websites informing the public and businesses of tens of millions of new customs declarations, export health checks, regulatory checks, rules of origin checks, conformity assessments. But while we wait for 2,000 pages of legal detail, that quote might help both explain a lot about the last four years, and map out some rocky moments ahead. It is possible that the prime minister has a different definition of what the phrase means. He seemed, when questioned to confuse them with technical standards for plugs. But any government confusion about this is about to meet a brick wall of reality from January. Industries are having to replicate regulatory processes for the UK market that previously existed only for the EU, doubling the cost. The deal mitigates the impact of some of this. But there is no precedent for the avalanche of new trade barriers that is coming. As retailers have said ""it is the biggest imposition of red tape in 50 years"". More than that, not only will those barriers now exist between the UK and EU, but some will also now occur within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as the news about seed potatoes shows. The government indeed is currently trying to advertise to thousands of business that these changes need to be prepared for, and urgently so. Failure to do so, still risks problematic congestion on key freight routes. But it also shows up the strategy of negotiators. Typically they carve up into defensive asks, where you manage your trade partners' access to your markets, and demand offensive asks about your access to their markets. The UK had few offensive asks. This was not a typical trade deal. For the UK, this was a means through which to establish regulatory independence, not to further share it and therefore increase trade, by reducing barriers. Details really matter here. A key question will be whether the most important exports qualify for tariff free status. The government claims a win here. The car companies are the ones best placed to judge that. The EU was playing hardball on this issue, even against the wishes of its own carmakers. Certainly, it has rejected the UK wish to count Japanese and Turkish parts as effectively ""made in Britain"". Accepting that means that there will be new trade barriers with the EU, though thankfully not actual tariffs. The challenge really is about whether the new freedoms the prime minister has won, can help more than make up for more trade friction with what is currently our main market. It means significant change, winners and losers. It means the government needs a proper strategic economic plan. This deal makes that process easier at an already challenging time. But it does not eliminate the economic challenge from this political win. Firms warn 'clock is ticking' to keep goods moving What trade deals has the UK done so far?

"A post-Brexit deal has been agreed between the UK and the EU. The rules that will govern how both sides trade with each other in future - and so much more - have been outlined in hundreds of pages of dense legal text. It will be scrutinised to see who has given ground and in what areas. We don't have all the answers yet, but we do know that - despite this agreement - lots of things are going to change anyway. A new era begins on 1 January 2021, ending the relationship which has existed between the UK and the EU for nearly fifty years. In general, there will be more barriers between them. The UK will no longer be part of the EU's economic zone -the single market and the customs union- and that means there will be a lot more bureaucracy and delay for businesses and travellers crossing the border. The UK is introducinga new immigration systemwhich means that free movement of people to and from the EU comes to an end. EU citizens willno longer have the automatic right to settle in the UK, and British citizens will lose the automatic right to live, work and retire in the rest of Europe. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK will stop making annual budget contributions for membership of the EU, but it will continue to pay much smaller amounts as part of thefinancial settlement (or divorce bill)for a number of years. It will also have to pay for any access it wants to European programmes, in fields such as scientific research. This is not a normal trade agreement. Trade deals are designed to make trade easier and cheaper, by bringing countries closer together. This one is pushing the two sides further apart. It ends frictionless trade between the UK and its largest trading partner, creating extra costs. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Outside the customs union, on the other hand, the UK will be able to negotiate its own trade deals around the world. The government says this is one of the big benefits of Brexit - the UK will be more nimble, able to make its own sovereign decisions. But any gains will be limited.New deals- over the next few years - will not replace trade that will be lost with the EU. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts thatover the long term, the UK economy will be 4% smaller,externalwith a new trade deal - than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU. That's a bigger long term hit to the economy than the one caused by Covid-19. But with no deal at all, it would have been even bigger. Despite the limitations set by the clock, negotiators on both sides have done an incredible job in achieving so much in such a short time. Some people thought it couldn't be done. Agreements of this kind normally take years to negotiate. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But it isn't a particularly ambitious deal for neighbours that do so much trade with each other. Scope for closer cooperation was limited by the UK government's decision to break away from EU rules as much as possible. The UK's ambitions lie elsewhere. For three years after the 2016 referendum, arguments swirled in the UK about whether the country should pursue a soft or a hard form of Brexit. Both sides agree that this is about as hard a Brexit as you can get, while still having a deal. A softer form of Brexit - leaving the EU but staying in the single market, for example, like Norway - was debated in parliament but never attracted majority support. Boris Johnson campaigned in the 2019 general election on a harder form of Brexit and won. Earlier government promises that the UK would have 'exactly the same benefits' as it had inside the EU have not been delivered, and they never could have been. Northern Ireland will have adifferent relationship with the EU than the rest of the UKfrom 1 January, because it will remain in the EU single market for goods. That was part of the plan contained in theBrexit withdrawal agreementto keep the Irish land border between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) as open as it is now. Earlier this month EU and UK negotiators reached a separate agreement on how this will work in practice. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 Goods manufactured in Northern Ireland will continue to have seamless access to the EU, but as a result new bureaucracy will emerge within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There will be document and physical checks on some food supplies, for example (although a three month grace period will begin on 1 January for many traders, before new measures are applied in full). Pets being taken from Great Britain into Northern Ireland will also need an animal health certificate from a vet. And because Northern Ireland is being treated differently, this agreement could have longer term constitutional significance for the UK. Pro-independence politicians in Scotland will continue to ask why, if Northern Ireland can stay in parts of the single market, Scotland can't do the same. Just because a deal has been done, don't assume everything is settled. The UK is going to be negotiating with the EU for years to come, on a more or less constant basis. Resolving disputes as they arise will be a persistent focus, and a likely cause of tension. Arbitration systems will probably be tested to the limit. It's also worth remembering this deal is not just about trade. As the name suggests, it is a partnership agreement, involving all sorts of other issues such as road transport, aviation, climate change policy, and security cooperation. The UK will lose full access to a series of EU databases which police forces use on a constant basis - to check on things such as criminal records, fingerprints and lists of wanted or missing people. It won't lose access altogether, which would have happened without a deal. But security officials on both sides may well press for ways to improve cooperation in the future. The agreement on Northern Ireland will also come up for review in four years' time. So the talking isn't going to stop. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

"This video can not be played Up to 10 sperm whales have been stranded on the East Yorkshire coast Ten sperm whales found washed up on the North Sea coast have died. The pod was first spotted on a beach between Tunstall and Withernsea, near Hull, at about 08:30 GMT. Members of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) said poor weather conditions and the size of the whales meant it was impossible to save them. A spokesperson said the young whales were ""in very poor nutritional condition"" and had most likely suffered a ""navigation error"". They rarely survive long once stranded, the group said. The BDMLR has been involved in the rescue of marine wildlife since its formation in 1988 According to the BDMLR the size of the sperm whales - which can reach 65ft (20m) in length and weigh up to 80 tonnes - meant there were no safe methods for lifting and moving them. A member of the public called 999 to report the stranding, and the coastguard was despatched to the scene. Ch Supt Darren Downs, of Humberside Police, urged people to stay away from the area ""to allow teams from HM Coastguard to manage what is an extremely distressing scene"". He warned that gathering in groups posed a risk of spreading Covid-19. Marine expert Robin Petch said younger males can end up ""confused in shallower water off the east coast"" Robin Petch, a marine expert and Sea Watch Foundation ambassador, said: ""Sperm whales are a species that shouldn't come into this part of the North Sea, but a few come down that way. ""They are a deep-water animal that feed on squid and dive in the deep waters of the continental shelf. Often younger males can end up confused in the shallower water off the east coast. ""Once they are ashore, chances of survival are very slim, none of the rescue equipment can deal with whales that big. ""The loss of a large group, probably of young males, is catastrophic,"" Mr Petch added.
