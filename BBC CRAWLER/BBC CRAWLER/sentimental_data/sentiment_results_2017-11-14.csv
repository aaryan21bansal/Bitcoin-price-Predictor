"This video can not be played What's going on with the EU Withdrawal Bill? Several Tory MPs have joined Labour in demanding Theresa May withdraw a key Brexit legislation amendment to set the exact time of EU departure in law. Ministers say being ""crystal clear"" about when the UK will leave on 29 March 2019 will give maximum certainty. But ex-chancellor Ken Clarke said the move was ""silly"" while Dominic Grieve said it would ""fetter"" ministers' hands if talks dragged on to the last minute. Labour has branded it a ""gimmick"" and said it will vote against it. The row came as MPs began debating the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill in depth for the first time, a crucial piece of legislation paving the way for the UK's withdrawal by essentially copying all EU law into UK law. Tuesday's marathon eight-hour debate is the first of eight sessions over the next month in which MPs will pore over the details of the government's Brexit strategy and seek changes. The government saw off the first challenge to the bill as Plaid Cymru's call for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly to give their consent before the 1972 European Communities Act - which paved the way for the UK to originally join the then European Economic Community - can be repealed was defeated by 318 to 52 votes. BBC Parliament Live: MPs examine EU Bill Six people who will shape the Brexit battle Brexit: All you need to know Sturgeon talks with May 'constructive' A government amendment to enshrine the Brexit date and time - 23:00 GMT on 29 March  2019 - in law, announced by Mrs May last Friday, will not be debated until the final day of the committee stage next month. But it dominated the early skirmishes in the Commons as Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said setting a date in law was a ""desperate gimmick"" that was ""about party management not the national interest"". Labour says it is a question of how, not if, the UK leaves the EU that matters ""The government's amendments to their own Bill would stand in the way of an orderly transition and increase the chance of Britain crashing out of Europe without an agreement,"" the shadow Brexit secretary said. ""Theresa May should stop pandering to the 'no deal' enthusiasts in her own party and withdraw these amendments."" What is happening on Tuesday: The EU Withdrawal Bill is entering its Committee stage - meaning MPs will scrutinise it line-by-line First up is a four hour debate on the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act, the legislation that took Britain into the EU, or the EEC as it was then called MPs could discuss a call for the UK to stay in the EU until a new treaty has been signed on its future relationship Another amendment that has support is one that would give the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a bigger say About 7pm: Four hours of debate on how to interpret 40 years of accumulated EU law in UK law The future status of the European Court of Justice, which will cease to set UK laws on Brexit day, is also up for debate MPs are due to vote at about 7pm and 11pm but the government is not expected to be defeated at this stage A further seven days of debate have been scheduled in the run-up to Christmas, with the second day, on Wednesday, expected to include Labour's calls for guarantees on workers' rights and the environment. But former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve said that fixing the precise time of withdrawal at this stage would ""fetter"" the government's hands if negotiations dragged on longer than expected and the process needed to be extended in order to reach an agreement. Describing it as a ""mad"" idea that had not been discussed by the cabinet, he said it had been ""accompanied by blood-curdling threats that anyone who might stand in its way was somehow betraying the country's destiny"". ""I am afraid I am just not prepared to go along with it,"" he told MPs. And former chancellor Ken Clarke, the only Tory to vote against triggering Brexit, condemned what he said were ""silly amendments thrown out"" solely to get positive coverage in Brexit-supporting newspapers. This video can not be played Field: 'I've always bought my houses' This video can not be played Ken Clarke attacks government over Brexit bill Labour's Frank Field said he agreed with the need for a deadline, saying he had never taken on a job without a start date or bought a house without knowing when he would take possession. He agreed to withdraw his own amendment, specifying a date but not a precise hour of departure, after Brexit minister Steve Baker warned of ""legal chaos"" if the issue of timing was not ""put to rest"". ""The government wants this bill to provide as much certainty as possible,"" Mr Baker added. ""We recognise the importance of being crystal clear on the setting of exit day."" A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill Sturgeon talks with May 'constructive' Parliament to get vote on final Brexit deal Why Davis's Brexit vote announcement matters Ministers say the main aim of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill is to copy across EU rules into domestic UK law to ensure a smooth transition on the day after Brexit but critics say it is a power grab by the government which will allow ministers to change laws and regulations without going through Parliament first. Most MPs say they accept that Britain is leaving the EU but some are expected to use the debates to fight against what they call a ""hard Brexit"" where the UK leaves without a trade deal. This video can not be played Davis: Parliament will be given time to debate, scrutinise and vote on the final deal with the EU MPs have tabled more than 470 amendments - running to 186 pages - for changes they want to see before the Brexit bill is passed into law by both the Commons and the Lords. The government is not thought to be facing the serious prospect of defeat until next month, with a small group of about 10 Conservative rebels reportedly plotting with Labour and other opposition parties. MPs were told on Monday they would be able to debate and vote on any agreement negotiated with the EU by the government as the Brexit deal would have to become law via an Act of Parliament. But Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK would still leave the EU on 29 March 2019, whether MPs backed or rejected the deal - making MPs' vote a take-it-or-leave-it one on the Brexit deal, rather than one which could either halt Brexit or have the deal renegotiated. Speaking in the Commons, the SNP's Stephen Gethins said MPs were being offered a choice between a ""really bad deal and a really, really bad deal"" which he said was ""no choice at all"".

"Ministers have seen off challenges to their authority on the first of eight days of scrutiny of a key Brexit bill. MPs backed plans to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, by 318 votes to 68. Calls for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to have a veto over the process were rejected by 318 votes to 52. But several Tories criticised plans to specify an exact date for Brexit and hinted they will rebel at a later date. The Daily Telegraph,externalreported that up to 15 Conservative MPs could join forces with Labour on the issue when it is voted on next month, threatening defeat for the government. The MPs, including a number of former cabinet ministers, are angry at a government plan to enshrine in law the Brexit date and time - 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019 - as announced by Theresa May last Friday.

Although the issue was not formally debated on Tuesday, it dominated the early skirmishes in the Commons as MPs began considering the EU Withdrawal Bill in depth for the first time. Labour attacks Brexit date 'gimmick' As it happened: MPs examine EU bill A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill Former Conservative Attorney General Dominic Grieve said he could not support the ""mad"" proposal which he said would ""fetter"" the government's hands if the negotiations dragged on longer than expected and would prevent any extension to the talks to get a deal in both sides' interests. And former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke signalled he would be opposing the government when the matter came to a vote, telling MPs that - as a pro-European - ""he was the rebel now"" and Eurosceptics in his party now represented the ""orthodoxy"" within his party. Under current EU laws, the UK will leave two years to the day after it triggered Article 50, which was on March 29 2017, unless the UK and all 27 other EU members agree to an extension. Labour said the amendment was therefore a ""desperate gimmick"" that was ""about party management not the national interest"", arguing it increased the chance of the UK crashing out of the bloc without an agreement.

The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill is a crucial piece of legislation paving the way for the UK's withdrawal by essentially copying all EU law into UK law. After a marathon eight-hour session, the government also won three votes on clauses and amendments relating to how British courts will interpret retained EU law after the UK leaves and the role of the European Court of Justice during a transition period expected to last about two years. Sturgeon talks with May 'constructive' Six people who will shape the Brexit battle Davis moves to reassure the City Ministers did make one concession by agreeing to make a statement to the Commons about how compatible any new Brexit legislation is with existing equalities laws, before they introduce that legislation. Debate will resume on Wednesday, with MPs expected to consider Labour's calls for guarantees on workers' rights and the environment. MPs have tabled more than 470 amendments - running to 186 pages - for changes they want to see before the bill is passed into law by both the Commons and the Lords.

Brexit Secretary David Davis, who did not speak in Tuesday's debate, earlier told City executives that he hoped to get agreement on a time-limited Brexit implementation phase ""very early next year"". He told an audience at the Swiss investment bank UBS that he envisaged a new partnership with the EU that protects the mobility of workers and professionals across the continent. The BBC's business editor Simon Jack said his assurances may come too late for some companies which have already begun to trigger their contingency plans.

"This video can not be played Guns supplied to gangs by disgraced firearms dealer Paul Edmunds revealed A firearms dealer has been found guilty of supplying illegal handguns and home-made ammunition linked to more than 100 crime scenes, including three murders. Paul Edmunds, of Hardwicke, Gloucestershire, supplied ammunition used in an attempt to shoot down a police helicopter in the 2011 riots. The 66-year-old was found guilty of conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court. He will be sentenced on 20 December. The court was told Edmunds, of Bristol Road, was arrested at his home in 2015, where he had three armouries he used to make ammunition to fit antique weapons. Paul Edmunds had denied conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition Detectives discovered that a Colt pistol - imported on November 14 2013 - was used five weeks later in a Boxing Day fatal shooting at the Avalon nightclub in London. Four of Edmunds' rounds of ammunition were recovered from the victim's body. The jury were told Edmunds' ammunition was also recovered following the Birmingham murders of Derek Myers in 2015 and 18-year-old Kenichi Phillips in 2016. Following his arrest, 100,000 live rounds were seized from the armoury inside Edmunds' garage, while seven wheelie bin-loads of gun and ammunition components were recovered from a bedroom and attic. Following Edmunds' arrest, 100,000 live rounds were seized from the armoury inside his garage One of the seized guns which was examined by forensics officers In all, 17 criminally-linked weapons recovered by police are known to have been imported by Edmunds, while around 1,000 rounds of ammunition connected to him have been recovered from crime scenes in nine different police force areas. In police interviews, Edmunds said he was ""not responsible for the actions of somebody that buys some things"", adding his ""duty of care"" only extended to not selling to people who ""didn't look right"". He told officers: ""Like me selling a knife and you take that knife and kill somebody and then the system blames me for selling you the knife. ""It's your problem, got nothing to do with me."" Dr Mohinder Surdhar admitted conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition between 2009 and 2015 The two-month long re-trial heard Edmunds and middleman Dr Mohinder Surdhar - likened by police to the lead characters in the TV series Breaking Bad - acted together to supply antique revolvers and custom-made ammunition to criminal gangs. Surdhar, 56, from Grove Lane in Handsworth, Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition between 2009 and 2015 before Edmunds' trial. Jurors also convicted Edmunds of possessing a prohibited air pistol and perverting the course of justice by filing down a bullet-making tool to destroy potential evidence. His barrister acknowledged that the gun-dealer faces a sentence of at least 25 years when he is sentenced. Det Con Phil Rodgers, from West Midlands Police, said: ""They were like the Breaking Bad of the gun world - on the face of it, both decent men, but using their skills and expertise to provide deadly firearms.""

"This video can not be played The 163 carat diamond was the largest of its kind to go under the hammer A diamond necklace featuring a flawless 163-carat diamond - the largest of its kind to be auctioned - has fetched $33.7m (Â£25.6m) at a Christie's event in Geneva. The colourless diamond was taken from a 404-carat stone found in Angola. The finished piece is made from white gold, diamond and emeralds. The necklace was designed by Swiss jewellery maker de Grisogono and took more than 1,700 hours to make, Christie's said. It went under the hammer at Geneva's Four Seasons Hotel following a series of public viewings in Hong Kong, London, Dubai and New York. The necklace, named The Art of de Grisogono, sold for $33.5m - $29.5m plus $4m premium - exceeding pre-sale predictions of $30m. The buyer's identity has not been revealed.

"This video can not be played Would the US military disobey a nuclear order from President Trump? For the first time in over 40 years, Congress has examined a US president's authority to launch a nuclear attack. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing was titled Authority to Order the Use of Nuclear Weapons. Some senators expressed concern that the president might irresponsibly order a nuclear strike; others said he must have the authority to act without meddling from lawyers. The last time Congress debated this issue was in March 1976. Trump and the nuclear codes Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation In August, Mr Trump vowed to unleash ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" on North Korea if it continued to expand its atomic weapons programme. Last month, the Senate committee's Republican chairman, Senator Bob Corker, accused the president of setting the US ""on a path to World War 3"". Senator Ben Cardin set the tone at Tuesday morning's public hearing on Capitol Hill. ""This is not a hypothetical discussion,"" the Maryland Democrat said. Bob Corker says Trump 'utterly untruthful president' Some senators present said they were troubled about the president's latitude to launch a nuclear strike. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said: ""We are concerned that the president is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear-weapons strike that is wildly out of step with US national-security interests."" This video can not be played Lashing out: What Bob Corker really thinks of President Trump One of the experts, C Robert Kehler, who was commander of the US Strategic Command from 2011-13, said that in his former role he would have followed the president's order to carry out the strike - if it were legal. He said if he were uncertain about its legality, he would have consulted with his own advisers. Under certain circumstances, he explained: ""I would have said, 'I'm not ready to proceed.'"" One senator, Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, asked: ""Then what happens?"" Mr Kehler admitted: ""I don't know."" People in the room laughed. But it was a nervous laugh. The Minot Air Force Base houses part of the US arsenal of Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles Another expert, Duke University's Peter Feaver, a political science professor, explained that a presidential order ""requires personnel at all levels"" to sign off on it. It would be vetted by lawyers, as well as by the secretary of defence and individuals serving in the military. ""The president cannot by himself push a button and cause missiles to fly,"" said Prof Feaver. Another expert, Brian McKeon, a former under-secretary of defence for policy, said military officials would stop the president if they felt he was acting in a rash manner. ""Four-star generals are not shrinking violets,"" said Mr McKeon. Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, sounded sceptical. ""I don't think we should be trusting the generals to be a check on the president,"" he said. One of the key questions at the hearing was whether the senators - and Americans in general - had confidence in the president to make such a decision within minutes, or even seconds. At that moment, the defence secretary, military officials and lawyers would have little time to review the president's decision. Some of the senators said the president needed to have the freedom to act fast and forcefully under those circumstances. Senator Marco Rubio explained that the US president ""has to have the capacity to respond if we are under attack"" - and not be circumvented by ""a bunch of bunker lawyers"". Senator James Risch, an Idaho Republican, reinforced Mr Rubio's message, explaining that officials in Pyongyang should not misinterpret their discussion. ""He will do what is necessary to defend this country,"" said Mr Risch. At the end of the hearing, the lawmakers and experts agreed that the nuclear arsenal should be modernised - just in case.

Ms Mackenzie herself, from south London, was sent what she described to the BBC as ""a grovelling email - as if they'd killed my firstborn"", then found her account had been credited with Â£5 to compensate for the inconvenience. She said that meant Handy had ""profited Â£20 from her illness, about twice as much as they'd make if she turned up"". New York-based Handy told the BBC the cleaner was automatically blocked by its system as she had appeared as a ""no show"". Handy said at no point was the cleaner banned and that it was now ""reviewing its policy regarding waiving fees for emergencies such as this"". It added that the fine was cancelled after the firm learned the reason for her not attending. The cleaner has since been made available to Ms Mackenzie once more, but the incident has ignited a debate on social media about the use of app-based services and the gig economy. In the gig economy, instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for each job, such as a food delivery or a car journey. One of the best-known examples is driving for Uber. Proponents of the gig economy claim that people can benefit from flexible hours, with control over how much time they can work as they juggle other commitments. Those against say its simply another form of employment - without rights or in-work benefits. It is not unheard of for gig economy workers to be charged for days they do not work. Earlier this year,the Guardian reported,externalthat Parcelforce couriers who make deliveries for Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and Hamleys could be charged up to Â£250 a day if they were off sick and could not find someone to cover their shift. The debate also came to the boil last week when a tribunal ruled that Uber should give drivers the same rights as workers, rather than treat them as self-employed. Handy added: ""While there was initial confusion, any fees have been waived and the [cleaner] can continue to work for customers on the platform as a valued member of the Handy community. ""After reviewing the incident in question we can confirm that the professional was never banned from the platform and has completed bookings since the incident in question.""

"Zimbabwe Army General Constantino Chiwenga warned of a military takeover Zimbabwe's ruling party has accused the country's army chief of ""treasonable conduct"" after he warned of a possible military intervention in politics. General Constantino Chiwenga had challenged President Robert Mugabe after he sacked the vice-president. Gen Chiwenga said the army was prepared to act to end purges within Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. The party said the general's comments were ""calculated to disturb national peace... [and] incite insurrection"". In a statement, the party said it would never succumb to military threats, and that it ""reaffirms the primacy of politics over the gun"". The statement was signed by SK Moyo, the information secretary, on party letterheaded paper. The US State Department urged all parties in Zimbabwe to resolve disputes ""calmly and peacefully"" and said it was ""closely monitoring"" the situation. Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, amid a row over succession. Mr Mnangagwa had previously been seen as an heir to the 93-year-old president, but First Lady Grace Mugabe is now the clear front-runner. Rise of Grace Mugabe On Tuesday, BBC correspondents reported that a few armoured vehicles had been seen on a main public road outside the capital city, Harare, having left one of the country's main military barracks, Inkomo. It is not clear where they were heading but they were not seen on the streets of the city itself. One of the vehicles had broken down on the side of the road. It was not clear where the armoured vehicles near Harare were headed The Zimbabwean ambassador to South Africa, Isaac Moyo, told Reuters that the government was ""intact"" and dismissed any talk of a possible coup as ""just social media claims"". Gen Chiwenga's warning of possible military intervention came on Monday at a news conference at the army's headquarters. He said the ""purging"" within Zanu-PF was ""clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background"", referring to the country's struggle for independence. ""We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,"" he said. Mr Mnangagwa is one such veteran of the 1970s war which led to independence. Gen Chiwenga gave his address surrounded by 90 senior army officers. Grace Mugabe is seen as a potential successor to her elderly husband But the leader of Zanu-PF's youth wing, Kudzai Chipanga, said the general did not have the full support of the entire military. ""We will not sit and fold hands while threats are made against a legitimately-elected government,"" he warned. The youth wing supports President Mugabe's wife, Grace, as his successor - something which the former vice president had opposed. Mr Mnangagwa had told Mr Mugabe that Zanu-PF is ""not personal property for you and your wife to do as you please"" before he was forced into exile.

"Police say a number of students had to be medically evacuated from the school A gunman who killed four people on Tuesday in rural California fired into an elementary school but was stopped from entering by teachers, police say. Staff at Rancho Tehama Reserve School went into lockdown, securing school doors after hearing nearby gunshots. Authorities praised the teachers' actions as ""monumental"" in saving ""countless"" lives. Police confirmed one child was shot at the school after the gunman fired into it. Others were hurt by broken glass. Police later confronted the gunman in a stolen vehicle, shooting and killing him. He was named locally as 43-year-old Kevin Neal. It is believed the shooting spree began after a domestic row with the gunman's neighbours in Rancho Tehama, a rural community about 120 miles (195km) from Sacramento, on Tuesday morning. America's gun culture in 10 charts Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? Trump rejects stricter gun checks Police said they believed he went on a ""bizarre and murderous rampage"" after the dispute escalated and he killed a neighbour. Officials confirmed the gunman had ""prior contacts with law enforcement"". The Tehama district attorney told the Sacramento Bee he was being prosecuted on charges relating to a stabbing and assault in January,externalin an incident involving two of his neighbours. He had also reportedly been the subject of a domestic violence call on the eve of the gun spree. A semi-automatic rifle and two handguns were recovered from one of the crime scenes, police said. At least 10 people were injured in the shootings at multiple locations. Police said he chose most of the victims at random, and reportedly shot into the school but became frustrated after the teachers locked the doors and left after six minutes. It is believed the school was alerted after a mother was shot at in her car while driving her children to school. She was reportedly seriously wounded but not killed. The child who was shot has undergone surgery after being struck in the leg and chest, reports say. Other children at the school were reportedly injured by broken glass, and some were evacuated from the school and transported to hospital by helicopter. Police examine a vehicle that was involved in the string of shootings in Rancho Tehama ""This individual shooter was bent on engaging and killing people at random. I have to say this incident, as tragic and as bad as it is, could have been so much worse,"" Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said. The Redding Record Searchlight newspaper spoke to a man who said he was a neighbour of the gunman.,external Brian Flint said his neighbour ""has been shooting a lot of bullets lately, hundreds of rounds, large magazines"". ""We made it aware [to police] that this guy is crazy and he's been threatening us,"" he told the newspaper. The rampage is believed to have began at about 08:00 locally The Associated Press spoke to a woman who identified herself as Neal's mother,,externalwho said he had told her: ""I'm on a cliff and there's nowhere to go."" She said Neal was in a long-running dispute with neighbours who he believed were cooking methamphetamine. She added that Neal, who was raised in North Carolina, had been working as a cannabis farmer and had recently married his longtime girlfriend. His sister, Sheridan Orr, told the Associated Press that she believed her brother was addicted to drugs, and had struggled with mental illness and a violent temper. ""We're stunned and we're appalled that this is a person who has no business with firearms whatsoever,"" Ms Orr said. She added that she hopes this attack will ""make people realise there must be some gates on people like this from getting guns"". ""This is the same story we're hearing more and more."" Police have refused to officially confirm the gunman's identity until all his next-of-kin are notified. US President Donald Trump was criticised online after he tweeted condolences to the wrong mass shooting. ""May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas,"" a post on his account said on Tuesday night, though that shooting happened on 5 November. The tweet was deleted by Wednesday morning.

"This video can not be played Mr Macron: 'It's very important to me to support those defending an open Islam' French President Emmanuel Macron says Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are threatening Western values of openness and tolerance, but isolating them from Europe would be counterproductive. ""If you decide just to push them back from Europe and our values, saying 'you're betraying our values', you lose them,"" he told the BBC. Many see the US and Russian leaders as resistant to liberal ""elite"" values. Mr Macron was speaking in Abu Dhabi, where he opened a new Louvre Museum. He called it a symbol of tolerance and diversity in the region. ""We're at the epicentre of a series of conflicts and battles inside the Muslim world,"" he said in an interview at the weekend. ""It's very important to me to support those defending an open Islam."" He said the West had made a mistake in abandoning a ""grand narrative"" around its values and identity, and that France had a role in defending them abroad. ""You need a collective narrative, a common goal, common imagination,"" he said. ""It was the strength of Daesh [so-called Islamic State] - it was a promise of death. ""And I think one of the problems of Western society and Western countries during the past decade was to abandon imagination, ambition, vision. ""No one falls in love with the single market, the financial market, labour reforms or budget perspective,"" he continued. ""[People] are motivated because of a big narrative."" He said it was ""paranoia, their [sense of] threat, and their willingness to protect something"" that made leaders such as President Putin choose a different path, but that the Russian president was forgetting that part of his country's own civilisation was about openness, and that its future was directly linked to Europe. Mr Macron took office six months ago, promising to transform France's economy, society, even its identity.  Since then he has made 28 foreign trips and set out new proposals for the European Union, designed to give the bloc a collective vision and promote its benefits at home. WATCH: Behind the scenes with Macron Is France already losing its Macron frisson? France's controversial man on the move I knew this trip would be different to most reporting gigs when they took my passport away on the flight out.  I didn't see it again until I was flying back to Paris. But then, being part of the presidential press corps is an unusual experience for a regular news correspondent. And there were times when it felt more like a school trip than a reporting gig: the press corps bussed en masse from location to location, fed and watered at appropriate times, and handed detailed information about the president's speeches and schedule. Not once did I order a meal, give a taxi driver directions, or speak to a local person who wasn't a member of the hotel staff. In return, of course, was the rare chance to speak to Mr Macron one-to-one, and film him up-close in a way we've never done before - startling for a crew that's usually battling to get a decent shot of his face at all. And while there was a good deal of waiting around - the media has to be in place hours before the president arrives - it was made an awful lot easier by the food. Wherever we went, the refreshments laid on for the presidential party were surprisingly good. Think perfect miniature French tarts and copious Bollinger champagne.  As I say, not your usual reporting trip. Behind the scenes with Macron. Video, 00:02:31Behind the scenes with Macron France's man on the move Macron's dog interrupts meeting.

"Daisy Goodwin says she was cross, not traumatised, after the incident David Cameron says he is ""alarmed and shocked"" by a TV producer's claim that she was groped by a government official at 10 Downing Street. Daisy Goodwin, who created the ITV series Victoria, told the Radio Times the man touched her breast after a meeting about a new TV show during Mr Cameron's time as PM. Ms Goodwin said she was ""cross"" at the time, but did not report the incident. No 10 said the Cabinet Office would look into any formal complaint made. ""Allegations such as this are taken very seriously,"" the Downing Street spokesman added. Ms Goodwin said the official - who has not been named - invited her into an office at Number 10 for the meeting. She said she was surprised when the man, who was a few years younger than her, put his feet up on her chair and remarked that her sunglasses made her ""look like a Bond Girl"". Was there really a time sexual harassment was âacceptableâ? Should sexual harassment be a criminal offence? MPs' harassment 'not as big as expenses' She said she tried to steer the conversation back onto professional matters, but added: ""At the end of the meeting we both stood up and the official, to my astonishment, put his hand on my breast. ""I looked at the hand and then in my best Lady Bracknell voice said: 'Are you actually touching my breast?' ""He dropped his hand and laughed nervously."" Ms Goodwin said she left Downing Street in a state of ""high dudgeon"". ""I wasn't traumatised, I was cross. But by the next day it had become an anecdote, The Day I Was Groped In Number 10,"" she said. A spokesman for Mr Cameron - who was in office from 2010 to 2016 - said he was first made aware of this ""serious allegation"" on Monday. ""He was alarmed, shocked and concerned to learn of it and immediately informed the Cabinet Office,"" the spokesman added. Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""Of course this is something that we would be concerned about. ""We are looking at it, and as we have said, wherever an allegation has been made we will make sure it's treated with the utmost seriousness."" Ms Goodwin said recent revelations of alleged abuses had made her question whether she was wrong not to have made a formal complaint. ""Now, in the light of all the really shocking stories that have come out about abusive behaviour by men in power from Hollywood to Westminster, I wonder if my Keep Calm and Carry on philosophy, inherited from my parents, was correct? ""The answer is, I am not sure."" Hollywood has been rocked by allegations against film mogul Harvey Weinstein and others. At Westminster, several Conservative and Labour MPs are being investigated over claims of sexual misconduct. A group established in the wake of the allegations to strengthen grievance procedures for those working in Parliament met for the first time on Tuesday. House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said she was determined the group - made up of representatives of different parties, MPs' staff and union officials - would listen to all those affected and devise an independent complaints process which was ""underpinned by evidence, fairness and transparency"". The group, set up by Theresa May, aims to publish draft proposals following further meetings later this month. Should sexual harassment be a criminal offence?

"Labour's Dame Margaret Hodge said tax avoidance was taking place on an ""industrial scale"" The government should use next week's Budget to crack down on issues of tax avoidance raised by the release of the Paradise Papers, an ex-minister says. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who led an emergency debate on the leaked documents, said tax avoidance was ""a national and international disgrace"". She called for new laws to force big firms to report profits more openly. Treasury Minister Mel Stride said the government had a ""very strong track record"" in tackling tax avoidance. The leak, dubbedthe Paradise Papers, contained 13.4m documents, mostly from one leading offshore finance firm. The papers raised questions about how politicians, multinational companies, celebrities and other high-net-worth individuals use complex structures to protect their cash from higher taxes. What are the Paradise Papers? Should the UK take control of offshore centres? The island that swapped donkey rides for offshore cash Speaking in the Commons, Dame Margaret - who was in the cabinet under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and is also a former chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee - said tax avoidance was now a ""widely accepted behaviour of too many of those who are rich and influential"". The practice is taking place on an ""industrial scale"", she told MPs. She said the record of the last Labour government had not been ""as good as I would have wanted"", but added that the actions of the current government had been ""inadequate and somewhat hypocritical"". The Paradise Papers show firms and individuals are using certain financial jurisdictions - viewed as tax havens by some, offshore finance centres by others - to lower their taxes on profits or assets. They include a number of UK Crown Dependencies or Overseas Territories, such as the Isle of Man and Jersey. This video can not be played Paradise Papers: How to hide your cash offshore Dame Margaret called for legislation to force multinational firms to report their profits ""on a country-by-country basis, so that companies can be taxed where they make their profits"". And she called on the Treasury to introduce a new public register of property ownership and to help British tax havens ""in transforming their economies"". ""The government needs to grasp this moment to act. They have an opportunity to do so in next week's Budget,"" she said. ""Britain will never get rich on dirty money and our public services cannot function if the most wealthy individuals and the most powerful companies deliberately avoid paying their fair share."" Queen's private estate invested offshore Prince Charles lobbied on policy after shares buy Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on private jet Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed Mr Stride said the government had raised Â£160bn as a consequence of clamping down on tax avoidance since 2010. He told MPs: ""One of the problems is we have been so active in bringing in so many measures that unfortunately not all of them have been noticed."" However, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Peter Dowd, called for the government to introduce a public register of offshore trusts. ""It should also stop cuts to HMRC [HM Revenue and Customs] and ensure HMRC has the staff and resources it needs to enable it to tackle avoidance at its core,"" he added. Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, a former government chief whip, said the ""time has come"" to insist on the same levels of transparency for British overseas territories as the UK. He echoed the call for tax havens to have a public register of investments, adding: ""Registers must be open to the media, to journalists, to NGOs and to those people who can join up the dots."" The leaked papers were also debated in the European Parliament, in Strasbourg, on Tuesday where the EU's tax commissioner said finance professionals who enable aggressive tax avoidance were ""vampires"" who ""fear the light"". Pierre Moscovici said only greater transparency would work as a deterrent. He called on EU members to agree ""in the next six months"" on proposals to force tax advisers to report avoidance schemes devised for clients. Mr Moscovici also urged countries to agree on a blacklist of tax havens by the end of the year. The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with  corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externaland then shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external(ICIJ).Panoramahas led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries.

"Gary Goldsmith pleaded guilty to one count of assault by beating The Duchess of Cambridge's uncle has admitted punching his wife in the face and knocking her to the ground after a drunken row. Gary Goldsmith, 52, attacked Julie-Ann Goldsmith outside their home in Wimpole Street, central London, in the early hours of 13 October. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the pair had argued in the back of a taxi before he threw a ""left hook"". Goldsmith pleaded guilty to one count of assault by beating. Prosecutor Kate Shilton told the court the couple's taxi driver saw Mrs Goldsmith slap her husband in the face before he retaliated as they got home after a charity event. She said Mrs Goldsmith had ""fallen backwards"" after the punch and the taxi driver believed she had been knocked unconscious. Mrs Goldsmith remained on the floor with eyes closed for about 15 seconds before she woke and staggered to her feet and crying, the court heard. Ms Shilton said Goldsmith appeared to be ""panicked"" and when the taxi driver challenged him over his actions, he became aggressive. Goldsmith attended Pippa Middleton's wedding in May The court was told Mrs Goldsmith then asked the taxi driver to call the police. When at the police station Goldsmith said he had pushed his wife hard but denied hitting her. The court heard he was apologetic for his actions. Ahead of sentencing, which will take place on 21 November, chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said she was ""excluding custody and looking at a community order"". ""But I am really looking at how to protect this lady from this man,"" she said. Mr Goldsmith is the younger brother of Carole Middleton and attended the weddings of both her daughters - the Duchess of Cambridge and Pippa Middleton.

"The game simulates the attack capabilities of an AC-130 gunship Russia's Ministry of Defence has posted what it called ""irrefutable proof"" of the US aiding so-called Islamic State - but one of the images was actually taken from a video game. The ministry claimed the image showed an IS convoy leaving a Syrian town last week aided by US forces. Instead, it came from the smartphone game AC-130 Gunship Simulator: Special Ops Squadron. The ministry said an employee had mistakenly attached the photo. The Conflict Intelligence Team fact-checking group said the other four provided were also errors, taken from a June 2016 video which showed the Iraqi Air Force attacking IS in Iraq. The video game imageseems to be taken from a promotional video on the game's website and YouTube channel,external, closely cropped to omit the game controls and on-screen information. In the corner of the image, however, a few letters of the developer's disclaimer can still be seen: ""Development footage. This is a work in progress. All content subject to change."" The gameplay video, left, with the Russian MoD photo, right Hours later, the ministry published an updated statement with a different set of images, which it also said proved their claims. It repeated the claim it was ""irrefutable evidence that US are actually covering Isis [IS] combat units to recover their combat capabilities, redeploy, and use them to promote the American interests in the Middle East"". Russia alleges the US is co-operating with so-called Islamic State by providing cover to fleeing IS militants.In a Facebook post, the ministry said it liberated the town of Abu Kamal last week alongside the Syrian army,external. It said the US-led coalition refused requests to cooperate and ""eliminate fleeing Isis convoys"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It also accused the US-led coalition of carrying out air operations in the area to interfere with possible Russian strikes, and alleged that IS forces were disguising themselves as US-backed SDF fighters. ""The US are actually covering the Isis combat units to recover their combat capabilities, redeploy, and use them to promote the American interests in the Middle East,"" the statement concluded. A later press release said it had launched a probe into the actions of a civilian employee of one of its subdivisions who ""mistakenly attached photos"" to the first version of its statement. Responding to Russia's allegations in remarks carried by Reuters, a spokesman for the US-led coalition Col Ryan Dillon said the Russian allegations were ""about as accurate as their air campaign"". ""I certainly can't verify, but I've seen the report that one of the pictures came from a video game.

"Aston Martin has said it may have to halt production if the UK fails to strike a Brexit deal with the EU. All new cars in the UK must have Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) approval, which is valid in the EU. Without a UK-EU deal, that validity would cease for new cars from March 2019. Mark Wilson, Aston Martin's finance chief, said it would have the ""semi-catastrophic effect of having to stop production"". ""We're a British company. We produce our cars exclusively in Britain and will continue to do so,"" he said. ""Recertifying to a new type of approval, be that federal US, Chinese or even retrospectively applying to use the EU approval, would mean us stopping our production."" However, Mr Wilson added: ""We suppose there will be a transitional arrangement. During that transition we would have to look to see how Aston Martin could recertify under a non-VCA approval structure."" Honda imports two million components every day from Europe Mr Wilson was giving evidence to the Business Select Committee along with Mike Hawes, Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders chief executive, and Patrick Keating, Honda Motor Europe's government affairs manager. All three called for clarity on a transition deal with the EU. Mr Keating told the MPs that Honda would take 18 months to get its systems ready for new customs procedures for exporting to Europe. He said Honda imported two million components every day from Europe on 350 trucks and had just one hour of stock on its shelves. Every 15 minutes of delay at customs would cost the company Â£850,000 a year, although Mr Keating admitted the figure was not ""scientific"". ""We're thinking about increasing the amount of warehousing and the amount of stock we would have to hold if friction entered the border,"" he said. ""March 2018 is where we would want clarity around transition."" Mr Hawes added that the UK motor industry's integration into European supply chains could make it harder to benefit from any free trade agreement with non-EU countries after Brexit. Free trade agreements require that about 60% of goods must originate from within the countries making the agreement. Mr Hawes said: ""The average car made in the UK has 44% of its components from UK suppliers. How much of that 44% actually comes from the UK, bearing in mind those suppliers are buying in supply chains from all over the world? The figure is more like 25%, which is a long way from the 60% threshold you would need to qualify for a free trade agreement."" The problem could be overcome through a ""cumulation"" agreement with the EU, he said. That would allow EU content to count as being of UK origin and vice versa - but would need to be part of the Brexit trade deal.

"This video can not be played Russia 'tries to sow discord in the West' Senior Russian politicians have dismissed accusations by Theresa May that Moscow has meddled in elections and carried out cyber-espionage. On Monday night, Mrs May accused Moscow of ""planting fake stories"" to ""sow discord in the West"". She said Vladimir Putin's government was trying to ""undermine free societies"". Russian senators accused the UK PM of ""making a fool of herself"" with a ""counterproductive"" speech. But the top US diplomat in the UK, Woody Johnson, said countries engaging in such behaviour needed to be ""called out"". President Donald Trump's newly appointed ambassador to the UK told BBC News that Mrs May ""probably has evidence"" of Russian meddling and she had ""every right"" to draw attention to it. Boris Johnson set for Moscow visit Trump and Putin 'agree to defeat IS' Trump backs US agencies after Putin remark Mrs May's comments, at the Lord Mayor's Banquet at London's Guildhall, were in contrast to those of US President Donald Trump, who last week said he believed President Putin's denial of intervening in the 2016 presidential election. The Russian Embassy in the UK hit back at her criticism on Twitter and described her remarks as ""fake news"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator involved in media policy, said: ""The world order that suits May, with the seizure of Iraq, war in Libya, the rise of IS and terrorism in Europe, has had its day. You can't save it by attacking Russia."" This video can not be played Wood Johnson on Mrs May's comments: 'She probably has evidence to indicate that that was the case' Leonid Slutsky, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's Parliament, said: ""Russia, like the UK, is by no means striving to bring back the Cold War. We are ready to develop a mutual dialogue and partnership relations."" He added: ""In this case, I completely disagree with the statement that Russia is allegedly trying to undermine the international system of rules."" And Frants Klintsevich, deputy chairman of the defence and security committee in the Parliament's upper house, said: ""May has done more damage to herself than to us, making a fool of herself in the eyes of the world community and once again raising Russia's profile."" UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is due to visit Russia next month. In what Mrs May described as a ""very simple message"" for President Putin, she said he must choose a very ""different path"" from the one that in recent years had seen Moscow annex Crimea, foment conflict in Ukraine and launch cyber-attacks on governments and parliaments across Europe. This video can not be played What Boris Johnson told MPs about Russian meddling in UK elections Russia could be a valuable partner of the West but only if it ""plays by the rules"", she argued. ""Russia has repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption. ""This has included meddling in elections and hacking the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Bundestag among many others. ""We know what you are doing and you will not succeed. Because you underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us."" She said that as the UK left the EU and charted a new course in the world, it remained absolutely committed to Nato and securing a Brexit deal which ""strengthens our liberal values"", adding that a strong economic partnership between the UK and EU would be a bulwark against Russian agitation in Europe. There are some countries in Europe that believe the West should engage more closely with Russia. They argue the European Union and the United States should better understand Russia's point of view, its belief that it is threatened from all sides. And that more should be done to accommodate this sense of vulnerability, by softening Nato's approach and reducing sanctions. Well, not Theresa May. In a speech in the US in February, the prime minister spoke of the need to ""engage but beware"" of Russia. She has now switched the order and the focus is very much on beware. She believes that President Putin should be called out for the threat that she believes he poses both internationally and in the UK. The Electoral Commission is investigating claims that Russia used social media to meddle in the Brexit referendum. So Mrs May is willing to engage with Russia - she is sending the foreign secretary to Moscow next month. But she also wants Russia to know that Mr Johnson will come with a clear message that its destabilising activities will no longer be tolerated. Mr Johnson, who will be making his first trip to Russia as foreign secretary in December, has said the UK's policy to Russia must be one of ""beware but engage"" following a decade of strained relations. He told MPs earlier this month that he had not seen any evidence of Russia trying to interfere in British elections or the 2016 Brexit vote, in which Moscow has insisted it remained neutral. In her speech, Mrs May said the UK would ""take the necessary action to counter Russian activity"". ""We do not want to return to the Cold War or to be in a state of perpetual confrontation. ""As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has the reach and the responsibility to play a vital role in promoting international stability. ""Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path. But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend.""

"Police say a number of students had to be medically evacuated from the school A gunman who killed four people on Tuesday in rural California fired into an elementary school but was stopped from entering by teachers, police say. Staff at Rancho Tehama Reserve School went into lockdown, securing school doors after hearing nearby gunshots. Authorities praised the teachers' actions as ""monumental"" in saving ""countless"" lives. Police confirmed one child was shot at the school after the gunman fired into it. Others were hurt by broken glass. Police later confronted the gunman in a stolen vehicle, shooting and killing him. He was named locally as 43-year-old Kevin Neal. It is believed the shooting spree began after a domestic row with the gunman's neighbours in Rancho Tehama, a rural community about 120 miles (195km) from Sacramento, on Tuesday morning. America's gun culture in 10 charts Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? Trump rejects stricter gun checks Police said they believed he went on a ""bizarre and murderous rampage"" after the dispute escalated and he killed a neighbour. Officials confirmed the gunman had ""prior contacts with law enforcement"". The Tehama district attorney told the Sacramento Bee he was being prosecuted on charges relating to a stabbing and assault in January,externalin an incident involving two of his neighbours. He had also reportedly been the subject of a domestic violence call on the eve of the gun spree. A semi-automatic rifle and two handguns were recovered from one of the crime scenes, police said. At least 10 people were injured in the shootings at multiple locations. Police said he chose most of the victims at random, and reportedly shot into the school but became frustrated after the teachers locked the doors and left after six minutes. It is believed the school was alerted after a mother was shot at in her car while driving her children to school. She was reportedly seriously wounded but not killed. The child who was shot has undergone surgery after being struck in the leg and chest, reports say. Other children at the school were reportedly injured by broken glass, and some were evacuated from the school and transported to hospital by helicopter. Police examine a vehicle that was involved in the string of shootings in Rancho Tehama ""This individual shooter was bent on engaging and killing people at random. I have to say this incident, as tragic and as bad as it is, could have been so much worse,"" Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said. The Redding Record Searchlight newspaper spoke to a man who said he was a neighbour of the gunman.,external Brian Flint said his neighbour ""has been shooting a lot of bullets lately, hundreds of rounds, large magazines"". ""We made it aware [to police] that this guy is crazy and he's been threatening us,"" he told the newspaper. The rampage is believed to have began at about 08:00 locally The Associated Press spoke to a woman who identified herself as Neal's mother,,externalwho said he had told her: ""I'm on a cliff and there's nowhere to go."" She said Neal was in a long-running dispute with neighbours who he believed were cooking methamphetamine. She added that Neal, who was raised in North Carolina, had been working as a cannabis farmer and had recently married his longtime girlfriend. His sister, Sheridan Orr, told the Associated Press that she believed her brother was addicted to drugs, and had struggled with mental illness and a violent temper. ""We're stunned and we're appalled that this is a person who has no business with firearms whatsoever,"" Ms Orr said. She added that she hopes this attack will ""make people realise there must be some gates on people like this from getting guns"". ""This is the same story we're hearing more and more."" Police have refused to officially confirm the gunman's identity until all his next-of-kin are notified. US President Donald Trump was criticised online after he tweeted condolences to the wrong mass shooting. ""May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas,"" a post on his account said on Tuesday night, though that shooting happened on 5 November. The tweet was deleted by Wednesday morning.

"This video can not be played The 163 carat diamond was the largest of its kind to go under the hammer A diamond necklace featuring a flawless 163-carat diamond - the largest of its kind to be auctioned - has fetched $33.7m (Â£25.6m) at a Christie's event in Geneva. The colourless diamond was taken from a 404-carat stone found in Angola. The finished piece is made from white gold, diamond and emeralds.

It went under the hammer at Geneva's Four Seasons Hotel following a series of public viewings in Hong Kong, London, Dubai and New York. The necklace, named The Art of de Grisogono, sold for $33.5m - $29.5m plus $4m premium - exceeding pre-sale predictions of $30m. The buyer's identity has not been revealed.

"Mr Rouhani said the government would give financial help to those left homeless after the quake Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has vowed to ""find the culprits"" responsible for buildings collapsing in a 7.3-magnitude earthquake on Sunday. He suggested that government-built buildings had collapsed while privately-built ones remained standing. As he spoke in the worst-affected city, Sarpol-e Zahab, he gestured to two buildings, one of which had collapsed while the other had not. More than 400 people were killed and close to 8,000 injured in the quake. Although an earlier report from the state news agency Irna said 530 people had died, the death toll was later revised downward, to 432. But many more people are thought to have died and been buried without death certificates, meaning they are not included in the official figures. The government is scrambling to get aid to Kermanshah province in the west of the country, where hundreds of homes were destroyed and people have spent two nights outdoors in the cold. President Rouhani visited the region on Tuesday - a national day of mourning - and made an address that was broadcast live on TV. He said the government would lend and give money to those left homeless, and hold accountable anyone found not to have upheld building standards. ""Who is to be blamed?"" he asked. ""These are the issues that we should follow, we should find the culprits and people are waiting for us to introduce the culprits. ""We will do that, we will do that."" Iranians explain what they've lost Latest images of aftermath A photograph circulating on social media shows an unaffected private building next to a collapsed building that was part of the Mehr project, a scheme created by previous President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to build two million housing units for people on low incomes. Some buildings were much more damaged than others Mehr is Farsi for kindness, and under the scheme hundreds of homes were built in Sarpol-e Zahab. ""Pay attention, please, that some of these houses are very new, some of them have been built by the government and they are not very old,"" Mr Rouhani said. ""However, you can see that some buildings collapsed. How could that happen?"" The buildings behind President Rouhani highlight the difference in damage between privately-built and state-built homes in Sarpol-e Zahab But Maj Gen Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), told state TV: ""Newly constructed buildings... held up well, but the old houses built with earth were totally destroyed."" Mansoureh Bagheri, an Iran-based official with the Red Crescent Society, told the BBC about 12,000 residential buildings had ""totally collapsed"". One aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter after the quake, which struck at 21:18 local time (18:18 GMT) on Sunday, about 30km (19 miles) south of Darbandikhan in Iraq, near the north-eastern border with Iran. Can you predict a quake? List of the world's deadliest earthquakes Analysis by Jiyar Gol, BBC Persian Forty-eight hours after the earthquake, thousands of people complain that still they have no tents, food or water. They complain about the lack of co-ordination between security forces and aid agencies. Although many soldiers showed up, they didn't have enough ambulances or proper machinery to move rubble. More than 1,900 Kurdish mountain villages have been affected. The villagers say no one from the government has come to their rescue but ordinary Iranians from neighbouring cities and provinces have started sending aid. Most of the government-sponsored affordable housing complexes for the poor were damaged severely, and many died inside. Even the newly-built hospital in Sarpol-e-Zahab was completely destroyed. President Rouhani brought attention to this, saying those responsible for the projects - initiated under his predecessor's presidency - must be held accountable. But his opponents claim Mr Rouhani's aim is to divert attention from his own government's slow response to the victims. Tremors were felt as far away as Turkey, Israel and Kuwait. The earthquake was the deadliest of 2017, and one of the year's strongest.

"Deliveroo riders have been ruled self-employed by labour law body the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC). The test case was brought against the delivery company by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) . The IWGB said the ruling showed a majority of Deliveroo riders wanted workers' rights and union recognition. But the CAC found they were self-employed because of their freedom to ""substitute"" - allowing other riders to take their place on a job. The case follows a number of claims brought by workers in the ""gig"" economy demanding rights such as holiday pay, the minimum wage and pensions contributions. Drivers at Uber won a victory a week ago when the company lost an appeal at the Employment Appeal Tribunal against an earlier decision to grant them workers' rights. IWGB brought the case after it had asked Deliveroo to recognise it as a union representing drivers in Camden and Kentish Town and to start collective bargaining over workers' rights. Deliveroo refused and the case was taken to the CAC. The company said its turquoise-and-grey clad ""Roomen"" and ""Roowomen"" wanted to keep flexibility of being self-employed. But the IWGB said the ruling showed that Deliveroo riders were not satisfied with their current terms and conditions and wanted worker rights, including holiday pay and the minimum wage. IWGB General Secretary Dr Jason Moyer-Lee said: ""It seems that after a series of defeats, finally a so-called gig economy company has found a way to game the system."" ""On the basis of a new contract introduced by Deliveroo's army of lawyers just weeks before the tribunal hearing, the CAC decided that because a rider can have a mate do a delivery for them, Deliveroo's low paid workers are not entitled to basic protections."" Crowley Woodford, employment partner at law firm Ashurst said: ""This will be a significant blow to the unions who are trying to expand their membership within the gig economy by challenging the basis on which such employers engage and use their labour."" A decision by the CAC can be challenged in the High Court on a point of law. Dan Warne, Managing Director for Deliveroo in the UK and Ireland said: ""This is a victory for all riders who have continuously told us that flexibility is what they value most about working with Deliveroo. ""As we have consistently argued, our riders value the flexibility that self-employment provides. Riders enjoy being their own boss - having the freedom to choose when and where they work, and riding with other delivery companies at the same time.""

Ms Mackenzie herself, from south London, was sent what she described to the BBC as ""a grovelling email - as if they'd killed my firstborn"", then found her account had been credited with Â£5 to compensate for the inconvenience. She said that meant Handy had ""profited Â£20 from her illness, about twice as much as they'd make if she turned up"". New York-based Handy told the BBC the cleaner was automatically blocked by its system as she had appeared as a ""no show"". Handy said at no point was the cleaner banned and that it was now ""reviewing its policy regarding waiving fees for emergencies such as this"". It added that the fine was cancelled after the firm learned the reason for her not attending. The cleaner has since been made available to Ms Mackenzie once more, but the incident has ignited a debate on social media about the use of app-based services and the gig economy. In the gig economy, instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for each job, such as a food delivery or a car journey. One of the best-known examples is driving for Uber. Proponents of the gig economy claim that people can benefit from flexible hours, with control over how much time they can work as they juggle other commitments. Those against say its simply another form of employment - without rights or in-work benefits. It is not unheard of for gig economy workers to be charged for days they do not work. Earlier this year,the Guardian reported,externalthat Parcelforce couriers who make deliveries for Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and Hamleys could be charged up to Â£250 a day if they were off sick and could not find someone to cover their shift. The debate also came to the boil last week when a tribunal ruled that Uber should give drivers the same rights as workers, rather than treat them as self-employed. Handy added: ""While there was initial confusion, any fees have been waived and the [cleaner] can continue to work for customers on the platform as a valued member of the Handy community. ""After reviewing the incident in question we can confirm that the professional was never banned from the platform and has completed bookings since the incident in question.""

"Deliveroo riders have been ruled self-employed by labour law body the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC). The test case was brought against the delivery company by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) . The IWGB said the ruling showed a majority of Deliveroo riders wanted workers' rights and union recognition. But the CAC found they were self-employed because of their freedom to ""substitute"" - allowing other riders to take their place on a job. The case follows a number of claims brought by workers in the ""gig"" economy demanding rights such as holiday pay, the minimum wage and pensions contributions. Drivers at Uber won a victory a week ago when the company lost an appeal at the Employment Appeal Tribunal against an earlier decision to grant them workers' rights. IWGB brought the case after it had asked Deliveroo to recognise it as a union representing drivers in Camden and Kentish Town and to start collective bargaining over workers' rights. Deliveroo refused and the case was taken to the CAC. The company said its turquoise-and-grey clad ""Roomen"" and ""Roowomen"" wanted to keep flexibility of being self-employed. But the IWGB said the ruling showed that Deliveroo riders were not satisfied with their current terms and conditions and wanted worker rights, including holiday pay and the minimum wage. IWGB General Secretary Dr Jason Moyer-Lee said: ""It seems that after a series of defeats, finally a so-called gig economy company has found a way to game the system."" ""On the basis of a new contract introduced by Deliveroo's army of lawyers just weeks before the tribunal hearing, the CAC decided that because a rider can have a mate do a delivery for them, Deliveroo's low paid workers are not entitled to basic protections."" Crowley Woodford, employment partner at law firm Ashurst said: ""This will be a significant blow to the unions who are trying to expand their membership within the gig economy by challenging the basis on which such employers engage and use their labour."" A decision by the CAC can be challenged in the High Court on a point of law. Dan Warne, Managing Director for Deliveroo in the UK and Ireland said: ""This is a victory for all riders who have continuously told us that flexibility is what they value most about working with Deliveroo. ""As we have consistently argued, our riders value the flexibility that self-employment provides. Riders enjoy being their own boss - having the freedom to choose when and where they work, and riding with other delivery companies at the same time.""

"This video can not be played Would the US military disobey a nuclear order from President Trump? For the first time in over 40 years, Congress has examined a US president's authority to launch a nuclear attack. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing was titled Authority to Order the Use of Nuclear Weapons. Some senators expressed concern that the president might irresponsibly order a nuclear strike; others said he must have the authority to act without meddling from lawyers. The last time Congress debated this issue was in March 1976. Trump and the nuclear codes Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation In August, Mr Trump vowed to unleash ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" on North Korea if it continued to expand its atomic weapons programme. Last month, the Senate committee's Republican chairman, Senator Bob Corker, accused the president of setting the US ""on a path to World War 3"". Senator Ben Cardin set the tone at Tuesday morning's public hearing on Capitol Hill. ""This is not a hypothetical discussion,"" the Maryland Democrat said. Bob Corker says Trump 'utterly untruthful president' Some senators present said they were troubled about the president's latitude to launch a nuclear strike. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said: ""We are concerned that the president is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear-weapons strike that is wildly out of step with US national-security interests."" This video can not be played Lashing out: What Bob Corker really thinks of President Trump One of the experts, C Robert Kehler, who was commander of the US Strategic Command from 2011-13, said that in his former role he would have followed the president's order to carry out the strike - if it were legal. He said if he were uncertain about its legality, he would have consulted with his own advisers. Under certain circumstances, he explained: ""I would have said, 'I'm not ready to proceed.'"" One senator, Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, asked: ""Then what happens?"" Mr Kehler admitted: ""I don't know."" People in the room laughed. But it was a nervous laugh. The Minot Air Force Base houses part of the US arsenal of Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles Another expert, Duke University's Peter Feaver, a political science professor, explained that a presidential order ""requires personnel at all levels"" to sign off on it. It would be vetted by lawyers, as well as by the secretary of defence and individuals serving in the military. ""The president cannot by himself push a button and cause missiles to fly,"" said Prof Feaver. Another expert, Brian McKeon, a former under-secretary of defence for policy, said military officials would stop the president if they felt he was acting in a rash manner. ""Four-star generals are not shrinking violets,"" said Mr McKeon. Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, sounded sceptical. ""I don't think we should be trusting the generals to be a check on the president,"" he said. One of the key questions at the hearing was whether the senators - and Americans in general - had confidence in the president to make such a decision within minutes, or even seconds. At that moment, the defence secretary, military officials and lawyers would have little time to review the president's decision. Some of the senators said the president needed to have the freedom to act fast and forcefully under those circumstances. Senator Marco Rubio explained that the US president ""has to have the capacity to respond if we are under attack"" - and not be circumvented by ""a bunch of bunker lawyers"". Senator James Risch, an Idaho Republican, reinforced Mr Rubio's message, explaining that officials in Pyongyang should not misinterpret their discussion. ""He will do what is necessary to defend this country,"" said Mr Risch. At the end of the hearing, the lawmakers and experts agreed that the nuclear arsenal should be modernised - just in case.

"Zimbabwe Army General Constantino Chiwenga warned of a military takeover Zimbabwe's ruling party has accused the country's army chief of ""treasonable conduct"" after he warned of a possible military intervention in politics. General Constantino Chiwenga had challenged President Robert Mugabe after he sacked the vice-president. Gen Chiwenga said the army was prepared to act to end purges within Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. The party said the general's comments were ""calculated to disturb national peace... [and] incite insurrection"". In a statement, the party said it would never succumb to military threats, and that it ""reaffirms the primacy of politics over the gun"". The statement was signed by SK Moyo, the information secretary, on party letterheaded paper. The US State Department urged all parties in Zimbabwe to resolve disputes ""calmly and peacefully"" and said it was ""closely monitoring"" the situation. Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, amid a row over succession. Mr Mnangagwa had previously been seen as an heir to the 93-year-old president, but First Lady Grace Mugabe is now the clear front-runner. Rise of Grace Mugabe On Tuesday, BBC correspondents reported that a few armoured vehicles had been seen on a main public road outside the capital city, Harare, having left one of the country's main military barracks, Inkomo. It is not clear where they were heading but they were not seen on the streets of the city itself. One of the vehicles had broken down on the side of the road. It was not clear where the armoured vehicles near Harare were headed The Zimbabwean ambassador to South Africa, Isaac Moyo, told Reuters that the government was ""intact"" and dismissed any talk of a possible coup as ""just social media claims"". Gen Chiwenga's warning of possible military intervention came on Monday at a news conference at the army's headquarters. He said the ""purging"" within Zanu-PF was ""clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background"", referring to the country's struggle for independence. ""We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,"" he said. Mr Mnangagwa is one such veteran of the 1970s war which led to independence. Gen Chiwenga gave his address surrounded by 90 senior army officers. Grace Mugabe is seen as a potential successor to her elderly husband But the leader of Zanu-PF's youth wing, Kudzai Chipanga, said the general did not have the full support of the entire military. ""We will not sit and fold hands while threats are made against a legitimately-elected government,"" he warned. The youth wing supports President Mugabe's wife, Grace, as his successor - something which the former vice president had opposed. Mr Mnangagwa had told Mr Mugabe that Zanu-PF is ""not personal property for you and your wife to do as you please"" before he was forced into exile.

"This video can not be played ""We will end the supremacy of EU law"" - Davis It's crunch time for the government's EU Withdrawal Bill - the bill which aims to ensure European law will no longer apply in the UK after Brexit. This key plank of legislation, once known as the Great Repeal Bill, has reached committee stage in the House of Commons, which is the bit where there will be hundreds of attempts by MPs to change its wording. As its informal name suggests, therepeal bill,externalwill repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which took Britain into the EU and meant that European law took precedence over laws passed in the UK Parliament. It will also end the power of the European Court of Justice in the UK. All existing EU legislation will be copied across into domestic UK law to ensure a smooth transition on the day after Brexit. The government says it wants to avoid a ""black hole in our statute book"" and avoid disruption to businesses and individual citizens as the UK leaves the EU. The UK Parliament can then ""amend, repeal and improve"" individual laws as necessary. Ensuring the continuity of EU rules and regulations is also meant to aid trade negotiations with the EU because the UK will already meet all of its product stands. The repeal bill will mean the UK is no longer bound by the European Court of Justice The bill is likely to be ""one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK"", areport,externalby the House of Commons library predicts, with ""major swathes of the statute book"" needing to be examined to see how they will work after Brexit. This is because working out which bits of UK law came from the EU is not as simple as it may sound. In fact, it presents a ""unique challenge"", a House of Lords committee warned, because ""the body of EU law is found in a number of different places, and in a number of different forms"". Simply transposing all EU law into UK legislation will not be enough, the government'sWhite Paper,externalon the bill says. Swathes of UK law ""will no longer work"" on exit, for example because they refer to EU institutions. Not all of this can be done through the repeal bill, so the government plans to create powers to ""correct the statute book where necessary"" - without full Parliamentary scrutiny. This power - known as Henry VIII power - is the one of the most controversial features of the bill (see below). More complications are presented by the government's negotiations with the EU, which will be taking place while the bill is passing through Parliament. Those talks could shape what the UK's post-Brexit laws look like - but the repeal bill will need to be done and dusted by the day the UK leaves. The government is expected to use powers known as Henry VIII clauses The government plans to enact its ""corrections"" to the statute book using what are known as Henry VIII powers, after the Statute of Proclamations 1539 which gave him the power to legislate by proclamation. Given that this will not involve the usual Parliamentary scrutiny process, opposition parties have protested, with Labour claiming ministers were being handed ""sweeping powers"" to make hasty, ill thought-out legislation. Ministers have attempted to reassure critics by saying such measures will be time-limited and not used to make policy changes. In total, the government estimates that 800 to 1,000 measures called statutory instruments will be required to make sure the bill functions properly. The European Commission proposes new EU legislation A lot. The government's White Paper says there is ""no single figure"" for this, but that there are believed to be 12,000 EU regulations (one type of EU law) in force, while Parliament has passed 7,900 statutory instruments implementing EU legislation and 186 acts which incorporate a degree of EU influence. The total body of European law, dating back to 1958, is known as the Acquis Communautaire. It binds all member states and in 2010 was estimated to consist of about 80,000 items, covering everything from workers' rights to environment and trade. As well as regulations, this includes EU treaties, directions and European Court of Justice rulings. New EU legislation is being created all the time and will continue to apply to the UK until it leaves. Different types of EU legislation work in different ways, and will be treated differently by the bill. So regulations, which apply automatically in the UK, will be converted into UK law. But directives require a new UK law to come into force - this legislation will be preserved by the bill. Reality check: How much UK law comes from the EU? MPs have already voted to approve the second reading of the bill, by 326 votes to 290. But there are many hurdles ahead and on Tuesday the line-by-line scrutiny of how it will operate begins. As tends to happen with legislation deemed to be of constitutional importance, this 'committee stage' is taking place on the floor of the House of Commons, so all MPs can take part. Eight days have been allocated for this process, which will be followed by more stages including the bill's passage through the House of Lords. The plan is for it to be passed ahead of the UK's exit from the EU but to become law only when it actually leaves, in March 2019. Read more: A guide to the EU bill's journey through Parliament Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems all opposed the bill at second reading, and MPs from all parties - with the exception of the DUP - are now trying to amend it at committee stage. Labour's suggested changes include trying to maintain a role for the European Court of Justice during the transition phase planned after March 2019. There is also a cross-party attempt to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal in place. Until the UK actually leaves, EU law will continue to apply. But after leaving, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act (as it will be by then) comes into force. The government says having the legislation in place will ensure a ""calm and orderly exit"". Then begins the long-term process of the government, and Parliament, choosing what it wants to do with the laws it has incorporated from the EU. With so many pieces of legislation to be considered, this could turn out to be a ""major drain on resources"" and should not ""crowd out"" other government policies, the Institute for Government think tank has warned. The Scottish Parliament is likely to get a vote on the Great Repeal Bill Some of the EU laws are in areas that are controlled by the devolved administrations - so do they now become part of Westminster law, or will they be added to the statute book in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? It is not entirely clear how this will work, although the government says it will work closely with the devolved administrations. It also predicts the repeal process will result in a ""a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration"", as powers in devolved areas are repatriated from Brussels. But the bill has been described by the Scottish government as an ""executive power grab"". Ministers have confirmed the devolved administrationswill be asked to consent to the bill- but this does not amount to a veto. The UK government has warned that blocking the bill could have ""very significant consequences"", leaving ""a hole in our law"".

"The Children's Commissioner said the impact of the new benefit was not tested on families The rollout of universal credit to families with children should be paused, the children's commissioner for England has told MPs. Anne Longfield told the Education Select Committee there was evidence families with children were being hit hard by the welfare changes. The impact of universal credit had not been tested on families with children, said Ms Longfield. The government says the change will make it easier to claim benefits. The rollout of the new benefit across the UK accelerated last month - with about 50 job centres now being added each month. It merges six benefits for working-age people into one new payment. What is Universal Credit? Universal Credit: Helpline delays The system, with a built-in six-week wait, has been beset by controversy. The benefit is paid in arrears, which means everyone has to wait at least four weeks for their money. The rest of the wait is because of the way the scheme is administered. So far, about a quarter of all claimants have had to wait more than six weeks to receive their first payments. ""I am worried about the rollout of welfare reforms,"" Ms Longfield said in her evidence to the committee. ""I am aware that, actually, families with children are being very hard hit, families with more than two children very hard hit, and, actually, lone parents. ""So, I do think we've got a set of families whose lives are quite precarious. ""Often they are the ones in work, and I am not sure that everyone has recognised that the new poor and the new insecure are those in insecure work."" She said the fact that the new system had not been tested on families with children meant ""we are moving into rollout not knowing what that means"". ""So, one of the things that I will be asking the chancellor to do is to pause universal credit rollout for families with children until we better understand what that means,"" Ms Longfield said. She said the change was coming on top of ""welfare failures"" and families were now having to resort to using food banks. ""I am well aware of the impact of therules around two childrenand also thebenefits freeze,"" she said. ""There is cumulative impact and I think at this stage, with such a vulnerable group of children and families, it's the right thing to pause universal credit.""

A spokeswoman said: ""Under universal credit, people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than the old system.

"This video can not be played Family friend Rosemary Dinch was the last person to see Gaia Pope before she went missing A woman and a man arrested on suspicion of murdering missing teenager Gaia Pope have been released by police while inquiries continue. Gaia, 19, from Langton Matravers, Dorset, disappeared from nearby Swanage, where she had been staying, on 7 November. Rosemary Dinch, 71, and her 19-year-old grandson, Nathan Elsey, both from Swanage, know Gaia. Police made the arrests after searching two Swanage addresses on Monday. Dorset Police said ""extensive searches"" would continue in the hope she was still alive. Police said a search for Gaia with the coastguard, volunteers from Dorset Search and Rescue and Wessex 4x4, along with members of the local community, was carried out on Tuesday in the Swanage area. Gaia Pope was last seen in Swanage, Dorset, on 7 November Det Supt Paul Kessler said: ""We still believe Gaia is somewhere in the Swanage area... I remain hopeful that we will find Gaia alive. ""If the public can help us - anyone who has had contact with her in the last seven days, please contact Dorset Police as you may have information that can help us locate her. ""However, we will continue to conduct every avenue of inquiry which is open."" Gaia was last seen by Ms Dinch, a family friend, at an address in Manor Gardens, Morrison Road, Swanage at about 16:00 GMT. Before she was arrested she told BBC News Gaia had ""pounded"" on her door then spent 20 minutes with her. This video can not be played Det Supt Int Paul Kessler said it is thought Gaia is ""somewhere in the Swanage area"" ""She was very upset, she slid to the floor at one point, I gave her a cuddle and she responded to me - I have no idea where she is - she just seems to have disappeared,"" she said. A statement released by police on behalf of Gaia's family said the continuing search had given them ""great comfort in what everyone will understand is a deeply worrying and scary experience for all who love Gaia so deeply"". The family also appealed to social media users to focus on ""constructive and positive efforts to find Gaia and not to encourage uninformed speculation which can have a negative impact on the family and be a distraction"". In a direct message to Gaia, the statement read: ""We all love you forever. We miss you beyond words. We will find you darling girl. ""The thought of seeing the sunshine of your smile again soon keeps us all going and hoping.""

"The UK's key inflation rate remained steady in October at a five-and-a-half-year high of 3%, official figures show. Higher food prices were offset by lower fuel costs, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The price of food and non-alcoholic drinks rose at an annual rate of 4.1%, the highest since September 2013. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) had been expected to rise, with the Bank of England forecasting it would peak at 3.2% this autumn. The official target for the CPI is 2%. If the CPI inflation rate had risen above 3%, Bank of England governor Mark Carney would have been forced to write to the chancellor explaining why it was so far above target. Kamal Ahmed: Price rises - is the worst over? Fewer High Street shops closing down Maike Currie at Fidelity International said Mr Carney could ""breathe a sigh of relief this month"". However, she added: ""While the Bank of England raised interest rates at the beginning of this month given concerns over inflation, it will take some time for inflation to fall back nearer the 2% target. ""This means cash-strapped consumers will continue to feel the pinch as wages lag price rises."" While food price inflation picked up last month, this was offset by the falling cost of motor fuel and lower furniture prices, the ONS said. The fall in the value of the pound since last year's Brexit referendum has contributed to the recent rise in inflation, as it has increased the cost of imported goods and services. However, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the latest inflation figures ""will add to the sense that the worst of this impact has already passed"". ""Data on company costs, which tend to change ahead of changes in consumer prices, are already shown signs of having peaked earlier in the year,"" he added. This video can not be played Pound's fall has driven inflation, says Mark Carney Earlier this month, Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe said the UK was ""probably through the worst"" of food price rises following the slide in the pound. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG said the ""relatively positive"" news on inflation could prompt the Bank to plan fewer rate rises in the next two to three years. ""That may help support a vulnerable UK economy in the process of leaving the EU, but at the same time it could put further strain on savers and significant sectors of the economy such as banks and insurers, while stoking potential pockets of over-exuberant asset prices,"" she said. October's Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 4%, up from 3.9% in September.  Government index-linked savings products and some train ticket prices rise in line with RPI. The ONS's preferred inflation measure of CPIH, which contains owner-occupiers' housing costs, was unchanged at 2.8%.

"A TV producer has said she was groped by a government official during a visit to 10 Downing Street. Daisy Goodwin, who created the ITV series Victoria, told the Radio Times the man put his hand on her breast after a meeting to discuss a proposed TV show when David Cameron was PM. Ms Goodwin said she was ""cross"" at the time, but did not report the incident. Downing Street said it took allegations seriously and officials would look into a formal complaint, should one be made. Ms Goodwin said the official - who has not been named - invited her into an office at Number 10 for the meeting. She said she was surprised when the man put his feet up on her chair and remarked that her sunglasses ""made me look like a Bond Girl"". Was there really a time when sexual harassment was âacceptableâ?

""I looked at the hand and then in my best Lady Bracknell voice said: 'Are you actually touching my breast?' ""He dropped his hand and laughed nervously."" Ms Goodwin said she left Downing Street in a state of ""high dudgeon"". ""I wasn't traumatised, I was cross. But by the next day it had become an anecdote, The Day I Was Groped In Number 10,"" she said. Mr Cameron, who was prime minister between 2010 and 2016, said he was first made aware of this ""serious allegation"" on Monday.

"Labour's Dame Margaret Hodge said tax avoidance was taking place on an ""industrial scale"" The government should use next week's Budget to crack down on issues of tax avoidance raised by the release of the Paradise Papers, an ex-minister says. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who led an emergency debate on the leaked documents, said tax avoidance was ""a national and international disgrace"". She called for new laws to force big firms to report profits more openly. Treasury Minister Mel Stride said the government had a ""very strong track record"" in tackling tax avoidance. The leak, dubbedthe Paradise Papers, contained 13.4m documents, mostly from one leading offshore finance firm. The papers raised questions about how politicians, multinational companies, celebrities and other high-net-worth individuals use complex structures to protect their cash from higher taxes. What are the Paradise Papers? Should the UK take control of offshore centres? The island that swapped donkey rides for offshore cash Speaking in the Commons, Dame Margaret - who was in the cabinet under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and is also a former chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee - said tax avoidance was now a ""widely accepted behaviour of too many of those who are rich and influential"". The practice is taking place on an ""industrial scale"", she told MPs. She said the record of the last Labour government had not been ""as good as I would have wanted"", but added that the actions of the current government had been ""inadequate and somewhat hypocritical"". The Paradise Papers show firms and individuals are using certain financial jurisdictions - viewed as tax havens by some, offshore finance centres by others - to lower their taxes on profits or assets. They include a number of UK Crown Dependencies or Overseas Territories, such as the Isle of Man and Jersey. This video can not be played Paradise Papers: How to hide your cash offshore Dame Margaret called for legislation to force multinational firms to report their profits ""on a country-by-country basis, so that companies can be taxed where they make their profits"". And she called on the Treasury to introduce a new public register of property ownership and to help British tax havens ""in transforming their economies"". ""The government needs to grasp this moment to act. They have an opportunity to do so in next week's Budget,"" she said. ""Britain will never get rich on dirty money and our public services cannot function if the most wealthy individuals and the most powerful companies deliberately avoid paying their fair share."" Queen's private estate invested offshore Prince Charles lobbied on policy after shares buy Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on private jet Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed Mr Stride said the government had raised Â£160bn as a consequence of clamping down on tax avoidance since 2010. He told MPs: ""One of the problems is we have been so active in bringing in so many measures that unfortunately not all of them have been noticed."" However, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Peter Dowd, called for the government to introduce a public register of offshore trusts. ""It should also stop cuts to HMRC [HM Revenue and Customs] and ensure HMRC has the staff and resources it needs to enable it to tackle avoidance at its core,"" he added. Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, a former government chief whip, said the ""time has come"" to insist on the same levels of transparency for British overseas territories as the UK. He echoed the call for tax havens to have a public register of investments, adding: ""Registers must be open to the media, to journalists, to NGOs and to those people who can join up the dots."" The leaked papers were also debated in the European Parliament, in Strasbourg, on Tuesday where the EU's tax commissioner said finance professionals who enable aggressive tax avoidance were ""vampires"" who ""fear the light"". Pierre Moscovici said only greater transparency would work as a deterrent. He called on EU members to agree ""in the next six months"" on proposals to force tax advisers to report avoidance schemes devised for clients. Mr Moscovici also urged countries to agree on a blacklist of tax havens by the end of the year. The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with  corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externaland then shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external(ICIJ).Panoramahas led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries.

"Gary Haggarty admitted a lengthy list of serious criminal charges in June Evidence from a so-called supergrass will be used against an alleged Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) man accused of murdering two men during the Troubles. Catholic workmen Gary Convie and Eamon Fox were shot dead at a building site in Belfast city centre in May 1994. It is understood the man to be charged is James Smyth, from Forthriver Link in Belfast. Former UVF commander Gary Haggarty, who has admitted 202 offences, including five murders, will be the star witness. The police bristle at the very mention of the word supergrass, because of its association with a series of high-profile trials in the 1980s. Hundreds of republicans and loyalists were convicted on the word of informers and suspects who agreed to give evidence in return for reduced sentences, new identities and lives outside Northern Ireland. Those deals were done at a political level, with the details kept secret. Technically, those individuals were assisting offenders but they became known as ""touts"" and ""supergrasses"" in communities. The system collapsed in 1985 because of concerns about the credibility of the evidence provided by the supergrasses. Members of the judiciary complained that they were being used as political tools to implement government security policy. A change in law in 2005 implemented safeguards for trials of that kind. Mr Smyth will be prosecuted for the two 1994 murders, one attempted murder, possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life, and membership of the UVF. Mr Smyth was previously charged with the murders and when he was brought to court in 2014, he denied all of the offences. The charges were withdrawn two years ago. Eamon Fox and Gary Convie were shot dead while eating their lunch at a building site in 1994 Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory QC, announced on Tuesday the decision to use Haggarty as what is known as an assisting offender.

""In these circumstances, I have concluded that there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and that the test for prosecution is met. ""I can confirm that we intend to use assisting offender Gary Haggarty as a witness in this prosecution."" Gary Haggarty was the commander of the Ulster Volunteer Force's north Belfast unit Prosecutors had received files relating to four UVF murders based on information provided by Haggarty. In June, hepleaded guilty to a lengthy list of serious changes, including murders, attempted murders, kidnappings and false imprisonments. He was given five life sentences for the murders, but his agreement to act as an assisting offender will see those terms significantly reduced. All of the killings, and the majority of the other offences, took place while Haggarty was working as a police informer. Haggarty signed an agreement to become an assisting offender under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act.

"Mr Rouhani said the government would give financial help to those left homeless after the quake Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has vowed to ""find the culprits"" responsible for buildings collapsing in a 7.3-magnitude earthquake on Sunday. He suggested that government-built buildings had collapsed while privately-built ones remained standing. As he spoke in the worst-affected city, Sarpol-e Zahab, he gestured to two buildings, one of which had collapsed while the other had not. More than 400 people were killed and close to 8,000 injured in the quake. Although an earlier report from the state news agency Irna said 530 people had died, the death toll was later revised downward, to 432. But many more people are thought to have died and been buried without death certificates, meaning they are not included in the official figures. The government is scrambling to get aid to Kermanshah province in the west of the country, where hundreds of homes were destroyed and people have spent two nights outdoors in the cold. President Rouhani visited the region on Tuesday - a national day of mourning - and made an address that was broadcast live on TV. He said the government would lend and give money to those left homeless, and hold accountable anyone found not to have upheld building standards. ""Who is to be blamed?"" he asked. ""These are the issues that we should follow, we should find the culprits and people are waiting for us to introduce the culprits. ""We will do that, we will do that."" Iranians explain what they've lost Latest images of aftermath A photograph circulating on social media shows an unaffected private building next to a collapsed building that was part of the Mehr project, a scheme created by previous President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to build two million housing units for people on low incomes. Some buildings were much more damaged than others Mehr is Farsi for kindness, and under the scheme hundreds of homes were built in Sarpol-e Zahab. ""Pay attention, please, that some of these houses are very new, some of them have been built by the government and they are not very old,"" Mr Rouhani said. ""However, you can see that some buildings collapsed. How could that happen?"" The buildings behind President Rouhani highlight the difference in damage between privately-built and state-built homes in Sarpol-e Zahab But Maj Gen Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), told state TV: ""Newly constructed buildings... held up well, but the old houses built with earth were totally destroyed."" Mansoureh Bagheri, an Iran-based official with the Red Crescent Society, told the BBC about 12,000 residential buildings had ""totally collapsed"". One aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter after the quake, which struck at 21:18 local time (18:18 GMT) on Sunday, about 30km (19 miles) south of Darbandikhan in Iraq, near the north-eastern border with Iran. Can you predict a quake? List of the world's deadliest earthquakes Analysis by Jiyar Gol, BBC Persian Forty-eight hours after the earthquake, thousands of people complain that still they have no tents, food or water. They complain about the lack of co-ordination between security forces and aid agencies. Although many soldiers showed up, they didn't have enough ambulances or proper machinery to move rubble. More than 1,900 Kurdish mountain villages have been affected. The villagers say no one from the government has come to their rescue but ordinary Iranians from neighbouring cities and provinces have started sending aid. Most of the government-sponsored affordable housing complexes for the poor were damaged severely, and many died inside. Even the newly-built hospital in Sarpol-e-Zahab was completely destroyed. President Rouhani brought attention to this, saying those responsible for the projects - initiated under his predecessor's presidency - must be held accountable. But his opponents claim Mr Rouhani's aim is to divert attention from his own government's slow response to the victims. Tremors were felt as far away as Turkey, Israel and Kuwait. The earthquake was the deadliest of 2017, and one of the year's strongest.

"This video can not be played Guns supplied to gangs by disgraced firearms dealer Paul Edmunds revealed A firearms dealer has been found guilty of supplying illegal handguns and home-made ammunition linked to more than 100 crime scenes, including three murders. Paul Edmunds, of Hardwicke, Gloucestershire, supplied ammunition used in an attempt to shoot down a police helicopter in the 2011 riots. The 66-year-old was found guilty of conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court. He will be sentenced on 20 December. The court was told Edmunds, of Bristol Road, was arrested at his home in 2015, where he had three armouries he used to make ammunition to fit antique weapons. Paul Edmunds had denied conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition Detectives discovered that a Colt pistol - imported on November 14 2013 - was used five weeks later in a Boxing Day fatal shooting at the Avalon nightclub in London. Four of Edmunds' rounds of ammunition were recovered from the victim's body. The jury were told Edmunds' ammunition was also recovered following the Birmingham murders of Derek Myers in 2015 and 18-year-old Kenichi Phillips in 2016. Following his arrest, 100,000 live rounds were seized from the armoury inside Edmunds' garage, while seven wheelie bin-loads of gun and ammunition components were recovered from a bedroom and attic. Following Edmunds' arrest, 100,000 live rounds were seized from the armoury inside his garage One of the seized guns which was examined by forensics officers In all, 17 criminally-linked weapons recovered by police are known to have been imported by Edmunds, while around 1,000 rounds of ammunition connected to him have been recovered from crime scenes in nine different police force areas. In police interviews, Edmunds said he was ""not responsible for the actions of somebody that buys some things"", adding his ""duty of care"" only extended to not selling to people who ""didn't look right"". He told officers: ""Like me selling a knife and you take that knife and kill somebody and then the system blames me for selling you the knife. ""It's your problem, got nothing to do with me."" Dr Mohinder Surdhar admitted conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition between 2009 and 2015 The two-month long re-trial heard Edmunds and middleman Dr Mohinder Surdhar - likened by police to the lead characters in the TV series Breaking Bad - acted together to supply antique revolvers and custom-made ammunition to criminal gangs. Surdhar, 56, from Grove Lane in Handsworth, Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition between 2009 and 2015 before Edmunds' trial. Jurors also convicted Edmunds of possessing a prohibited air pistol and perverting the course of justice by filing down a bullet-making tool to destroy potential evidence. His barrister acknowledged that the gun-dealer faces a sentence of at least 25 years when he is sentenced. Det Con Phil Rodgers, from West Midlands Police, said: ""They were like the Breaking Bad of the gun world - on the face of it, both decent men, but using their skills and expertise to provide deadly firearms.""

Labour MP David Lammy described the survey as ""deeply troubling"". The Tory group have been contacted for comment. The leaflet, which seeks to find out what kind of issues are important to residents ahead of the 2018 local elections, was sent out to households in the Courtfield ward - a wealthy neighbourhood in Kensington. The questionnaire,which is also available online,external, asks people to rate ""how important to you and your family"" the disaster and other ""local issues"" were from ""0 - not important at all"" to ""10 - very important"". The Kensington, Chelsea and Fulham Conservatives' survey is also available online Charlie Goodman, 34, who lives in the area, said the Tory group should apologise. ""I think they have acted in a very insensitive manner,"" he said. ""It's not something one would ever want to quantify, particularly when you consider the other items on the list.

"US regulators have approved the first pill that can be digitally tracked through the body. The Abilify MyCite aripiprazole tablets - for treating schizophrenia and manic episodes - have an ingestible sensor embedded inside them that records that the medication has been taken. A patch worn by the patient transmits this information to their smartphone. The information can also be sent to the prescribing doctor, if the patient consents to this. Experts hope it could improve medication compliance, although the company that makes the tablets says this has not been proved for their product. The prescribing notes also stress that Abilify MyCite should not be used to track drug ingestion in ""real-time"" or during an emergency, because detection may be delayed or may not occur. The pills are not licensed to be used in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. About the size of a grain of sand, the sensor activates when it comes into contact with stomach fluid. It can take 30 minutes to two hours to detect ingestion of the tablet. Mitchell Mathis, from the Food and Drug Administration, said: ""Being able to track ingestion of medications prescribed for mental illness may be useful for some patients. ""The FDA supports the development and use of new technology in prescription drugs and is committed to working with companies to understand how technology might benefit patients and prescribers.""

Ms Mackenzie herself, from south London, was sent what she described to the BBC as ""a grovelling email - as if they'd killed my firstborn"", then found her account had been credited with Â£5 to compensate for the inconvenience. She said that meant Handy had ""profited Â£20 from her illness, about twice as much as they'd make if she turned up"". New York-based Handy told the BBC the cleaner was automatically blocked by its system as she had appeared as a ""no show"". Handy said at no point was the cleaner banned and that it was now ""reviewing its policy regarding waiving fees for emergencies such as this"". It added that the fine was cancelled after the firm learned the reason for her not attending. The cleaner has since been made available to Ms Mackenzie once more, but the incident has ignited a debate on social media about the use of app-based services and the gig economy. In the gig economy, instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for each job, such as a food delivery or a car journey. One of the best-known examples is driving for Uber. Proponents of the gig economy claim that people can benefit from flexible hours, with control over how much time they can work as they juggle other commitments. Those against say its simply another form of employment - without rights or in-work benefits. It is not unheard of for gig economy workers to be charged for days they do not work. Earlier this year,the Guardian reported,externalthat Parcelforce couriers who make deliveries for Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and Hamleys could be charged up to Â£250 a day if they were off sick and could not find someone to cover their shift. The debate also came to the boil last week when a tribunal ruled that Uber should give drivers the same rights as workers, rather than treat them as self-employed. Handy added: ""While there was initial confusion, any fees have been waived and the [cleaner] can continue to work for customers on the platform as a valued member of the Handy community. ""After reviewing the incident in question we can confirm that the professional was never banned from the platform and has completed bookings since the incident in question.""

They are holding on to their parents to warm themselves - it's pretty bad."" Mr Gulani said there were an average of three strong aftershocks an hour, provoking panic. Close to 200 aftershocks have hit the region since the magnitude-7.3 earthquake on Sunday night. It was one of the strongest on earth this year, as well as the deadliest.

"Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump had kept the world guessing about whether they would formally meet in Vietnam US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to fight so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria until its defeat. A statement was prepared by experts after the leaders met briefly on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam on Saturday. In total, they had three encounters within 24 hours at the summit. During one conversation, Mr Trump said Mr Putin had denied allegations of meddling in the US 2016 election. Questions over Mr Trump's ties to Moscow have dogged his presidency, with key former aides under investigation for alleged collusion with Russia. The two stood side by side in matching shirts for a group photo on Friday A formal bilateral meeting between the two presidents had been widely expected at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in the port city of Da Nang, but Mr Putin later said scheduling issues had got in the way. The pair met for the first time in July at the G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg. How different are Trump and Putin? Did dinner chat break diplomatic protocol? Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House A statement released by the Kremlin on Saturday said the leaders had ""agreed that the conflict in Syria has no military solution"". They also confirmed their ""determination to defeat Isis [another term for IS]"" and called on all parties to take part in the Geneva peace process. According to Russia's Interfax news agency, they promised to maintain existing Russian-US military channels of communication to prevent ""serious incidents involving the forces of partners combating IS"". Russia has been the Syrian government's main ally in the six-year-long civil war. The US meanwhile has been backing Syrian Arab and Kurdish rebels on the ground, and since 2014 it has led a coalition carrying out air strikes against IS in Syria. The jihadist group has been pushed out of its main strongholds in Syria in recent months by a combination of offensives involving the Syrian army and the Kurdish and Arab coalition. Last month the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared they were in full control of Raqqa, a city that became the headquarters of IS's self-styled ""caliphate"" in 2014.

"Boris Johnson is to visit Moscow later this year as part of efforts to build a more constructive dialogue with Russia on global security issues. The foreign secretary has been invited by his counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Items on the agenda are likely to include North Korea, Iran and security for next year's football World Cup. The Foreign Office said the UK had ""deep differences"" with Russia but the visit was part of a policy of ""sustained and robust engagement"". Mr Johnson was due to visit Moscow in April, but the trip was cancelled following a deadly chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held town in Syria. The atrocity was blamed on President Assad's regime, which is backed by the Russians, although the Syrian government has denied using nerve gas. The attack prompted a military response from the US, which bombed a Syrian air base it suspected of storing chemical weapons. The UK's relations with Russia have been strained for several years but the two foreign ministers have met on several occasions this year, most recently at the UN General Assembly in September. The Foreign Office said the bilateral visit, a date for which has not been set, did not mean a return ""to business as usual"" with Russia following its annexation of Crimea, which prompted EU sanctions, its wider actions in Ukraine and its continued support for the Assad regime. Boris Johnson will meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov But it said it was vital in the UK's national interest to keep ""channels of communication"" open. ""Russia is a fellow permanent member of the UN Security Council and there are global security issues we need to discuss from Iran to North Korea,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Of course we will continue to challenge Russia's approach where we disagree, whether that is Russia's actions in Syria or its aggression towards Ukraine. My visit will provide an opportunity to talk about these issues and more, face-to-face. ""Our relationship with Russia is not straightforward. That is all the more reason to be talking to Russia - to manage our differences and cooperate where possible for the security of both our nations and the international community."" As well as government meetings, the foreign secretary said he would also speak to figures from Russian society and the ""next generation"".

"This video can not be played What's going on with the EU Withdrawal Bill? Several Tory MPs have joined Labour in demanding Theresa May withdraw a key Brexit legislation amendment to set the exact time of EU departure in law. Ministers say being ""crystal clear"" about when the UK will leave on 29 March 2019 will give maximum certainty. But ex-chancellor Ken Clarke said the move was ""silly"" while Dominic Grieve said it would ""fetter"" ministers' hands if talks dragged on to the last minute. Labour has branded it a ""gimmick"" and said it will vote against it. The row came as MPs began debating the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill in depth for the first time, a crucial piece of legislation paving the way for the UK's withdrawal by essentially copying all EU law into UK law. Tuesday's marathon eight-hour debate is the first of eight sessions over the next month in which MPs will pore over the details of the government's Brexit strategy and seek changes. The government saw off the first challenge to the bill as Plaid Cymru's call for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly to give their consent before the 1972 European Communities Act - which paved the way for the UK to originally join the then European Economic Community - can be repealed was defeated by 318 to 52 votes. BBC Parliament Live: MPs examine EU Bill Six people who will shape the Brexit battle Brexit: All you need to know Sturgeon talks with May 'constructive' A government amendment to enshrine the Brexit date and time - 23:00 GMT on 29 March  2019 - in law, announced by Mrs May last Friday, will not be debated until the final day of the committee stage next month. But it dominated the early skirmishes in the Commons as Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said setting a date in law was a ""desperate gimmick"" that was ""about party management not the national interest"". Labour says it is a question of how, not if, the UK leaves the EU that matters ""The government's amendments to their own Bill would stand in the way of an orderly transition and increase the chance of Britain crashing out of Europe without an agreement,"" the shadow Brexit secretary said. ""Theresa May should stop pandering to the 'no deal' enthusiasts in her own party and withdraw these amendments."" What is happening on Tuesday: The EU Withdrawal Bill is entering its Committee stage - meaning MPs will scrutinise it line-by-line First up is a four hour debate on the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act, the legislation that took Britain into the EU, or the EEC as it was then called MPs could discuss a call for the UK to stay in the EU until a new treaty has been signed on its future relationship Another amendment that has support is one that would give the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a bigger say About 7pm: Four hours of debate on how to interpret 40 years of accumulated EU law in UK law The future status of the European Court of Justice, which will cease to set UK laws on Brexit day, is also up for debate MPs are due to vote at about 7pm and 11pm but the government is not expected to be defeated at this stage A further seven days of debate have been scheduled in the run-up to Christmas, with the second day, on Wednesday, expected to include Labour's calls for guarantees on workers' rights and the environment. But former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve said that fixing the precise time of withdrawal at this stage would ""fetter"" the government's hands if negotiations dragged on longer than expected and the process needed to be extended in order to reach an agreement. Describing it as a ""mad"" idea that had not been discussed by the cabinet, he said it had been ""accompanied by blood-curdling threats that anyone who might stand in its way was somehow betraying the country's destiny"". ""I am afraid I am just not prepared to go along with it,"" he told MPs. And former chancellor Ken Clarke, the only Tory to vote against triggering Brexit, condemned what he said were ""silly amendments thrown out"" solely to get positive coverage in Brexit-supporting newspapers. This video can not be played Field: 'I've always bought my houses' This video can not be played Ken Clarke attacks government over Brexit bill Labour's Frank Field said he agreed with the need for a deadline, saying he had never taken on a job without a start date or bought a house without knowing when he would take possession. He agreed to withdraw his own amendment, specifying a date but not a precise hour of departure, after Brexit minister Steve Baker warned of ""legal chaos"" if the issue of timing was not ""put to rest"". ""The government wants this bill to provide as much certainty as possible,"" Mr Baker added. ""We recognise the importance of being crystal clear on the setting of exit day."" A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill Sturgeon talks with May 'constructive' Parliament to get vote on final Brexit deal Why Davis's Brexit vote announcement matters Ministers say the main aim of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill is to copy across EU rules into domestic UK law to ensure a smooth transition on the day after Brexit but critics say it is a power grab by the government which will allow ministers to change laws and regulations without going through Parliament first. Most MPs say they accept that Britain is leaving the EU but some are expected to use the debates to fight against what they call a ""hard Brexit"" where the UK leaves without a trade deal. This video can not be played Davis: Parliament will be given time to debate, scrutinise and vote on the final deal with the EU MPs have tabled more than 470 amendments - running to 186 pages - for changes they want to see before the Brexit bill is passed into law by both the Commons and the Lords. The government is not thought to be facing the serious prospect of defeat until next month, with a small group of about 10 Conservative rebels reportedly plotting with Labour and other opposition parties. MPs were told on Monday they would be able to debate and vote on any agreement negotiated with the EU by the government as the Brexit deal would have to become law via an Act of Parliament. But Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK would still leave the EU on 29 March 2019, whether MPs backed or rejected the deal - making MPs' vote a take-it-or-leave-it one on the Brexit deal, rather than one which could either halt Brexit or have the deal renegotiated. Speaking in the Commons, the SNP's Stephen Gethins said MPs were being offered a choice between a ""really bad deal and a really, really bad deal"" which he said was ""no choice at all"".

"This video can not be played The rescued puppies have been quarantined Record numbers of illegal puppies are being smuggled across the Channel into the UK ready for the ""Christmas trade"". In three undercover operations the Dogs Trust seized 100 young dogs in just one week from Folkestone and Dover ports. But the UK's largest dog welfare charity said the clampdown was ""just the tip of the iceberg"", and feared people looking for a cheap puppy would fuel the illegal trade. The pups are found in ""shocking conditions"", with severe health issues. This puppy has a skin infection from urine scalding The Dogs Trust said it had come across seven Cane Corso pups with infected wounds after their ears and tails were cropped and docked, apparently using scissors and vodka. According to the trust, high demand for ""trendy"" breeds such as French bulldogs, English bulldogs, Chow Chows and Dachshunds helped to fuel the ""sickening trade"", which can net bootleg breeders tens of thousands of pounds. Dogs Trust veterinary director Paula Boyden said: ""Buying an illegally imported puppy could potentially cost well-meaning but unsuspecting families thousands of pounds in quarantine and vet bills and emotional heartache for the family if the puppy falls ill or worse, dies. ""We continue to be astounded at the lengths these deceptive breeders and dealers will go to."" Rescued British bulldog puppies at the Dogs Trust kennels Under the Dogs Trust's ""Puppy Pilot"" scheme, 582 illegally smuggled puppies were rehomed between December 2015 and 18 October 2017.  About 40 rescued puppies died from the poor conditions they suffered on the journey to the UK. In2016 officials found 688 ""illegally landed"" dogs, more than treble the recorded number in 2014. The number of dogs entering the UK to be kept as pets in 2011 was 85,299, and this figure continues to increase year-on-year, with 275,876 entering in 2016. Between 2011 and 2013 the number of dogs coming to the UK from central and eastern Europe in particular rocketed, with a 780% increase from Lithuania and a 663% increase from Hungary. Illegally imported puppies are often sick or have been mistreated Keith Taylor MEP, the Green Party's animals spokesperson and member of the European Parliament's Animal Welfare Intergroup, said the illegal trade is ""gruesome and reprehensible"". ""With more than 100,000 dogs in rescue centres across the UK looking for a home it is hugely upsetting to see the demand for puppies fuelling such a barbaric criminal enterprise. ""Puppy smuggling and the illegal puppy trade is big business with dealers getting rich while leaving a trail of dead puppies and heartbroken families.""

"The Grenfell Tower fire is thought to have killed about 80 people Residents have criticised a ""crass and offensive"" survey asking them to rate how important the Grenfell Tower tragedy was to them. The questionnaire sent out by a Kensington branch of the Conservative Party asked for people's views on the fatal fire alongside issues such as parking and recycling. Labour MP David Lammy described the survey as ""deeply troubling"". The Tory group have been contacted for comment. The leaflet, which seeks to find out what kind of issues are important to residents ahead of the 2018 local elections, was sent out to households in the Courtfield ward - a wealthy neighbourhood in Kensington. The questionnaire,which is also available online,external, asks people to rate ""how important to you and your family"" the disaster and other ""local issues"" were from ""0 - not important at all"" to ""10 - very important"". The Kensington, Chelsea and Fulham Conservatives' survey is also available online Charlie Goodman, 34, who lives in the area, said the Tory group should apologise.

"This video can not be played Sumo wrestler Harumafuji sorry for 'causing trouble' A sumo wrestling grand champion is alleged to have hit a fellow wrestler over the head with a beer bottle in a fresh scandal that has rocked the highly ceremonial sport. Nine-time grand champion Mongolian wrestler Harumafuji, 33, has apologised for ""causing trouble"". The alleged victim, Takanoiwa, was hospitalised for several days, the Japan Sumo Association has said. Japanese media report the incident occurred during a drinking session. Sumo association officials told AFP news agency that exactly what happened remains unconfirmed. Takanoiwa, who is also Mongolian, is reported to have suffered a fractured skull. The 27-year-old is part of a so-called 'stable' led by Takanohana, a former grand champion who reported the incident to police, according to Kyodo news agency. Harumafuji and his stable master, Isegahama, were questioned by association executives on Tuesday. Japan gets first sumo champion in 19 years How does sumo wrestling work? Sumo hit by match-fixing claimsâ The grand champion apologised publicly but did not confirm the circumstances of the incident. ""As for Takanoiwa's injuries, I apologise deeply for causing trouble for stable master Takanohana, people affiliated with Takanohana stable, the Sumo Association and my stable master,"" he told reporters. Stable master Isegahama and Harumafuji were questioned by association executives on Tuesday Weighing in at 137kg (300lb), Harumafuji is considered a relatively small sumo wrestler, and is lauded for his technique in the ring. Sumo hit by match-fixing claims Sumo shines in the US Sumo's origins lie in Shinto rites performed in temples, and Japanese fans expect wrestlers competing in the ancient sport to live up to strict standards of good behaviour. Wrestlers are expected to not show emotion after a victory and a rigid hierarchy exists. This video can not be played Could the next sumo star come from Senegal? But this case is far from the first time that the sumo world has been hit by scandal and reports of violence outside the ring. In 2007, a teenage novice died after being beaten up by older wrestlers, with the stable master subsequently jailed for five years over the abuse. That case exposed a culture of bullying and hazing within the ancient sport's strict hierarchy. In 2016, a stable master and wrestler were made to pay nearly $300,000 (Â£230,000) to a wrestler allegedly abused so badly that he lost sight in one eye, according to reports. Back in 2010, the sport was rocked by alleged links between sumo wrestlers and yakuza crime syndicates.A match-fixing scandal followed in 2011. Sumo falls prey to Japan's mafia In 2010, Mongolian grand champion Asashoryu retired from the sport after reports of a drunken fight in Tokyo. Japan's much-loved traditional sport dates back hundreds of years Two wrestlers face off in an elevated circular ring and try to push each other to the ground or out of the ring There are six tournaments each year in which each wrestler fights 15 bouts Wrestlers, who traditionally go by one fighting name, are ranked and the ultimate goal is to become a yokozuna (grand champion) Sumo wrestler sorry for 'causing trouble' Video, 00:00:53Sumo wrestler sorry for 'causing trouble' Japan gets first sumo champion in 19 years Mongolian girl grappling with sumo world Life of a sumo wrestler.

"Charlie Fry said he was ""blindsided"" by the shark A UK doctor says he escaped a shark by punching it in the face after the animal injured him in Australia. Charlie Fry, 25, was at a beach north of Sydney on Monday when the shark ""jumped out of the water and hit him in the right shoulder"", police said. Dr Fry said he punched the shark while in the water before climbing back on his board and surfing to shore. He said he had been inspired bysurfer Mick Fanning, who famously fended off a sharkduring a competition in 2015. The shark left scratches and a small puncture wound on Dr Fry's arm. Police said the animal was about 2m (6.5ft) long. ""I saw this shark come out of the water and breach its head and I punched it in the face with my left hand,""Dr Fry told local Nine Network's Today programme,externalon Tuesday.

"This video can not be played Russia 'tries to sow discord in the West' Theresa May has launched her strongest attack on Russia yet, accusing Moscow of meddling in elections and carrying out cyber espionage. Addressing leading business figures at a banquet in London, the prime minister said Vladimir Putin's government was trying to ""undermine free societies"". Mrs May said it was ""planting fake stories"" to ""sow discord in the West"". While the UK did not want ""perpetual confrontation"" with Russia, it would protect its interests, she added. Her comments are in stark contrast to those of US President Donald Trump, who last week said he believed his Russian counterpart's denial of intervening in the 2016 presidential election. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is due to visit Russia next month. Boris Johnson set for Moscow visit Trump and Putin 'agree to defeat IS' Trump backs US agencies after Putin remark In a major foreign policy speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet at London's Guildhall, which Mrs May described as a ""very simple message"" for President Putin, she said he must choose a very ""different path"" from the one that in recent years had seen Moscow annex Crimea, foment conflict in Ukraine and launch cyber attacks on governments and Parliaments across Europe. Russia could be a valuable partner of the West but only if it ""plays by the rules"", she argued. ""Russia has repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber espionage and disruption. ""This has included meddling in elections and hacking the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Bundestag among many others."" This video can not be played What Boris Johnson told MPs about Russian meddling in UK elections ""We know what you are doing and you will not succeed. Because you underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us."" She said as the UK left the EU and charted a new course in the world, it remained absolutely committed to Nato and securing a Brexit deal which ""strengthens our liberal values"", adding that a strong economic partnership between the UK and EU would be a bulwark against Russian agitation in Europe. There are some countries in Europe that believe the West should engage more closely with Russia. They argue the European Union and the United States should better understand Russia's point of view, its belief that it is threatened from all sides. And that more should be done to accommodate this sense of vulnerability, by softening Nato's approach and reducing sanctions. Well, not Theresa May. In a speech in the US in February, the prime minister spoke of the need to ""engage but beware"" of Russia. She has now switched the order and the focus is very much on beware. She believes that President Putin should be called out for the threat she believes he poses both internationally and in the UK. The Electoral Commission is investigating claims that Russia used social media to meddle in the Brexit referendum. So Mrs May is willing to engage with Russia - she is sending the foreign secretary to Moscow next month. But she also wants Russia to know that Mr Johnson will come with a clear message that its destabilising activities will no longer be tolerated. Mr Johnson, who will be making his first trip to Russia since becoming foreign secretary in December, has said the UK's policy towards Moscow must be one of ""beware but engage"" following a decade of strained relations. He told MPs earlier this month that he had not seen any evidence of Russia trying to interfere in British elections or the 2016 Brexit vote, in which Moscow has insisted it remained neutral. ""We will take the necessary action to counter Russian activity,"" Mrs May added. ""But this is not where we want to be and not the relationship with Russia we want. ""We do not want to return to the Cold War or to be in a state of perpetual confrontation. ""As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has the reach and the responsibility to play a vital role in promoting international stability. ""Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path. But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend."" Responding to Mrs May's speech, former Labour cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw - who has been raising the issue of Russian interference in UK elections for nearly a year - tweeted: ""Asking why May suddenly acknowledging Russian interference now having stonewalled for months."" Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator involved in media policy, dismissed the PM's comments. ""The international system of rules must be saved not from Russia but from the advocates of intervention, coups and regime change. Russia will not accept those 'rules',"" he tweeted. ""The world order that suits May, with the seizure of Iraq, war in Libya, the rise of IS and terrorism in Europe, has had its day. You can't save it by attacking Russia."" In Mrs May's speech, she also said the authorities in Myanmar - formerly known as Burma - must take ""full responsibility"" for what ""looked like ethnic cleansing"" of the Rohingya people in Rakhine province.

"Gary Haggarty admitted a lengthy list of serious criminal charges in June Evidence from a so-called supergrass will be used against an alleged Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) man accused of murdering two men during the Troubles. Catholic workmen Gary Convie and Eamon Fox were shot dead at a building site in Belfast city centre in May 1994. It is understood the man to be charged is James Smyth, from Forthriver Link in Belfast. Former UVF commander Gary Haggarty, who has admitted 202 offences, including five murders, will be the star witness. The police bristle at the very mention of the word supergrass, because of its association with a series of high-profile trials in the 1980s. Hundreds of republicans and loyalists were convicted on the word of informers and suspects who agreed to give evidence in return for reduced sentences, new identities and lives outside Northern Ireland. Those deals were done at a political level, with the details kept secret. Technically, those individuals were assisting offenders but they became known as ""touts"" and ""supergrasses"" in communities. The system collapsed in 1985 because of concerns about the credibility of the evidence provided by the supergrasses. Members of the judiciary complained that they were being used as political tools to implement government security policy. A change in law in 2005 implemented safeguards for trials of that kind. Mr Smyth will be prosecuted for the two 1994 murders, one attempted murder, possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life, and membership of the UVF. Mr Smyth was previously charged with the murders and when he was brought to court in 2014, he denied all of the offences. The charges were withdrawn two years ago. Eamon Fox and Gary Convie were shot dead while eating their lunch at a building site in 1994 Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory QC, announced on Tuesday the decision to use Haggarty as what is known as an assisting offender. ""I am satisfied that there is independent evidence which is capable of supporting his identification of the subject,"" he said. ""This includes both eyewitness and forensic evidence. ""In these circumstances, I have concluded that there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and that the test for prosecution is met. ""I can confirm that we intend to use assisting offender Gary Haggarty as a witness in this prosecution."" Gary Haggarty was the commander of the Ulster Volunteer Force's north Belfast unit Prosecutors had received files relating to four UVF murders based on information provided by Haggarty. In June, hepleaded guilty to a lengthy list of serious changes, including murders, attempted murders, kidnappings and false imprisonments. He was given five life sentences for the murders, but his agreement to act as an assisting offender will see those terms significantly reduced. All of the killings, and the majority of the other offences, took place while Haggarty was working as a police informer. Haggarty signed an agreement to become an assisting offender under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act. He was interviewed by detectives more than 1,000 times and the information he gave them ran beyond 12,000 pages. Victim's son angry at supergrass deal.

"Gianluigi Buffon made his international debut against Russia in 1997 A tearful Gianluigi Buffon said he was ""sorry for all of Italian football"" as he led a wave of international retirements after a World Cup play-off defeat by Sweden. Italy were held toa 0-0 drawin Milan and failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958. Buffon, 39, said: ""It's a shame my last official game coincided with the failure to qualify for the World Cup. ""Blame is shared equally between everyone. There can't be scapegoats."" Read how Sweden qualified for Russia Watch Italy's iconic World Cup moments Buffon's Juventus team-mateAndrea Barzagliand Roma midfielderDaniele de Rossialso ended their Italy careers, while Juve defender Giorgio Chiellini is expected to join them. The quartet have won 461 caps between them. Goalkeeper Buffon made 175 appearances for his country in a 20-year career - lifting the World Cup in 2006 - and believes the future could still be bright for the four-time world champions. ""There is certainly a future for Italian football because we have pride, ability, determination and after bad tumbles, we always find a way to get back on our feet,"" he said. Italy manager Giampiero Ventura did not speak to national television after the defeat but arrived at a news conference 90 minutes after full-time. The Italian FA have said they will meet on Wednesday to discuss the future of the coach, who is under contract until 2020. ""I have not resigned because I haven't spoken to the president yet,"" Ventura, 69, said after the game. ""I'm sorry for being late, but every player I had the privilege of working with, I wanted to salute individually. ""Resignation? I have to evaluate an infinity of issues. We will meet with the federation and discuss it."" Barzagli, 36, said it was ""painful"" to ""leave this group of lads"". He added: ""I don't know what we missed. All I know is we're out of the World Cup. It's a unique disappointment. ""The era of four or five veterans comes to a close, the one of the hungry young players coming through begins and that's how it should be."" Lorenzo Insigne has scored three goals and made four assists for Napoli in Serie A this season There was a bizarre moment late in the game when De Rossi was asked to warm up but pointed instead at Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne, a player Ventura refused to call upon despite pressure from Italian media and supporters. ""I just said we were near the end and had to win, so send the strikers to warm up!"" said De Rossi. ""I pointed to Insigne too. ""I just thought perhaps it was better that Insigne come on instead."" Ultimately, De Rossi, 34, was not used either as Italy failed in their search for the goal that would have taken the tie to extra time. Italy's leading sports newspaperLa Gazzetta dello Sport,externalsaid the result brought the arrival of the ""apocalypse"". The article said: ""We will not be with you and you will not be with us. A love so great must be reserved for other things. Italy will not participate at the World Cup. ""It is time to start thinking about what else we can do in June: concerts, cinema, village festivals. Anything but watching Sweden play at the World Cup - that would be too painful."" On Buffon, former Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas said: ""I don't like seeing you like this. I want to see you as you've always been, as what you are for so many - as a legend. I'm proud to have met you and to have faced you many times."" Gazzetta have outlined,externalfour candidates who could replace Ventura to ""rebuild from rubble and work for the 2020 Euros"". Former AC Milan, Juventus and Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti is the ""most liked"" name to take over, having been sacked as Bayern Munich boss earlier this season. He also leads the poll on the Gazzetta website. Chelsea boss Antonio Conte, who left the Italy job after Euro 2016, has also been mentioned as he is ""a bit tired of England"", while ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini, now at Zenit St Petersburg, and Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri have also been touted. Italian football journalist Mina Rzouki told BBC World Service Sport: It is a national tragedy. It feels surreal that in a World Cup where so many nations take part, Italy will not be there. It is a lot of mediocre players put together in the squad. The ones who do have talent have not been given the opportunity to show off their talents by Ventura. The oldest coach to take charge of Italy, it was amazing he did not have the room or tactics to bring in Lorenzo Insigne, considering how effective he has been for Serie A's best side Napoli. The very good players for Italy are the experienced veterans who did so well and Ventura was largely put in charge to bring through the young talents to mix with old players and take Italy forward. He did not manage that. This is not a great thing to happen to Italian football, but maybe it was needed and can look at it as a blessing in disguise. It may give an opportunity to rebuild and that means from the top, getting rid of the men who have been in power for so long. Ventura is perhaps not the right age for someone to adapt to the national team. He is only a man who won the Serie C title with Lecce so this is not someone with great experience of winning trophies. This is the chance to start afresh, bring in the right people at the top, on the pitch and those giving the strategies. It will no longer mask the deficiencies in Italian football.

"Emma Dent Coad has been accused of writing a ""racist"" article in a 2010 blog piece A Labour MP accused of writing a ""racist"" article about a London Assembly member has apologised for ""any offence caused"". Emma Dent Coadwrote a blog piece in 2010 in which she labelled Shaun Bailey a ""token ghetto boy"". Ms Dent Coad told BBC Radio London she had been quoting ""an Afro-Carribean"" constituent in her blog. Mr Bailey urged the Labour leadership ""to take the strongest disciplinary action possible"" against Ms Dent Coad. However, Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not withdraw the whip from the Kensington MP. He said he would ""obviously ensure that people discuss the use of language"" and ""make sure that everyone treats others with respect."" In a letter to the Labour leader, Mr Bailey called the apology ""cowardly"". Mr Bailey said: ""Despite her claims, she can provide no evidence that I or anyone else used the horrendous terms she advocated."" In the article Ms Dent Coad called Shaun Bailey the ""'token ghetto boy' standing behind D Cameron"" In the piece Ms Dent Coad claimed Mr Bailey, who was a parliamentary candidate for Hammersmith, had ""stigmatised"" the area he was born in by referring to it as a ""ghetto"". ""Who can say where this man will ever fit in, however hard he tries? One day he is the 'token ghetto boy' standing behind D Cameron, the next 'looking interested' beside G Osborne. Ever felt used?"", she wrote. Speaking on the Vanessa Feltz breakfast show on BBC London, Ms Dent Coad said: ""If [Mr Bailey] is offended, I apologise."" In another letter sent to Mr Corbyn, Conservative MPs Kemi Badenoch and James Cleverly called his ""failure to condemn her comments... disappointing and concerning"".

""I have not resigned because I haven't spoken to the president yet,"" Ventura, 69, said after the game. ""I'm sorry for being late, but every player I had the privilege of working with, I wanted to salute individually. ""Resignation? I have to evaluate an infinity of issues. We will meet with the federation and discuss it."" Barzagli, 36, said it was ""painful"" to ""leave this group of lads"". He added: ""I don't know what we missed. All I know is we're out of the World Cup. It's a unique disappointment. ""The era of four or five veterans comes to a close, the one of the hungry young players coming through begins and that's how it should be."" Lorenzo Insigne has scored three goals and made four assists for Napoli in Serie A this season There was a bizarre moment late in the game when De Rossi was asked to warm up but pointed instead at Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne, a player Ventura refused to call upon despite pressure from Italian media and supporters. ""I just said we were near the end and had to win, so send the strikers to warm up!"" said De Rossi. ""I pointed to Insigne too. ""I just thought perhaps it was better that Insigne come on instead."" Ultimately, De Rossi, 34, was not used either as Italy failed in their search for the goal that would have taken the tie to extra time. Italy's leading sports newspaperLa Gazzetta dello Sport,externalsaid the result brought the arrival of the ""apocalypse"". The article said: ""We will not be with you and you will not be with us. A love so great must be reserved for other things. Italy will not participate at the World Cup. ""It is time to start thinking about what else we can do in June: concerts, cinema, village festivals. Anything but watching Sweden play at the World Cup - that would be too painful."" On Buffon, former Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas said: ""I don't like seeing you like this. I want to see you as you've always been, as what you are for so many - as a legend. I'm proud to have met you and to have faced you many times."" Gazzetta have outlined,externalfour candidates who could replace Ventura to ""rebuild from rubble and work for the 2020 Euros"". Former AC Milan, Juventus and Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti is the ""most liked"" name to take over, having been sacked as Bayern Munich boss earlier this season. He also leads the poll on the Gazzetta website. Chelsea boss Antonio Conte, who left the Italy job after Euro 2016, has also been mentioned as he is ""a bit tired of England"", while ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini, now at Zenit St Petersburg, and Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri have also been touted. Italian football journalist Mina Rzouki told BBC World Service Sport: It is a national tragedy. It feels surreal that in a World Cup where so many nations take part, Italy will not be there. It is a lot of mediocre players put together in the squad. The ones who do have talent have not been given the opportunity to show off their talents by Ventura. The oldest coach to take charge of Italy, it was amazing he did not have the room or tactics to bring in Lorenzo Insigne, considering how effective he has been for Serie A's best side Napoli. The very good players for Italy are the experienced veterans who did so well and Ventura was largely put in charge to bring through the young talents to mix with old players and take Italy forward. He did not manage that. This is not a great thing to happen to Italian football, but maybe it was needed and can look at it as a blessing in disguise. It may give an opportunity to rebuild and that means from the top, getting rid of the men who have been in power for so long. Ventura is perhaps not the right age for someone to adapt to the national team. He is only a man who won the Serie C title with Lecce so this is not someone with great experience of winning trophies. This is the chance to start afresh, bring in the right people at the top, on the pitch and those giving the strategies. It will no longer mask the deficiencies in Italian football.

"Doctors have removed five bullets from the soldier's body - but suspect there are two more bullets inside A North Korean who defected at the heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone was shot at least five times and is in a critical condition, South Korea says. The soldier crossed to the South Korean side of the Joint Security Area (JSA) in the village of Panmunjom on Monday. He had driven near the JSA, but had to finish his journey by foot when a wheel came loose, the South said. North Korean troops shot at him 40 times - but he made it across and was found under a pile of leaves, it added. About 1,000 people from the North flee to the South each year - but very few defect via the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), which is one of the world's most heavily guarded strips of land. It is even more unusual for North Koreans to cross at the JSA, which is a tourist attraction, and the only portion of the DMZ where both forces stand face-to-face. North and South Korea are technically still at war, since the conflict between them ended in 1953 with a truce and not a formal peace treaty. South Korea's military gave more details of the soldier's condition on Tuesday. ""Until this morning, we heard he had no consciousness and was unable to breathe on his own - but his life can be saved,"" military official Suh Uk told lawmakers. Doctors had extracted five bullets from his body, but suspected there were two more inside, he added. How to dodge mines and snipers on the Korean border S Korea sees drop in defectors from North N Korean soldier defects across river The soldier had been spotted driving towards the JSA on Monday afternoon - but a wheel came off, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. ""He then exited the vehicle and continued fleeing south across the line as he was fired upon by other soldiers from North Korea,"" the US-led United Nations Command said. The defector took cover behind a building on the South Korea side - troops later found him collapsed under a pile of leaves, and crawled to the spot to recover him, the military added. The JSA is the only part of the DMZ where North and South Korean troops face each other South Korea's defence minister Song Young-moo told lawmakers that it was the first time North Korean soldiers had shot into the South's side of the JSA. Some MPs questioned whether this meant North Korea had violated the terms of the armistice agreement between the two sides, Yonhap news agency reported. Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have defected to the South since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The majority of the defectors flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected DMZ. China though regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them. On Tuesday, the BBC's Korean service spoke to one man whose wife and four-year-old son are currently in detention in China, and are likely to be repatriated to the North. Addressing Chinese President Xi Jinping,the man, who asked to be identified only as Mr Lee, urged the Chinese leader to ""please keep them alive and send them to South Korea"". He said his wife and son would either face execution or be put in a political prison camp if sent back to the North. ""My wife told me that the location of their safe house was revealed. After waiting an hour I called her again and she said she was arrested and cuffed. Then she hung up."" ""I realise I'm useless as there's nothing I can do... I'm deeply regretful - I will live under guilt until we meet again,"" he added. Separately, a US man was arrested after he tried to enter North Korea on Monday, Yonhap reported. The 58-year-old crossed the Civilian Control Line, which marks an extra buffer zone beneath the DMZ, for political purposes, the news agency said. He is currently being investigated by police.

"Tesco's Â£3.7bn takeover of food wholesaler Booker has been provisionally cleared by the UK's competition regulator. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal could even increase competition in the wholesale market and reduce prices for shoppers. Tesco and Booker did not compete head-to-head in most activities, it added. Booker is the UK's largest food wholesaler, and also owns the Premier, Budgens and Londis store brands. More than 30% of its sales are to the catering sector, which Tesco does not supply, although the supermarket is keen to get a foothold in the market. The CMA concluded,externalthat the wholesale market would ""remain competitive in the longer term"", because Booker's share of the UK grocery wholesaling market, at less than 20%, ""was not sufficient to justify the longer-term concerns"". Despite losing market share in recent years, Tesco remains the UK's biggest supermarket with a share of about 28%. The retail industry is undergoing a period of consolidation. A shift in shopping habits, fierce competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl, and the arrival of Amazon has prompted retailers to look to bolster their businesses by buying food wholesalers. What does Booker Group do? Nisa shareholders back Co-op takeover Five ways to fix our High Streets On Monday, shareholders in the Nisa wholesaler and convenience store group approved the company's Â£137m takeover by the Co-operative Group. Morrisons also recently signed a deal to become the UK wholesale supplier to convenience store chain McColls and it has also formed a tie-up with Amazon Christmas has come early for Tesco. The question in many minds was how many of its 1,700 convenience stores would it have to offload to get this deal through. In other words, what would the trade off need to be to secure what Tesco sees as the bigger long term prize of a slice of the growing out of home market. After an in depth look, including countless submissions from all part of the grocery sector, the regulator has come to the provisional conclusion that no remedies are needed. Tesco-Booker have won the argument that their stores don't directly compete with each other. The creation of an immensely powerful new combined food business now looks unstoppable. In reaching its conclusions, the CMA found that it was ""likely Booker would be able to negotiate better terms from a number of its suppliers for some of its groceries, and that it was likely to pass on some of the benefits of these savings to the shops that it supplies"". ""This might increase competition in the wholesale market, as well as reducing prices for shoppers."" Simon Polito, chair of the CMA's inquiry group, said: ""Our investigation has found that existing competition is sufficiently strong in both the wholesale and retail grocery sectors to ensure that the merger between Tesco and Booker will not lead to higher prices or a reduced service for supermarket and convenience shoppers."" Tesco and Booker both welcomed the CMA's provisional decision and added that they would continue to work with the competition regulator, which is due to publish its final report by the end of the year. Booker said it was ""pleased that the CMA has provisionally concluded that this transaction does not lessen competition"". Tesco said it anticipated the merger would be completed in early 2018. However, the CMA's findings were criticised by the managing director of wholesale group Landmark, John Mills. ""This move will not increase competition, it will destroy it,"" he said. ""The combined Tesco/Booker operation has sales of Â£60bn, the rest of the UK wholesale industry amounts to Â£25bn. Other wholesalers will not be able to compete with the buying and distribution power of Tesco/Booker. ""So Tesco, who account for Â£1 in every Â£8 spent in the High Street will now dominate the convenience and corner shop market. And will no doubt now dominate the food service/out of home market as well."" Following the CMA announcement Tesco's shares rose by 5.7% and Booker's were up by 6.1%.

"The UK's key inflation rate remained steady in October at a five-and-a-half-year high of 3%, official figures show. Higher food prices were offset by lower fuel costs, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The price of food and non-alcoholic drinks rose at an annual rate of 4.1%, the highest since September 2013. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) had been expected to rise, with the Bank of England forecasting it would peak at 3.2% this autumn. The official target for the CPI is 2%. If the CPI inflation rate had risen above 3%, Bank of England governor Mark Carney would have been forced to write to the chancellor explaining why it was so far above target. Kamal Ahmed: Price rises - is the worst over? Fewer High Street shops closing down Maike Currie at Fidelity International said Mr Carney could ""breathe a sigh of relief this month"". However, she added: ""While the Bank of England raised interest rates at the beginning of this month given concerns over inflation, it will take some time for inflation to fall back nearer the 2% target. ""This means cash-strapped consumers will continue to feel the pinch as wages lag price rises."" While food price inflation picked up last month, this was offset by the falling cost of motor fuel and lower furniture prices, the ONS said. The fall in the value of the pound since last year's Brexit referendum has contributed to the recent rise in inflation, as it has increased the cost of imported goods and services. However, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the latest inflation figures ""will add to the sense that the worst of this impact has already passed"". ""Data on company costs, which tend to change ahead of changes in consumer prices, are already shown signs of having peaked earlier in the year,"" he added. This video can not be played Pound's fall has driven inflation, says Mark Carney Earlier this month, Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe said the UK was ""probably through the worst"" of food price rises following the slide in the pound. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG said the ""relatively positive"" news on inflation could prompt the Bank to plan fewer rate rises in the next two to three years. ""That may help support a vulnerable UK economy in the process of leaving the EU, but at the same time it could put further strain on savers and significant sectors of the economy such as banks and insurers, while stoking potential pockets of over-exuberant asset prices,"" she said. October's Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 4%, up from 3.9% in September.  Government index-linked savings products and some train ticket prices rise in line with RPI. The ONS's preferred inflation measure of CPIH, which contains owner-occupiers' housing costs, was unchanged at 2.8%.

"The old Â£10 note is soon to go the way of the old pound coin If you still have any old Â£10 notes, make sure you spend them before 1 March next year. The Bank of England has announced that the old paper notes, featuring naturalist Charles Darwin, will no longer be legal tender after that date. Its days have been numbered since the new polymer tenner, depicting author Jane Austen, entered circulation in September. But the old note can still be exchanged by the Bank after the cut-off date. Threadneedle Street says polymer, also now used for the Â£5 note featuring Winston Churchill, is more durable and cleaner than paper notes. A see-through window featuring the Queen's portrait Winchester Cathedral shown in gold foil on the front of the note and silver on the back A quill at the side of the window which changes from purple to orange A hologram which contains the word ""Ten"" and changes to ""Pounds"" when the note is tilted A hologram of the coronation crown which appears 3D and multi-coloured when the note is tilted Micro-lettering beneath the Queen's portrait with tiny letters and numbers that are visible under a microscope A book-shaped copper foil patch which contains the letters JA The words ""Bank of England"" printed in intaglio (raised ink) along the top of the note It has persevered with the material despite complaints from religious and vegan groups that the animal fat tallow is used in the production process. Following consultation, the Bank said in August that it would continue with the use of tallow in future banknotes - saying it ""has not taken this decision lightly"". The Bank assessed whether palm oil or coconut oil should be used instead, but concluded that this might not be able to be sourced sustainably. Changing production would also involve considerable extra costs to taxpayers. The old Â£10 notes have been in circulation since November 2000, but lost out to the new ones on grounds of security as well as durability. The Jane Austen notes have a number of features built in that make them particularly hard to forge. They also have an inscription in raised dots that helps blind and partially-sighted users to identify them. The end of the old paper tenner follows the official withdrawal last month of the old round Â£1 coin, which has now been wholly replaced by the new 12-sided version.

"The security services have warned about the dangers of toys being exploited by malicious hackers Consumer watchdog Which? has called on retailers to stop selling some popular toys it says have ""proven"" security issues. Those toys include Furby Connect, the i-Que robot, Cloudpets and Toy-fi Teddy. Which? found that there was no authentication required between the toys and the devices they could link with via Bluetooth. Two of the manufacturers said they took security very seriously. The lack of authentication meant that, in theory, any device within physical range could link to the toy and take control or send messages, the watchdog said. ""Connected toys are becoming increasingly popular, but as our investigation shows, anyone considering buying one should apply a level of caution,"" said Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at Which? ""Safety and security should be the absolute priority with any toy. If that can't be guaranteed, then the products should not be sold."" Hasbro, which makes the Furby Connect, said in a statement that it believed the results of the tests carried out for Which? had been achieved in very specific conditions. This video can not be played Rory Cellan-Jones sees how Cayla, a talking child's doll, can be hacked to say any number of offensive things. ""A tremendous amount of engineering would be required to reverse-engineer the product as well as to create new firmware,"" it said. ""We feel confident in the way we have designed both the toy and the app to deliver a secure play experience."" I-Que maker Vivid Imagination said there had been ""no reports of these products being used in a malicious way"" but added that it would review Which?'s recommendations. Spiral Toys, which makes Cloudpets and Toy Fi, did not comment. Other toys tested by Which? included the Wowee Chip, Mattel Hello Barbie and Fisher Price Smart Toy Bear - but these were not found to have serious security concerns. Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, told the BBC it was a ""no brainer"" that toys with security issues should not be put on sale. ""Sadly, there have been many examples in the past two to three years of connected toys that have security flaws that put children at risk,"" he said. ""Whether it is sloppiness on the part of the manufacturer, or their rush to build a product down to a certain price, the consequences are the same. ""To produce these toys is bad enough, but to then stock them as a retailer knowing that they are potentially putting children at risk is quite unacceptable.""

"Head teachers from the Worth Less? campaign brought their message to Downing St Head teachers representing more than 5,000 schools across England are supporting a protest letter to the chancellor over ""inadequate"" funding. The letter, being delivered to Downing Street, warns of schools increasingly having to make ""desperate requests to parents for 'voluntary' donations"". Heads are calling for an extra Â£1.7bn per year for schools. The government has already moved Â£1.3bn of education funding directly into school budgets. The protest, ahead of next week's Budget, has been organised by regional groups of head teachers representing schools with 3.5 million pupils in 30 local authorities from Cornwall to Cumbria. It followsa letter warning about funding cuts, sent to the parentsof more than 2.5 million pupils in September. This is the biggest collective protest so far from the school funding campaigners, who have been warning of an overall lack of investment and a failure to resolve differences in levels of per pupil spending. ""It is extraordinary that some English secondary schools will receive 60% less funding than others of the same size,"" says the letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond. ""The impact on class sizes, curriculum offer and staffing is obvious,"" the heads write. ""A school receiving over Â£4m more than another could, for example, afford 133 more teachers."" West Sussex head Jules White co-ordinated a funding warning sent to 2.5 million families The government has recognised the regional anomalies in funding and published a new national funding formula. But the heads argue that changes in how funding is allocated will depend on there being enough overall money in the system. Despite the promise to move Â£1.3bn from the Department for Education's budget directly into school spending, the heads say they will still have faced a real-terms cut of Â£1.7bn between 2015 and 2020. Without this Â£1.7bn being restored, heads are warning the chancellor: they will not be able to afford to recruit teachers class sizes will rise subjects will have to be withdrawn sixth forms could close special needs pupils will not get the support they need Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the government ""needs to start listening to head teachers and concerned parents"". ""Despite Tory spin, the new funding formula does nothing to reverse the cuts to budgets and every penny they have found just comes from cutting other education provision - it isn't fair, and it isn't funded."" But school standards minister, Nick Gibb, said the Â£1.3bn being put into school budgets ""will put an end to historic disparities in the system"". ""There are no cuts in funding - every school will see an increase in funding through the formula from 2018, with secondary schools set to receive at least Â£4,800 per pupil by 2019-20. ""As the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has confirmed, overall schools funding is being protected at a national level in real terms per pupil over the next two years.""

"Tesco's Â£3.7bn takeover of food wholesaler Booker has been provisionally cleared by the UK's competition regulator. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal could even increase competition in the wholesale market and reduce prices for shoppers. Tesco and Booker did not compete head-to-head in most activities, it added. Booker is the UK's largest food wholesaler, and also owns the Premier, Budgens and Londis store brands. More than 30% of its sales are to the catering sector, which Tesco does not supply, although the supermarket is keen to get a foothold in the market. The CMA concluded,externalthat the wholesale market would ""remain competitive in the longer term"", because Booker's share of the UK grocery wholesaling market, at less than 20%, ""was not sufficient to justify the longer-term concerns"". Despite losing market share in recent years, Tesco remains the UK's biggest supermarket with a share of about 28%. The retail industry is undergoing a period of consolidation. A shift in shopping habits, fierce competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl, and the arrival of Amazon has prompted retailers to look to bolster their businesses by buying food wholesalers. What does Booker Group do? Nisa shareholders back Co-op takeover Five ways to fix our High Streets On Monday, shareholders in the Nisa wholesaler and convenience store group approved the company's Â£137m takeover by the Co-operative Group. Morrisons also recently signed a deal to become the UK wholesale supplier to convenience store chain McColls and it has also formed a tie-up with Amazon Christmas has come early for Tesco. The question in many minds was how many of its 1,700 convenience stores would it have to offload to get this deal through. In other words, what would the trade off need to be to secure what Tesco sees as the bigger long term prize of a slice of the growing out of home market. After an in depth look, including countless submissions from all part of the grocery sector, the regulator has come to the provisional conclusion that no remedies are needed. Tesco-Booker have won the argument that their stores don't directly compete with each other. The creation of an immensely powerful new combined food business now looks unstoppable. In reaching its conclusions, the CMA found that it was ""likely Booker would be able to negotiate better terms from a number of its suppliers for some of its groceries, and that it was likely to pass on some of the benefits of these savings to the shops that it supplies"". ""This might increase competition in the wholesale market, as well as reducing prices for shoppers."" Simon Polito, chair of the CMA's inquiry group, said: ""Our investigation has found that existing competition is sufficiently strong in both the wholesale and retail grocery sectors to ensure that the merger between Tesco and Booker will not lead to higher prices or a reduced service for supermarket and convenience shoppers."" Tesco and Booker both welcomed the CMA's provisional decision and added that they would continue to work with the competition regulator, which is due to publish its final report by the end of the year. Booker said it was ""pleased that the CMA has provisionally concluded that this transaction does not lessen competition"". Tesco said it anticipated the merger would be completed in early 2018. However, the CMA's findings were criticised by the managing director of wholesale group Landmark, John Mills. ""This move will not increase competition, it will destroy it,"" he said. ""The combined Tesco/Booker operation has sales of Â£60bn, the rest of the UK wholesale industry amounts to Â£25bn. Other wholesalers will not be able to compete with the buying and distribution power of Tesco/Booker. ""So Tesco, who account for Â£1 in every Â£8 spent in the High Street will now dominate the convenience and corner shop market. And will no doubt now dominate the food service/out of home market as well."" Following the CMA announcement Tesco's shares rose by 5.7% and Booker's were up by 6.1%.

"Drivers should have compulsory eye tests every 10 years, the Association of Optometrists has said.

"People who overdose on paracetamol could be helped by a blood test that shows immediately if they are going to suffer liver damage. Researchers in Edinburgh and Liverpool said the test would help doctors identify which patients arriving in hospital need more intensive treatment. The blood test detects levels of specific molecules in blood associated with liver damage. The three different molecules are called miR-122, HMGB1 and FL-K18. Previous studies have shown that levels of these markers are elevated in patients with liver damage long before current tests can detect a problem. A team led by the Universities of Edinburgh and Liverpool measured levels of the three markers in more than 1,000 patients across the UK who needed hospital treatment for paracetamol overdose. They found the test could accurately predict which patients are going to develop liver problems, and who may need to be treated for longer before they are discharged. The test could also help identify patients who could be safely discharged after treatment, freeing up hospital beds. About 50,000 people are admitted to hospital each year in the UK due to paracetamol overdose. Many people unknowingly consume too much by taking paracetamol at the same time as cold and flu medications that also contain the drug. Liver injuries are a common complication of drug overdoses. In some cases the damage can be so severe the patient needs a transplant and, in rare instances, can be fatal. Patients with a life-threatening level of paracetamol in their blood can be treated with an antidote called acetylcysteine, given by intravenous drip. The treatment is associated with side effects so doctors do not treat patients longer than necessary. The researchers said the test could help to pinpoint patients who are unlikely to benefit from treatment. The study, published in the Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, was funded by the Edinburgh and Lothians Health Foundation and the Medical Research Council. Dr James Dear, of the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Paracetamol overdose is very common and presents a large workload for already over-stretched emergency departments. ""These new blood tests can identify who will develop liver injury as soon as they first arrive at hospital. This could transform the care of this large, neglected, patient group.""

"The old Â£10 note is soon to go the way of the old pound coin If you still have any old Â£10 notes, make sure you spend them before 1 March next year. The Bank of England has announced that the old paper notes, featuring naturalist Charles Darwin, will no longer be legal tender after that date. Its days have been numbered since the new polymer tenner, depicting author Jane Austen, entered circulation in September. But the old note can still be exchanged by the Bank after the cut-off date. Threadneedle Street says polymer, also now used for the Â£5 note featuring Winston Churchill, is more durable and cleaner than paper notes. A see-through window featuring the Queen's portrait Winchester Cathedral shown in gold foil on the front of the note and silver on the back A quill at the side of the window which changes from purple to orange A hologram which contains the word ""Ten"" and changes to ""Pounds"" when the note is tilted A hologram of the coronation crown which appears 3D and multi-coloured when the note is tilted Micro-lettering beneath the Queen's portrait with tiny letters and numbers that are visible under a microscope A book-shaped copper foil patch which contains the letters JA The words ""Bank of England"" printed in intaglio (raised ink) along the top of the note It has persevered with the material despite complaints from religious and vegan groups that the animal fat tallow is used in the production process. Following consultation, the Bank said in August that it would continue with the use of tallow in future banknotes - saying it ""has not taken this decision lightly"". The Bank assessed whether palm oil or coconut oil should be used instead, but concluded that this might not be able to be sourced sustainably. Changing production would also involve considerable extra costs to taxpayers. The old Â£10 notes have been in circulation since November 2000, but lost out to the new ones on grounds of security as well as durability. The Jane Austen notes have a number of features built in that make them particularly hard to forge. They also have an inscription in raised dots that helps blind and partially-sighted users to identify them. The end of the old paper tenner follows the official withdrawal last month of the old round Â£1 coin, which has now been wholly replaced by the new 12-sided version.

"This video can not be played What's going on with the EU Withdrawal Bill? Several Tory MPs have joined Labour in demanding Theresa May withdraw a key Brexit legislation amendment to set the exact time of EU departure in law. Ministers say being ""crystal clear"" about when the UK will leave on 29 March 2019 will give maximum certainty. But ex-chancellor Ken Clarke said the move was ""silly"" while Dominic Grieve said it would ""fetter"" ministers' hands if talks dragged on to the last minute. Labour has branded it a ""gimmick"" and said it will vote against it. The row came as MPs began debating the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill in depth for the first time, a crucial piece of legislation paving the way for the UK's withdrawal by essentially copying all EU law into UK law. Tuesday's marathon eight-hour debate is the first of eight sessions over the next month in which MPs will pore over the details of the government's Brexit strategy and seek changes. The government saw off the first challenge to the bill as Plaid Cymru's call for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly to give their consent before the 1972 European Communities Act - which paved the way for the UK to originally join the then European Economic Community - can be repealed was defeated by 318 to 52 votes. BBC Parliament Live: MPs examine EU Bill Six people who will shape the Brexit battle Brexit: All you need to know Sturgeon talks with May 'constructive' A government amendment to enshrine the Brexit date and time - 23:00 GMT on 29 March  2019 - in law, announced by Mrs May last Friday, will not be debated until the final day of the committee stage next month. But it dominated the early skirmishes in the Commons as Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said setting a date in law was a ""desperate gimmick"" that was ""about party management not the national interest"". Labour says it is a question of how, not if, the UK leaves the EU that matters ""The government's amendments to their own Bill would stand in the way of an orderly transition and increase the chance of Britain crashing out of Europe without an agreement,"" the shadow Brexit secretary said. ""Theresa May should stop pandering to the 'no deal' enthusiasts in her own party and withdraw these amendments."" What is happening on Tuesday: The EU Withdrawal Bill is entering its Committee stage - meaning MPs will scrutinise it line-by-line First up is a four hour debate on the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act, the legislation that took Britain into the EU, or the EEC as it was then called MPs could discuss a call for the UK to stay in the EU until a new treaty has been signed on its future relationship Another amendment that has support is one that would give the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a bigger say About 7pm: Four hours of debate on how to interpret 40 years of accumulated EU law in UK law The future status of the European Court of Justice, which will cease to set UK laws on Brexit day, is also up for debate MPs are due to vote at about 7pm and 11pm but the government is not expected to be defeated at this stage A further seven days of debate have been scheduled in the run-up to Christmas, with the second day, on Wednesday, expected to include Labour's calls for guarantees on workers' rights and the environment. But former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve said that fixing the precise time of withdrawal at this stage would ""fetter"" the government's hands if negotiations dragged on longer than expected and the process needed to be extended in order to reach an agreement. Describing it as a ""mad"" idea that had not been discussed by the cabinet, he said it had been ""accompanied by blood-curdling threats that anyone who might stand in its way was somehow betraying the country's destiny"". ""I am afraid I am just not prepared to go along with it,"" he told MPs. And former chancellor Ken Clarke, the only Tory to vote against triggering Brexit, condemned what he said were ""silly amendments thrown out"" solely to get positive coverage in Brexit-supporting newspapers. This video can not be played Field: 'I've always bought my houses' This video can not be played Ken Clarke attacks government over Brexit bill Labour's Frank Field said he agreed with the need for a deadline, saying he had never taken on a job without a start date or bought a house without knowing when he would take possession. He agreed to withdraw his own amendment, specifying a date but not a precise hour of departure, after Brexit minister Steve Baker warned of ""legal chaos"" if the issue of timing was not ""put to rest"". ""The government wants this bill to provide as much certainty as possible,"" Mr Baker added. ""We recognise the importance of being crystal clear on the setting of exit day."" A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill Sturgeon talks with May 'constructive' Parliament to get vote on final Brexit deal Why Davis's Brexit vote announcement matters Ministers say the main aim of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill is to copy across EU rules into domestic UK law to ensure a smooth transition on the day after Brexit but critics say it is a power grab by the government which will allow ministers to change laws and regulations without going through Parliament first. Most MPs say they accept that Britain is leaving the EU but some are expected to use the debates to fight against what they call a ""hard Brexit"" where the UK leaves without a trade deal. This video can not be played Davis: Parliament will be given time to debate, scrutinise and vote on the final deal with the EU MPs have tabled more than 470 amendments - running to 186 pages - for changes they want to see before the Brexit bill is passed into law by both the Commons and the Lords. The government is not thought to be facing the serious prospect of defeat until next month, with a small group of about 10 Conservative rebels reportedly plotting with Labour and other opposition parties. MPs were told on Monday they would be able to debate and vote on any agreement negotiated with the EU by the government as the Brexit deal would have to become law via an Act of Parliament. But Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK would still leave the EU on 29 March 2019, whether MPs backed or rejected the deal - making MPs' vote a take-it-or-leave-it one on the Brexit deal, rather than one which could either halt Brexit or have the deal renegotiated. Speaking in the Commons, the SNP's Stephen Gethins said MPs were being offered a choice between a ""really bad deal and a really, really bad deal"" which he said was ""no choice at all"".

"The two leaders discussed the allegations at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam President Donald Trump appears to have rowed back on comments suggesting he believed the Russian president's denials of meddling in the US election. He was widely criticised after saying Vladimir Putin had been insulted by the allegations of Russian interference. On Sunday, Mr Trump clarified that he supported US intelligence agencies, who have long concluded that Russia tried to sway the 2016 poll in his favour. The two leaders briefly discussed the allegations at an Asia-Pacific summit. Questions surrounding Russia's role in last year's US elections and allegations of collusion involving Donald Trump's campaign team have dogged his presidency. Legal action has already been taken against several of his former aides as part of a justice department inquiry. Until now, President Trump has refused to acknowledge intelligence agency findings that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the run-up to the poll. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? After brief conversations with President Putin on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec), Mr Trump briefed reporters on Saturday on what had been said about Russian interference in the presidential campaign. ""Every time he sees me he says I didn't do that, and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. ""I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country."" He also disparaged key figures in the US intelligence community who concluded in January that Russian meddling had taken place, including former national intelligence chief James Clapper, ex-CIA director John Brennan and sacked FBI chief James Comey, whom he called ""political hacks"". Mr Trump and Mr Putin had three brief conversations over the weekend in Vietnam Asked to clarify his comments on Mr Putin's denials during a press conference with the Vietnamese president on Sunday, Mr Trump said: ""As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted."" Drawing a clear line between the current and previous leadership of the FBI, CIA and national intelligence he said ""As currently led, by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies."" ""What he believes, he believes,"" he added, of Mr Putin's belief that Russia did not meddle in the presidential campaign. He later took to Twitter to attack ""haters and fools"", who, he said, did not encourage good relations between Russia and the US. Allow Twitter content?

In his tweets, Mr Trump also said his predecessor, Barack Obama, had lacked ""chemistry"" with President Putin. Mr Trump's original comments came under vehement criticism at home with lawmakers and intelligence figures questioning whether he had accepted the Russian president's denials of interference, despite intelligence findings to the contrary. Republican Senator John McCain, a strident critic of Mr Trump, called him naive for ""taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community"" Adam Schiff, ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted: ""You know who else is insulted by it, Mr President? The American people. You believe a foreign adversary over your own intelligence agencies."" Mr Clapper told Reuters: ""The fact that he would take Putin at his word over the intelligence community is unconscionable."" A CIA statement passed to US media said: ""The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed."" Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Da Nang Donald Trump once again goes against the findings of his own intelligence agencies. Because although the US justice department is investigating the scale and nature of Russian interference in the election of 2016 (and any links to the Trump campaign), the American intelligence community has already long determined that Russia did, indeed, interfere. Yet Mr Trump suggested this story was not only entirely fabricated by his political opponents, it might even be costing lives in Syria, because it is getting in the way of his relationship with the Russian president and hampering their ability to help solve the conflict together. ""People will die because of it, and it's a pure hit job, and it's artificially induced and that's a shame,"" he said. It is hard to know what the president hopes to achieve with this type of rhetoric. The investigation goes on. The CIA and other intelligence agencies have already concludedthat Russia was behind the DNC hack in the run-up to last year's presidential election. The contents of the emails, passed to Wikileaks and posted online, were embarrassing to the Democrats and shook up the presidential campaign, which ended in defeat for Hillary Clinton. In addition to the justice department inquiry, led by special investigator Robert Mueller, congressional committees have been set up to carry out their own investigations. The presidential campaign was fiercely contested Relations between the US and Russia have been strained for years, with the Kremlin long accusing Washington of seeking to sway elections in Russia and other ex-Soviet states including Ukraine and Georgia. While Russian hackers are widely suspected of involvement, there has been no conclusive link to the Kremlin. Denying that Russia had tried to interfere last year by fostering contacts with Mr Trump's campaign, Mr Putin told reporters in Vietnam: ""Everything about the so-called Russian dossier in the US is a manifestation of a continuing domestic political struggle."" 18 revelations from Wikileaks emails Russia's 'cyber war' against the West Last month,former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to having lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He testified that Russian nationals had contacted him in an attempt to gain influence with the Trump campaign, offering ""dirt"" in the form of ""thousands of emails"" on Mrs Clinton in April 2016 - two months before the DNC emails were leaked. Mr Trump has played down the importance of Mr Papadopoulos, calling him a ""low-level volunteer"" and ""liar"". On Saturday, Mr Putin brushed aside US media reports that a woman wrongly identified by Mr Papadopoulos as the Russian president's niece had offered to help broker meetings with Kremlin officials. ""I do not know anything about it and I think it is just some fantasies,"" Mr Putin said. Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and an associate were also placed under house arrest on charges of money laundering as a result of the Mueller inquiry, but the charges do not relate to the election.

"This video can not be played ""We will end the supremacy of EU law"" - Davis It's crunch time for the government's EU Withdrawal Bill - the bill which aims to ensure European law will no longer apply in the UK after Brexit. This key plank of legislation, once known as the Great Repeal Bill, has reached committee stage in the House of Commons, which is the bit where there will be hundreds of attempts by MPs to change its wording. As its informal name suggests, therepeal bill,externalwill repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which took Britain into the EU and meant that European law took precedence over laws passed in the UK Parliament. It will also end the power of the European Court of Justice in the UK. All existing EU legislation will be copied across into domestic UK law to ensure a smooth transition on the day after Brexit. The government says it wants to avoid a ""black hole in our statute book"" and avoid disruption to businesses and individual citizens as the UK leaves the EU. The UK Parliament can then ""amend, repeal and improve"" individual laws as necessary. Ensuring the continuity of EU rules and regulations is also meant to aid trade negotiations with the EU because the UK will already meet all of its product stands. The repeal bill will mean the UK is no longer bound by the European Court of Justice The bill is likely to be ""one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK"", areport,externalby the House of Commons library predicts, with ""major swathes of the statute book"" needing to be examined to see how they will work after Brexit. This is because working out which bits of UK law came from the EU is not as simple as it may sound. In fact, it presents a ""unique challenge"", a House of Lords committee warned, because ""the body of EU law is found in a number of different places, and in a number of different forms"". Simply transposing all EU law into UK legislation will not be enough, the government'sWhite Paper,externalon the bill says. Swathes of UK law ""will no longer work"" on exit, for example because they refer to EU institutions. Not all of this can be done through the repeal bill, so the government plans to create powers to ""correct the statute book where necessary"" - without full Parliamentary scrutiny. This power - known as Henry VIII power - is the one of the most controversial features of the bill (see below). More complications are presented by the government's negotiations with the EU, which will be taking place while the bill is passing through Parliament. Those talks could shape what the UK's post-Brexit laws look like - but the repeal bill will need to be done and dusted by the day the UK leaves. The government is expected to use powers known as Henry VIII clauses The government plans to enact its ""corrections"" to the statute book using what are known as Henry VIII powers, after the Statute of Proclamations 1539 which gave him the power to legislate by proclamation. Given that this will not involve the usual Parliamentary scrutiny process, opposition parties have protested, with Labour claiming ministers were being handed ""sweeping powers"" to make hasty, ill thought-out legislation. Ministers have attempted to reassure critics by saying such measures will be time-limited and not used to make policy changes. In total, the government estimates that 800 to 1,000 measures called statutory instruments will be required to make sure the bill functions properly. The European Commission proposes new EU legislation A lot. The government's White Paper says there is ""no single figure"" for this, but that there are believed to be 12,000 EU regulations (one type of EU law) in force, while Parliament has passed 7,900 statutory instruments implementing EU legislation and 186 acts which incorporate a degree of EU influence. The total body of European law, dating back to 1958, is known as the Acquis Communautaire. It binds all member states and in 2010 was estimated to consist of about 80,000 items, covering everything from workers' rights to environment and trade. As well as regulations, this includes EU treaties, directions and European Court of Justice rulings. New EU legislation is being created all the time and will continue to apply to the UK until it leaves. Different types of EU legislation work in different ways, and will be treated differently by the bill. So regulations, which apply automatically in the UK, will be converted into UK law. But directives require a new UK law to come into force - this legislation will be preserved by the bill. Reality check: How much UK law comes from the EU? MPs have already voted to approve the second reading of the bill, by 326 votes to 290. But there are many hurdles ahead and on Tuesday the line-by-line scrutiny of how it will operate begins. As tends to happen with legislation deemed to be of constitutional importance, this 'committee stage' is taking place on the floor of the House of Commons, so all MPs can take part. Eight days have been allocated for this process, which will be followed by more stages including the bill's passage through the House of Lords. The plan is for it to be passed ahead of the UK's exit from the EU but to become law only when it actually leaves, in March 2019. Read more: A guide to the EU bill's journey through Parliament Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems all opposed the bill at second reading, and MPs from all parties - with the exception of the DUP - are now trying to amend it at committee stage. Labour's suggested changes include trying to maintain a role for the European Court of Justice during the transition phase planned after March 2019. There is also a cross-party attempt to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal in place. Until the UK actually leaves, EU law will continue to apply. But after leaving, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act (as it will be by then) comes into force. The government says having the legislation in place will ensure a ""calm and orderly exit"". Then begins the long-term process of the government, and Parliament, choosing what it wants to do with the laws it has incorporated from the EU. With so many pieces of legislation to be considered, this could turn out to be a ""major drain on resources"" and should not ""crowd out"" other government policies, the Institute for Government think tank has warned. The Scottish Parliament is likely to get a vote on the Great Repeal Bill Some of the EU laws are in areas that are controlled by the devolved administrations - so do they now become part of Westminster law, or will they be added to the statute book in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? It is not entirely clear how this will work, although the government says it will work closely with the devolved administrations. It also predicts the repeal process will result in a ""a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration"", as powers in devolved areas are repatriated from Brussels. But the bill has been described by the Scottish government as an ""executive power grab"". Ministers have confirmed the devolved administrationswill be asked to consent to the bill- but this does not amount to a veto. The UK government has warned that blocking the bill could have ""very significant consequences"", leaving ""a hole in our law"".

"Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump had kept the world guessing about whether they would formally meet in Vietnam US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to fight so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria until its defeat. A statement was prepared by experts after the leaders met briefly on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam on Saturday. In total, they had three encounters within 24 hours at the summit. During one conversation, Mr Trump said Mr Putin had denied allegations of meddling in the US 2016 election. Questions over Mr Trump's ties to Moscow have dogged his presidency, with key former aides under investigation for alleged collusion with Russia. The two stood side by side in matching shirts for a group photo on Friday A formal bilateral meeting between the two presidents had been widely expected at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in the port city of Da Nang, but Mr Putin later said scheduling issues had got in the way. The pair met for the first time in July at the G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg. How different are Trump and Putin? Did dinner chat break diplomatic protocol? Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House A statement released by the Kremlin on Saturday said the leaders had ""agreed that the conflict in Syria has no military solution"". They also confirmed their ""determination to defeat Isis [another term for IS]"" and called on all parties to take part in the Geneva peace process. According to Russia's Interfax news agency, they promised to maintain existing Russian-US military channels of communication to prevent ""serious incidents involving the forces of partners combating IS"". Russia has been the Syrian government's main ally in the six-year-long civil war. The US meanwhile has been backing Syrian Arab and Kurdish rebels on the ground, and since 2014 it has led a coalition carrying out air strikes against IS in Syria. The jihadist group has been pushed out of its main strongholds in Syria in recent months by a combination of offensives involving the Syrian army and the Kurdish and Arab coalition. Last month the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared they were in full control of Raqqa, a city that became the headquarters of IS's self-styled ""caliphate"" in 2014. The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' What will happen in Syria following IS defeats? Iran building base in Syria - claim Mr Trump and President Putin posed side by side for a photo in custom-made blue shirts for the summit on Friday.

The two men were seen chatting as they joined a larger group shot of attendees at the summit Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also met his US counterpart Rex Tillerson earlier the same day, a source from the Russian delegation told Interfax news agency. The Kremlin said the two had co-ordinated the statement on Syria especially for the meeting in Da Nang.

"Boris Johnson is to visit Moscow later this year as part of efforts to build a more constructive dialogue with Russia on global security issues. The foreign secretary has been invited by his counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Items on the agenda are likely to include North Korea, Iran and security for next year's football World Cup. The Foreign Office said the UK had ""deep differences"" with Russia but the visit was part of a policy of ""sustained and robust engagement"". Mr Johnson was due to visit Moscow in April, but the trip was cancelled following a deadly chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held town in Syria. The atrocity was blamed on President Assad's regime, which is backed by the Russians, although the Syrian government has denied using nerve gas. The attack prompted a military response from the US, which bombed a Syrian air base it suspected of storing chemical weapons. The UK's relations with Russia have been strained for several years but the two foreign ministers have met on several occasions this year, most recently at the UN General Assembly in September. The Foreign Office said the bilateral visit, a date for which has not been set, did not mean a return ""to business as usual"" with Russia following its annexation of Crimea, which prompted EU sanctions, its wider actions in Ukraine and its continued support for the Assad regime. Boris Johnson will meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov But it said it was vital in the UK's national interest to keep ""channels of communication"" open. ""Russia is a fellow permanent member of the UN Security Council and there are global security issues we need to discuss from Iran to North Korea,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Of course we will continue to challenge Russia's approach where we disagree, whether that is Russia's actions in Syria or its aggression towards Ukraine. My visit will provide an opportunity to talk about these issues and more, face-to-face. ""Our relationship with Russia is not straightforward. That is all the more reason to be talking to Russia - to manage our differences and cooperate where possible for the security of both our nations and the international community."" As well as government meetings, the foreign secretary said he would also speak to figures from Russian society and the ""next generation"".

"Bailiffs were called in to collect debts by councils in England and Wales on more than two million occasions last year, a charity has discovered. Council tax arrears accounted for 60% of cases sent to bailiffs by local authorities in 2016-17, the Money Advice Trust said. The Trust, which runs National Debtline, said more could be done for the vulnerable in debt. The association representing councils said they had a duty to collect taxes. Enforcement agents, commonly known as bailiffs, were used to chase council tax arrears on 1.38 million occasions out of 2.3 million cases, the ""Stop the Knock"" report by the Money Advice Trust found. They were also used on 810,000 occasions for unpaid parking fines, 86,000 times for unpaid business rates, and on 50,000 occasions to recover overpaid housing benefit, the report found. The use of bailiffs has risen by 14% compared with two years ago when similar research was carried out by the charity. However, it said that there had been widespread improvement in the way councils used this last resort. Its concern was, primarily, in the use of bailiffs by smaller councils. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: ""The growing use of bailiffs to collect debts by many local authorities is deeply troubling. ""Councils are under enormous financial pressure, and they of course need to recover what they are owed in order to fund vital services. However, many councils are far too quick to turn to bailiff action."" She said that, in doing so, people could be pushed even further into debt. ""Bailiff action should only ever be used as a last resort, and can be avoided by early intervention,"" she added. Some 50 councils had signed up to a protocol aimed at preventing those at risk from getting behind on key payments. The Trust wanted more councils to sign up to an official policy on how to treat vulnerable residents, and to exempt the most vulnerable from bailiff action completely. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said people facing difficulties should contact their local authority to discuss options such as repayment plans. Claire Kober, who chairs the LGA's resources board, said: ""No council wants to ask people on the lowest incomes to pay more, but councils have a duty to their residents to collect taxes - these fund crucial services, such as caring for the elderly, protecting vulnerable children, keeping roads maintained and collecting bins. ""With councils facing a Â£5.8bn funding shortfall by 2020, it is essential that these funds are collected so these vital services can be protected."" She said that councils took steps, where possible, to ensure people in financial difficulty were supported. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""We expect councils to show sympathy for people in genuine hardship and only use bailiffs as a last resort. However, every penny of council tax that is not collected means a higher bill for those law-abiding citizens who do pay on time. ""To support those facing financial difficulties we have given councils the powers to establish their own council tax support schemes to best meet their local need.""

"President Rouhani visited Sarpol-e Zahab on Tuesday - the buildings behind him highlight the difference in damage between privately-built and state-built homes Iranians living outdoors in bitterly cold temperatures after an earthquake are making desperate pleas for help. About 540 people were killed and close to 8,000 injured when the quake hit near the Iran-Iraq border on Sunday. The government is scrambling to get aid to the worst-hit Kermanshah province, where hundreds of homes were destroyed. President Hassan Rouhani, visiting the region, said state-built houses suffered more damage, and those responsible would be held accountable. Night-time temperatures in Kermanshah province fell close to freezing for the second night in succession. Ali Gulani, 42, lives in the province's badly-hit town of Qasr-e-Shirin, and told BBC Persian people were burning crates to try to stay warm. ""We are living in a tent and we don't have enough food or water,"" he said. ""You can hear children crying, it's too cold. They are holding on to their parents to warm themselves - it's pretty bad."" Mr Gulani said there were an average of three strong aftershocks an hour, provoking panic. Close to 200 aftershocks have hit the region since the magnitude-7.3 earthquake on Sunday night. It was one of the strongest on earth this year, as well as the deadliest. Iranians explain what they've lost Latest images of aftermath Mr Gulani said he understood aid had been despatched within the province, but that people in his town had not yet received help. Instead, people were having to trek to the other side of town to get water from a tank.

She said now that rescue operations had ended, the priority was getting people into shelters as quickly as possible, and that the delivery of aid was on track. Maj Gen Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), said that the immediate needs were tents, water and food. ""Newly constructed buildings... held up well, but the old houses built with earth were totally destroyed,"" he told state TV while visiting the affected region. The Iranian Red Crescent said many areas lacked water and electricity and that aid supplies were being hampered by roads blocked by landslides.

"This video can not be played 'I was terrified' says Moore accuser A fifth woman has accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct as Republicans increase calls for him to ""step aside"". Beverly Young Nelson said she was 16 years old when Mr Moore allegedly tried to force himself on her after offering a ride home from her job as a waitress. ""I tried fight him off while yelling at him to stop,"" she said, adding that he locked his car to prevent her escape. Mr Moore, 70, denies the allegations, describing them as a ""witch hunt"". But Senator Cory Gardner, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, said on Monday he believes Mr Moore's accusers ""spoke with courage and truth"" and the former Alabama Supreme Court judge should be expelled if he is elected. ""If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,"" he said. Mrs Nelson's accusation comes after four other women detailed allegations of sexual misconduct by the conservative firebrand while they were teenagers in Alabama. The 56-year-old said she met Mr Moore during the late 1970s at the Olde Hickory House restaurant in Gadsen, Alabama, where she worked as a waitress while she was a teenager. She claimed Mr Moore, a 30-year-old deputy district attorney at the time, offered to sign her high school yearbook and wrote: ""To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas."" He signed it ""Love, Roy Moore, DA"", according to a copy of the yearbook page provided to reporters by her attorney, Gloria Allred. About a week or two later, he allegedly offered to drive her home and instead drove to the back of the restaurant car park. ""I was terrified. He was also trying to pull my shirt off. I thought he was going to rape me,"" she told reporters at a news conference on Monday. ""At some point he gave up and he then looked at me and he told me, 'You're just a child,' and he said, 'I am the district attorney of Etowah County. If you tell anyone about this, no one will believe you"", Mrs Nelson said, adding that her neck was bruised in the struggle. ""He finally allowed me to open the door and I either fell out or he pushed me out."" Why people are posting #MeAt14 Moore Campaign Chairman Bill Armistead denied the charges, calling Mr Moore ""an innocent man"". ""This is a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character,"" he said. Mr Moore's wife also vehemently denies the allegations, contending that her husband's accusers are being paid. Earlier on Monday US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said that he believed the women accusing Mr Moore of inappropriate behaviour. Mr McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky that party officials have considered whether another Republican could challenge Mr Moore in next month's election, through a so-called write-in challenge. He said Luther Strange, whom Mr Moore beat in the Republican primary earlier this year, was a possible option. Roy Moore said Mitch McConnell is the one who should step aside No matter what happens between now and the 12 December election, Mr Moore's name will remain on the voters' ballot, the Alabama secretary of state has confirmed. Alabama law prohibits the replacement of a party candidate up to 76 days before the election. However, voters are free to ""write-in"" any name they choose and the party might encourage support for another Republican candidate. The state Republican party could also disqualify Mr Moore's nomination, meaning that if he won the most votes he would still not be declared the winner. Failing that, if Mr Moore won the election, the US Senate could vote to expel him by arguing that he lacked fitness to serve. Last week's Washington Post story quoted four women by name, including one who alleged Mr Moore initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 - beneath the legal age of consent in Alabama - while he was a prosecutor in his 30s. Mr Moore has said the Washington Post story is a fabricated smear by his political opponents, calling it ""a prime example of fake news"". Mr McConnell previously said Mr Moore should step aside only if the allegations were proven true. Conservatives back firebrand after abuse report Roy Moore on gays, Muslims and Darwin But on Monday he said flatly: ""I believe the women. Yes.""

"This video can not be played Davis: Parliament will be given time to debate, scrutinise and vote on the final deal with the EU Parliament is to be given a take-it-or leave-it vote on the final Brexit deal before the UK leaves the EU. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the terms of the UK's exit, such as money, citizen rights and any transition must become law via a new Act of Parliament. Labour welcomed a ""climbdown"" but some MPs warned of a ""sham"" if ministers could not be asked to renegotiate. Sources have told the BBC some Tory rebels were unimpressed, with one saying the promise was ""meaningless"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the announcement was significant because it represented a big concession to potential Tory rebels and Labour MPs at a highly important moment in the Brexit process. It comes as MPs prepare to debate key Brexit legislation later this week with the government facing possible defeat on aspects of the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will convert EU law into UK law. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, irrespective of whether MPs back or reject the terms of the deal negotiated by Theresa May's government. Laura Kuenssberg: Why Brexit vote announcement matters Brexit: All you need to know DUP 'should not influence Brexit options' But updating MPs on the sixth round of talks which concluded on Friday, Mr Davis told MPs they would still play a major role and ""there cannot be any doubt that Parliament will be intimately involved at every stage"". The government had previously agreed to give MPs and peers a vote on a Commons motion relating to the final Brexit deal - before it has been voted upon by the European Parliament. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor A confident government wouldn't have conceded like this the day before the Brexit debate was due to come back to the Commons in earnest. This climbdown does not remotely mean that other grievances over the existing Brexit legislation will disappear. It doesn't mean that the next few weeks will suddenly become plain sailing. And if there isn't a withdrawal deal with the rest of the EU, well, then there can't be a bill that covers the withdrawal bill. It's only in the coming days that the government will know if they have done enough to get the existing plans through. And the move also of course adds to a massive load of complicated Parliamentary business that has to be cleared before we actually leave. Why Brexit vote announcement matters Mr Davis said he still ""intended and expected"" this to happen but went further - agreeing to Labour and Tory MPs' demands for any vote to take place on substantive primary legislation, which would allow MPs and peers to amend the bill before it became law. The bill, he told MPs, would contain the contents of the withdrawal agreement that the UK hopes to seal in time ahead of its scheduled departure and all key aspects of it - such as the financial settlement between the two sides, the future status of UK and EU citizens and the terms of any implementation period. May warns rebels as Brexit timing set out EU business groups call for Brexit deal ""This means that Parliament will be given time to scrutinise, debate and vote on the final deal we strike with the EU,"" he said, adding that it was not clear when such a bill would be published. Labour's Keir Starmer said it was a ""significant climbdown from a weak government on the verge of defeat"". ""With less than 24 hours before they had to defend their flawed bill to Parliament, they have finally backed down,"" the shadow Brexit secretary said. ""However, like everything with this government, the devil will be in the detail."" Labour's Chris Leslie said what ""could have been a very welcome concession instead looks like a sham that pretends to respect the sovereignty of Parliament but falls well short of what is required"". The Lib Dems reiterated their call for the final deal to be put to a referendum while several Tory MPs questioned what would happen if a deal was only agreed at the last minute before the 29 March deadline - a scenario Mr Davis has suggested was conceivable - and MPs could only vote after exit. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former Attorney General, said this would not be acceptable and if time ran out then negotiations with the EU should be extended ""so all parties are able to deal with it"". And Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach pressed Mr Davis to reassure MPs how ""if the bill intended to ensure a meaningful vote only comes forward after that date, the vote is in any sense meaningful"". Mr Davis responded by saying MPs would have the opportunity to say ""either you want the deal or you don't want it"" and if the UK and EU could not agree a deal, there would be no legislation. But, in a meeting with the Conservative chief whip, a group of about a dozen Tory MPs expressed anger at the government's plans, sources have told the BBC. One of the MPs, Anna Soubry, said the idea of a Brexit Act of Parliament was ""'insultingâ¦ it sounds in theory very good but there's no guarantee"". She suggested that the promise was ""meaningless"" and that the government is in ""grave difficulty"" over passing its Brexit legislation in the coming months.

"Emma Dent Coad has been accused of writing a ""racist"" article in a 2010 blog piece A Conservative London Assembly member has accused a Labour MP of writing a ""racist"" article about him before she entered Parliament. Emma Dent Coad wrote a blog piece in 2010 in which she labelled Shaun Bailey a ""token ghetto boy"". Mr Bailey said the MP should apologise for the ""hate-filled, racist article"". A spokesman for Ms Dent Coat, who was elected to Kensington in June, said she had been quoting Mr Bailey's ""own comments about parts of the borough"". In the article Ms Dent Coad called Shaun Bailey the ""'token ghetto boy' standing behind D Cameron"" In the piece Ms Dent Coad claimed Mr Bailey, who was a parliamentary candidate for Hammersmith, had ""stigmatised"" the area he was born in by referring to it as a ""ghetto"". ""Who can say where this man will ever fit in, however hard he tries? One day he is the 'token ghetto boy' standing behind D Cameron, the next 'looking interested' beside G Osborne. Ever felt used?,"" she wrote. After the blog post was highlighted, Mr Bailey said he had never been ""labelled a 'token ghetto boy'"" before and was ""shocked and saddened"" by the article. He said Ms Dent Coad's ""use of language should not be acceptable for an elected politician... and she should be ashamed"", he said. ""I am proud of where I am from and would certainly not use language like ghetto in a way to disparage the area I grew up in,"" the London Assembly member said. Ms Dent Coad's spokesman said it was clear in the original post she had been quoting Mr Bailey's ""own comments... plus those of his Conservative colleagues on Kensington and Chelsea Council"".

"This video can not be played CCTV of acid attack in London club A man has been found guilty of carrying out an acid attack in a packed London club which left 22 people injured. Arthur Collins, the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, threw the corrosive substance at revellers in Mangle E8 in Dalston on 17 April. The 25-year-old admitted throwing the liquid but had claimed he believed it was a date rape drug. He was convicted at Wood Green Crown Court. Andre Phoenix, who was accused of helping him,was found not guilty. How a night out ended in scars for life 'Arthur Collins victim- It felt like my skin was being eaten alive - BBC Newsbeat' Twenty-two people were injured, 16 of those suffering serious burns, when Collins sprayed acid over revellers inside the busy east London venue at about 01:00 BST. One man suffered third-degree chemical burns to the left side of the face and required a skin graft. Others had eye injuries. Arthur Collins had denied knowing the substance he threw was acid Phoebe Georgiou, who had been celebrating her 23rd birthday in the club that night, said she still suffers from night terrors and anxiety about being in crowded places having been hit by the substance. When she was taken to hospital she said she ""saw my reflection in the shower hold, which was so shocking because my whole chest looked like it had been ripped apart and I could see the inside of my chest and my arm"". ""I have a life sentence to deal with, with scars and mental injuries,"" she said. A solicitor for two of the other victims said Collins' ""despicable crime"" had ""changed the lives of so many people in the club that night"". Twenty-two people were injured when acid was thrown in the Mangle E8 nightclub CCTV shown in court showed clubbers clutching their faces and running off the dancefloor as they were hit with the liquid. Victims told the jury their skin began ""blistering straight away"" and described a burning smell. The liquid was later found to have a rating of pH1, equal to strong acids such as those used in battery acid. Collins told the court during the trial he had been at the club celebrating the news of Ms McCann's pregnancy, which the couple had revealed to her family the previous day. He was seen on CCTV getting into a confrontation with a group of men in the club before he sprayed liquid from a bottle over the crowd. Andre Phoenix (left) was acquitted earlier on Monday of helping Arthur Collins (right) carry out the attack Following the trial the Met said Collins had grabbed the bottle ""from the back pocket of an unidentified man"". Collins, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, had claimed in court he had taken the bottle from that group and thought it was a date rape drug. However, the jury found him guilty of five counts of GBH with intent, and nine counts of ABH against 14 people. Collins will be sentenced on 19 December. The attack happened in Mangle E8 in Dalston on 17 April He was not arrested for several days after the attack and was eventually detained when officers Tasered him after he tried to flee by jumping from an upstairs window of a house in Northamptonshire. Scotland Yard said he answered no comment to all questions put to him after he was detained. Det Ch Supt Simon Laurence said Collins had intended to ""inflict serious harm"" on a large number of people in a ""barbaric and cowardly act"". Collins sent a message to his sister reading: ""Tell mum to mind that little hand wash in my car acid"" The court heard Collins had sent a text to his sister a week before the attack, reading: ""Tell mum to mind that little hand wash in my car acid"". Collins claimed he was referring to hair-thickening shampoo which contained amino acid, which he needed for his hair after having two hair transplants. He had said he kept the shampoo in his car so his girlfriend did not find out about his hair loss. Lily Saw, London CPS reviewing lawyer, said the prosecution had ""proved this acid attack was no accident"". ""Acid can be as much of a weapon as a knife with equally damaging consequences,"" she said. Moment of acid attack in London club.

"Bailiffs were called in to collect debts by councils in England and Wales on more than two million occasions last year, a charity has discovered. Council tax arrears accounted for 60% of cases sent to bailiffs by local authorities in 2016-17, the Money Advice Trust said. The Trust, which runs National Debtline, said more could be done for the vulnerable in debt. The association representing councils said they had a duty to collect taxes. Enforcement agents, commonly known as bailiffs, were used to chase council tax arrears on 1.38 million occasions out of 2.3 million cases, the ""Stop the Knock"" report by the Money Advice Trust found. They were also used on 810,000 occasions for unpaid parking fines, 86,000 times for unpaid business rates, and on 50,000 occasions to recover overpaid housing benefit, the report found. The use of bailiffs has risen by 14% compared with two years ago when similar research was carried out by the charity. However, it said that there had been widespread improvement in the way councils used this last resort. Its concern was, primarily, in the use of bailiffs by smaller councils. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: ""The growing use of bailiffs to collect debts by many local authorities is deeply troubling. ""Councils are under enormous financial pressure, and they of course need to recover what they are owed in order to fund vital services. However, many councils are far too quick to turn to bailiff action."" She said that, in doing so, people could be pushed even further into debt. ""Bailiff action should only ever be used as a last resort, and can be avoided by early intervention,"" she added. Some 50 councils had signed up to a protocol aimed at preventing those at risk from getting behind on key payments. The Trust wanted more councils to sign up to an official policy on how to treat vulnerable residents, and to exempt the most vulnerable from bailiff action completely. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said people facing difficulties should contact their local authority to discuss options such as repayment plans. Claire Kober, who chairs the LGA's resources board, said: ""No council wants to ask people on the lowest incomes to pay more, but councils have a duty to their residents to collect taxes - these fund crucial services, such as caring for the elderly, protecting vulnerable children, keeping roads maintained and collecting bins. ""With councils facing a Â£5.8bn funding shortfall by 2020, it is essential that these funds are collected so these vital services can be protected."" She said that councils took steps, where possible, to ensure people in financial difficulty were supported. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""We expect councils to show sympathy for people in genuine hardship and only use bailiffs as a last resort. However, every penny of council tax that is not collected means a higher bill for those law-abiding citizens who do pay on time. ""To support those facing financial difficulties we have given councils the powers to establish their own council tax support schemes to best meet their local need.""

"This video can not be played 'I was terrified' says Moore accuser A fifth woman has accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct as Republicans increase calls for him to ""step aside"". Beverly Young Nelson said she was 16 years old when Mr Moore allegedly tried to force himself on her after offering a ride home from her job as a waitress. ""I tried fight him off while yelling at him to stop,"" she said, adding that he locked his car to prevent her escape. Mr Moore, 70, denies the allegations, describing them as a ""witch hunt"". But Senator Cory Gardner, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, said on Monday he believes Mr Moore's accusers ""spoke with courage and truth"" and the former Alabama Supreme Court judge should be expelled if he is elected. ""If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,"" he said. Mrs Nelson's accusation comes after four other women detailed allegations of sexual misconduct by the conservative firebrand while they were teenagers in Alabama. The 56-year-old said she met Mr Moore during the late 1970s at the Olde Hickory House restaurant in Gadsen, Alabama, where she worked as a waitress while she was a teenager. She claimed Mr Moore, a 30-year-old deputy district attorney at the time, offered to sign her high school yearbook and wrote: ""To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas."" He signed it ""Love, Roy Moore, DA"", according to a copy of the yearbook page provided to reporters by her attorney, Gloria Allred. About a week or two later, he allegedly offered to drive her home and instead drove to the back of the restaurant car park. ""I was terrified. He was also trying to pull my shirt off. I thought he was going to rape me,"" she told reporters at a news conference on Monday. ""At some point he gave up and he then looked at me and he told me, 'You're just a child,' and he said, 'I am the district attorney of Etowah County. If you tell anyone about this, no one will believe you"", Mrs Nelson said, adding that her neck was bruised in the struggle. ""He finally allowed me to open the door and I either fell out or he pushed me out."" Why people are posting #MeAt14 Moore Campaign Chairman Bill Armistead denied the charges, calling Mr Moore ""an innocent man"". ""This is a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character,"" he said. Mr Moore's wife also vehemently denies the allegations, contending that her husband's accusers are being paid. Earlier on Monday US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said that he believed the women accusing Mr Moore of inappropriate behaviour. Mr McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky that party officials have considered whether another Republican could challenge Mr Moore in next month's election, through a so-called write-in challenge. He said Luther Strange, whom Mr Moore beat in the Republican primary earlier this year, was a possible option. Roy Moore said Mitch McConnell is the one who should step aside No matter what happens between now and the 12 December election, Mr Moore's name will remain on the voters' ballot, the Alabama secretary of state has confirmed. Alabama law prohibits the replacement of a party candidate up to 76 days before the election. However, voters are free to ""write-in"" any name they choose and the party might encourage support for another Republican candidate. The state Republican party could also disqualify Mr Moore's nomination, meaning that if he won the most votes he would still not be declared the winner. Failing that, if Mr Moore won the election, the US Senate could vote to expel him by arguing that he lacked fitness to serve. Last week's Washington Post story quoted four women by name, including one who alleged Mr Moore initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 - beneath the legal age of consent in Alabama - while he was a prosecutor in his 30s. Mr Moore has said the Washington Post story is a fabricated smear by his political opponents, calling it ""a prime example of fake news"". Mr McConnell previously said Mr Moore should step aside only if the allegations were proven true.
