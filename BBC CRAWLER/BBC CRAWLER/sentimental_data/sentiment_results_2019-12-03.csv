"This video can not be played Reporters ask the US president his thoughts on the upcoming UK general election US President Donald Trump has said he could ""work with anybody"" in No 10 - nine days ahead of a general election. Speaking on a three-day visit to the UK, Mr Trump said he would ""stay out of the election"", that he was a ""fan of Brexit"" and he thought PM Boris Johnson was ""very capable"". Mr Trump is in the UK for a Nato summit being held in Watford on Wednesday. He attended a reception hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace and later went to an event at Downing Street. The US president's comments in a press conference came moments after he told reporters that he was staying out of the election on 12 December ""because I don't want to complicate it"".

The Duke of York has been facing questions over his ties to disgraced financierJeffrey Epstein.Mr Trumpmet the duke,externalon his last visit to the UK in June President Trump is visiting the UK to attend a Nato summit commemorating the 70th anniversary of the transatlantic organisation. He had a breakfast meeting with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the US ambassador's residence in London. Mr Trumpheld separate talkswith French President Emmanuel Macron. Later, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were kept waiting for around 40 minutes before the US president and First Lady Melania Trump arrived at the prince's residence, Clarence House, for afternoon tea. Mr Trump and his wife went on to join other Nato leaders and senior royals at a Buckingham Palace reception, hosted by the Queen. The first couple later attended a reception at Downing Street with other world leaders. Melania and Donald Trump had tea with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House They later met the Queen at a Buckingham Palace reception It is unclear whether Mr Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Mr Johnson during his visit to the UK. The US president said he would be meeting the British prime minister during his visit, adding: ""I have meetings set up with lots of different countries"". Mr Johnson said he would be discussing Syria, Russia and China during discussions with Nato leaders. Boris Johnson at the reception at Buckingham Palace after hosting Mr Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at No 10 Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who held a meeting with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - said arrangements for such bilateral meetings were ""always quite fluid"". BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said the Conservatives' HQ is not keen on such a meeting ""to avoid pictures that could be used by his (Boris Johnson's) opponents"" in the upcoming general election. Mr Johnson and Mr Trump did speak on Saturday, when Mr Trump expressed his condolences after the London Bridge attack. There'll be an almighty shuddering sigh of relief reverberating around the walls of Downing Street. Because there was real apprehension in No 10 about exactly what the president might say. In fact, he's given Boris Johnson an almighty helping hand in this election. Most importantly, we heard Donald Trump seeking to counter what has become one of the main attack lines of the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn during this campaign, that if you re-elect Boris Johnson he will ensure that the NHS is on the table in trade talks with the US. And yet we heard Mr Trump being pretty unequivocal that he's not interested in the NHS, even if it was presented to him on a silver platter and also suggesting he didn't know why it was being raised as an issue, even though, in fact, it was Mr Trump who first raised it as an issue when he was here in June at a news conference saying everything should be on the table. Be that as it may, I think Team Johnson will be mightily relieved that he has, as it were, provided them with a get-out-of-jail-free card to Labour claims that the NHS would be on the table. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who called for Mr Trump to be treated ""with respect and politeness"" during his visit, wrote to Mr Trump ahead of his visit, demanding assurances that theNHS will be ""off the table""in any post-Brexit US-UK trade talks. Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Jeremy Vine show that he would seek assurances from Mr Trump at the Buckingham Palace reception later. What we learned from Trump's last visit to the UK ""I will say, look, welcome to this country. I hope you'll understand how precious our national health service is,"" he said. ""And in any future trade relationship with the USA, none of our public services are on the table, none of our public services are for sale."" Mr Trump has previously been criticised for voicing his opinions of British political leaders. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK and US  ""traditionally don't get involved in each other's elections"" The US president was warned against getting involved in the upcoming general election by Mr Johnson last week. Nigel Farage said it was ""awkward"" that his ""friend"", Mr Trump, had arrived during the election campaign, adding that he didn't intend to speak to him. The Brexit Party leader said if there were ""personal exchanges"", they would be ""purely personal"" and he would keep them private. Scotland Yard has saidroad closures will be in place in central London,externalduring the summit. Protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square, before heading to Buckingham Palace ahead of the reception for Nato leaders. BBC journalist Charlotte Gallagher, who was at the protest, said it was a real mixture of people ""but they all had one thing in common - an intense dislike of President Trump"". ""There were people with concerns about the future of the NHS, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, while others were demanding the release of Julian Assange."" She said she also spoke to several US tourists who decided to come to the protest to show how unhappy they were with their own president. The mother of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn was among the protesters. Mr Dunn's death has led to a diplomatic row between the US and UK after a suspect over his death returned to America, claiming diplomatic immunity. Charlotte Charles said the response from other protesters outside the palace to her campaign for justice had been ""heart-warming"". The Foreign Office said Mr Raab raised ""UK concerns"" about the case with his US counterpart at a meeting earlier. Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing?

"This video can not be played Macron on Nato: ""We don't have the same definition of terrorism"" US President Donald Trump and French leader Emmanuel Macron have set out opposing views ahead of a Nato summit. In an occasionally tense press conference, the two politicians sparred over Nato's role, Turkey, and Islamic State group (IS) fighters. Mr Trump had described Mr Macron's comments about Nato as ""nasty"", but Mr Macron said he stood by his words. World leaders are in London to mark the Western military alliance's 70th anniversary. The summit has already been marked by strained relations between Turkey and other member states. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he will oppose Nato's plan for the defence of the Baltic region if it does not back Turkey over its fight against Kurdish groups it considers terrorists. Troubled Nato not in party mood What does the US do for Nato? Corbyn tells Trump no trade deal if NHS included On Tuesday night, Mr Macron and Mr Erdogan met in Downing Street in a four-way meeting that also included German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the host, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Ties between Mr Trump and Mr Macron were already strained amid a trade dispute, and afterthe French president described Nato as ""brain dead"" last monthbecause, he said, the US commitment to the alliance was fading. Mr Trump hit back on Tuesday by saying the French leader had been ""very disrespectful"", adding that France had ""a very high unemployment rate"" and ""nobody needs Nato more than France"". This video can not be played Donald Trump: Macron comments ""nasty, insulting, and disrespectful"" At a joint press conference with Mr Macron later, Mr Trump was less combative, stressing that the two countries had ""done a lot of good things together"". Mr Macron, meanwhile, said he stood by his comments. The two sides then clashed over foreign IS fighters who were captured in Syria. Mr Trump jokingly offered them to France, saying: ""Would you like some nice [IS] fighters? You can take everyone you want."" Sounding stern, Mr Macron said ""Let's be serious"" and that IS fighters from Europe were ""a tiny minority"", and that the ""number one priority"" was to get rid of the terrorist group. Mr Trump then retorted: ""This is why he is a great politician because that was one of the greater non-answers I have ever heard, and that's OK"". Mr Trump also criticised Nato countries who were paying less than the Nato guidelines of at least 2% of GDP towards the alliance. He said he did not want countries to be ""delinquent"" and pay less than their share, adding: ""Maybe I'll deal with them from a trade standpoint."" Mr Macron said France - which currently spends 1.84% of its GDP on defence - would reach the minimum, and acknowledged that the US had ""overinvested"" in Nato for several decades. However, he added that there were other pressing issues to discuss. ""When I look at Turkey, they now are fighting against those who fought with us shoulder to shoulder against [IS]... if we just have discussions about what we pay and we don't have clear discussions about such a situation, we are not serious."" The two leaders also discussed Turkey's decision to buy a Russian S-400 missile system. Mr Trump said they were ""looking at"" whether to impose sanctions, while Mr Macron asked: ""How is it possible to be a member of the alliance... and buy things from Russia?"" The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been key allies of the US-led coalition against IS in Syria. However, Turkey views a section of the group - the YPG - as terrorists. Ahead of his departure for London, Mr Erdogan said Turkey would not approve a plan to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the event of a Russian attack unless Nato recognised the Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists. ""If our friends at Nato don't recognise as terrorist organisations those we consider terrorist organisations... we will stand against any step that will be taken there,"" he said about the plan. However, Mr Macron told reporters: ""We don't have the same definition of terrorism around the [Nato] table"". In October, Turkey launched an operation in Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Syria to create a ""security zone"" along its border. That military action deepened fractures between Turkey and other Nato members, and took place after President Trump had controversially pulled US forces out of the region.

"The Reunion Nugget is in two parts and weighs a total of 121.3g A gold hunter claims to have discovered the UK's largest gold nugget in a Scottish river. The lump of pure gold, which weighs 121.3g (4.2 oz), was unearthed in a mystery location in May this year. The two pieces form a doughnut shape and could be worth Â£80,000. The previous largest find, in 2016, was the 85.7g (3oz) Douglas Nugget. However, gold panning experts are remaining sceptical until its provenance can be confirmed. The treasure was discovered in two pieces but fits together perfectly, earning it the name The Reunion Nugget. The gold-panning community is renowned for its secrecy, and the name of the river where it was found has not been revealed. The lucky finder is also remaining anonymous. The finder brought the discovery to the attention of author Lee Palmer who was researching his book Gold Occurrences In The UK. Mr Palmer, 50,  said: ""This is now the largest nugget in existence in the UK. When you look at it, it's doughnut-shaped. ""There are no impurities in it, it is just pure gold nugget of about 22 carats. It really is a remarkable find."" The nugget was found using the method of ""sniping"", which sees gold hunters lying face down in a river while wearing a snorkel and dry suit. The enthusiast unearthed the larger piece first, which weighs 89.6g (3.1oz), before finding the other half, weighing 31.7g (1,1oz) 10 minutes later. Mr Palmer said: ""The man just threw the bigger piece in his bucket with the rest of his stuff - he knew it was big but didn't realise how big. The Reunion Nugget could be the largest unearthed in the UK ""He found the second nugget 30cm (12in) away and chucked that in his bucket too. ""It wasn't until a couple of days later that he had a look at them and realised how big they were and that they fitted together."" He added: ""The hole in the middle could have been caused by a strike off a rock or glacier. ""One mineralogist thought it looked like an entry and exit hole that could've been made with a neolithic antler pick, which were used by farmers in the Iron Age."" Both the finder of the nugget and the owner of the land where it was discovered are keeping their identities secret due to its magnitude. Mr Palmer hopes it will be purchased by either the National Museum Of Scotland or the Natural History Museum, but legally it may have to be handed over to The Crown Estate. He believes the fact it is in two pieces should not affect its value. Mr Palmer said: ""From the top you could say it looks like two bits, but when you see it from underneath, it's a perfect fit. ""It's like an exact jigsaw, there's no disputing it. ""Even if you took the largest individual piece, it is still the biggest one in the UK. ""Add together the second piece and the story behind it and you've got something amazing."" The Douglas Nugget holds the current record for the largest gold nugget found in the UK for 500 years. Both the Reunion Nugget and the Douglas Nugget were found in Scottish rivers using the process of ""sniping"" In a similar story,it was discovered in a Scottish river by a man in his 40s. He kept quiet for two years before publicly revealing his incredible find. Gold panning expert Leon Kirk said he was not going to get too excited just yet. He told BBC Scotland: ""Unfortunately the world of gold is very divisive. If someone finds a nugget it is not necessarily true. ""This has come out of the blue and there is no confirmed provenance. ""I would like to think it is real but it can take many months to establish if it is genuine and at the moment there is no proof.""

"Left-right: Tai Shani, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock and Oscar Murillo The four artists nominated for the 2019 Turner Prize will share this year's award after urging the judges not to choose any of them as a single winner. Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo got together to write to the prestigious prize's panel. They said they wanted to make a ""collective statement"" at a time when there was ""already so much that divides and isolates people and communities"". The judges agreed and revealed the move at Tuesday's ceremony in Margate, Kent. Vogue editor Edward Enninful announced the decision The Turner Prize is Britain's most high-profile contemporary art award. The quartet will share the Â£40,000 prize money. The art world had gathered at the town's Dreamland amusement park to find out who had won, but even for an award once known for its shock value, the four-way split was unexpected. Are award winners and losers are out of fashion? Attendees stood and cheered as Vogue magazine editor Edward Enninful opened the envelope and was surprised to find a statement about all four artists rather than the name of just one. ""Here's something quite extraordinary,"" he said. ""At a time of political division in Britain and conflict in much of the world, the artists wanted to use the occasion of the Turner Prize to make a strong statement of community and solidarity and have formed themselves into a collective."" Oscar Murillo with his art in Margate This year's nominated works included Murillo's congregation of human effigies staring at a black curtain covering a window overlooking the sea; and ""audio investigator"" Abu Hamdan's sound effects, recreating the noise inside a notorious Syrian prison. They were the pre-ceremony favourites. Shani presented a brightly-coloured feminist fantasy world ""beyond patriarchal limits""; while Cammock made a film commemorating the role of women at the start of the Northern Irish Troubles in the late 1960s. In their letter to the judges, the quartet said they all made art ""about social and political issues and contexts we believe are of great importance and urgency"". They continued: ""The politics we deal with differ greatly, and for us it would feel problematic if they were pitted against each other, with the implication that one was more important, significant or more worthy of attention than the others."" This video can not be played Turner Prize: The moment all four nominees win prestigious award After the announcement, Cammock read a joint statement saying their work was ""incompatible with the competition format, whose tendency is to divide and to individualise"". They said they wanted to speak out in ""an era marked by the rise of the right and the renewal of fascism in an era of the Conservatives' hostile environment that has paradoxically made each of us and many of our friends and family again increasingly unwelcome in Britain"". They added: ""Isolation and exclusion are the weapons of this hostile environment. It is this we seek to stand against by making this symbolic gesture of cohesion."" Tai Shani with her nominated installation The jury unanimously agreed to allow them to share the prize. ""We are honoured to be supporting this bold statement of solidarity and collaboration in these divided times,"" they said. ""Their symbolic act reflects the political and social poetics that we admire and value in their work."" Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who chaired the judges, said: ""In coming together and presenting themselves as a group, this year's nominated artists certainly gave the jury a lot to think about. ""But it is very much in the spirit of these artists' work to challenge convention, to resist polarised world views, and to champion other voices. The jury all felt that this made the collective a worthy winner of the Turner Prize."" Reacting to the news of the shared prize,Adrian Searle in The Guardian,externalwrote: ""'Good for them!' - subverting the Turner prize is what artists are meant to do"". ""Losers have sulked and even attacked people with gladioli. But the four shortlisted artists' decision to share this year's winnings could be the upset to end them all,"" said their writer Adrian Searle. The Independent,externaldeclared: ""The Turner Prize puts itself out of business by allowing the artists to award the prize to themselves."" ""The four nominees asked to share this year's prize - but robbing the judges and the public of the opportunity to scrutinise and compare their work hurts the artists too,"" wrote Mark Hudson. ""Is the baffling Turner Prize 2019 result just a virtue signal for the snowflake era?"" askedAlastair Sooke in The Telegraph,external. On Twitter, Jamie Byng, whose company Canongate published the Booker-winning best-seller Life of Pi,posted,external: ""What a beautiful and genuine act of solidarity.  I hope this inspires others to think and act similarly."" Writer Musa Okwonga agreed, adding the ""only true opponents"" to artists are ""the blank canvas"". Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by BBC arts editor Will Gompertz The decision to award the Turner Prize to all four nominees collectively was not made on the spur of the moment. The idea developed in the autumn when the artists first met in Margate for the Turner Prize exhibition opening. It was discussed within the Tate (the ultimate overseer of the prize), led by Alex Farquharson. The proposal gave pause for thought, reservations were expressed, followed by the decision to put the artists' proposal to the Turner Prize jury. The jury's decision to acquiesce to the artists' request sets a precedent which may well complicate matters for future juries, and possibly, the prize itself. The fact is a lot of the artists who accept the invitation to take part in the Turner Prize (some refuse) do so with a nagging concern about its basic conceit: a competition to choose a winner, a best in class. Nominees can see it as a simplistic, reductive notion, which sits uncomfortably. In the past they've held their nose and got on with it. I wonder how many will in the future. Maybe annual awards like the Turner Prize and the Booker Prize, which also didn't have a single winner this year, are reaching their sell-by date: an anachronism from a bygone binary age of winners and losers. Almost 95,000 people have visited an exhibition of the shortlisted works since it opened in September at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. The exhibition runs until 12 January. Three years ago, Turner winner Helen Marten pledged to share the prize money with her fellow nominees - three weeks after doing the same with her winnings from the inaugural Hepworth Prize. And earlier this year,the Booker Prize was splitbetween two winners - Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo - after the judges refused to select a single victor.

"Larry Page and Sergey Brin Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have announced they are stepping down from top roles at the online giant's parent company. They will leave their respective roles as Alphabet's chief executive officer and president but remain on the board. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai will become Alphabet's CEO too, a statement said. Alphabet was created in 2015 as part of a corporate restructuring of Google, which Mr Page and Mr Brin famously founded in a California garage in 1998. The parent company was intended to make the tech giant's activities ""cleaner and more accountable"" as it expanded from internet search into other areas such as self-driving cars. The pair moved from Google to Alphabet when it was formed - saying they were making the jump to focus on starting new initiatives. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do? How Google became so big Fired employees claim Google is punishing them But in a blog post on Tuesday,external, the co-founders, both aged 46, announced they were stepping back from the day-to-day management of the company. A joint letter said they would remain ""actively involved as board members, shareholders and co-founders"", but said it was the ""natural time to simplify our management structure"". The pair (photographed in 2008) founded Google 21 years ago ""We've never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there's a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President,"" their letter said. They also declared it was time to ""assume the role of proud parents - offering advice and love, but not daily nagging"" and insisted there was ""no better person"" to lead the company into the future than Mr Pichai. The 47-year-old was born in India, where he studied engineering. He went on to study in the US at Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania before joining Google in 2004. Sundar Pichai will now serve as CEO of both companies In a statement, he said he was ""excited"" about the transition and paid tribute to Mr Page and Mr Brin. ""The founders have given all of us an incredible chance to have an impact on the world,"" Mr Pichai said. ""Thanks to them, we have a timeless mission, enduring values, and a culture of collaboration and exploration that makes it exciting to come to work every day. ""It's a strong foundation on which we will continue to build. Can't wait to see where we go next and look forward to continuing the journey with all of you."" This move represents the most significant shake-up of leadership at Google since its inception - the first time the dynamic duo of Brin and Page, a legendary Silicon Valley partnership, won't hold important management roles in the company they founded. In reality, though, that's been the case for some time - the public face of the firm has been Mr Pichai and, to a lesser extent, YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki. But Tuesday's announcement makes it absolutely clear - Mr Page and Mr Brin aren't running the company. Yet while the pair are apparently relinquishing management duties, it won't mean giving up ultimate power. Between them, they control 51% of voting rights on Alphabet's board. This won't change. They likened their new role to being ""proud parents"" to the company, looking on with close interest and care. But should they feel the need, they can override any decision Mr Pichai makes - with little more than a parental ""because we said so"". Mr Page and Brin are ranked the 10th and 14th richest individuals in the world,externalby Forbes, with each of them estimated to be worth about $50bn (Â£38bn). The American business magazine ranks Alphabet as the 17th largest public company in the world,external, with an estimated market value of $863bn. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do?

""You are the only audience in my entire 13-year history of performing that have actually thrown something at me,"" Kumar said, after a bread roll hit the stage. Radio 1 DJ and Taverners' ambassador Greg James said the behaviour of some of the crowd was ""appalling"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The event, at London's Grosvenor House, was raising money to give vulnerable children a start in life through sport. Speaking to The Guardian on Tuesday,external, Kumar said: ""I made what I considered to be some extremely mild jokes about Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees Mogg, Theresa May and the Brexit process for not going well."" He said the audience was more ""easily offended"" than he thought they might be. Video footage of the event showed Kumar being interrupted by hecklers, one of whom shouted ""don't do politics"". ""It's an election season and I thought it would be interesting to spark a conversation here,"" explained  the comedian, ""but clearly the conversation I've sparked is, 'this guy is a bit of a dickhead.' ""I did think it would be nice to come here and talk to some people who had a different political outlook to me, and I thought it'd be interesting for me to share my perspective - but clearly that's not been the case."" He added: ""What I don't want to do is to detract from any of the fantastic work done by the charity,"" for which he received a round of applause. But as the routine continued, the audience began a ""slow clap"", after which Kumar refused to leave the stage. ""I'm not going anywhere,"" Kumar said. ""Absolutely not. I'm full Bercow-ing it,"" referring to the former House of Commons speaker John Bercow. ""I know you want me to do it but I'm not gonna leave. Absolutely not. Absolutely not."" Kumar was eventually joined by the host of the event, who escorted him off stage. ""Can I shake your hand, sir?"" he asked. ""Ladies and gentlemen, Nish gave his time to come and support this charity today, and I think the very least we can do is say thank you for doing that.""

Reflecting on the incident, he told the Guardian: ""I'm sort of amazed by how fascinated people are by the whole thing. It's not the first time I've been booed off stage â¦ I consider it the life of being a comedian - they have a right to boo me.""

"This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Evidence for impeaching US President Donald Trump for misconduct in office is ""overwhelming"", according to the panel leading the impeachment inquiry. The president placed personal political interests ""above the national interests of the United States"", it states in a key report to House lawmakers. He did so by trying to ""solicit foreign interference"" from Ukraine to help his 2020 re-election bid, it says. The report is designed to lay out the case to remove Mr Trump from office. He denies any wrongdoing, and has described the inquiry as a witch-hunt. Before the draft report was released, the Republican president attacked the Democrat-led investigation as ""very unpatriotic"". Following publication, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the Democrats ""utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing"" and that the report ""reflects nothing more than their frustrations"". The report now goes to the House Judiciary Committee, which will begin proceedings on Wednesday and consider formal impeachment charges against Mr Trump. The Trump-Ukraine Impeachment Inquiry Report,externalwas made public on Tuesday by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. It says the inquiry ""uncovered a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election"". ""President Trump's scheme subverted US foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favour of two politically-motivated investigations that would help his presidential re-election campaign,"" it says. ""The president demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice-President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election."" Evidence of misconduct is overwhelming ""and so too is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress"", the report says. Anyone who listened to Adam Schiff's extended, extemporaneous closing statement at the impeachment hearings two weeks ago probably wouldn't be surprised by the summary of the Intelligence Committee report released on Tuesday. Buried within the pages of the 300-page document, however, were some striking new details. The telecommunications company AT&T provided committee investigators with Rudy Giuliani's mobile phone records - and those records shed new light on the timing and breadth the communications Donald Trump's personal lawyer had with the White House. Starting in April of this year, Giuliani had multiple phone conversations with numbers listed for the White House and, in particular, the Office of Management and Budget - the government agency ultimately responsible for putting a hold on the congressionally authorised US military aid to Ukraine. While the details of these communications aren't known, their simple existence undercuts the contention of some presidential defenders that Giuliani was operating independently of senior administration officials. Multiple witnesses, including US Ambassador to the EU Gordan Sondland, have testified that Giuliani was directing them, at the behest of the president, to pressure Ukrainian officials to open investigations that would be politically advantageous for Mr Trump. Now the line between Giuliani and the White House has become more certain. The intelligence committee voted 13 to 9, along party lines, on Tuesday to approve the report and send it to the House Judiciary Committee. The judiciary panel's hearings will begin with four constitutional scholars, who will explain how impeachment works. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, citing a lack of ""fairness"". Among formal impeachment charges expected to be considered are abuse of power, obstruction of justice and contempt of Congress. Democrats are keen to hold a vote on impeachment in the House of Representatives before the end of the year, with the prospect of a trial in the Senate perhaps as early as January. A SIMPLE GUIDE:If you want a basic take, this one is for you GO DEEPER:Here is a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT IS IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Reaction from a West Virginia town CONTEXT:Why Ukraine matters to the US FACT-CHECK:Is the whistleblower linked to the Democrats? Before the draft report was made public,House Republicans released their own 123-page report that condemned the ""unelected bureaucrats"" who testified,external, saying they ""fundamentally disagreed with President Trump's style, world view and decisions"". The document accuses Democrats of ""trying to undo the will of the American people"" and argues that they have been trying to depose the president since his first day in office. ""None of the Democrats' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanours,"" it argues, in reference to the constitutional clause that permits the removal of a president. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff dismissed the Republican rebuttal, saying it was ""intended for an audience of one"", Mr Trump, and ""ignores voluminous evidence ""against him. In London, where he is attending the 70th anniversary of defence alliance Nato, Mr Trump slammed Mr Schiff by name, calling him ""a maniac"", ""a very sick man"" and ""a deranged human being"". Democrats say Mr Trump dangled two bargaining chips to Ukraine - $400m (Â£309m) of military aid that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting for Mr Zelensky - to obtain the investigations. They think this political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounts to an abuse of power. The first investigation Mr Trump wanted from Ukraine was into Mr Biden, his main Democratic challenger, and his son Hunter. Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian energy company when Joe Biden was US vice-president. The second Trump demand was that Ukraine try to corroborate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the last US presidential election. This theory has been widely debunked, and US intelligence agencies are unanimous in saying Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016. This video can not be played Ukrainian foreign minister Prystaiko dismissed allegations the country interfered in US election Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.

"Les Rutherford escaped Dunkirk by paddling out to sea on a shed door A veteran who escaped Dunkirk by paddling out to sea on a shed door has died at the age of 101. Les Rutherford became trapped while fighting a rear-guard action during the evacuation of the port. He and a fellow soldier used the door, which had been blown off a shed, to escape out to sea, where they were picked up by a French trawler. Tributes paid to Mr Rutherford described him as ""a wonderful man who will be sorely missed"". Talking previously about his exploits in Dunkirk, Mr Rutherford said: ""The place was being bombed to bits. ""There was absolutely no hope, so another chap and I decided to take this big door which had been blown off a shed and we put out to sea."" After being picked up, he said he was given a glass of rum and returned to England wearing only a blanket and socks. He later joined Bomber Command and served as a bomb aimer in the RAF. His role was to lie flat in the nose of the aircraft, directing the pilot during a bombing-run as the bombs were released. Les Rutherford in a Lancaster bomber on his 90th birthday Mr Rutherford, who was based at RAF Skellingthorpe in Lincolnshire, served with Bomber Command During a raid over Germany in December 1943, Mr Rutherford was shot down and captured. He was taken to Stalag Luft III shortly before the Great Escape took place in March 1944, although he was not part of it. Whilst there, he exchanged chocolate for a notebook which he used to record life in the camp. One of the images in his notebook depicted the Great Escape Another showed the withdrawal of troops from Stalag Luft III in 1945 in response to the Russian advance At the end of the war he was repatriated to the UK.

"Iceland and other Nordic nations are widely admired for family-friendly policies Iceland's prime minister has urged governments to adopt green and family-friendly priorities, instead of just focusing on economic growth figures. Katrin Jakobsdottir has teamed up with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern to promote a ""well-being"" agenda. Ms Jakobsdottir called for ""an alternative future based on well-being and inclusive growth"". She said new social indicators were needed besides traditional GDP data. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz is among several economists arguing that gross domestic product - measuring a country's production in goods and services - fails to capture the impact of climate change, inequality, digital services and other phenomena shaping modern societies. In a Guardian article last month,Prof Stiglitz said the 2008 global financial crisis ""was the ultimate illustration of the deficiencies in commonly used metrics"",external. GDP failed to reveal distortions in the bloated US housing market which triggered the crisis. Katrin Jakobsdottir: Modern challenges demand new economic thinking Ms Jakobsdottir said environmental devastation was a key factor driving Iceland to incorporate new social indicators besides GDP in its budget planning. She began a speech at London's Chatham House think-tank,externalby highlighting the disappearance of Iceland's Okjokull glacier. Scientists say the retreat of glaciers is clear evidence of global warming, which is blamed largely on CO2 pollution. Read more on related topics: Does GDP tell the whole economic story? Is the secret to happiness at the top of this mountain? Icelandic PM hails links with Scotland UK 'among least family friendly in Europe' Asked if a ""well-being"" budget was equally appropriate for developed and developing nations, she said: ""It's about how you prioritise in the public budget - you can always have an emphasis on well-being."" Developing countries ""need to take a leap"" to embrace renewable energy, she said, rather than repeat the developed world's carbon-based industrialisation. This video can not be played WATCH: A memorial to Iceland's disappearing glaciers GDP's focus on economic performance means it tends to undervalue quality of life and the social damage caused by inequality. Ms Jakobsdottir said an Icelandic poet had joked that ""having sex with your wife doesn't count in GDP, but with a prostitute it does"". A Left-Green politician,Ms Jakobsdottir formed a coalition government in 2017with the conservative Independence Party and centre-right Progressive Party. While acknowledging Iceland's progress in family-friendly policies, she said her nation - with a population of just 350,000 - still had big challenges, such as improving public transport and tackling depression. ""Iceland uses more anti-depressants than neighbouring countries,"" she said. ""We need to strengthen prevention [of depression], through sports and the arts."" In a TED talk in August, Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon made a similar plea,externalfor modern economies to put more resources into mental health, childcare and parental leave, and green energy. Ms Jakobsdottir said Iceland's adoption of universal childcare and shared parental leave was the product of grassroots women's activism, regardless of political differences. She said the ""well-being"" initiative promoted by herself, Ms Sturgeon and Ms Ardern should not be seen as a gender-based backlash against populism. ""It's very important to have all genders at the table - it affects the way you think, and then different decisions are made,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Fay Jones said nobody should be ""using this as a political exercise"" Boris Johnson was ""wrong"" to use the language he did after the London Bridge terror attack, a Welsh Conservative election candidate has said. Two people were killed by convicted terrorist Usman Khan on Friday. The prime minister blamed Khan's early release from jail on legislation introduced by a ""leftie government"". Welsh Conservative election candidate Fay Jones said the prime minister should not have used the terrorist incident ""as a political exercise"". After Mr Johnson called for longer sentences and an end to automatic release, David Merritt - whose son Jack was one of the victims - said he would not wish his death""to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences"",external. Speaking in the BBC Wales Live election debate in Wrexham on Tuesday, Ms Jones said: ""I don't think the prime minister or anybody should be using this as a political exercise."" Asked if Mr Johnson was wrong, she replied: ""Yes, he was."" Mr Johnson has denied claims he was politicising the attack, saying he had campaigned against early release for some time, having previously raised the issue during his 2012 campaign to be mayor of London. ""I feel, as everybody does, a huge amount of sympathy for the loss of Jack Merritt's family, and indeed for all the relatives of Jack and Saskia, who perished at London Bridge,"" he said. ""But be in no doubt, I've campaigned against early release and against short sentences for many years."" Khan had served half of his sentence and the prime minister claimed scrapping early release would have stopped him. Mr Johnson blamed Khan's release on legislation introduced under ""a leftie government"", insisting the automatic release scheme was introduced by Labour. However, he has been challenged about what the Conservatives had done to change the law over the past 10 years in government. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says about 74 convicted terrorists have been released early from prison Labour's David Hanson, a former policing and counter-terrorism minister, said the police had struggled following a reduction in the number of officers and he had concerns about the probation service. ""We need to have the 40% cut that was taken to the probation service put back in place because that's one of the issues that's led to the high risk on this particular case and others,"" he said. Brexit Party MEP Nathan Gill said it was ""bonkers"" that convicted terrorists were being released early. ""If you plot mass murder of people, a terrorist attack, I want to see you go to jail for your whole life,"" he said. ""I do not understand that when the death penalty was taken away. We were told life would mean life, and now people serve just five or ten years and then they're let out."" Usman Khan had been jailed in 2012 Politicisation of terror attacks like London Bridge was wrong, said Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth, ""because it affects every one of us"". ""These are our communities"", he said, ""intolerance between different groups is something we should all condemn"". When pressed on whether Khan should have been released, Mr ap Iorwerth stressed each case was different. Liberal Democrat Steffan John also criticised the prime minister. ""It was clear that Boris did play games on this and he saw an advantage,"" he said.

"Video of the polar bear posted on Facebook has led to fears for its wellbeing Footage shared on social media in Russia of a polar bear with ""T-34"" spray-painted in black on its side has alarmed experts. Experts warned the stunt could affect the animal's ability to blend in with its surroundings and hunt for food. An investigation is under way to determine exactly where in Arctic Russia the video was filmed. The T-34 was a tank that played a vital role in the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two. The footage was posted on Facebook by Sergey Kavry, a member of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) nature organisation, and then shared by local media. Allow Instagram content?

You may want to readMetaâs Instagram cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Mr Kavry said the video had been shared with a WhatsApp group for the indigenous people of the Chukotka region in Russia's Far East, and that scientists monitoring wildlife in the area would not have branded the bear in such a way. ""I don't know the details of which region, district, or vicinity this [footage] was taken,"" he said, adding: ""If it's a military lettering theme... that is some kind of perverse disrespect for history."" The press officer for WWF Russia, Daria Buyanova, told the BBC that seeing the images was ""quite a shock"" and that the inscription ""looks like a bad joke"". A scientist at the Institute of Biological Problems of the North, Anatoly Kochnev, said it was unlikely that the bear could have been painted without it being sedated. He said the bear could not have been mobile, or at least must have been quite still while it was being sprayed because ""the characters are evenly written and are all the same size"". He suggested the incident may have taken place in the remote Russian region of Novaya Zemlya, where a team of specialists had earlier sedated polar bears that had been wandering into populated areas. Mr Kochnev said it could take weeks for the markings to wash off, and this could cause problems for the animal, which relies on its white coat when hunting prey in the Arctic snow and ice. Experts are now trying to determine the origin of the video. Russian media speculated that the stunt was linked to local anger at a rise in the number of polar bears coming into communities in Arctic Russia. In February, a state of emergency was declared in the Novaya Zemlya region over the appearance of dozens of polar bears in several towns and villages in the Arctic. Footage from the archipelago showed the animals roaming through buildings and exploring populated areas.

"Larry Page and Sergey Brin Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have announced they are stepping down from top roles at the online giant's parent company. They will leave their respective roles as Alphabet's chief executive officer and president but remain on the board. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai will become Alphabet's CEO too, a statement said. Alphabet was created in 2015 as part of a corporate restructuring of Google, which Mr Page and Mr Brin famously founded in a California garage in 1998. The parent company was intended to make the tech giant's activities ""cleaner and more accountable"" as it expanded from internet search into other areas such as self-driving cars. The pair moved from Google to Alphabet when it was formed - saying they were making the jump to focus on starting new initiatives. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do? How Google became so big Fired employees claim Google is punishing them But in a blog post on Tuesday,external, the co-founders, both aged 46, announced they were stepping back from the day-to-day management of the company. A joint letter said they would remain ""actively involved as board members, shareholders and co-founders"", but said it was the ""natural time to simplify our management structure"". The pair (photographed in 2008) founded Google 21 years ago ""We've never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there's a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President,"" their letter said. They also declared it was time to ""assume the role of proud parents - offering advice and love, but not daily nagging"" and insisted there was ""no better person"" to lead the company into the future than Mr Pichai. The 47-year-old was born in India, where he studied engineering. He went on to study in the US at Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania before joining Google in 2004. Sundar Pichai will now serve as CEO of both companies In a statement, he said he was ""excited"" about the transition and paid tribute to Mr Page and Mr Brin. ""The founders have given all of us an incredible chance to have an impact on the world,"" Mr Pichai said. ""Thanks to them, we have a timeless mission, enduring values, and a culture of collaboration and exploration that makes it exciting to come to work every day. ""It's a strong foundation on which we will continue to build. Can't wait to see where we go next and look forward to continuing the journey with all of you."" This move represents the most significant shake-up of leadership at Google since its inception - the first time the dynamic duo of Brin and Page, a legendary Silicon Valley partnership, won't hold important management roles in the company they founded. In reality, though, that's been the case for some time - the public face of the firm has been Mr Pichai and, to a lesser extent, YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki. But Tuesday's announcement makes it absolutely clear - Mr Page and Mr Brin aren't running the company. Yet while the pair are apparently relinquishing management duties, it won't mean giving up ultimate power. Between them, they control 51% of voting rights on Alphabet's board. This won't change. They likened their new role to being ""proud parents"" to the company, looking on with close interest and care. But should they feel the need, they can override any decision Mr Pichai makes - with little more than a parental ""because we said so"". Mr Page and Brin are ranked the 10th and 14th richest individuals in the world,externalby Forbes, with each of them estimated to be worth about $50bn (Â£38bn). The American business magazine ranks Alphabet as the 17th largest public company in the world,external, with an estimated market value of $863bn. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do?

"Joyce Nainby died after suffering head injuries An 82-year-old woman killed her best friend in a ""tragic"" parking blunder after a school reunion. Joyce Nainby was standing by the side of Patricia Tulip's car when her friend mistakenly hit the accelerator instead of the brake. The 80-year-old was hit by the open car door and knocked unconscious. She died of a head injury 10 days later. Tulip admitted causing death by careless driving and was ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work. Newcastle Crown Court was told the pair had gone to school together about 70 years ago and had been best friends. The pair had just returned from a reunion when Tulip parked the car outside Mrs Nainby's home in Gosforth, Newcastle, and had to jump back in when it started to roll backwards. But instead of braking, she accidentally pressed the accelerator and hit the grandmother of six. The defendant, who wept in court, felt a ""great deal of remorse"" for the accident on 18 September 2018 and had written a letter of condolence to the family, the court heard. Witnesses said Tulip, of Seghill, Northumberland, was a trusted and competent motorist with many years' experience. In addition to the community order, she was banned from driving for three years but the court heard she had voluntarily given up her licence. Judge Amanda Rippon said the loss had ""completely devastated"" the Nainby family. ""As a result of a series of careless errors, your car very sadly became the implement responsible for your old and great friend's tragic death,"" she said. ""There is no sentence that I can give that will bring back Joyce Nainby for her family, or for you.""

"Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has confirmed a member of her party's staff has been suspended for ""faking"" an email. The email was reportedly sent as part of a legal fight between the Lib Dems and news site Open Democracy. Ms Swinson said the ""unacceptable"" incident had led to ""swift action"". The row between the Lib Dems and Open Democracy relates to a story about the party selling personal data - something the party denies. The Lib Dems accused the website of not including a response from the party in its story. The website insists one of its journalists had contacted the Lib Dems for a response ahead of publication, but the party had not replied. According to Open Democracy's editor, the party then produced a copy of an email, through its lawyers, to back up its claim that it had sent a response. But the email was dated 18 hours before Open Democracy had asked for a response, suggesting it was a fake. Ms Swinson did not confirm the identity of the person involved. But she said: ""As has been reported, there was an email that was sent which was inaccurate, which was faked. ""That's not acceptable, there is an investigation, the member of staff has been suspended and I'm not going to comment further on staffing matters."" Open Democracy reported that it had seen evidence held by the UK's privacy watchdog about the alleged sale of data by the party to Britain Stronger in Europe, the official Remain campaign in the EU referendum. In a2018 report,external, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it had ""obtained information"" to show that the personal data was sold by the Lib Dems to the Remain campaign for Â£100,000. The ICO said the Lib Dems and the campaign group denied that party members' data had been sold. Both insisted that Britain Stronger in Europe had bought information on the official electoral register from the Lib Dems, the ICO said. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ""The Liberal Democrats refute allegations made in Open Democracy's piece of 13 November. ""However, we have been made aware that the information Open Democracy subsequently received from the Liberal Democrats was incorrect. ""We have suspended a member of staff involved and are following due process.""

"Ms Thunberg has spent more than two weeks crossing the Atlantic in a catamaran Climate activist Greta Thunberg said that adults should stop making young people ""angry"" over global warming. Ms Thunberg was speaking after her arrival in Lisbon, Portugal, after a two-weeks-plus journey across the Atlantic from her starting point in Virginia, US. ""People are underestimating the force of angry kids,"" she told reporters. The 16-year-old is on her way to the COP25 climate summit in Madrid. She is taking a stand on more polluting forms of transport by sailing, rather than flying or travelling in cars. Responding to a question from a journalist who said some adults viewed her as ""angry"", Ms Thunberg said: ""We are angry, we are frustrated and it's because of good reasons. Climate summit told of nation's 'fight to death' What is climate change? ""If they want us to stop being angry, maybe they should stop making us angry."" She had originally planned to travel from the US to a UN climate summit in Chile. But the South American nation had to give up the event due to civil unrest. The venue changed to Spain, and so Ms Thunberg hitched a ride on a 48ft sailing catamaran called La Vagabonde. She travelled with Australian YouTubers Riley Whitlum and Elayna Carausu, as well as Briton Nikki Henderson - who is a professional yachtswoman. Their boat uses solar panels and hydro-generators for power. However the emissions impact of the voyage has been called into question by reports that suggested Ms Henderson flew to the US from Britain to undertake the trip. Meanwhile, in a report released on Tuesday during COP25, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on countries to prioritise funding to deal with the effects of climate change on human health. In coming decades, global warming is expected to cause thousands of additional deaths each year from malnutrition, insect-borne disease and heat stress. WHO researchers surveyed 101 nations to find out which had already developed health and climate change strategies, and whether these plans had sufficient financial backing. It found about half of the surveyed countries had drawn up a national strategy. But of 45 countries subjected to more detailed analysis, less than 40% said their current health budget fully or partially covered the estimated costs of implementing their national plans. Only 9% had allocated enough resources to carry out their strategies in full.

"Left-right: Tai Shani, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock and Oscar Murillo The four artists nominated for the 2019 Turner Prize will share this year's award after urging the judges not to choose any of them as a single winner. Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo got together to write to the prestigious prize's panel. They said they wanted to make a ""collective statement"" at a time when there was ""already so much that divides and isolates people and communities"". The judges agreed and revealed the move at Tuesday's ceremony in Margate, Kent. Vogue editor Edward Enninful announced the decision The Turner Prize is Britain's most high-profile contemporary art award. The quartet will share the Â£40,000 prize money. The art world had gathered at the town's Dreamland amusement park to find out who had won, but even for an award once known for its shock value, the four-way split was unexpected. Are award winners and losers are out of fashion? Attendees stood and cheered as Vogue magazine editor Edward Enninful opened the envelope and was surprised to find a statement about all four artists rather than the name of just one. ""Here's something quite extraordinary,"" he said. ""At a time of political division in Britain and conflict in much of the world, the artists wanted to use the occasion of the Turner Prize to make a strong statement of community and solidarity and have formed themselves into a collective."" Oscar Murillo with his art in Margate This year's nominated works included Murillo's congregation of human effigies staring at a black curtain covering a window overlooking the sea; and ""audio investigator"" Abu Hamdan's sound effects, recreating the noise inside a notorious Syrian prison. They were the pre-ceremony favourites. Shani presented a brightly-coloured feminist fantasy world ""beyond patriarchal limits""; while Cammock made a film commemorating the role of women at the start of the Northern Irish Troubles in the late 1960s. In their letter to the judges, the quartet said they all made art ""about social and political issues and contexts we believe are of great importance and urgency"". They continued: ""The politics we deal with differ greatly, and for us it would feel problematic if they were pitted against each other, with the implication that one was more important, significant or more worthy of attention than the others."" This video can not be played Turner Prize: The moment all four nominees win prestigious award After the announcement, Cammock read a joint statement saying their work was ""incompatible with the competition format, whose tendency is to divide and to individualise"". They said they wanted to speak out in ""an era marked by the rise of the right and the renewal of fascism in an era of the Conservatives' hostile environment that has paradoxically made each of us and many of our friends and family again increasingly unwelcome in Britain"". They added: ""Isolation and exclusion are the weapons of this hostile environment. It is this we seek to stand against by making this symbolic gesture of cohesion."" Tai Shani with her nominated installation The jury unanimously agreed to allow them to share the prize. ""We are honoured to be supporting this bold statement of solidarity and collaboration in these divided times,"" they said. ""Their symbolic act reflects the political and social poetics that we admire and value in their work."" Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who chaired the judges, said: ""In coming together and presenting themselves as a group, this year's nominated artists certainly gave the jury a lot to think about. ""But it is very much in the spirit of these artists' work to challenge convention, to resist polarised world views, and to champion other voices. The jury all felt that this made the collective a worthy winner of the Turner Prize."" Reacting to the news of the shared prize,Adrian Searle in The Guardian,externalwrote: ""'Good for them!' - subverting the Turner prize is what artists are meant to do"". ""Losers have sulked and even attacked people with gladioli. But the four shortlisted artists' decision to share this year's winnings could be the upset to end them all,"" said their writer Adrian Searle. The Independent,externaldeclared: ""The Turner Prize puts itself out of business by allowing the artists to award the prize to themselves."" ""The four nominees asked to share this year's prize - but robbing the judges and the public of the opportunity to scrutinise and compare their work hurts the artists too,"" wrote Mark Hudson. ""Is the baffling Turner Prize 2019 result just a virtue signal for the snowflake era?"" askedAlastair Sooke in The Telegraph,external. On Twitter, Jamie Byng, whose company Canongate published the Booker-winning best-seller Life of Pi,posted,external: ""What a beautiful and genuine act of solidarity.  I hope this inspires others to think and act similarly."" Writer Musa Okwonga agreed, adding the ""only true opponents"" to artists are ""the blank canvas"". Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by BBC arts editor Will Gompertz The decision to award the Turner Prize to all four nominees collectively was not made on the spur of the moment. The idea developed in the autumn when the artists first met in Margate for the Turner Prize exhibition opening. It was discussed within the Tate (the ultimate overseer of the prize), led by Alex Farquharson. The proposal gave pause for thought, reservations were expressed, followed by the decision to put the artists' proposal to the Turner Prize jury. The jury's decision to acquiesce to the artists' request sets a precedent which may well complicate matters for future juries, and possibly, the prize itself. The fact is a lot of the artists who accept the invitation to take part in the Turner Prize (some refuse) do so with a nagging concern about its basic conceit: a competition to choose a winner, a best in class. Nominees can see it as a simplistic, reductive notion, which sits uncomfortably. In the past they've held their nose and got on with it. I wonder how many will in the future. Maybe annual awards like the Turner Prize and the Booker Prize, which also didn't have a single winner this year, are reaching their sell-by date: an anachronism from a bygone binary age of winners and losers. Almost 95,000 people have visited an exhibition of the shortlisted works since it opened in September at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. The exhibition runs until 12 January. Three years ago, Turner winner Helen Marten pledged to share the prize money with her fellow nominees - three weeks after doing the same with her winnings from the inaugural Hepworth Prize. And earlier this year,the Booker Prize was splitbetween two winners - Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo - after the judges refused to select a single victor.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: Macron comments ""nasty, insulting, and disrespectful"" US President Donald Trump has accused his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron of being ""nasty"" for saying Nato was ""brain dead"". Mr Trump is in London for a summit marking the Western military alliance's 70th anniversary. The US president said Nato served a great purpose, and Mr Macron's remarks had been ""very insulting"". He also said he could see France ""breaking off"" from Nato, but did not explain why. However, at a joint press conference with Mr Macron later, Mr Trump struck a warmer tone, stressing that the two countries had ""done a lot of good things together as partners"". Troubled Nato not in party mood What does the US do for Nato? Corbyn tells Trump no trade deal if NHS included Mr Macron said he knew his comments about Nato ""shook up"" a lot of people, but added that he stood by them. Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - was founded after World War Two to counter the threat of Soviet expansion. The 29 member states pledge to come to the aid of one another should any come under attack. But speaking last month, Mr Macron complained that Nato members were no longer co-operating on key issues. He described the alliance as ""brain dead"", stressing what he saw as a waning commitment from its biggest guarantor - the US. He also criticised the US for not consulting Nato before pulling forces out of northern Syria. The summit, due to get under way later on Tuesday, has already been overshadowed by a bitter row between member states France and Turkey, and a continuing debate over money. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he will oppose Nato's plan for the defence of the Baltic region if it does not back Turkey over its fight against Kurdish groups it considers terrorists. Earlier on Tuesday, at a news conference with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, President Trump said Nato ""serves a great purpose"", but was then asked what he thought about Mr Macron's statements. He said he thought the French leader had been ""very disrespectful"" to other alliance members. ""It is a very, very nasty statement. I think they have a very high unemployment rate in France. France is not doing well economically at all,"" he said. ""It is a very tough statement to make when you have such difficulty in France when you look at what is going on. They have had a very rough year. You just can't go around making statements like that about Nato. It is very disrespectful."" France has an unemployment rate of about 8.5% - its lowest level in 10 years, although higher than the EU average of 6.3%. This video can not be played Nato explained in 80 seconds Mr Trump added: ""Nobody needs Nato more than France... the US benefits the least. It's a very dangerous statement for them to make. ""I'm looking at him [Mr Macron] and I'm saying that he needs protection more than anybody, and I see him breaking off [from Nato]. So I'm a little surprised at that."" Mr Trump also reiterated his longstanding complaint that many other Nato countries were still not contributing enough financially. Mr Stoltenberg praised Mr Trump's ""leadership on defence spending"", saying it was having a real impact. ""Since 2016, Canada and European allies have added $130bn more to the defence budget, and this number will increase to $400bn by 2024,"" he said. This video can not be played Macron on Nato: ""We don't have the same definition of terrorism"" ""This is unprecedented, this is making Nato stronger, and it shows that this alliance is adapting, responding when the world is changing."" President Trump welcomed the extra spending but singled out Germany as still falling short.According to Nato's latest figures,external, Germany spends 1.36% of GDP on defence when the Nato guideline is 2%. On a more positive note, he added: ""The world has changed a lot and Nato is changing right now. I've become a bigger fan of Nato because they have become more flexible."" He later added that he did not want countries to be ""delinquent"" and pay less than their share, adding ""maybe I'll deal with them from a trade standpoint"". Mr Erdogan joined the dispute by suggesting that Mr Macron was the one who was ""brain dead"", and accusing him of having ""a sick and shallow understanding"" of terrorism. Last month, Mr Macron angered Turkey by hosting an official from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), key allies of the US-led coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. Turkey views a section of the group - the YPG - as terrorists. Ahead of his departure for London, Mr Erdogan said Turkey would not approve a plan to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the event of a Russian attack unless Nato recognised the Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists. ""If our friends at Nato don't recognise as terrorist organisations those we consider terrorist organisations... we will stand against any step that will be taken there,"" he said about the plan. However, Mr Macron told reporters: ""We don't have the same definition of terrorism around the [Nato] table,"" adding that the greatest priority was to fight IS. In October, Turkey launched an operation in Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Syria to create a ""security zone"" along its border. That military action deepened fractures between Turkey and other Nato members, and took place after President Trump had controversially pulled US forces out of the region. Mr Macron and Mr Erdogan will come face to face in Downing Street on Tuesday in a four-way meeting also including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the host, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Turkey is posing a major and developing problem for Nato, a problem that if not resolved could test the very boundaries of its membership. It is effectively holding hostage a response plan for the rapid reinforcement of the Baltic region - which must be approved by all 29 Nato members - until it gets what it wants in its own region. Turkey wants all other Nato countries to regard Kurdish separatist groups in Turkey as terrorists. This would effectively take Nato into domestic security matters, which most allies see as none of their business. Add to this Turkey's unilateral actions in Syria; President Erdogan's recent row with Emmanuel Macron over the Kurds; and Turkey's purchase of a sophisticated Russian air defence system - an extraordinary step for a key Nato player - and you are well on the way to a full-blown crisis between Ankara and the alliance.

"Ariana Grande and Drake were the most-streamed female and male artists of the decade Spotify has revealed its biggest songs, albums and artists of the last decade, with Drake emerging as the most-streamed artist of the 2010s. The Canadian star has racked up more than 28 billion streams, with his most popular song, One Dance, played 1.7 billion times alone. It was dwarfed by Ed Sheeran's Shape Of You, whose 2.4 billion streams, made it the decade's most listened-to track. 2019's biggest song was Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello's Senorita. Released in June, the island-flavoured duet has already been played one billion times. Billie Eilish's Bad Guy isn't far behind, on 990 million streams. Eilish's debut album, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go, was also the year's most popular album - the first time a female artist has topped Spotify's end-of-year survey. In the UK, however, Eilish played second fiddle to Lewis Capaldi whose debut album, Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent, topped the chart. His ubiquitous ballad Someone You Loved was also the year's most-streamed song. Spotify's data also revealed some quirky facts: Modern Bollywood was the year's fastest-rising genre; the most popular mood-based playlist was ""feel good,"" followed by ""lit""; and the top podcast genre was comedy. Here are the music charts in full. The end-of-decade charts are presumably skewed towards more recent songs because of the growth in Spotify's user-base. The service had just 7 million users in 2009, but now boasts 248 million monthly active users, of which 113 million are paid subscribers. Later this week, Spotify will unveil the latest incarnation of its ""Spotify Wrapped,external"" feature, allowing users to generate a personalised breakdown of the music they listened to in 2019.

"Essex Fire Service said the dog was a husky (similar to the type pictured here) A dog started a house fire when it managed to turn the microwave on, a fire service said. The husky-type animal, which was left on its own in the house in Stanford-le-Hope, turned on the appliance, which was on a worktop in the kitchen. A packet of bread rolls, which had been placed inside, began to burn and caused a small fire, Essex Fire Service said. The owner, who was not at home at the time, was alerted to the fire by an app on their mobile phone. The fire service said the owner's device allowed them to view live feeds from a camera that was set up in their house on Kingsman Road. Geoff Wheal, watch manager at Corringham Fire Station, called it a ""very strange incident"" and said firefighters found the kitchen filled with smoke, but they made sure the flames did not spread to the rest of the house. ""It demonstrates that microwaves shouldn't be used to store food when they aren't in use,"" he said. ""Always keep your microwave clean and free of clutter or food and any packaging. ""Animals or children can turn them on more easily than you might think - so please don't run the risk."" The dog was not hurt, the service added. Dog starts fire... Video, 00:01:02Dog starts fire...

"The Reunion Nugget is in two parts and weighs a total of 121.3g A gold hunter claims to have discovered the UK's largest gold nugget in a Scottish river. The lump of pure gold, which weighs 121.3g (4.2 oz), was unearthed in a mystery location in May this year. The two pieces form a doughnut shape and could be worth Â£80,000. The previous largest find, in 2016, was the 85.7g (3oz) Douglas Nugget. However, gold panning experts are remaining sceptical until its provenance can be confirmed. The treasure was discovered in two pieces but fits together perfectly, earning it the name The Reunion Nugget. The gold-panning community is renowned for its secrecy, and the name of the river where it was found has not been revealed. The lucky finder is also remaining anonymous. The finder brought the discovery to the attention of author Lee Palmer who was researching his book Gold Occurrences In The UK. Mr Palmer, 50,  said: ""This is now the largest nugget in existence in the UK. When you look at it, it's doughnut-shaped. ""There are no impurities in it, it is just pure gold nugget of about 22 carats. It really is a remarkable find."" The nugget was found using the method of ""sniping"", which sees gold hunters lying face down in a river while wearing a snorkel and dry suit. The enthusiast unearthed the larger piece first, which weighs 89.6g (3.1oz), before finding the other half, weighing 31.7g (1,1oz) 10 minutes later. Mr Palmer said: ""The man just threw the bigger piece in his bucket with the rest of his stuff - he knew it was big but didn't realise how big. The Reunion Nugget could be the largest unearthed in the UK ""He found the second nugget 30cm (12in) away and chucked that in his bucket too. ""It wasn't until a couple of days later that he had a look at them and realised how big they were and that they fitted together."" He added: ""The hole in the middle could have been caused by a strike off a rock or glacier. ""One mineralogist thought it looked like an entry and exit hole that could've been made with a neolithic antler pick, which were used by farmers in the Iron Age."" Both the finder of the nugget and the owner of the land where it was discovered are keeping their identities secret due to its magnitude. Mr Palmer hopes it will be purchased by either the National Museum Of Scotland or the Natural History Museum, but legally it may have to be handed over to The Crown Estate. He believes the fact it is in two pieces should not affect its value. Mr Palmer said: ""From the top you could say it looks like two bits, but when you see it from underneath, it's a perfect fit. ""It's like an exact jigsaw, there's no disputing it. ""Even if you took the largest individual piece, it is still the biggest one in the UK. ""Add together the second piece and the story behind it and you've got something amazing."" The Douglas Nugget holds the current record for the largest gold nugget found in the UK for 500 years. Both the Reunion Nugget and the Douglas Nugget were found in Scottish rivers using the process of ""sniping"" In a similar story,it was discovered in a Scottish river by a man in his 40s. He kept quiet for two years before publicly revealing his incredible find. Gold panning expert Leon Kirk said he was not going to get too excited just yet. He told BBC Scotland: ""Unfortunately the world of gold is very divisive. If someone finds a nugget it is not necessarily true. ""This has come out of the blue and there is no confirmed provenance.

"Video of the polar bear posted on Facebook has led to fears for its wellbeing Footage shared on social media in Russia of a polar bear with ""T-34"" spray-painted in black on its side has alarmed experts. Experts warned the stunt could affect the animal's ability to blend in with its surroundings and hunt for food. An investigation is under way to determine exactly where in Arctic Russia the video was filmed. The T-34 was a tank that played a vital role in the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two. The footage was posted on Facebook by Sergey Kavry, a member of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) nature organisation, and then shared by local media. Allow Instagram content?

Mr Kavry said the video had been shared with a WhatsApp group for the indigenous people of the Chukotka region in Russia's Far East, and that scientists monitoring wildlife in the area would not have branded the bear in such a way. ""I don't know the details of which region, district, or vicinity this [footage] was taken,"" he said, adding: ""If it's a military lettering theme... that is some kind of perverse disrespect for history."" The press officer for WWF Russia, Daria Buyanova, told the BBC that seeing the images was ""quite a shock"" and that the inscription ""looks like a bad joke"". A scientist at the Institute of Biological Problems of the North, Anatoly Kochnev, said it was unlikely that the bear could have been painted without it being sedated. He said the bear could not have been mobile, or at least must have been quite still while it was being sprayed because ""the characters are evenly written and are all the same size"". He suggested the incident may have taken place in the remote Russian region of Novaya Zemlya, where a team of specialists had earlier sedated polar bears that had been wandering into populated areas. Mr Kochnev said it could take weeks for the markings to wash off, and this could cause problems for the animal, which relies on its white coat when hunting prey in the Arctic snow and ice. Experts are now trying to determine the origin of the video. Russian media speculated that the stunt was linked to local anger at a rise in the number of polar bears coming into communities in Arctic Russia. In February, a state of emergency was declared in the Novaya Zemlya region over the appearance of dozens of polar bears in several towns and villages in the Arctic. Footage from the archipelago showed the animals roaming through buildings and exploring populated areas.

"The UK's troubled retail sector has been given a boost by Black Friday promotions, figures indicate. Barclaycard, which processes nearly Â£1 of every Â£3 spent in the UK, says that sales volumes from 25 November to 2 December were up 7.1% compared with 2018, while sales value rose by 16.5%. ""Consumers have not only been buying more, but also spending more than last year,"" said Barclaycard's Rob Cameron. ""This will no doubt come as welcome news to the retail sector."" It has been a tough year for the retail industry in the UK,with a net 1,234 stores disappearing from Britain's top 500 High Streetsin the first six months, according to accountants PwC. Black Friday, which is an American tradition, started in the UK in 2013, but is rememberedfor fights breaking out as shoppers hunted for bargains in some stores. More retailers have taken part in the following years and the sales period has started to stretch out over a long weekend to include Cyber Monday. These days, some retailers offer discounts for a week or more. Black Friday: I feel guilty about how much I return Black Friday protests at Amazon warehouses in England Black Friday sales offer few real discounts, says Which? Shoppers have also increasingly decided to grab discounted deals online rather than visiting shops themselves. Footfall across UK High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres fell every year from 2015 to 2018 - with 5% fewer people going out to shop last year compared with 2017, according to data provider Springboard. However, this year has bucked the trend with a rise of 3.1% in physical shoppers. The highest rise was seen in shopping centres, which attracted 5.2% more visitors than 12 months ago. This video can not be played The boss of fashion retailer Missguided discusses the importance of Black Friday. Barclaycard's Mr Cameron said: ""Shoppers took full advantage of the discounts on offer. On Black Friday itself, sales volumes were 7.2% higher compared to last year. ""This continued right though to Cyber Monday where we saw sales increase 6.9% compared to 2018 data."" Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, commented: ""This positive result may well 'seal the deal' for retailers in terms of their commitment to Black Friday moving forward, as they will have claimed shoppers early on in the Christmas trading period, giving them the opportunity to steal a march on their rivals."" The company added that it expected the busiest trading day before Christmas to occur on Saturday 21 December. It also expects football on the three days after Christmas to be busier than on Boxing Day. Kyle Monk, head of insight and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, said that despite Black Friday being a week closer to Christmas than in 2018, it was still expected to outperform last year.

"This video can not be played What happened at London Bridge stabbing incident? The man who carried out the stab attack at London Bridge on Friday,named by police as Usman Khan,external, had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. Khan, 28, was wearing a GPS police tag and was out of prison on licence when he launched his attack, in which a man and a woman were killed and three others were injured. Khan was shot dead by officers after members of the public restrained him. The Queen said she was ""saddened"" by the attack. She thanked the emergency services ""as well as the brave individuals who put their own lives at risk to selflessly help and protect others"". Police declared the attack a terrorist incident. LIVE: Investigations continue after London Bridge attack 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker What we know about the London Bridge attacker Khan was known to the authorities,having been convicted for terrorism offences in 2012. He was released from prison on licence in December 2018, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said. As part of his release conditions, Khan was obliged to take part in the government's desistance and disengagement programme - the purpose of which is the rehabilitation of people who have been involved in terrorism. The Parole Board said it had no involvement in the 28-year-old's release, saying he ""appears to have been released automatically on licence (as required by law)"". After leaving prison he had moved into a Stafford property on the ""approved premises"" list. The attack began at 13:58 GMT on Friday at Fishmongers' Hall, at the north end of London Bridge, at a Cambridge University conference on prisoner rehabilitation. The Learning Together scheme, whichfeatured in the BBC's Law in Action programmeearlier this year, allows university students and prisoners to study alongside each other. Khan had been one of dozens of people at the event. Usman Khan, 28, was jailed in 2012 Mr Basu said the attack is understood to have started inside the building, before continuing onto London Bridge itself, where Khan was shot by armed officers. Police are carrying out a search, believed to be linked to the attack, at flats in Stafford, close to the town centre. Staffordshire Police's Deputy Ch Con, Nick Baker, said it was ""vitally important everyone remains alert but not alarmed"". Mr Basu added police were not actively seeking anyone else in relation to the attack, although they were making ""fast time enquiries"" to make sure there was no outstanding threat to the public. A cordoned-off area around London Bridge Forensic officers at the scene on London Bridge The Met Police is urging anyone with information - particularly anyone who was at Fishmongers' Hall - to contact them. Ben Perrin, BBC News Online Staffordshire Police searched flats in Stafford There is a general feeling of shock and disbelief here in Stafford, where a top floor flat is being searched. Blue screens and forensic tents are outside the front of the semi-detached property within a 50m police cordon. I've seen evidence bags being taken out of the house and the garden also appears to be part of the search. The property is believed to be privately-owned and used, in part, as a halfway house. Local residents have told me it has a high turnover of tenants and Khan had only been living there for about six months. A man and a woman were killed during the attack. Three others - a man and two women - were also injured and remain in hospital. NHS chief Simon Stevens said, on Friday, that one person was in a critical but stable condition, another was stable and the third had less serious injuries. None of those killed or injured has so far been named and officers were still working to identify those who died, Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said on Friday. Police believe the attacker had acted alone, the commissioner added on Saturday. The actions of the public have been widely praised, including by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Ms Dick, who said they had shown ""extreme courage"". Videos posted on social media appeared to show passers-by holding Khan down, while a man in a suit could be seen running from him, having apparently retrieved a large knife. One witness described,externalhow a man at the event at Fishmongers' Hall grabbed a narwhal tusk - a long white horn that protrudes from the whale - that was on the wall, and went outside to confront the attacker. Another person let off a fire extinguisher in the face of the attacker to try to keep him at bay. This video can not be played Tour guide Stevie Hurst told 5 Live he kicked the suspect in the head One of those who rushed to help during the attack was a convicted murderer who was attending the prisoner rehabilitation event on day release, the Times reported. James Ford, 42,was jailed for life with a minimum of 15 years in 2004 for the murder of Amanda Champion,external, a 21-year-old woman with learning difficulties. PM to appear on Marr after London attack 'Get off and run': Witnesses describe the scene London Bridge: What we know so far Mr Basu said Khan was wearing what was believed to be a hoax explosive device. The prime minister put election campaigning on hold on Friday to hold a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. Mr Johnson visited the scene at London Bridge on Saturday with Met Commissioner Ms Dick and Home Secretary Priti Patel. He praised the ""incredible"" response by members of the emergency services and the ""sheer bravery"" of members of the public who intervened. Mr Johnson said his ""immediate takeaway"" from the attack was to""toughen up sentences"" for serious and violent offences. ""When people are sentenced to a certain number of years in prison, they should serve every year of that sentence,"" he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited the scene on Saturday alongside Met Commissioner Cressida Dick and Home Secretary Priti Patel London Mayor Sadiq Khan he was ""in awe of the bravery, the courageousness of ordinary Londoners"" who stopped the attacker. He told BBC Breakfast there would be an increased presence of armed and unarmed police officers in London over the weekend, adding they were there to ""reassure us - not because there is an additional or heightened threat"". The London mayor also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK had to make sure the ""right lessons"" were learned from the attack. ""You can't disaggregate terrorism and security from cuts made to resources of the police, of probation - the tools that judges have,"" he said. But security minister Brandon Lewis told the programme funding for counter-terrorism policing had consistently increased since 2015. ""We will make sure that the police has got the resource that it needs,"" he added. This video can not be played The prime minister says the system that allowed the killer out on early release ""does not make sense"" Political parties cancelled some events on Saturday, which had been planned ahead of the general election on 12 December. Flags on UK government buildings will fly at half-mast on Saturday as a mark of respect to all those affected by the attack. The Queen said in a statement: ""Prince Philip and I have been saddened to hear of the terror attacks at London Bridge. ""We send our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies to all those who have lost loved ones and who have been affected by yesterday's terrible violence."" This video can not be played Einar Orn was on his lunch break when suddenly he saw police cars and heard gunshots London Bridge was the scene of another attack, on 3 June 2017, in which eight people were killed and many more injured. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral, the Very Revd Andrew Nunn, said Friday's events had brought back memories of the 2017 attack. ""It's only two-and-a-half years since the June attack and that's not long for healing, and actually it feels as though wounds have been reopened,"" he said. ""Where people felt they had come to terms with what had happened in their community, now I think they're wondering whether they really had - so a lot of work for us to do,"" he added. This latest attack comes afterthe UK's terrorism threat level was downgraded on 4 November from ""severe"" to ""substantial"",meaning that attacks were thought to be ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"". The terror threat level is reviewed every six months by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which makes recommendations independent of government. Some of the early debate about the London Bridge attack has focused on the sentence imposed on Usman Khan. The sentencing judge thought Khan should be freed from prison only when it was safe to do so, as part ""indeterminate penalty"" scheme (IPP). But the Court Of Appeal replaced Khan's IPP with an extended sentence, which required his release at the halfway point of his 16-year custodial term. The IPP regime was scrapped in 2012  - a decision that was widely supported at the time. Since Khan's conviction, legislation has been put in place for the Parole Board to determine when offenders on extended sentences should be let out. The attack also raises questions about the extent to which people convicted of terrorism offences can be de-radicalised. Khan was one of 51 inmates with terror links let out of jail in the 12 months to the end of March 2019, so it's inevitable that the role of those monitoring him will now be scrutinised. Did the authorities pick up any warning signs about Khan? Was he meeting people he shouldn't have done or plotting the attack? If no signs were detected, why not? And if the authorities did spot concerns, what did they do? Friday's horrific attack was the second fatal stabbing at an offender rehabilitation event this month, after Hakim Sillah died at a knife awareness course in Hillingdon, west London. These events will likely fuel concerns about safety at such venues and whether checks need to be strengthened. Did you witness what happened?

"Police have named the London Bridge attacker as Usman Khan, who was previously part of a group that plotted to bomb the city's stock exchange. Khan, 28, was out on licence from prison whenhe killed two people and injured three others in the stabbing attack on Friday, before being shot dead by armed police. Since being released in December 2018 - his conditions requiring him to wear an electronic tag - Khan had been living in Stafford. He also took part in the government's ""Desistance and Disengagement Programme"", the purpose of which is the rehabilitation of those who have been involved in terrorism. In 2012, he was sentenced to indeterminate detention for ""public protection"" with a minimum jail term of eight years after pleading guilty to preparing terrorist acts. The sentence would have allowed him to be kept in prison beyond the minimum term, should the authorities have deemed it necessary. In a reference to Khan and two other defendants, the trial judge said: ""In my judgement, these offenders would remain, even after a lengthy term of imprisonment, of such a significant risk that the public could not be adequately protected by their being managed on licence in the community, subject to conditions, by reference to a preordained release date."" He added that the ""safety of the public in respect of these offenders can only adequately be protected if their release on licence is decided upon, at the earliest, at the conclusion of the minimum term which I fix today."" Within months of his conviction Khan had been upgraded to a ""high risk"" prisoner at HMP Whitemoor. A government source told BBC Look East that Khan became an increased security risk in 2012 ""after making threats to senior prison staff"". He was said by the source to have been a ""model prisoner"" afterwards. However, a prison source told the BBC Khan had ""played everyone"" and was involved in lots of security incidents during his imprisonment. In 2013the Court of Appeal quashed Khan's sentence, replacing it with a 16-year-fixed term of which half was to be served in prison. He was then released automatically at that point. Khan was moved to another maximum security prison, HMP Woodhill, prior to his release on license in 2018. London Bridge attacker had terror conviction London Bridge: What we know so far 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker London Bridge attacker had ties to Cardiff Born and raised in Stoke-on-Trent, Khan was originally jailed along with eight others, who were arrested in 2010. The nine, inspired by al-Qaeda, had been under surveillance by MI5. The men - who were from Stoke, Cardiff and London - were engaged in several plans, one of which involved a plot to place a pipe bomb in the London Stock Exchange. Those from Stoke were overheard discussing potential attacks in their city, including leaving explosive devices in pubs and clubs. Khan described members of the public as ""kuffar"" and ""dogs"". Usman Khan, circled, with his fellow defendants in a surveillance image released by police in 2012 At one point Khan was monitored in conversation about ""how to construct a pipe bomb"" from a recipe in an al-Qaeda magazine. The men had also been funding a proposed madrassa - a college for Islamic instruction - abroad, which was to be used for firearms training and would have been attended by Khan. The court of appeal judgement said: ""The groups were clearly considering a range of possibilities, including fundraising for the establishment of a military-training madrassa in Pakistan - where they would undertake training themselves and recruit others to do likewise - sending letter bombs through the post, attacking public houses used by British racist groups, attacking a high-profile target with an explosive device and a Mumbai-style attack."" It added that they had ""serious long-term plans"" to send Khan and other recruits for ""training and terrorist experience"". ""Should they return to the UK, they would do so trained and experienced in terrorism,"" the judgement continued. Another man from Stoke who was jailed alongside Khan - Mohibur Rahman - was laterconvicted of another terrorist plotfollowing his release from prison. Khan had spent years proselytising in Stoke on so-called ""dawah stalls"" linked to the proscribed terrorist organisation al-Muhajiroun, which was once led by the hate preacher Anjem Choudary. After Khan was jailed, theDaily Star quoted Choudary,externalsaying that the Stoke plotters ""were students of mine"" and ""I knew them for quite a while"". In 2008 Khan's address was one of five properties in Stoke raided by counter-terrorism police. None of those investigated was ultimately charged. This video can not be played Usman Khan speaking to the BBC in 2008: ""I ain't no terrorist"" Speaking at the time, Khan publicly complained about being under suspicion, saying: ""I've been born and bred in England, in Stoke-on-Trent in Cobridge."" He said ""all the community knows me"" and that ""I ain't no terrorist"". While incarcerated, Khan attended some counter terrorism programmes and first came into contact with the educational initiative Learning Together, whose event in London he later so brutally attacked. After leaving prison, Khan appeared as a ""case study"" in a report by the initiative focused on its work at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. Identified only by his first name, Khan was said - since leaving prison - to have given a speech at a fundraising dinner and been provided with a ""secure"" laptop that complied with his licence conditions. Khan contributed a poem to a separate brochure in which he also expressed gratitude for the computer, stating: ""I cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those who continue to support this wonderful community."" The attacker, who was restricted in who he could meet and where he could go, was managed by a panel comprising public bodies - including the police and probation service - under the system of multi-agency public protection arrangements. The day of the attack was the first time Khan had been allowed to visit London since he left prison. The panel that permitted his attendance - in order to attend the Learning Together event - also decided he could travel there unescorted. But when Khan had attended an event elsewhere in the country in May he had been escorted, and - later in the year - Khan was refused permission to travel to Stoke to attend a social event. He was formally under investigation by MI5 at the time of the attack, classed as one of its 3,000 subjects of interest. He was not placed in the top tiers of those under scrutiny.

"Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones were killed during a conference to rehabilitate offenders A man who stabbed two people to death and wounded three others in a ""terror-related"" attack was shot dead by police on London Bridge after he was held down by members of the public. Usman Khan, 28, had been released from jail on licence in 2018, half-way through a 16-year sentence for terrorism offences. Cambridge University graduates Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were killed in the attack. Messages of condolences left at London Bridge Jack Merritt, studied law at the University of Manchester before going to Cambridge to continue his studies. Saskia Jones, was from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, and both were involved in a university prisoner rehabilitation programme at Cambridge University. Mr Merritt, from Cottenham in Cambridgeshire, was a co-ordinator and Ms Jones a volunteer, the Met Police said. They were attacked during a conference being held on Friday afternoon at Fishmongers' Hall, at the north end of London Bridge. Saskia Jones was killed in the London Bridge attack The family of Ms Jones paid tribute to her as a ""positive influence at the centre of many people's lives"". Ms Jones' former university tutor Colleen Moore told BBC Breakfast: ""She was fearless, she was a warrior, she was going to change the world - maybe she will."" ""She was a lovely, lovely woman, she made me laugh. She called me out on things - a lot of people were scared of me, she wasn't."" Mr Merritt had a ""deep commitment"" to the scheme,known as Learning Together, according to people who worked with him. His father David Merritt said his son was ""a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog"". A member of university staff was also among the three people injured. Two of those, both of them women, remain in a stable condition in hospital, according to police. Fishmongers Hall, below London Bridge Khan's attack began at 13:58 GMT inside Fishmongers' Hall. Fishmonger Company chief executive Toby Williamson said staff who fought Khan as he launched his attack believed he was wearing a bomb. He described the scene inside the hall as a game of ""pinball bomb with added knives"". He said one staff member in the hall's reception tried in vain to hold Khan back behind doors while another calmly placed a call to emergency services. Mr Williamson said two men used chairs, fire extinguishers, a pole and a narwhal tusk, which was hanging on the wall, to fend off Khan after he broke through the doors, driving him out of the building. One of those called Lukasz, a Polish national who was working as a porter in the hall's basement, suffered five wounds to his left-hand side as he fended off the knifeman with a pole during ""about a minute of one-on-one straight combat"" - allowing others time to escape danger, Mr Williamson said. Lukasz was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been able to return home. This video can not be played London Bridge attack: 'Pinball bomb with added knives' Khan was forced out of Fishmongers' Hall by a group of men - with hall staff joined by participants of the Learning Together conference - said to include ex-prisoners, probation and prison staff. Two men can be seen in a video holding the attacker back using a whale tusk, seized from a wall mount, and a fire extinguisher spray, before others stepped in to pin him down. In a second video a man is seen walking away holding a large knife they had retrieved. British Transport Police said later he was a plain clothes officer. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons The Metropolitan Police said its armed officers arrived on the scene within five minutes of the initial 999 call. The people holding Khan down were moved away by the armed police officers after they thought he was wearing a suicide vest under his jacket. Families lead tributes to London attack victims 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker 'Turn off your engine, get out and run' He was then shot by an officer. The Met's assistant commissioner said the explosive vest which turned out to be a hoax looked ""very convincing"". Usman Khan, 28, was jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange Mr Basu said Khan was released from jail in December 2018. He had beenconvicted in 2012after plotting with a group from Stoke-on-Trent, London and Cardiff. Theydiscussed attacking the London Stock Exchangeand pubs in Stoke, and setting up a jihadist training camp in Pakistan. Usman Khan was photographed in 2008 One of the conditions of his release was that he should wear an electronic tag. He also had to take part in the government's desistance and disengagement programme, the purpose of which is the rehabilitation of people who have been involved in terrorism. The Parole Board said it had no involvement in his release from jail. Usman Khan had spent yearspreaching in Stokeand had links to the banned organisation al-Muhajiroun. Usman Khan (fourth from the left), pictured in Roath Park, Cardiff on 7 November 2010 An urgent review of the licence conditions of people jailed for terror offenceshas been launchedby the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). It confirmed the number of offenders convicted of terrorism offences who are currently under supervision in the community is 74. In a Twitter response to Brendan Cox, whose MP wife Jo Cox was murdered, Jack Merritt's father said: ""I obviously don't have full facts about the process that led to the attacker being released but what I can say with certainty is that no one at the event had the slightest inkling that he could or would do something like this. ""We don't need knee-jerk reactions."" Hundreds attended the vigil in Cambridge Avigil was held at the Guildhall Yard in London and outside the Guildhall in Cambridgeon Monday. Prayers have also been said at Southwark Cathedral for Mr Merritt and Ms Jones. The Dean, the Very Revd Andrew Nunn, said the incident had brought back memories of the 2017 attack. Officers removed items from the house in Stafford Officers have been carrying out two searches; in Stafford where Khan is believed to have lived, and in Stoke-on-Trent. Mr Basu said police were going through at least 500 images and videos sent to them. Police patrols across London have been increased as a result of the attack. The Queen sent ""thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies to all those who have lost loved ones"" on behalf of herself and Prince Philip.

"The family of London Bridge attacker Usman Khan have said they are ""saddened and shocked"" by what happened and ""totally condemn his actions"". In a statement, they expressed their condolences to the victims' families Khan, who was convicted of a terrorism offence in 2012, killed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, at a prisoner rehabilitation event on Friday. Separately, a porter who tried to fight Khan said he was coming to terms with the incident. Lukasz, who works at the Fishmongers' Hall venue where Khan began his attack, said he ""acted instinctively"" by grabbing a pole to try to stop Khan. Usman Khan's family said in a statement issued through the Metropolitan Police: ""We are saddened and shocked by what Usman has done. ""We totally condemn his actions and we wish to express our condolences to the families of the victims that have died and wish a speedy recovery to all of the injured. ""We would like to request privacy for our family at this difficult time."" This video can not be played What happened at London Bridge? Lukasz, who was among those praised for his bravery during the attack, alsoissued a statement,externalthrough Scotland Yard. ""When the attack happened, I acted instinctively. I am now coming to terms with the whole traumatic incident and would like the space to do this in privacy, with the support of my family,"" he said. The statement confirmed Lukasz was stabbed by Khan and taken to hospital but has now returned home. 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker ""I would like to express my condolences to the families who have lost precious loved ones. I would like to send my best wishes to them and everyone affected by this sad and pointless attack,"" he added. Lukasz said, contrary to some reports, that he had used a pole to tackle Khan while someone else used a narwhal tusk in an attempt to stop the attack. Two women were also injured in the attack before Khan was shot dead by armed officers on London Bridge - the women remain in a stable condition in hospital. Usman Khan had been jailed in 2012 Khan, 28, was arrested in December 2010 and sentenced in 2012 to indeterminate detention for ""public protection"" with a minimum jail term of eight years after pleading guilty to preparing terrorist acts. He had been part of an al-Qaeda inspired group that considered attacks in the UK,including at the London Stock Exchange. But in 2013the Court of Appeal quashed the sentence, replacing it with a 16-year-fixed term, and ordered Khan to serve at least half this - eight years - behind bars. Since his subsequent release in December 2018, Khan had been living in Stafford and was required to wear a GPS police tag. He was armed with two knives and was wearing a fake suicide vest during the attack at Fishmongers' Hall on Friday. He wastackled by members of the public,including ex-offenders from the conference, before he was shot dead by police. London Bridge: What we know What we know about the London Bridge attacker It comes as Leanne O'Brien, the girlfriend of Cambridge University student Mr Merritt who was killed,paid tribute to her partneron Facebook writing: ""My love, you are phenomenal and have opened so many doors for those that society turned their backs on."" Ms O'Brien was seen breaking down in tears as she and Mr Merritt's familygathered at a vigil in Cambridgeon Monday to remember the victims. Mr Merritt's father, David, alsowrote a piece in the Guardian,externaldedicated to his ""absorbingly intelligent"" and ""fiercely loyal"" son. Also killed was Ms Jones, from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, who was a volunteer on the Learning Together programme, which was holding an anniversary event where the event took place. She has been described as a ""lovely, lovely woman"" who was ""fearless"" by her former tutor. Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones were both involved with the Learning Together programme, which was holding an event when the attack took place Friday's attack sparkeda political rowover the release of Khan and a debate over the criminal justice system. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonwas accused of""trying to exploit"" the attack ""for political gain"". HeblamedKhan's release on legislation introduced under ""a leftie government"", and called for longer sentences and an end to automatic release. Mr Johnson denied claims he was politicising the attack, saying he had campaigned against early release for some time, having previously raised the issue during his 2012 campaign to be mayor of London.

"US President Donald Trump will touch down in the UK on Tuesday for a Nato summit - the second visit he has made to Britain this year. What will the security operation involve and what hardware and staff will the president bring with him? Whenever the US president arrives in the UK, a multi-million-pound security operation is brought into action. Mr Trump's three-day state visit in June, which involved more than 6,300 officers,cost the Metropolitan Police Â£3.4m,external, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. A previous four-day working visit in 2018cost more than Â£14.2m. Here are some of the incredible vehicles and entourage the president could be bringing with him this time around. The president is likely to arrive in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Air Force One isn't actually a specific plane but instead refers to one of two specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. Whichever of these aircraft the president is on board is referred to as Air Force One.,external Donald Trump confirms pre-election UK visit Trump visits US troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving With its advanced avionics and defences, Air Force One is classed as a military aircraft, designed to withstand an air attack. It can jam enemy radar and eject flares to throw heat-seeking missiles off course. It is also capable of refuelling midair, allowing it to fly for an unlimited time - crucial in an emergency. Air Force One is also equipped with secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre. There are 85 onboard telephones, a collection of two-way radios and computer connections. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the president, a medical facility with an operating table, a conference and dining room, two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time, and designated areas for the press, VIPs, security and secretarial staff. Several cargo planes, including C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, carry the president's fleet of armoured vehicles and helicopters, usually landing in advance of his arrival. According to the Washington Post, the president is always accompanied by a military aide carrying an emergency satchel known as the ""football"", whichcontains the ""gold codes"" for launching the country's nuclear weapons and options for their use.,external The military aide must be nearby the president at all times, as the commander-in-chief is in possession of personal identification codes required to order a strike. They are carried on a plastic card known as the ""biscuit"", which can be read only when its opaque plastic covering is snapped in two and removed. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines and other security and communications vehicles, are transported ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. On the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - a bullish, enhanced limousine dubbed the ""Beast"" for obvious reasons. The spare, decoy vehicle that accompanies it has the same Washington DC licence plates - 800-002. President Trump's generation of presidential car debuted in 2018 - with the US Secret Service tweeting ahead of the UN General Assembly that it was ""ready to roll"". But the service and vehicle's designers at General Motors have remained tight-lipped about the vehicle's special security features. Weighing in at about nine tonnes (20,000lb) - with an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows (which don't all open) - the car is reported to have tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. Reinforced tyres surround steel-rimmed wheels, which mean the car can still be driven if the tyres are flat. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, to fend off a chemical attack, while special foam would surround the fuel tank in case of impact. The vehicle also has extensive electronic equipment, Reuters reports. The car can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including - NBC News suggests - a fridge full of blood matching the president's blood type, in case of emergency. But that's not all. When the president's on the move - you know about it. Other vehicles in the cavalcade include a parade of police outriders, secret service backup vehicles, counter-assault and hazardous attack teams, an armoured SUV communications vehicle, known as Roadrunner, medics and the press corps. The president could also bring a fleet of helicopters with him to the UK. Among them Marine One, which, like Air Force One, isn't a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president. However, Marine One usually refers toone of the president's large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or the newer, smaller VH-60N White Hawks.,external The specially adapted helicopters are known as ""white tops"" because of their livery and are fitted with communications equipment, anti-missile defences and hardened hulls. It was Sea King versions that met the president at Stansted Airport and carried him to London, accompanied by tandem rotor chinook aircraft. As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys. It is also usually accompanied by two or threeOsprey MV-22 escort aircraft,,externalreferred to as ""green tops"". These tilt-rotor aircraft carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency. The Ospreys, capable of vertical landings and high-speed flight, were heard circling around London during President Trump's last visit to the UK in 2018. Staff are also transported around in CH-46s Sea Knight helicopters. British forces' aircraft are also likely to be part of the security operation during his visit. Some estimates put the number of people in Mr Trump's entourage for his UK visit in 2018 at 1,000, including more than 150 US secret service agents. Staff included military communications specialists, White House aides, a doctor, a chef and members of the media. Some 750 rooms were booked out to accommodate his entourage,external, according to Matt Chorley, of the Times newspaper. For his 2019 state visit, the president was reported to have booked a floor of the Corinthia Hotel in Westminster for his family and entourage. This time around Mr Trump will be in London and Hertfordshire between 2 and 4 December for the Nato summit. He will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace on 3 December, which will be hosted by the Queen.

"This video can not be played Nato explained in 80 seconds Seventy years of existence is clearly worth celebrating, but Nato is strangely low-key about this week's brief gathering of alliance heads of state and government outside London. Nato spokesmen reject the label of ""summit"", insisting that this is really a lesser affair; that there was a full-scale summit only last year; and that this gathering will not release the traditional lengthy communiquÃ© of conclusions and future plans. Why so reticent? This is after all what many Nato advocates call, with some justification, the most successful military alliance in history. Nato was founded in 1949 for the collective defence of its members, linking the security of the United States with its European allies against the Soviet Union. It witnessed the end of communism, defeating the Soviet bloc without firing a shot. It went to war for the first time in the Balkans in the 1990s. It then set out on a new path - so-called ""out of area"" operations beyond Nato's frontiers, notably its operations in Afghanistan and the wider war against terror. What is defence alliance Nato? Can Nato survive President Donald Trump? Nato also set about a programme of expansion, nearly doubling in size. Today it has 29 members and North Macedonia is soon to join its ranks. US troops on a Nato exercise in Lithuania in June 2018 Nato - which is as much a diplomatic as a military alliance - has played a key role in stabilising the new democracies of Europe, whether it be in the Baltic or the Balkans, giving them a new self-confidence and locking them into a formidable security framework. But has this actually produced a stronger Nato? The respected British defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke says ""no"". US President Harry Truman marks the beginning of Nato in 1949 ""Nato is indeed the greatest alliance the world has ever seen,"" he told me, but ""today with some thirty members, it is less than half as strong as it was when it was half this size. ""Nato is in trouble"", he argues, ""even though it's still got lots of capabilities"". Nato expansion is seen within the alliance as a good thing. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg described it to me as a ""historical success"", the alliance helping to spread democracy and the rule of law. Expansion has brought Nato's frontiers 1,000 miles (1,600km) closer to Moscow. Countries once occupied by the Red Army and incorporated into the Soviet Union, like the three Baltic republics, or former Warsaw Pact allies of Moscow like Poland, are now firmly in Nato's orbit, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin does not like this. Russia is pushing back in every way it can, bolstering its nuclear arsenal and seeking to renew its influence abroad. Its controversial but successful campaign to prop up the Assad regime in Syria is a case in point. Nato led a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo after bombing Yugoslavia in 1999 In Europe, Russia is criticised for cyber attacks; information operations to try to influence elections; even political assassination in the wake of a radiological and a chemical weapons attack - the former in London, the second in Salisbury in southern England. The latter attack in Salisbury - which Moscow strenuously denies - prompted a mass expulsion of Russian diplomats and intelligence officers from Nato countries. Many have spoken of a new Cold War. But this one is very different from that of the 1950s and 1960s. Russia's power and influence is a shadow of that of the former Soviet Union's. This is a kind of shadow conflict waged below the threshold of combat, in what analysts call ""the grey zone"", where it is hard to assign blame for intrusive actions like cyber attacks or hacks against computers. ""There is a problem of political consensus in the western world and so we make it easy for Mr Putin,"" Mr Clarke says. ""Russia,"" he argues, ""will be a real nuisance to Nato for the next ten or twenty years. ""But they should not be a strategically important challenge to us unless we let them."" President Putin has warned the West not to cross ""red lines"", meaning Russia's national security interests Russia is simply using the intrinsic weaknesses of the West to further its own goals, he says. ""If the Western world and if the Western democracies are not sufficiently cohesive to deal with this threat - and at the moment I have to say they're not - then the Russians will actually play a big role in European security for the future. They'll dominate the agenda. They'll constrain people's choices. They'll intimidate and they'll use a certain amount of not very subtle blackmail."" This Nato ""summit"" is all about demonstrating solidarity and resolve and also about charting a path for the future. But in the days leading up to the meeting there has been more than a hint of the problems behind Nato's ceremonial faÃ§ade. Nato has proudly announced new spending projections which show that the defence budgets of its European allies will grow further in the years ahead. It has also agreed a new formula to spread the costs of Nato's central budget between its members; a budget that covers its headquarters in Brussels and other commonly funded programmes. The US in this case will pay less and Germany, which lags behind in the proportion of its resources that it devotes to defence, will pay more. It is all an effort to mollify President Donald Trump and to avoid another embarrassing tirade from him aimed at his Nato partners. The burden-sharing debate has long dogged Nato. Mr Trump did not invent it. But he seems to take a peculiarly transactional approach to the alliance, and often does not seem to share a fundamental sense that the survival of a healthy Nato is as much in Washington's interests as it is in those of its European allies. What does the US contribute to Nato? Nato: Cyber-attack on one nation is attack on all Nonetheless, Nato governments have committed to spending at least 2% of their GDP on defence; and many of them are still far from that benchmark. Donald Trump: The uncrowned leader of the Western alliance or a divider? But this focus on funding obscures other problems. Frustration is growing and this is what prompted the French President Emmanuel Macron recentlyto describe Nato as strategically ""brain-dead"". Far from regretting his comments, he amplified them last week, insisting that the alliance needed to stop talking about money all the time and spend more time dealing with its fundamental strategic problems. Only days before this week's summit, a row erupted between France and Turkey.  It illustrates how events in north-eastern Syria are straining relations within Nato. President Macron has repeatedly criticised both Washington's abrupt withdrawal of support for the Kurds and Turkey's related offensive into Syria - two strategic decisions that were taken without consulting other Nato allies. Mr Macron (R), pictured with Mr Stoltenberg, criticised Nato's failure to respond to Turkey's offensive Turkey sees France as far too friendly towards the Kurds. It wants Nato as a whole to back its position in Syria. This episode underscores another fundamental problem for the alliance: what many see as Turkey's drift away from Nato and the West. Ankara's purchase of a sophisticated Russian air defence system is an extraordinary step for a Nato ally. The problem is that Turkey's size and geographical position make it an important, albeit for many troublesome, partner in Nato, despite some analysts questioning if it really should still be in the alliance at all. So, Turkish and US unilateralism; rows over money; a resurgent but ill-defined Russian threat - there's plenty for Nato leaders to talk about when they meet in a luxury resort hotel near Watford, a town best known by many for its nondescript railway junction. Nato too is at a kind of a junction itself. It has many of the problems of success. Many of the decisions it has taken - its expansion to bring in so many new members for example - were driven as much by politics as by strategy. Turkish and Russian forces are carrying out joint ground patrols in northern Syria But the world has changed dramatically since Nato's founding. It is very different again from the world of the 1990s, in which Nato basked in its victory in the Cold War. President Macron's label of ""brain dead"" may be going a bit far. But he has a point. Nato leaders need to get back to strategy, to the big thoughts about where the alliance should be heading. How will it contend with the Russian threat? Does it need to rethink its strategy? Should Nato have a common approach to a rising China? What should be Nato's priorities in the 21st-Century world? How much do Nato members spend on defence? Can Nato survive President Donald Trump?

"This video can not be played Newsnight: Kay Richardson was killed by her estranged husband, after he was released under investigation More than 93,000 suspected violent criminals and sex offenders have been released without restrictions by police in England and Wales since 2017, figures obtained by BBC Newsnight show. People suspected of offences including rape and murder have been among those ""Released Under Investigation"" (RUI). Richard Miller of the Law Society said a ""major scandal"" was brewing over the way RUIs are being used. The Home Office said the cases must be regularly reviewed and managed. In 2017, therules on pre-charge bail changed,making it more difficult for police to keep suspects on bail beyond 28 days. The overuse of RUIs, Mr Miller said, is the unintended consequence of the changes. Unlike pre-charge bail, RUIs do not impose a limit on suspects' movements, stop them from contacting certain people or require them report to a police station. Earlier this monththe government announced plans,externalto review the 2017 changes. In September 2018, Alan Martin, 53, was released under investigation by police in Sunderland, after his estranged wife Kay Richardson had gone to the police accusing him of rape. No conditions were imposed and the police gave Martin the keys back to the home he had shared with Ms Richardson. Martin let himself into the house and waited for Ms Richardson, 49, before attacking her with a hammer and strangling her. ""They might as well have gone and opened the door for him,"" said Audrey Richardson, Kay's mother. ""He killed her,"" she said. ""We've got to accept this and the police is not taking a little bit of responsibility... We are haunted by what happened."" Hidden rape conviction target revealed Thousands of violent crime suspects released without conditions Police accused of 'failing' sexual violence victims in super-complaint Mr Martin had a history of domestic violence. But Northumbria Police said, because he had not been bailed, officers had no legal right to keep the keys from him. The force werecleared of misconductby The Independent Office for Police Conduct. Violence against the person and sexual offences account for almost 100,000 of the cases where an individual was Released Under Investigation since April 2017 Newsnight's data - obtained under the Freedom of Information Act -  revealed there were 322,250 RUI cases between April 2017 to October this year. Of these, 93,098 related to violence against a person and sexual offences cases. The figures were provided by 20 of the 44 police forces in England and Wales - meaning the total number of RUIs since 2017 is likely to be much higher. Caroline Goodwin QC, chairwoman of the Criminal Bar Association, said there were people being released without ""any form of judicial control or indeed police bail control""  which ""can be dangerous"" for victims. Newsnight found 2,772 of the cases involving violent and sexual offences had been classed as RUI for more than 12 months. ""It's unfair on defendants and complainants if these cases are not resolved quickly,"" said Mr Miller, head of justice at the Law Society. ""It also means that the quality of the evidence is impacted as the longer a case is left the more memories fade."" Newsnight spoke to a man who was released under investigation for more than two years, after he was accused of rape. He agreed to speak to the BBC anonymously. ""Your life is effectively put on hold. You're put into this limbo where everything starts falling apart around you, you've got no control of it whatsoever,"" he said. ""I felt suicidal."" He protested his innocence and was eventually told he would not be charged.

"Jack Merritt's family said he was 'looking forward to building a future with his girlfriend, Leanne' The girlfriend of London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt has called him ""phenomenal"" and promised: ""Together, we will make a difference."" Writing on Facebook, Leanne O'Brien said he ""opened so many doors for those that society turned their backs on"". She also shared an article written by Jack's father urging people to ""extinguish hatred with his kindness"". Mr Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were killed by Usman Khan at a prisoner rehabilitation event on Friday. Two women and a man were also injured in the attack before Khan was shot dead by armed officers on London Bridge. In the articlepublished in the Guardian,externalon Tuesday, Jack's father David Merritt paid tribute to his son, who workedfor a programmethat links university students and prisoners. ""Jack believed in the inherent goodness of humanity, and felt a deep social responsibility to protect that,"" said Mr Merritt. He accused politicians of using his son's death to ""perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against"" - and that his son would be ""seething"" at how his death was being used. The family of Jack Merritt took part in a vigil at the Guildhall in Cambridge on Monday On Monday, Ms O'Brien was seen breaking down in tears as she and Mr Merritt's familygathered at a vigil in Cambridgeto pay tribute to him.

Prime Minister Boris Johnsonwas accused of""trying to exploit"" the attack ""for political gain"". HeblamedKhan's release on legislation introduced under ""a leftie government"", and called for longer sentences and an end to automatic release. David Merritt previously said he would not wish his son's death to ""to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences"". And writing in the Guardian, he said: ""If Jack could comment on his death - and the tragic incident on Friday 29 November - he would be livid. ""We would see him ticking it over in his mind before a word was uttered between us. Jack would understand the political timing with visceral clarity."" He added: ""What Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens. ""That door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. ""Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge.""

Mr Johnson denied claims he was politicising the attack, saying he had campaigned against early release for some time, having previously raised the issue during his 2012 campaign to be mayor of London. ""I feel, as everybody does, a huge amount of sympathy for the loss of Jack Merritt's family, and indeed for all the relatives of Jack and Saskia, who perished at London Bridge,"" he said.

"This video can not be played ITV's Philip Schofield asked Jeremy Corbyn several times on This Morning whether he would apologise or not Jeremy Corbyn has apologised again for incidents of anti-Semitism in Labour. The party leader said sorry twice in 2018, but wascriticised for refusing to do so four times in a recent interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil. Asked repeatedly on ITV's This Morning by Phillip Schofield to apologise, Mr Corbyn said: ""Obviously I am very sorry for everything that has happened."" Labour has been dealing with the row over the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than three years. It was reignited during the election campaign after the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis,claimed ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - had taken root"" in Labour. In response, Mr Corbyn said anti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"" and would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government. He said internal processes for dealing with anti-Semitism cases were ""constantly under review"" and his door would be open to Rabbi Mirvis and other faith leaders to discuss their concerns if he entered Downing Street. Live: Latest from the campaign trail Chief rabbi in election attack on Labour Teach British Empire injustice in schools - Labour No apology from Corbyn over anti-Semitism claims In the interview on the mid-morning programme, Schofield said: ""Here is your opportunity now to apologise to the Jewish community for any anti-Semitism by Labour members"". Mr Corbyn began to answer, saying, ""can I make it clear..."", but was interrupted by the presenter who said, ""no, just say sorry"". The Labour leader replied: ""Our party and me do not accept anti-Semitism in any form. Obviously I am very sorry for everything that has happened, but I want to make this clear - I am dealing with it, I have dealt with it. ""Other parties are also affected by anti-Semitism. Candidates have been withdrawn by the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, and by us, because of it. We just do not accept it in any form whatsoever.""

"This video can not be played Newsnight: Kay Richardson was killed by her estranged husband, after he was released under investigation More than 93,000 suspected violent criminals and sex offenders have been released without restrictions by police in England and Wales since 2017, figures obtained by BBC Newsnight show. People suspected of offences including rape and murder have been among those ""Released Under Investigation"" (RUI). Richard Miller of the Law Society said a ""major scandal"" was brewing over the way RUIs are being used. The Home Office said the cases must be regularly reviewed and managed. In 2017, therules on pre-charge bail changed,making it more difficult for police to keep suspects on bail beyond 28 days. The overuse of RUIs, Mr Miller said, is the unintended consequence of the changes. Unlike pre-charge bail, RUIs do not impose a limit on suspects' movements, stop them from contacting certain people or require them report to a police station. Earlier this monththe government announced plans,externalto review the 2017 changes. In September 2018, Alan Martin, 53, was released under investigation by police in Sunderland, after his estranged wife Kay Richardson had gone to the police accusing him of rape. No conditions were imposed and the police gave Martin the keys back to the home he had shared with Ms Richardson. Martin let himself into the house and waited for Ms Richardson, 49, before attacking her with a hammer and strangling her. ""They might as well have gone and opened the door for him,"" said Audrey Richardson, Kay's mother. ""He killed her,"" she said. ""We've got to accept this and the police is not taking a little bit of responsibility... We are haunted by what happened."" Hidden rape conviction target revealed Thousands of violent crime suspects released without conditions Police accused of 'failing' sexual violence victims in super-complaint Mr Martin had a history of domestic violence. But Northumbria Police said, because he had not been bailed, officers had no legal right to keep the keys from him. The force werecleared of misconductby The Independent Office for Police Conduct. Violence against the person and sexual offences account for almost 100,000 of the cases where an individual was Released Under Investigation since April 2017 Newsnight's data - obtained under the Freedom of Information Act -  revealed there were 322,250 RUI cases between April 2017 to October this year. Of these, 93,098 related to violence against a person and sexual offences cases. The figures were provided by 20 of the 44 police forces in England and Wales - meaning the total number of RUIs since 2017 is likely to be much higher. Caroline Goodwin QC, chairwoman of the Criminal Bar Association, said there were people being released without ""any form of judicial control or indeed police bail control""  which ""can be dangerous"" for victims. Newsnight found 2,772 of the cases involving violent and sexual offences had been classed as RUI for more than 12 months. ""It's unfair on defendants and complainants if these cases are not resolved quickly,"" said Mr Miller, head of justice at the Law Society. ""It also means that the quality of the evidence is impacted as the longer a case is left the more memories fade."" Newsnight spoke to a man who was released under investigation for more than two years, after he was accused of rape. He agreed to speak to the BBC anonymously. ""Your life is effectively put on hold. You're put into this limbo where everything starts falling apart around you, you've got no control of it whatsoever,"" he said. ""I felt suicidal."" He protested his innocence and was eventually told he would not be charged. ""I would expect, with the nature of the crime I was accused of, to have been placed under specific instructions,"" he added. ""But there were no restrictions at all.""

"Videos made by disabled users were deliberately prevented from going viral on TikTok by the firm's moderators, the app has acknowledged. The social network said the policy was introduced to reduce the amount of cyber-bullying on its platform, but added that it now recognised the approach had been flawed. The measure was exposed by theGerman digital rights news site Netzpolitik,external. Disability rights campaigners said the strategy had been ""bizarre"". A leakedextract from TikTok's rulebook,externalgave examples of what its moderators were instructed to be on the lookout for: disabled people people with facial disfigurements people with other ""facial problems"" such as a birthmark or squint Down's syndrome autism Such users were ""susceptible to bullying or harassment based on their physical or mental condition"", the guidelines added. According to an unnamed TikTok source quoted by Netzpolitik, the moderators were told to limit viewership of affected users' videos to the country where they were uploaded. And in cases where the creators were judged to be particularly vulnerable, it reported that the moderators were ordered to prevent the clips from appearing in the app's main video feed once they had reached between 6,000 to 10,000 views. This video feed is auto-generated and personalised for each member. It accounts for where most people spend their time watching others' content. Netzpolitik reporter Chris Koever suggested the result was that the Chinese-owned firm had further victimised those affected ""instead of policing the perpetrators"". A spokesman for TikTok admitted it had made the wrong choice. ""Early on, in response to an increase in bullying on the app, we implemented a blunt and temporary policy,"" he told the BBC. ""This was never designed to be a long-term solution, and while the intention was good, it became clear that the approach was wrong. ""We have long since removed the policy in favour of more nuanced anti-bullying policies."" TikTok has not confirmed when it abandoned the measure, but Netzpolitik reported that it was still in force in September. UK-based organisations have condemned the discovery. ""It's good that TikTok has ended this bizarre policy,"" Ceri Smith from the disability equality charity Scope said. ""Social media platforms must do more to tackle cyber-bullying, but hastily hiding away a group of users under the guise of protecting them is not the right approach at all."" Anti-bullying charity Ditch the Label added that it hoped valuable lessons had been learned. ""It is concerning that young people with disabilities have been actively excluded from participating on a platform that prides itself as being fun and inclusive,"" said chief executive Liam Hackett. ""This approach is discriminatory and further demonises disability, which we already know attracts a huge amount of abuse and intolerance."" This is the latest in a series of controversies to affect the short-form video app in recent weeks. In September, the Guardian reported that the app used torestrict or ban political content, including footage of the Tiananmen Square protests, that could be used to criticise the Chinese government. The firm's parent company Bytedance subsequentlydeclined to testify to US Congressabout its ties to China saying it had not been given enough warning. Then last Wednesday, TikTokapologised to a US teenager for removing a video,externalin which she had accused China of mistreating its Uighur Muslim population. This video can not be played WATCH: Feroza Aziz rejected TikTok's explanations for blocking her from its app And it has since emerged that it is being sued by a US student who alleges that the firm surreptitiously transferred ""vast quantities of private and personally identifiable user data"" from the international version of its app to China. TikTok maintains it only stores US user data in the United States and Singapore. For its part, Netzpolitik said it hoped the latest revelations would encourage the app to consult users before imposing potentially discriminatory changes. ""Basically any time you try to make a policy, ask those who will be affected by it,"" said Ms Koever. ""That would be a good start.""

"Ofcom has decided not to investigate a Conservative Party impartiality complaint about a Channel 4 special. The party complained ahead of the Climate Debate on 28 November about C4's intention to ""empty chair"" the Conservatives with an ice sculpture. It criticised the channel's refusal to accept Cabinet Minister Michael Gove as the Tory representative if the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, didn't attend. But Ofcom concluded the Conservative viewpoint had been given due weight. The one-hour programme went on to ""empty chair"" both Mr Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who was also replaced with an ice sculpture. Michael Gove appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show last month In a statement, the media watchdog said: ""Ofcom's election committee concluded that, across the one-hour debate and a subsequent news programme, Channel 4's use of editorial techniques ensured that the Conservative's viewpoint on climate and environmental issues was adequately reflected and given due weight."" The Conservative complaint had described the use of the ice sculpture to replace Mr Johnson as ""a provocative partisan stunt"". Election 2019 coverage on BBC News But Ofcom said: ""The committee also took into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the Prime Minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants."" Channel 4 told Ofcom the programme was intended to be a party leaders' debate from the outset. It added that the leaders of the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the SNP and the co-leader of the Green Party, all agreed to participate in the programme on the understanding it was a leaders' debate. Channel 4 said Mr Gove arrived unannounced at the ITN building ahead of the debate and requested the channel ask the other party leaders in attendance if they would agree to him participating instead of Mr Johnson. Channel 4 said it did so but they declined. Broadcasters have editorial freedom in determining the format of any election debate. Depending on the circumstances, they may choose to proceed without having agreed the participation of a particular political party or politician, providing they take steps to ensure the programme complies with Ofcom'sdue impartiality,externalandelection rules,external.

"An artists' impression of Sky's Elstree development, which will have 14 sound stages. Media giant Sky is to build huge new film studios near the existing Elstree production site outside London, creating 2,000 jobs. The 32-acre development will be used by Sky, other Comcast-owned firms including NBC Universal, and be open to third parties. Sky predicted up to Â£3bn would be invested in new production at the site over the next five years. The UK's film and television sector has performed strongly in recent years. Hit shows such as The Crown and Games of Thrones have been filmed using UK facilities as the battle between Netflix, Amazon and other streaming services has intensified. Sky spends Â£7bn a year on production in Europe, including football rights, and plans to double the amount it spends on making its own content to Â£1bn per year by 2024. Sky Studios chief executive Gary Davey said it was hard to keep up with the increasing demand for high quality content, given that it typically takes three years to bring a project to the screen. Chernobyl, a Sky HBO joint production, took 10 years to make, Mr Davey said. Mr Davey said recent successes, such as the Sky-HBO joint production, Chernobyl, and HBO smash-hit Game of Thrones, had a high proportion of European actors, and showed US audiences were ready to embrace productions made overseas. Choosing to build the new studios at Elstree meant there would already be a pool of UK production talent available, he added. The UK now boasts a world-leading film industry, supported by wide-ranging tax relief, including for television and animation. According to the British Film Institute (BFI),UK films grossed $9.4bn (Â£7.2bn) in 2018,external, a 23% share of the global box office take. There is a long history of film making at Elstree. The existing studios, in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, date back to 1925, and were used by George Lucas when he filmed the original Star Wars trilogy. The new Sky studies will be located close by on land owned by Legal and General, which will fund the development and lease the studios back to Sky. The studios, which will cost hundreds of millions of pounds to build, will have 14 sound stages. Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal and General, said the plans were ""another development in the modernisation of British industry"". Over the last five years Legal and General has made Â£20bn of investments in similar projects. Why are Premier League games at strange times this week?

" Election battleground: Enniskillen As politicians campaign for votes, we are looking closely at the places where the election could be won or lost. The town of Enniskillen - just a few miles from the UK-Irish border - is in the constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, which is typically among Northern Ireland’s closest-run contests. However, one man there is trying to break the deadlock between the parties.  By Jon Kelly    Dylan Quinn pulled on his walking boots and stepped outside. It was a clear morning and the sun had just risen over his hometown of Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh. He was setting off on foot to the Parliament Buildings in Stormont, a distance of approximately 90 miles - one for every member of the Northern Ireland Assembly who wasn’t currently taking their seat. This was January 2019, almost two years since the devolved Assembly had collapsed in the wake of a scandal over a flawed green energy scheme. While the chamber sat empty, politics hadn’t stopped mattering to people and their communities.  In Enniskillen, there were still potholes in the roads and complaints of a staffing crisis at the local hospital. And most significantly, the border with the Republic of Ireland, one of the most contentious sticking points in the row over Brexit, was only 10 miles (16km) away. And so as the months had gone by, Dylan felt a growing sense of exasperation and disbelief. He’d grown up in a town that had suffered badly during the Troubles - the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland that began in the late 1960s. He remembered checkpoints at the borders and soldiers on the streets. The power-sharing deal that had brought devolution back to Northern Ireland had been the outcome of a long and delicate peace process agreed by the British and Irish governments, and unionist and nationalist leaders. Now he and his wife were raising four children just outside Enniskillen. Why on earth, he wondered, were their futures being put at risk? A wiry, fast-talking 45-year-old who runs a dance theatre in the town, Dylan thought hard about how he could express his frustration. Then the idea came to him. “I think walking is a very good, peaceful, non-threatening protest action,” he says. “It was about saying to people, ‘This is actually something quite simple.’” Enniskillen was a highly symbolic place to start. Built on an island, the town straddles the Upper and Lower sections of Lough Erne, its grand Georgian streets surrounded by a network of lakes, marshes and woodland. It sits within the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, Westminster’s most westerly seat, at the very edge of the Union. The area’s carefully balanced demographics mean that at recent elections it has swung between nationalist and unionist candidates by the tightest of margins.   In 2017, Sinn Fein’s Michelle Gildernew won by 875 votes over former Ulster Unionist Party leader Tom Elliott. The Democratic Unionist Party hasn’t stood in the Westminster seat since 2005 so as not to split the unionist vote. However, DUP leader Arlene Foster, an Enniskillen native, represents the area in the Assembly. In 2015, Elliott won by 530. In 2010, Gildernew edged out another unionist unity candidate by just four. Dylan planned his route carefully. It would take him three days. He’d aim first for the village of Ballygawley in Co Tyrone, rest there for the night, then push on to Portadown, Co Armagh. On the third morning he’d aim towards Belfast. He posted his itinerary on Facebook and invited well-wishers to join him. His journey turned out to be more arduous than he expected.  In 1984, Dylan was at a junior swimming club in Enniskillen’s leisure centre looking out the window when a crack suddenly appeared in it. Four off-duty soldiers who had just returned from a fishing trip had been the target of a booby trap set by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Three and a half years later, in the front room of his home in the mostly nationalist Hillview estate, Dylan felt a sudden surge of pressure around him. Then he heard a blast and, through the window, saw a puff of smoke forming across the town. An IRA device had gone off at a Remembrance Day parade, killing 11 people.    Back then, the Troubles were an inescapable presence. “You were not just aware of it, it was all around you,” Dylan recalls. In 1981, IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands was elected MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone - a hugely significant event in terms of the republican movement’s shift towards electoral politics. Then as now, the very closeness of the result made everything “a green or an orange issue” - that is, seen through the prism of nationalist versus unionist. But there was more to life besides politics and sectarian divisions. “In the community, we kind of got on with things,” Dylan says. As a rural area, Fermanagh wasn’t segregated in the same way that a city like Belfast might be. His parents - his father was a chef and a musician, his mother a dinner lady and cleaner - were both from big families and were well-known across Enniskillen, with friends on both sides of the sectarian divide. The classroom was one area where Catholics and Protestants didn’t mix much. But at one point Dylan had to go to drama lessons at a different school from his own, one attended overwhelmingly by pupils from Protestant families. His uniform marked him out as a Catholic. One day, as he was leaving the high school with his cousin, a group surrounded them and jostled them as they walked. Then out of the corner of his eye he saw a much bigger boy charging across the road towards him. His uniform identified him as a Protestant. “And I thought, that’s it, we’re done for, we’re not fighters,” says Dylan. But Dylan was wrong. The larger boy pushed the tormentors away from him and his cousin, and walked them to the end of the road and safety. “I remember thinking, ‘OK, not everybody is as you would think,’” says Dylan. It was a turning point for him. “And those sorts of things were a key factor in me thinking, ‘Actually, things can change here, but it’s going to be a slow process.’”  Battlegrounds Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire Bishop Auckland Cheltenham Pembrokeshire Norwich Southampton  As a trained dancer, Dylan had always thought of himself as relatively fit and healthy. But he wasn’t used to walking these kind of distances, not continuously, not for seven or eight hours at a time. “It was much harder in the legs and feet than I expected it to be,” he says. At one point he got lost, and had to turn back, adding 10 miles to the journey. But people were coming along to join him. Dylan couldn’t keep track of how many there were. Some strolled only short distances, others stayed with him to the end.     They told him why they’d come along - because they’d been on a hospital waiting list for years, or because their children’s schools had asked them to donate toilet paper and hand wash, and nothing was being done about any of this in the absence of a government. Some said they didn’t feel there was a future in Northern Ireland for their children and grandchildren - they believed nothing would improve while the deadlock continued. Others said they were considering leaving themselves. This point hit home with Dylan. Out of five siblings, he was the only one still living in Northern Ireland. He’d left himself at 18 to train as a dancer, working for years in England and further afield, before moving back to Fermanagh when his eldest son was born. Victoria Graham also noticed an exodus from Northern Ireland. Most of her school friends left the country to study - only two have come back. But Victoria stayed put. She met her husband at 18 and, although she was offered a university place, decided to remain with him and get married. Now 35, Victoria doesn’t regret her decision - she loves the area’s abundant natural beauty and believes it’s the perfect place to raise her daughter. She’s studying for a degree with the Open University. But at times, she feels isolated. “It’s been hard in terms of having a social group,” she says.   While Belfast has enjoyed a visible so-called “peace dividend”, with its refurbished Victorian buildings and revitalised former docklands, Fermanagh sometimes feels forgotten, she says. And the collapse of the Assembly has made that worse, Victoria believes - the absence of a government means there are no local ministers to take decisions to address its lack of rural public transport or its low-wage economy. Still, she knows how much has improved since she was growing up. She remembers asking her father, a police officer, why he had to check underneath the car before the family could travel anywhere, and why he had to bring his gun with him to church. He was on duty nearby when the Remembrance Day bomb went off and witnessed the carnage first hand, pulling victims from the rubble. Victoria knows Fermanagh has come a long way since those days. “On the surface, everything is peaceful here,” she says. “And it’s lovely that everybody gets along and that there’s peace, it’s fantastic. But when elections come and the posters start going up… There’s an underlying tension, shall we say.” And often in such a closely fought race, she believes, the desire not to let the other side triumph often proves the strongest motivating factor: “It’s not what you’re voting for, it’s what you’re voting against.”   When Dylan set off from Portadown on the final morning, it was still dark. A man turned up clutching an energy drink. He’d just come off a nightshift. Dylan asked him: “Are you walking with me a bit?” The man replied: “I’m coming all the way to Stormont.” This wasn’t the first time Dylan had organised a protest about the lack of devolution. The previous August, when Northern Ireland was poised to pass Belgium’s record as the peacetime democracy that had gone longest without a government, he’d posted a video on Facebook calling for people to demonstrate. That had led to 14 rallies under the We Deserve Better banner.   The Assembly’s suspension meant it was left to Westminster to legislate on Northern Ireland’s behalf on divisive issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. For campaigners who supported change, this was a welcome intervention - but those who opposed it reacted with fury. Other issues fell by the wayside. For example, when Parliament was dissolved in November for the election, it in effect slammed the brakes on a Westminster domestic abuse bill. This included a provision to make coercive control an offence for the first time in Northern Ireland, bringing it into line with the rest of the UK. Dylan doesn’t blame any one single factor for the impasse. But as well as a failure of political leadership, Dylan believes the absence of a peace and reconciliation process has prevented Northern Irish politics from moving on from the past. “We still have people who, rightfully and understandably, feel hurt and traumatised by their experience, but there’s no process for them to go through that, there’s no process for accountability. We’re not going to be able to get over that until that’s dealt with.” Shauna Gallagher’s childhood was very different from Dylan’s and Victoria’s. She was born in 1988, on a farm near Irvinestown, a few miles outside Enniskillen. She doesn’t ever remember seeing any checkpoints. With the peace process unfolding, her parents consciously brought her up to treat everyone the same regardless of their religion. She was 15 before she realised she had a recognisably Catholic name.     As a child she loved the freedom she had on the farm. But as she grew older she felt restricted by it. “I found being a teenager really difficult,” she says. It became harder when she was affected badly by acne. “It does really affect your confidence,” she says. “Unconsciously, I always wore my hair down so it was around my face. I’d always wear a thick layer of makeup.” The skincare products she bought from the shops didn’t help much. So she took a beauty therapy course and started making her own natural cleansers, moisturisers and toners in her parents’ kitchen. “I thought: ‘It can’t be that hard, I’ll do it myself,’” she says. It worked. Her acne cleared up. For the first time, people started complimenting her on her complexion: “God Shauna, your skin looks great.” They’d ask which products she was using and could they buy a pot? So she decided to set up her own business. She learned everything there was to know about cosmetics - not just how to make them, that was the simple part, but also all the regulations and legislation she needed to follow. There was a setback when she found the name she had chosen for her business had already been trademarked by a major manufacturer - “I cried for about a week” - but soon she found her own premises, with a shop at the front and a small space to make up the products herself by hand. She moved in not long before the Brexit vote. As well as selling online and to stockists around Northern Ireland, she began supplying shops across the Irish Sea in Great Britain too. There were also opportunities in the Republic, but - although it was only a few miles away - she thought it was safer to concentrate on the UK market. What if there was a hard border? What if post-Brexit UK adopted different regulations and standards from the EU? It was too big a risk.    And then in October this year, the prime minister returned from Brussels with his latest deal. Legally the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, would leave the Customs Union. But in practice there wouldn’t be checks on the border with the Republic - in effect, the customs border would be in the Irish Sea. Now Shauna sees the decision not to go after the market in the Republic as a missed opportunity. “I thought: ‘Why would I build these relationships and then maybe stop or maybe have to double the price?’ So it’s held my business back in terms of growth.” Shauna blames Brexit for creating this uncertainty. She fears the new customs arrangements will mean extra red tape when she does business in Great Britain – the government has insisted it won’t, but there is still a lack of clarity about what it will mean in practice for businesses in Northern Ireland. A few miles away, in the tiny village of Monea, Suzanne Livingstone, 52, isn’t worrying. Suzanne was raised and started a family of her own in Belfast. But she and her husband always used to take their holidays in Fermanagh. In 2001, feeling burned out by the pace of city life, they decided to move there permanently. They set up a business from their house, selling home-made jam, marmalade, chutneys and pottery. Mostly they supply gift shops and cafes around Northern Ireland itself. She wants the Assembly to get back to work and thinks it needs to do more to promote tourism in Fermanagh. But the prospect of Brexit doesn’t trouble her too much.    “Everybody’s still going to get up in the morning,” she says. “We’re all going to go to work. We’re still going to need to eat and to do all the basic things of human life.” The warnings about Brexit remind her of the year 2000, when there were fears that the Millennium Bug would cause aeroplanes to fall from the sky. “On 1 January, we got up and life went on as normal,” she says. She thinks it will be the same this time: “Life will go on.”   “By the time I got to Belfast,” recalls Dylan, “my feet werebad.” It hadn’t been so onerous on country roads. Now, as he neared the city, there were kerbs to go up and down. But there were more people with him, too. He reached Stormont earlier than he had expected. Beyond the looming statue of Lord Carson, a former unionist leader, he could see the columns of the Parliament Buildings, the edifice’s classical grandeur an ironic counterpoint to the lack of activity inside. Now he was right in front of Stormont. There were camera crews. People were taking his photo. He was asked to speak and he did, but making it about him hadn’t been the point. He wasn’t under any illusions that his walk had changed much. He was still worried about where things were heading. “We’re a very naive democracy in Northern Ireland, a very young democracy. And to play with that is very dangerous,” he says. “I don’t know what that answer is but all I can do is try to continue to do something. A little something. In the hope that all the little things I do will maybe join in with what other people do. And we’ll end up moving along in the right direction.”  Dylan’s wife and children had come to meet him and drive him back home. When they reached the car, Dylan lowered himself into the passenger seat. The lower half of his body ached and all he wanted to do was lie down - to put his legs in the air, feel the tension drain from his limbs. But there wasn’t space to do that, not in a small vehicle heading south-west in the dark towards Enniskillen. He knew there was a long road ahead, for him, his hometown, and the rest of Northern Ireland.

Comedian Sandi Toksvig co-founded the Women's Equality Party in 2015 The Womenâs Equality Party is fielding candidates in three
seats, with the aim of drawing attention to unresolved sexual harassment cases
and what it says is the lack of action by political parties. In Dover, Luton North and Bury South, the MPs who represented the
constituency in the last Parliament faced allegations of sexual harassment. All
three have denied the allegations. The WEPâs candidates - Eljai Morais (Dover), Serena Laidley
(Luton North) and Gemma Evans (Bury South) â are all themselves survivors of
sexual assault and violence. They are campaigning for changes to the law to give constituents
the power to remove MPs if an independent third party finds them guilty of
harassment or violence. MPs who are being investigated over harassment claims should be
suspended from duty, they say, not just lose the party whip as has happened in
the past. They are also seeking guaranteed funding for services that
support women and girls who have experienced violence and abuse as well as
universal free childcare from the age of nine months. The party says none of its rivals are âambitious enoughâ when it
comes to tackling the issue and only it is pursuing the radical action required
to âcreate a society where women can live free from fearâ.

This video can not be played What a split from Labour led to in the past A huge force in British politics in the 1980s, the Social
Democratic Party is fielding 20 candidates in the election - its largest number
for more than 40 years. It is mainly targeting Labour voters in constituencies which
backed Brexit and which it hopes will be attracted by its âsensible blend of
red and blue policiesâ. The party backs the UK leaving the EU by 31 January, come
what may â either with the current withdrawal agreement if it is backed by
Parliament or without a deal. It is calling for a public inquiry into the governmentâs
handling of Brexit preparations and negotiations, including the roles played by
Theresa May and David Cameron. It is also proposing a big shake-up of taxation. It wants to
reinstate a starting rate of income tax axed in 2008. It would raise the
rate of tax paid by the highest-earners from 45% to 47%. Other policies include:  Leader William Clouston says the SDP is âre-emergingâ as a

The Liberal Party would scrap the Trident nuclear weapons system First up in our mini-series of posts about smaller parties is the Liberal Party. It says its 20 candidates are standing on a
platform of âreal liberalismâ that will put power in the hands of the people. Unlike the much larger Liberal Democrats, the party says the
Brexit referendum vote must be respected and the UK has to leave the EU. Its president, Steve Radford, says âold wounds should not be
re-openedâ and everyone should come together to try to make a success of
Brexit. On tax, the party wants the low paid to keep as much of
their income as possible. It would overhaul inheritance tax, slashing rates
from 40% to 10% while scrapping allowances and exemptions and giving all
25-year-olds a one-off universal inheritance payment. The Liberal Party would scrap the Trident nuclear weapons system,

Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has confirmed a member of her party's staff has been suspended for ""faking"" an email. The email was reportedly sent as part of legal fight between the Lib Dems and news site Open Democracy. Ms Swinson said the ""unacceptable"" incident had led to ""swift action"". The row between the Lib Dems and Open Democracy relates to a story about the party selling personal data - something the party denies. The Lib Dems accused the website of not including a response from the party in its story. The website insists one of its journalists had contacted the Lib Dems for a response ahead of publication, but the party had not replied. Read the full story here.

US President Donald Trump is the latest Nato leader to arrive in Downing Street after a trip to Buckingham Palace. Mr Trump and First Lady Melania Trump had to wait outside for several minutes before they were let into No 10, though. That's because they were caught in a line-up of leaders - French President Emmanuel Macron, who arrived at the same time as the US leader, was being photographed on the doorstep by members of the press. Mr and Mrs Trump stood and listened to carol singers before giving the cameras a wave and heading inside. Raoul Li-Everington, 27, is a junior doctor working for the NHS in
north London. Speaking from the protest, he says the health service is in ""decline"" due to
""austerity"" policies. ""It's clear to me that the next step is for the Americans
to start investing in the NHS, buying up the NHS. That only leads to universal coverage not existing
anymore,"" he says. ""People will have poorer care and we will inherit a lot of
America's health problems in terms of their system. I'm here on behalf of all the junior doctors in this
country worried about the path the NHS is heading down, which is
depressing,"" he adds. Desiree Cranenburgh, 62, from Hammersmith in London and a former
NHS employee in a pharmacy department, says: ""I don't think we can trust
Trump and Boris Johnson on not doing some sort of a deal, it's big business
(for) the pharmaceutical companies.""  Boris Johnson and Donald Trump have both today said the NHS is not on the table for trade deals. Others in the crowd say they are protesting against the Nato
gathering in London. Sue Roebuck, 73, from London, said: ""I think Nato is a
war-mongering organisation, it's not there for peace at all."" ""It's all about militarising the whole world,"" she
added. She argues investment in tackling cyber-crime and environmental
concerns should come before spending on the military and nuclear defences. NHS workers and anti-war activists are targeting US President Donald Trump and Nato in a protest in central London. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square before
marching towards Buckingham Palace, where Mr Trump and other Nato leaders are being hosted by the Queen. Some protesters are concerned about the possible impact
of a future trade deal between the US and the UK affecting the NHS. Their placards bear a range of messages for Mr Trump and for Nato, including about the NHS and in relation to global conflicts. No 10 has issued a statement following Boris Johnson's talks earlier with Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Downing Street said the quartet discussed the situation in Syria and Libya, joint counter-terrorism work and defence partnerships, including through Nato. On Syria, it said the leaders agreed on the need to facilitate humanitarian access and a role for the United Nations in determining the supply of aid in the north-east of the country following Turkey'scontroversial incursion in October. According to human rights organisations, the Turkish offensive - which began days after the US pulled its troops out of the region - has led to the deaths of more than 70 civilians in Syria and left 300,000 people displaced. The quartet also promised to work together to secure a lasting ceasefire in Syria and a political settlement, as well as the safe return of refugees.

Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent On a farm in Essex, Jo Swinson's been talking about the same issue as many of the other parties today - a potential post-Brexit trade deal with the US. But the Lib Dems aren't talking about the NHS in relation to this (like the other parties). Instead, they're discussing the potential impact that a trade deal with the US could have on farming and food imports. In particular, party leader Ms Swinson has been warning about the impact of things like chlorinated chicken and testosterone-filled beef. The US has said in the past that the UK should be open to these kinds of farming methods and standards.  Ms Swinson says a Brexit that leaves the UK ""begging Donald Trump for a trade deal"" is likely to lead to ""pressure to weaken food quality standards - and that's not something that will be good for farmers"". Of course, the Lib Dem argument on all of this is that if you stop Brexit, food standards will be maintained and British farmers' subsidies will be protected. David CornockBBC Parliamentary correspondent Jo Swinson has been campaigning at a farm near Chelmsford this afternoon Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson confirms a member of the partyâs staff has been suspended for
allegedly âfakingâ an email. Speaking on a visit to an arable farm near Chelmsford, Essex, Ms Swinson says the incident was
âcompletely unacceptableâ and an investigation has been launched. The Guardian reports an unnamed person was suspended for forging an email to back up
a legal threat against the media platform, Open Democracy. Ms Swinson does not confirm the identity of
the staff member but says: âThere was an email that was
sent which was inaccurate, which was faked. Thatâs not acceptable, thereâs an
investigation, the member of staff has been suspended and Iâm not going to
comment further on staffing matters.â She says the action was ""unacceptable... and itâs right that we have taken that action"". The Lib Dems have been accused of distributing misleading information during this campaign -read our Reality Check piece about some of the accusations. Ms Swinson says: âObviously we communicate
with people across the country through our 'focus' newsletters, through
newspapers that we put out, through letters that we send to people, through a
wide variety of campaigning methods and that is common not just for Liberal
Democrats. âThat is what other parties do as well so

"Ofcom has decided not to investigate a Conservative Party impartiality complaint about a Channel 4 special. The party complained ahead of the Climate Debate on 28 November about C4's intention to ""empty chair"" the Conservatives with an ice sculpture. It criticised the channel's refusal to accept Cabinet Minister Michael Gove as the Tory representative if the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, didn't attend. But Ofcom concluded the Conservative viewpoint had been given due weight. The one-hour programme went on to ""empty chair"" both Mr Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who was also replaced with an ice sculpture. Michael Gove appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show last month In a statement, the media watchdog said: ""Ofcom's election committee concluded that, across the one-hour debate and a subsequent news programme, Channel 4's use of editorial techniques ensured that the Conservative's viewpoint on climate and environmental issues was adequately reflected and given due weight."" The Conservative complaint had described the use of the ice sculpture to replace Mr Johnson as ""a provocative partisan stunt"". Election 2019 coverage on BBC News But Ofcom said: ""The committee also took into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the Prime Minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants."" Channel 4 told Ofcom the programme was intended to be a party leaders' debate from the outset. It added that the leaders of the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the SNP and the co-leader of the Green Party, all agreed to participate in the programme on the understanding it was a leaders' debate. Channel 4 said Mr Gove arrived unannounced at the ITN building ahead of the debate and requested the channel ask the other party leaders in attendance if they would agree to him participating instead of Mr Johnson. Channel 4 said it did so but they declined. Broadcasters have editorial freedom in determining the format of any election debate.

"Lawyers for British diver Vern Unsworth (L) said Mr Musk's tweets were ""vile and false"" Tesla boss Elon Musk is due to take the stand in a Los Angeles court and face the British diving specialist he accused of being a paedophile. Vern Unsworth was among the team credited with co-ordinating theJuly 2018 rescue of 12 boys trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. Mr Musk, in a now-deleted tweet, described Mr Unsworth as a âpedo guyâ. The entrepreneur gave no evidence to support the comment. He is being sued for defamation. Lawyers representing Mr Unsworth have described Mr Muskâs tweets as âvile and falseâ. The British diver is seeking punitive and compensatory damages. The outburst last year appeared to be in response to comments made by Mr Unsworth in an interview on CNN, in which he criticised Mr Muskâs decision to send a purpose-built mini-submarine to the Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai Province to help with rescue efforts. Mr Unsworth described it as a âPR stuntâ, later adding that Mr Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurtsâ. Thai cave rescue a year on Elon Musk reveals brain-hacking plans Taking to Twitter, Mr Musk said: ""Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it."" When questioned about the allegation by other Twitter users, Mr Musk replied with âbet ya a signed dollar it's trueâ. That tweet was also later deleted. After Teslaâs stock price dipped by as much as 4%, Mr Musk sent a tweet expressing an apology. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 âHis actions against me do not justify my actions against him,â he wrote, explaining that his comments were ""spoken in anger after Mr Unsworth said several untruths and suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness and according to specifications from the dive team leaderâ. Teslaâs share price recovered. However, Mr Musk went on to repeat the claim in an email exchange after being contacted by Buzzfeed reporter Ryan Mac. âStop defending child rapists,â Mr Musk wrote to the reporter. He had apparently intended the comments to be off the record but did not agree that with Mr Mac prior to emailing his response. Mr Unsworth is seeking damages for the content of the tweets only, not the email exchange - though Los Angeles District Judge Stephen Wilson said it could be used to illustrate Mr Muskâs state of mind when sending the scrutinised tweets. Mr Muskâs legal team insisted he would not be seeking an out-of-court settlement. Instead, he will argue that âpedo guyâ was not an insult suggesting Mr Unsworth was a paedophile. âPedo guy was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up,â Mr Musk said in a court filing as part of a failed request to have the case thrown out of court. ""It is synonymous with âcreepy old manâ and is used to insult a personâs appearance and demeanour, not accuse a person of paedophilia.â Diver Vern Unsworth (R) helped bring top international cave rescuers to the mission, including Rob Harper (C) Mr Unsworthâs legal team referred to the explanation as âoffensive to the truthâ. As well as agreeing to hear the case, Judge Wilson denied the defenceâs request to define Mr Unsworth as a âpublic figureâ - meaning lawyers for Mr Unsworth do not have to prove Mr Musk acted with ""actual malice"", lowering the bar necessary to win the case. Jury selection is due to begin on Tuesday at 09:30 local time (17:30 GMT), with the first witnesses - Mr Musk among them - likely to be called later on Tuesday.

"This video can not be played ITV's Philip Schofield asked Jeremy Corbyn several times on This Morning whether he would apologise or not Jeremy Corbyn has apologised again for incidents of anti-Semitism in Labour. The party leader said sorry twice in 2018, but wascriticised for refusing to do so four times in a recent interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil. Asked repeatedly on ITV's This Morning by Phillip Schofield to apologise, Mr Corbyn said: ""Obviously I am very sorry for everything that has happened."" Labour has been dealing with the row over the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than three years. It was reignited during the election campaign after the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis,claimed ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - had taken root"" in Labour. In response, Mr Corbyn said anti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"" and would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government. He said internal processes for dealing with anti-Semitism cases were ""constantly under review"" and his door would be open to Rabbi Mirvis and other faith leaders to discuss their concerns if he entered Downing Street. Live: Latest from the campaign trail Chief rabbi in election attack on Labour Teach British Empire injustice in schools - Labour No apology from Corbyn over anti-Semitism claims In the interview on the mid-morning programme, Schofield said: ""Here is your opportunity now to apologise to the Jewish community for any anti-Semitism by Labour members"". Mr Corbyn began to answer, saying, ""can I make it clear..."", but was interrupted by the presenter who said, ""no, just say sorry"". The Labour leader replied: ""Our party and me do not accept anti-Semitism in any form. Obviously I am very sorry for everything that has happened, but I want to make this clear - I am dealing with it, I have dealt with it. ""Other parties are also affected by anti-Semitism. Candidates have been withdrawn by the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, and by us, because of it. We just do not accept it in any form whatsoever.""

"This video can not be played President Trump talks about the UK's National Health Service Donald Trump has insisted the US wants ""nothing to do"" with the NHS in post-Brexit trade talks as he sought to repudiate opposition claims that the health service would be ""up for sale"". On a visit to the UK, the US President claimed he had no interest in increased market access to the NHS for US firms even if handed on a ""silver platter"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he still had ""very serious concerns"". And the SNP said MPs should pass a law to exclude the NHS from discussions. Boris Johnson said the Conservative election manifesto had ""categorically ruled out"" any NHS services, or drug prices, being up for negotiation. In June,the US president suggested the health service would form part of negotiationsover a possible future trade deal after the UK leaves the EU, saying: ""When you're dealing in trade, everything is on the table."" Live: Latest from the campaign trail Donald Trump arrives in UK for Nato summit Row over Labour's 'NHS for sale' claim Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? But speaking on Tuesday morning as he and other world leaders prepared for a summit to mark the 70th anniversary of Nato, he issued a different message. ""I don't even know where that rumour started,"" he told journalists. ""We have absolutely nothing to do with it. If you handed it [the NHS] to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it."" Mr Trump's visit comes at hugely sensitive time, with less than 10 days to go before the election - and with the issues of Brexit and the NHS having largely dominated the campaign so far. The US President insisted he would be ""staying out"" of the election. While he remained a ""fan of Brexit"" and thought Mr Johnson was ""very capable"", he said he would be prepared to ""work with anybody"" in No 10. This video can not be played Corbyn: ""Our NHS will not be put up for sale to anybody"" This video can not be played Jo Swinson: Trump is ""not someone who shares our values"" In October, he suggested Mr Corbyn would be ""bad"" for the UK and declined an offer to meet the Labour leader during his state visit. Mr Corbyn has repeatedly claimed that the NHS would be ""up for sale"" if the Conservatives hold onto power. At a campaign event last week, the Labour leader showed an unredacted report that gave details of meetings between US and UK officials. The document shows the US is interested in discussing drug pricing - mainly extending patents that stop cheaper generic medicines being used - and refers to the US policy of making ""total market access"" a starting point in any trade talks. The Labour leader welcomed Mr Trump's latest comments but said he was far from reassured by them. ""I'm pleased that he's said that but, if that's the case why have these talks gone on for two years?"" he told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show. ""Why have they been kept secret? I think there is very very legitimate grounds for very very serious concern here."" Mr Corbyn said if he was introduced to Mr Trump at a reception at Buckingham Palace later, which both are attending, he would impress on him how ""precious"" the NHS was to the British people and make clear a Labour government would discontinue trade talks if it was not excluded. On a trip to Salisbury, the prime minister described the opposition's claims as ""pure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda triangle stuff"". ""I can categorically rule out any part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiation... including pharmaceuticals."" And Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested Labour was only raising the issue because it had ""no plan for Brexit and no plan for the economy"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Raab ruled out any privatisation of the NHS ""under the Conservatives' watch or this prime minister's watch"". Trade decisions would be made by the next government ""in the best interest of patients and consumers"", he added. This video can not be played Nigel Farage says Donald Trump should comment on the NHS The Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, said Mr Trump's comments should be taken ""with a lorry load of salt"". He added: ""Trump has repeatedly made clear in the past that everything including the NHS will be on the table in future negotiations."" Five things we learned from leaked trade papers And SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said its MPs would be pressing for legislation to ringfence the NHS from any involvement in a future deal. ""I don't want the future of our NHS to be dependent on trusting the word of Boris Johnson or Donald Trump,"" she said at a campaign rally in Perth. ""Let's have legislation that explicitly and in statute takes any risk of trade negotiations to the NHS away, and make absolutely clear that the NHS not just will not be on the table but could not be on the table in any trade negotiations."" Nigel Farage called on the US president to challenge the ""complete fib"" that the Tories would ""sell the NHS"" to him in a trade deal. ""He has been accused by the Labour Party of wanting to buy the National Health Service,"" the Brexit Party leader told BBC Breakfast. ""It isn't true, I know it isn't true, and I think it would be wholly appropriate for him to say that.""

"This video can not be played Lil Thomas and Amy Winifred Hawkin - are they Wales' oldest sisters? She may be turning 100 years old - but Lil Thomas is still the youngster when it comes to her sister. Lil, of Newport, has just become a centenarian, following in the footsteps ofher 108-year-old sister, Amy Winifred Hawkin. With a combined age of 208, they are thought to be among the oldest living sisters in Wales. Between them, they have received six birthday cards from the Queen. Both sisters have received one to mark their 100th, while Amy - known as Win - was also sent a card when she turned 105 and has had one every year since. Born a year after the end of World War One, Lil was Wales' first female bus conductor in World War Two between her career as an entertainer. Having grown up in the Pillgwenlly area of the city, she was a natural performer. ""I was fortunate to have a pitch perfect voice at the age of two,"" she said. ""It was like Katherine Jenkins - but just not trained."" Lil (second from right) during her days as a performer It was little surprise that she was soon a regular on the stage of Newport's Empire Theatre, singing, tap dancing and playing the accordion while her older sister was part of a dance troupe and known as ""the highest kicker in Wales"". With the outbreak of war in 1939, Lil volunteered to be a bus conductor. ""Conductresses were needed during the war because of the black out and there were a lot of Irish boys working here who didn't know where they were going,"" said Lil. The woman who can remember the 1919 race riots Twin sisters are oldest in world ""We had a small lamp on our front which was the only light inside the bus. ""It was so dark that you had to call out every stop, whether you could see it or not. ""But we used to have a laugh on the last bus, singing songs with the boys on their way home from the pub."" The couple lived in South Africa for 23 years After the war, Lil married and moved with her husband Donald, a deputy post master, to South Africa. However the couple still loved entertaining and travelled the country performing for charities. ""We travelled from Durban to Johannesburg playing in church and town halls for the elderly who could barely afford to live,"" she recalled. ""My husband played the piano and could sit from 7 o'clock and not play the same song twice all night."" Lil said it was vital to 'keep your sense of humour' Lil continued to sing until she was 93 The couple returned and a three-month caretaker job in charge of the Bridge Inn in Llangwm, near Usk, Monmouthshire, turned into a 12-year stay. She said she was the only publican in the area who would welcome blind people, as others turned them away as they believed visually impaired people would spill their drinks. It was only when she was well into her 90s that Lil stopped singing but, now living in a care home in Bettws, she still loves to dance. Longevity is clearly in the blood with her sister, who goes by her middle name Win, thought to be one of the oldest living Welsh people. But what is Lil's best advice, after a century? ""Never lose your sense of humour because if you can't laugh, especially at yourself, you will never get through it all."" Meanwhile, Win will turn 109 in January, when she can expect her sixth letter from the Queen. ""I got a stack of them there, a boxful!"" she added, saying it was ""great"" the sisters could still celebrate birthdays together.

"Essex Police urged the public not to speculate on the circumstances of the crash A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 12-year-old boy who died in a hit-and-run outside a school. The 51-year-old was also detained on suspicion of the attempted murder of four other teenagers and a 23-year-old woman who were hurt in the crash. It happened near Debden Park High School in Loughton, Essex, at about 15:20 GMT on Monday. Essex Police said officers were looking for a silver Ford KA that was ""likely to have damage to [its] front"". Earlier, the force took the step of naming Terry Glover, 51, as someone they wanted to speak to in connection with the crash. It is understood that all the injured children - two 15-year-old boys, a 13-year-old boy, and a girl, 16 - are pupils at the school. Flowers have been laid outside the school Debden Park'shead teacher Helen Gascoyne, said,external: ""Our thoughts are with the family and all those affected. ""The school will be open [on Tuesday] with a number of counsellors on hand to support our community."" Christian Cavanagh, executive head teacher, described the boy's death as ""a young life so tragically lost"". He said: ""This young man had made his mark on the school and was liked and loved by staff and students. ""We will consult with the family and our school community to decide how best to commemorate his life."" Christian Cavanagh said the dead boy had been ""liked and loved by staff and pupils"" Donna Mills, the mother of Alfie Barnes who was one of the 15-year-olds struck by the car, said he was ""still in shock"", ""battered and bruised"". ""He remembers the car coming towards him, he remembers getting hit but it is a bit of a blur. He hit his head and I think he blacked out for a bit,"" she said. ""It was a bit scary, very scary for him. ""Alfie rang me and said 'mum I have been hit by a car', so I shot down there as fast as I could, it was horrendous. ""It was... horrible to see, kids laying on the floor, just terrible."" There is likely to be a ""prolonged investigation"", police said Det Ch Insp Rob Kirby described the crash as ""truly shocking"" and appealed for dashcam footage. ""I would like to thank the many members of the public who have called us with information and spoken to our officers, as well as those who provided crucial medical assistance at the scene,"" he said. Willingale Road, where the crash happened, cannot be accessed from junctions on either side of the school and remains cordoned off. Charlotte Rose, BBC Essex Pupils arriving to school this morning knew today was not going to be an ordinary day. Many of them may have witnessed some of the events that unfolded on Willingale Road as they left school last night, many more who may not have seen it firsthand will probably have seen reports on social media. The school has decided to open in order that pupils can come in, can be with their friends, fellow pupils and teachers and can receive counselling if they want or need it. A number of students have laid floral tributes, some with cards and messages for the family. Chris Whitbread, leader of Epping Forest District Council, said any parent who had heard about the crash would have been ""devastated and shocked"". Sixth-form student Scarlett Bearman, 17, said exams had been cancelled for the day and counselling was being provided to pupils. She said: ""From my point of view the school has handled it extremely well. I expect the mood there to be quite low today.""

"Lawyers for British diver Vern Unsworth (L) said Mr Musk's tweets were ""vile and false"" Tesla boss Elon Musk is due to take the stand in a Los Angeles court and face the British diving specialist he accused of being a paedophile. Vern Unsworth was among the team credited with co-ordinating theJuly 2018 rescue of 12 boys trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. Mr Musk, in a now-deleted tweet, described Mr Unsworth as a âpedo guyâ. The entrepreneur gave no evidence to support the comment. He is being sued for defamation. Lawyers representing Mr Unsworth have described Mr Muskâs tweets as âvile and falseâ. The British diver is seeking punitive and compensatory damages. The outburst last year appeared to be in response to comments made by Mr Unsworth in an interview on CNN, in which he criticised Mr Muskâs decision to send a purpose-built mini-submarine to the Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai Province to help with rescue efforts. Mr Unsworth described it as a âPR stuntâ, later adding that Mr Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurtsâ. Thai cave rescue a year on Elon Musk reveals brain-hacking plans Taking to Twitter, Mr Musk said: ""Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it."" When questioned about the allegation by other Twitter users, Mr Musk replied with âbet ya a signed dollar it's trueâ. That tweet was also later deleted. After Teslaâs stock price dipped by as much as 4%, Mr Musk sent a tweet expressing an apology. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 âHis actions against me do not justify my actions against him,â he wrote, explaining that his comments were ""spoken in anger after Mr Unsworth said several untruths and suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness and according to specifications from the dive team leaderâ. Teslaâs share price recovered. However, Mr Musk went on to repeat the claim in an email exchange after being contacted by Buzzfeed reporter Ryan Mac. âStop defending child rapists,â Mr Musk wrote to the reporter. He had apparently intended the comments to be off the record but did not agree that with Mr Mac prior to emailing his response. Mr Unsworth is seeking damages for the content of the tweets only, not the email exchange - though Los Angeles District Judge Stephen Wilson said it could be used to illustrate Mr Muskâs state of mind when sending the scrutinised tweets. Mr Muskâs legal team insisted he would not be seeking an out-of-court settlement. Instead, he will argue that âpedo guyâ was not an insult suggesting Mr Unsworth was a paedophile. âPedo guy was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up,â Mr Musk said in a court filing as part of a failed request to have the case thrown out of court. ""It is synonymous with âcreepy old manâ and is used to insult a personâs appearance and demeanour, not accuse a person of paedophilia.â Diver Vern Unsworth (R) helped bring top international cave rescuers to the mission, including Rob Harper (C) Mr Unsworthâs legal team referred to the explanation as âoffensive to the truthâ. As well as agreeing to hear the case, Judge Wilson denied the defenceâs request to define Mr Unsworth as a âpublic figureâ - meaning lawyers for Mr Unsworth do not have to prove Mr Musk acted with ""actual malice"", lowering the bar necessary to win the case. Jury selection is due to begin on Tuesday at 09:30 local time (17:30 GMT), with the first witnesses - Mr Musk among them - likely to be called later on Tuesday.

"This video can not be played Estonia was one of the highest achievers in Europe The UK has made ""positive"" progress in international school rankings, based on tests taken by 15-year-olds in 79 countries and regions. The Pisa tests, run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, show the UK rising in reading, maths and science. But the UK lags behind top performers such as China, Singapore and Estonia. The UK's teenagers were also found to have among the lowest levels of ""life satisfaction"". Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, said there were ""positive signals"" from the UK'sresults for the tests taken in 2018,external- which he said showed ""modest improvements"". In reading, the UK is 14th, up from 22nd in the previous tests three years ago In science, the UK is 14th, up from 15th In maths, the UK is 18th up from 27th The UK's maths results represent a particular improvement on three years ago, according to an analysis by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). But it says there has been no significant change for reading or science, with scores remaining broadly similar in Pisa tests since 2006, despite fluctuations in rankings. This year's science score has shown a slight fall, in fact, but because other countries' results have also slipped, the UK has climbed upwards in the rankings. At the current rate of progress, Mr Schleicher said, it would take a ""very long time"" for the UK to catch up with the highest achieving countries. He suggested more investment in teachers' skills as a way to make improvements. The global trend shows Asian school systems such as China and Singapore getting the best results, with Estonia and Finland among the highest achieving European countries and Canada performing strongly. China is top for all subjects - but its score is calculated using results from just four of its provinces, Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with a combined population of about 180 million. Mr Schleicher said these Chinese provinces were very effective at making sure all pupils, including the disadvantaged, reach a high level. And even the most deprived 10% of pupils in these provinces had better results than the average for the UK. Within the UK's four devolved education systems, England was the highest achiever in all three subjects. Wales remained the lowest performing within the UK for all subjects, with Scotland better than Northern Ireland at reading and Northern Ireland outperforming Scotland at maths and science. In reading tests, Wales scored below the average for OECD countries, while England, Scotland and Northern Ireland were all above average. Despite a decade of changes in school policy in England and Scotland and different political directions, the scores in this year's reading tests remained very similar for the two education systems, as they were a decade before. As well as gathering academic test results, there were also questions about teenagers' wellbeing. The global trend shows Asian school systems such as China and Singapore getting the best results And the UK had some of the lowest scores of any country for ""life satisfaction"" and for feeling they had ""meaning"" in their lives. In England, 66% of young people said they were sometimes or always worried - compared with an OECD average of 50%. Pisa 2018: Why Estonian pupils are doing so well Pisa 2015: UK lags behind in global school league table Pisa 2015: How to become the cleverest country Mr Schleicher said more than many other countries, UK schools had a strong culture of individual competition rather than co-operation. The Pisa tests are the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment, in which the ability of 15-year-olds is tested every three years in reading, maths and science. They are voluntary but an increasing number of countries take part, wanting to see how their pupils compare by international standards. The tests have become an influential measure of education standards, offering a different perspective from national exams. The rankings are based on samples of pupils in each country - with about 600,000 pupils having taken this round of tests. The UK's figures are based on a sample of about 14,000 pupils taking tests in almost 460 schools. ""Pupils in England have continued to perform well in reading and science and have made significant improvement in maths,"" said Carole Willis, chief executive of the NFER, which published an official analysis of the UK results. But she called for more investigation into why ""pupils in England were more likely to have negative feelings"". Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, warned during an election campaign there was a risk of ""over-claiming or over-blaming"" about these results. But he said attention should be paid to the low levels of wellbeing and the ""great pressure"" experienced by teenagers. Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, said: ""We need to do more to narrow the gap between rich and poor students, particularly for the highest performing ones."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the rise in the rankings reflected the efforts of Conservative governments to have ""more rigorous primary school assessments and more pupils are now studying the core academic subjects at GCSE"". But Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union, said it was too early to draw any conclusions about the Conservatives' changes to education from these results. Paul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers said teachers and school leaders deserved credit for the results ""given the very difficult circumstances in which they have been forced to operate over the past 10 years"".

"Phu Tran was found alive on Tuesday in Australia's Northern Territory A second person has been found alive two weeks after becoming stranded in Australia's outback. Phu Tran, 40, was discovered on Tuesday on a remote farm in the Northern Territory (NT), police said. Mr Tran was part of a trio who became stranded when their car got stuck in a riverbed on 19 November. They later split up to find help. Tamra McBeath-Riley, 52, was found on Sunday, but her partner, 46-year-old Claire Hockridge, remains missing. Mr Tran was found by a farmer who was performing checks on the vast property - known locally as a station - about 160km (100 miles) south of the town of Alice Springs, NT Police said. Woman survives 12 days in outback on groundwater He had survived by finding groundwater and would be treated for heat exposure in hospital, they added. ""If you believe in miracles, I'm saying it's a miracle,"" Supt Pauline Vicary said. The group and Ms McBeath-Riley's dog, Raya, had been travelling from Alice Springs to go on a hike when they became bogged in the Hugh River. Ms McBeath-Riley said the group had stayed by the car for around three days in an attempt to free it. The group became stranded in the remote Northern Territory ""We tried many times to try to get out, but just couldn't get out, the river was just too large,"" she told reporters outside hospital on Monday. ""During the day it's just really hot so we dug ourselves under the car. At night [we] could sleep in the car."" They used up all their supplies of water, as well as some vodka drinks, biscuits and beef noodles they had in the car. They eventually found a watering hole, and boiled the ""quite dirty"" water before sieving it through a shirt, police said. The group eventually decided to split up to get help. Mr Tran and Ms Hockridge planned to head towards a highway, while Ms McBeath-Riley stayed in the area, thinking her dog would not survive a long walk. Police despatched helicopters to search for the trio. They spotted Ms McBeath-Riley about 1.5km (0.9 miles) away from the car area after a local resident reported seeing tyre tracks. Mr Tran was discovered about 12km from the vehicle, two days after he and Ms Hockridge had separated after finding the station's fence. ""He decided to follow the fence line, and he left her there,""Supt Vicary was quoting as saying by the NT News,external. ""He continued to walk along the fence line for two days and approached the pastoralist [farmer] today and the first thing he did was get some water."" Tamra McBeath-Riley and her dog Raya had been on a drive to the outback Mr Tran was ""slightly disoriented"" but had been given food by the farmer and appeared to be in good spirits, she added. Police said Mr Tran's account had further narrowed down their search area for Ms Hockridge, adding it was unclear if she still had water. ""It's quite a diverse terrain - there's sandy dunes, there's hard clay, there's areas of dense trees but there is also rocks and ranges in the area as well,"" Supt Vicary told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday.

"The warming experienced over the past decade is taking its toll on the natural world Scientists say that average temperatures from 2010-2019 look set to make it the warmest decade on record. Provisional figures released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) suggest this year is on course to be the second or third warmest year ever. If those numbers hold, 2015-2019 would end up being the warmest five-year period in the record. This ""exceptional"" global heat is driven by greenhouse gas emissions, the WMO says. Climate summit told of nation's 'fight to death' Critical year for climate change begins in Madrid Study underpins key idea in Antarctic ice loss Is the climate passing some key 'tipping points'? What is climate change? The organisation's State of the Global Climate report for 2019 covers the year up to October, when the global mean temperature for the period was 1.1 degrees C above the ""baseline"" level in 1850. Many parts of the world experienced unusual levels of warmth this year. South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania were warmer than the recent average, while many parts of North America were colder than usual. The impacts of climate change play out through extreme and ""abnormal"" weather Two major heat waves hit Europe in June and July this year, with a new national record of 46C set in France on 28 June. New national records were also set in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and the UK. In Australia, the mean summer temperature was the highest on record by almost a degree. Wildfire activity in South America this year was the highest since 2010. The WMO clearly links the record temperatures seen over the past decade to ongoing emissions of greenhouse gases, from human activities such as driving cars, cutting down forests and burning coal for energy. In 2018, concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide all reached new record highs. The WMO says the warming experienced over the past decade is taking its toll on the natural world. The ice is melting at both poles and sea level rise has accelerated since the start of satellite measurements in 1993. Much of the heat generated by greenhouse gas emissions is going into the oceans, says the WMO. The waters are more acidic as a result and marine heat waves are becoming more common. As well as hurting nature, the increased heat is also affecting humans, with heat waves posing a particular risk to the elderly. Once in a century events are becoming more common, says the WMO's secretary-general ""On a day-to-day basis, the impacts of climate change play out through extreme and 'abnormal' weather. And, once again in 2019, weather and climate-related risks hit hard,"" said the WMO's secretary-general Petteri Taalas. ""Heat waves and floods which used to be 'once in a century' events are becoming more regular occurrences. Countries ranging from the Bahamas to Japan to Mozambique suffered the effect of devastating tropical cyclones. Wildfires swept through the Arctic and Australia,"" Mr Taalas continued. Since the 1980s, every successive decade has been warmer than the one that preceded it. Other scientists reacted to the release of the report with concern. ""It's shocking how much climate change in 2019 has already led to lives lost, poor health, food insecurity and displaced populations,"" said Dr Joanna House, from the University of Bristol. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA ""Even as a climate scientist who knows the evidence and the projections, I find this deeply upsetting.  What is more shocking is how long very little has been done about this. We have the information, the solutions, what we need now is urgent action."" The report has been released at global climate talks taking place in Madrid. Negotiators here have started two weeks of talks aimed at improving the world's pledges to cut carbon. Some of those attending the meeting say the WMO report would help concentrate minds on dealing with the root causes of climate change. ""Now we know that global temperatures are rising to record levels and without action we can expect more climate suffering. It's vital we phase out fossil fuels as fast as possible,"" said Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid. ""The good news is this is a timely wake-up call at the start of the COP25 climate summit in Madrid. Delegates have no excuse to block progress or drag their feet when the science is showing how urgently action is needed.""

"Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School said ""accusations of coercion"" against it were ""entirely false"" Two Orthodox Jewish secondary schools in London have been accused of pressurising parents into taking their children out of sex education lessons. The BBC has seen an email and heard a recording of the state-funded schools explaining how to withdraw pupils from mandatory relationships and sex education classes, which begin in 2020. One school referred to a wish to stop the teaching of LGBT issues. But it said ""accusations of coercion"" were ""entirely false"". The email, sent to the Victoria Derbyshire programme by a mother who wished to remain anonymous, shows her daughters' school - Lubavitch Senior Girls' School in north London - asking parents to ""prevent"" relationships and sex education (RSE) classes. ""The problem is the government is making the subject mandatory in September 2020. However, parents have the right to opt out,"" it reads. ""Please exercise your right to prevent it being taught by responding to this email and saying that you do not wish your daughters to receive lessons in RSE."" The woman told the BBC she was ""disgusted"". ""I thought that my kids' school was pretty open as Orthodox schools go,"" she added. The email was sent to parents of children attending Lubavitch Senior Girls' School Parents across England will have the right to withdraw their children from the sex education element of the secondary school lessons, but that decision should not be influenced by pressure from a school. Pupils cannot be withdrawn from relationships lessons. In primary schools, only Relationships Education (RE) is to be taught. The mother believes the email was ""designed to put a stop to RSE being taught"" as a whole at the school, including the teaching of LGBT issues. ""The fact that people with different sexualities exist in the world is something that they don't want to expose their children to. I don't think they want to expose them to the concept of sex,"" she said. Lubavitch Senior Girls' School told the BBC that if the parent concerned lodged her complaint according to its complaints policy, then it would be fully investigated. But she said she was too scared to do that. The programme also obtained a recording from a different woman, after she was contacted by her child's state-funded school. In the phone conversation, the staff member can be heard telling her: ""We need parents to formally say, 'I do not want you to teach my child about single-gender relationships or sex education within the school', unless you do as a parent want that."" The mother - who did not wish to be identified - was asked to write a letter confirming this, which she said she did as she was ""too scared"" not to. ""Even though I thought it was imperative for my children to be given sex education, I felt I had to write it because I didn't want the school to think I don't agree with them on this."" She said she feared that within the community she'd ""be thought of as not Jewish or completely weird, and I know I'd be alienated or ostracised. ""The truth is our children need sex education more than any other child in the country because our community is so insular,"" she added. The school, Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School, said in a statement: ""The vast majority of our families expect sex education to be given privately, within the family, at home. They do not expect their children to be given sex education in a school classroom. ""It is therefore very important that we let parents know that their child will be given sex education at school - unless they opt out."" It added it was merely giving parents information on how to withdraw pupils were it their choice, adding: ""Accusations of coercion against our school are entirely false."" One woman, now in her 20s, who attended Yesodey Hatorah, said textbooks had been redacted when she was a pupil, with words ""blacked out"". ""In science, we didn't learn about evolution, we didn't learn about reproduction, we didn't learn anything regarding sex ed at all."" She was taught about sex only weeks before her wedding at age 19, by a woman sent to give her bridal lessons. She eventually fled before the marriage and left the community. The Liberal Democrats' Layla Moran said the schools were running ""counter to the spirit of the Equality Act"" Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesperson, called for the Department for Education to ""have its own investigation into these schools"". ""They clearly don't want to teach these subjects. That is counter to the guidelines, but it is also counter to the spirit of the Equality Act which is the very same act that protects religious freedoms,"" she added. Ms Moran said that if further investigations did find either state-funded school to be refusing to teach the national curriculum or ""unduly influencing its own parental community"", it would need to be ""seriously looked at"".

"US President-elect Donald Trump has called on Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national incomes on defence. That is more than double the military alliance's current target of 2%. Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has also told member countries to boost military spending as part of a new ""wartime mindset"". Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in Washington DC in 1949 by 12 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK and the US. Nato was founded in Washington DC in April 1949 Nato'sprimary purpose,externalwas to block expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree thatif one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.,external Nato does not have its own army, but member states can take collective military action in response to crises. For instance, the body supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004. It alsoco-ordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises.,external Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America - the original 12 founders plus 20 countries which have joined since 1949. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries became members, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Having been neutral for decades,both applied to Nato in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia have also asked to join. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, the alliancesaid that Ukraine could eventually join,external. Former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in ""the long-term"" After Russia's invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for this process to be fast-tracked. Although then Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg reconfirmed Ukraine could join ""in the long term"", he said this would not happen until after the war ended. Nato currently asks every member country to spend at least 2% of national income - also known as GDP - on defence. It is thought that23 countries met that target in 2024, compared to only three in 2014. The countries which spend the largest share of GDP on defence are the US and those close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic states. In July 2024, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmersaid the UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. In December 2024, Nato secretary general Rutte said that member stateswould have to ""shift to a wartime mindset"" and spend ""considerably more than 2%"" on defence,external. During his first term as US president, Trump persuaded many Nato members to increase defence spending. In 2018 he said thatall countries in the alliance should be committing 4% of GDP. At a press conference at his Florida home in January 2025,Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5%,external, telling reporters: ""They can all afford it."" While campaigning for his second presidential term, Trumpsaid he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough, remarks which were strongly condemned by the White House and former Nato chief Stoltenberg. How much do Nato members spend on defence? Nato said Russia's invasion of Ukraine posed the""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"".,external The alliance has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia. However, individual member states have supplied arms and equipment. German research organisationthe Kiel Institute,externalsaid that the US had allocated 59.9bn euros (Â£49.7bn) for military support to Ukraine between February 2022 and October 2024. European Nato members provided 52.6bn euros (Â£43.7bn) over the same period. The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have sent anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems such as Patriot, artillery guns, tanks and drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles such as Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp. Atacms missiles can reach up to 300km (186 miles) and are hard to intercept due to their high speed In August 2024,Ukraine received two US-made F16 fighter jets- the first of more than 60 pledged by Nato member states. Since November 2024,the US and UK have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to hit targets within Russian territory. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?

"Syrups can greatly increase the sugar content of drinks Seasonal lattes and hot chocolates being sold by some High Street coffee chains can contain up to 23 spoonfuls of sugar per cup, a study has found. Action on Sugar analysed more than 200 drinks and found ""shockingly"" large amounts of sugar in many of them. Some were made using vegan-friendly alternatives to cow's milk. The ""venti"" (a pint) Starbucks Signature Caramel Hot Chocolate made with oat milk but topped with whipped cream had the most. It contains 23 teaspoons (93.7g) of sugar and 758 calories, which Action on Sugar says is as much as three cans of Coca-Cola or four white chocolate and strawberry muffins. Next was Caffe Nero's Grande Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate made with skimmed milk - containing 15 teaspoons (nearly 60g) of sugar and 503 calories. Third highest in sugar was a venti Starbucks Gingerbread Latte made with oat milk - containing 14 teaspoons (56.6g) of sugar and 523 calories - the same as 17 custard cream biscuits. Some of the coffee chains included in the study say they offer a variety of low-sugar options to customers, as well as these more indulgent drinks. Action on Sugar said consumers may be unknowingly opting for extra sugar because of a lack of labelling and the perception vegan options were healthier, when actually some shops used pre-sweetened alternatives to cow's milk. Small substitutions can make a difference. For example, if the Starbucks Gingerbread Latte is made with almond milk instead of oat milk, the sugar content goes down by 4.5 teaspoons (18g). Action on Sugar assessed drinks from nine different chains; Caffe Nero, Starbucks, Costa, KFC, Greggs, McDonald's, Eat, Leon and Pret a Manger. Adults should have no more than 30g (around 7 teaspoons) of free sugars - sugars added to food or drinks - per day Children aged 7 to 10 should have no more than 24g (6 teaspoons) per day Children aged 4 to 6 should have no more than 19g (5 teaspoons) per day There's no guideline limit for children under the age of 4, but it's recommended they avoid sugar-sweetened drinks and food with sugar added to it Nutritionist Holly Gabriel, from Action on Sugar, said the findings were ""shocking"". ""Coffee shops and cafes need to take much greater steps to reduce the levels of sugar and portion sizes, promote lower sugar alternatives and stop pushing indulgent extras at the till."" A spokeswoman for Starbucks said that customers could customise the size of their drink, as well as asking for reduced fat milk and less or no cream. ""We are committed to reducing sugar in all our beverages and since 2015 we've delivered a 9% reduction in the sugar content of our gingerbread and core syrup range of vanilla, caramel and hazelnut,"" the spokeswoman added. Sweetened milk-based drinks are currently exempt from the UK sugar tax - a levy on manufacturers introduced by government as part of the child obesity strategy. Look for the ""carbohydrates (of which sugars)"" figure in the nutrition label to see how much sugar the product contains for every 100g: more than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g is high 5g of total sugars or less per 100g is low Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Ariana Grande and Drake were the most-streamed female and male artists of the decade Spotify has revealed its biggest songs, albums and artists of the last decade, with Drake emerging as the most-streamed artist of the 2010s. The Canadian star has racked up more than 28 billion streams, with his most popular song, One Dance, played 1.7 billion times alone. It was dwarfed by Ed Sheeran's Shape Of You, whose 2.4 billion streams, made it the decade's most listened-to track. 2019's biggest song was Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello's Senorita. Released in June, the island-flavoured duet has already been played one billion times. Billie Eilish's Bad Guy isn't far behind, on 990 million streams. Eilish's debut album, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go, was also the year's most popular album - the first time a female artist has topped Spotify's end-of-year survey. In the UK, however, Eilish played second fiddle to Lewis Capaldi whose debut album, Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent, topped the chart. His ubiquitous ballad Someone You Loved was also the year's most-streamed song. Spotify's data also revealed some quirky facts: Modern Bollywood was the year's fastest-rising genre; the most popular mood-based playlist was ""feel good,"" followed by ""lit""; and the top podcast genre was comedy. Here are the music charts in full. The end-of-decade charts are presumably skewed towards more recent songs because of the growth in Spotify's user-base. The service had just 7 million users in 2009, but now boasts 248 million monthly active users, of which 113 million are paid subscribers. Later this week, Spotify will unveil the latest incarnation of its ""Spotify Wrapped,external"" feature, allowing users to generate a personalised breakdown of the music they listened to in 2019.

"This video can not be played President Trump talks about the UK's National Health Service Donald Trump has insisted the US wants ""nothing to do"" with the NHS in post-Brexit trade talks as he sought to repudiate opposition claims that the health service would be ""up for sale"". On a visit to the UK, the US President claimed he had no interest in increased market access to the NHS for US firms even if handed on a ""silver platter"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he still had ""very serious concerns"". And the SNP said MPs should pass a law to exclude the NHS from discussions. Boris Johnson said the Conservative election manifesto had ""categorically ruled out"" any NHS services, or drug prices, being up for negotiation. In June,the US president suggested the health service would form part of negotiationsover a possible future trade deal after the UK leaves the EU, saying: ""When you're dealing in trade, everything is on the table."" Live: Latest from the campaign trail Donald Trump arrives in UK for Nato summit Row over Labour's 'NHS for sale' claim Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? But speaking on Tuesday morning as he and other world leaders prepared for a summit to mark the 70th anniversary of Nato, he issued a different message. ""I don't even know where that rumour started,"" he told journalists. ""We have absolutely nothing to do with it. If you handed it [the NHS] to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it."" Mr Trump's visit comes at hugely sensitive time, with less than 10 days to go before the election - and with the issues of Brexit and the NHS having largely dominated the campaign so far. The US President insisted he would be ""staying out"" of the election. While he remained a ""fan of Brexit"" and thought Mr Johnson was ""very capable"", he said he would be prepared to ""work with anybody"" in No 10. This video can not be played Corbyn: ""Our NHS will not be put up for sale to anybody"" This video can not be played Jo Swinson: Trump is ""not someone who shares our values"" In October, he suggested Mr Corbyn would be ""bad"" for the UK and declined an offer to meet the Labour leader during his state visit. Mr Corbyn has repeatedly claimed that the NHS would be ""up for sale"" if the Conservatives hold onto power. At a campaign event last week, the Labour leader showed an unredacted report that gave details of meetings between US and UK officials. The document shows the US is interested in discussing drug pricing - mainly extending patents that stop cheaper generic medicines being used - and refers to the US policy of making ""total market access"" a starting point in any trade talks. The Labour leader welcomed Mr Trump's latest comments but said he was far from reassured by them. ""I'm pleased that he's said that but, if that's the case why have these talks gone on for two years?"" he told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show. ""Why have they been kept secret? I think there is very very legitimate grounds for very very serious concern here."" Mr Corbyn said if he was introduced to Mr Trump at a reception at Buckingham Palace later, which both are attending, he would impress on him how ""precious"" the NHS was to the British people and make clear a Labour government would discontinue trade talks if it was not excluded. On a trip to Salisbury, the prime minister described the opposition's claims as ""pure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda triangle stuff"". ""I can categorically rule out any part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiation... including pharmaceuticals."" And Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested Labour was only raising the issue because it had ""no plan for Brexit and no plan for the economy"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Raab ruled out any privatisation of the NHS ""under the Conservatives' watch or this prime minister's watch"". Trade decisions would be made by the next government ""in the best interest of patients and consumers"", he added. This video can not be played Nigel Farage says Donald Trump should comment on the NHS The Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, said Mr Trump's comments should be taken ""with a lorry load of salt"". He added: ""Trump has repeatedly made clear in the past that everything including the NHS will be on the table in future negotiations."" Five things we learned from leaked trade papers And SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said its MPs would be pressing for legislation to ringfence the NHS from any involvement in a future deal. ""I don't want the future of our NHS to be dependent on trusting the word of Boris Johnson or Donald Trump,"" she said at a campaign rally in Perth. ""Let's have legislation that explicitly and in statute takes any risk of trade negotiations to the NHS away, and make absolutely clear that the NHS not just will not be on the table but could not be on the table in any trade negotiations."" Nigel Farage called on the US president to challenge the ""complete fib"" that the Tories would ""sell the NHS"" to him in a trade deal. ""He has been accused by the Labour Party of wanting to buy the National Health Service,"" the Brexit Party leader told BBC Breakfast. ""It isn't true, I know it isn't true, and I think it would be wholly appropriate for him to say that.""

"This video can not be played Nato explained in 80 seconds Seventy years of existence is clearly worth celebrating, but Nato is strangely low-key about this week's brief gathering of alliance heads of state and government outside London. Nato spokesmen reject the label of ""summit"", insisting that this is really a lesser affair; that there was a full-scale summit only last year; and that this gathering will not release the traditional lengthy communiquÃ© of conclusions and future plans. Why so reticent? This is after all what many Nato advocates call, with some justification, the most successful military alliance in history. Nato was founded in 1949 for the collective defence of its members, linking the security of the United States with its European allies against the Soviet Union. It witnessed the end of communism, defeating the Soviet bloc without firing a shot. It went to war for the first time in the Balkans in the 1990s. It then set out on a new path - so-called ""out of area"" operations beyond Nato's frontiers, notably its operations in Afghanistan and the wider war against terror. What is defence alliance Nato? Can Nato survive President Donald Trump? Nato also set about a programme of expansion, nearly doubling in size. Today it has 29 members and North Macedonia is soon to join its ranks. US troops on a Nato exercise in Lithuania in June 2018 Nato - which is as much a diplomatic as a military alliance - has played a key role in stabilising the new democracies of Europe, whether it be in the Baltic or the Balkans, giving them a new self-confidence and locking them into a formidable security framework. But has this actually produced a stronger Nato? The respected British defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke says ""no"". US President Harry Truman marks the beginning of Nato in 1949 ""Nato is indeed the greatest alliance the world has ever seen,"" he told me, but ""today with some thirty members, it is less than half as strong as it was when it was half this size. ""Nato is in trouble"", he argues, ""even though it's still got lots of capabilities"". Nato expansion is seen within the alliance as a good thing. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg described it to me as a ""historical success"", the alliance helping to spread democracy and the rule of law. Expansion has brought Nato's frontiers 1,000 miles (1,600km) closer to Moscow. Countries once occupied by the Red Army and incorporated into the Soviet Union, like the three Baltic republics, or former Warsaw Pact allies of Moscow like Poland, are now firmly in Nato's orbit, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin does not like this. Russia is pushing back in every way it can, bolstering its nuclear arsenal and seeking to renew its influence abroad. Its controversial but successful campaign to prop up the Assad regime in Syria is a case in point. Nato led a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo after bombing Yugoslavia in 1999 In Europe, Russia is criticised for cyber attacks; information operations to try to influence elections; even political assassination in the wake of a radiological and a chemical weapons attack - the former in London, the second in Salisbury in southern England. The latter attack in Salisbury - which Moscow strenuously denies - prompted a mass expulsion of Russian diplomats and intelligence officers from Nato countries. Many have spoken of a new Cold War. But this one is very different from that of the 1950s and 1960s. Russia's power and influence is a shadow of that of the former Soviet Union's. This is a kind of shadow conflict waged below the threshold of combat, in what analysts call ""the grey zone"", where it is hard to assign blame for intrusive actions like cyber attacks or hacks against computers. ""There is a problem of political consensus in the western world and so we make it easy for Mr Putin,"" Mr Clarke says. ""Russia,"" he argues, ""will be a real nuisance to Nato for the next ten or twenty years. ""But they should not be a strategically important challenge to us unless we let them."" President Putin has warned the West not to cross ""red lines"", meaning Russia's national security interests Russia is simply using the intrinsic weaknesses of the West to further its own goals, he says. ""If the Western world and if the Western democracies are not sufficiently cohesive to deal with this threat - and at the moment I have to say they're not - then the Russians will actually play a big role in European security for the future. They'll dominate the agenda. They'll constrain people's choices. They'll intimidate and they'll use a certain amount of not very subtle blackmail."" This Nato ""summit"" is all about demonstrating solidarity and resolve and also about charting a path for the future. But in the days leading up to the meeting there has been more than a hint of the problems behind Nato's ceremonial faÃ§ade. Nato has proudly announced new spending projections which show that the defence budgets of its European allies will grow further in the years ahead. It has also agreed a new formula to spread the costs of Nato's central budget between its members; a budget that covers its headquarters in Brussels and other commonly funded programmes. The US in this case will pay less and Germany, which lags behind in the proportion of its resources that it devotes to defence, will pay more. It is all an effort to mollify President Donald Trump and to avoid another embarrassing tirade from him aimed at his Nato partners. The burden-sharing debate has long dogged Nato. Mr Trump did not invent it. But he seems to take a peculiarly transactional approach to the alliance, and often does not seem to share a fundamental sense that the survival of a healthy Nato is as much in Washington's interests as it is in those of its European allies. What does the US contribute to Nato? Nato: Cyber-attack on one nation is attack on all Nonetheless, Nato governments have committed to spending at least 2% of their GDP on defence; and many of them are still far from that benchmark. Donald Trump: The uncrowned leader of the Western alliance or a divider? But this focus on funding obscures other problems. Frustration is growing and this is what prompted the French President Emmanuel Macron recentlyto describe Nato as strategically ""brain-dead"". Far from regretting his comments, he amplified them last week, insisting that the alliance needed to stop talking about money all the time and spend more time dealing with its fundamental strategic problems. Only days before this week's summit, a row erupted between France and Turkey.  It illustrates how events in north-eastern Syria are straining relations within Nato. President Macron has repeatedly criticised both Washington's abrupt withdrawal of support for the Kurds and Turkey's related offensive into Syria - two strategic decisions that were taken without consulting other Nato allies. Mr Macron (R), pictured with Mr Stoltenberg, criticised Nato's failure to respond to Turkey's offensive Turkey sees France as far too friendly towards the Kurds. It wants Nato as a whole to back its position in Syria. This episode underscores another fundamental problem for the alliance: what many see as Turkey's drift away from Nato and the West. Ankara's purchase of a sophisticated Russian air defence system is an extraordinary step for a Nato ally. The problem is that Turkey's size and geographical position make it an important, albeit for many troublesome, partner in Nato, despite some analysts questioning if it really should still be in the alliance at all. So, Turkish and US unilateralism; rows over money; a resurgent but ill-defined Russian threat - there's plenty for Nato leaders to talk about when they meet in a luxury resort hotel near Watford, a town best known by many for its nondescript railway junction. Nato too is at a kind of a junction itself. It has many of the problems of success. Many of the decisions it has taken - its expansion to bring in so many new members for example - were driven as much by politics as by strategy. Turkish and Russian forces are carrying out joint ground patrols in northern Syria But the world has changed dramatically since Nato's founding. It is very different again from the world of the 1990s, in which Nato basked in its victory in the Cold War. President Macron's label of ""brain dead"" may be going a bit far. But he has a point. Nato leaders need to get back to strategy, to the big thoughts about where the alliance should be heading. How will it contend with the Russian threat? Does it need to rethink its strategy? Should Nato have a common approach to a rising China? What should be Nato's priorities in the 21st-Century world? How much do Nato members spend on defence? Can Nato survive President Donald Trump?

"US troops on a Nato exercise in Lithuania in June 2018 Turkey has said it will oppose a Nato defence plan for Baltic countries, exposing tensions in the alliance ahead of a summit for its 70th anniversary. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants the military bloc to recognise the groups Turkey is fighting as terrorists but members are reluctant to do so. Last month, the French president angered some countries by suggesting the alliance is ""brain dead"". The UK prime minister is set to call for unity at the meeting near London. As host of the two-day meeting, Boris Johnson is expected to reiterate the importance of Nato staying united, calling it ""the cornerstone of Euro-Atlantic security"" that helps ""keep a billion people safe"", his spokesman said. Troubled Nato not in party mood What does the US do for Nato? UK election: Corbyn tells Trump no trade deal if NHS included Tensions have grown since the election of US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly complained that Europe's Nato countries are not contributing enough to the bloc, created to counter the threat of post-World War Two communist expansion. The summit takes place as President Trump faces an impeachment inquiry at home and eyes a re-election campaign next year. At the same time, the UK will hold a general election next week amid its complicated Brexit process. Nato members pledge to come to the aid of one another should any of the 29 allies come under attack. Ahead of his departure from Ankara to London, Mr Erdogan said Turkey would not approve a plan to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the event of a Russian attack unless Nato recognises the Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists. The YPG lead the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), key allies of the US-led coalition against the Islamic State group in Syria. In October, Turkey launched an operation in Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Syria to create a ""security zone"" along its border. ""If our friends at Nato don't recognise as terrorist organisations those we consider terrorist organisations... we will stand against any step that will be taken there,"" he said about the plan. This video can not be played Nato explained in 80 seconds That military action deepened fractures between Turkey and other Nato members and took place after President Trump controversially pulled US forces out of the region reportedly without consulting allies. In an interview last month,French President Emmanuel Macron described Nato as ""brain dead"", stressing what he saw as a waning commitment to the transatlantic alliance by its main guarantor - Washington. Last Friday, Mr Erdogan hit back, suggesting that Mr Macron was in fact the one who was ""brain dead"". He accused him of ""a sick and shallow understanding"" of terrorism. President Macron had also angered Turkey by in November hosting an official from the SDF. Both Mr Macron and Mr Erdogan will be attending the Nato event and will be hosted, alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, by Mr Johnson at Downing Street on Tuesday. Will Mr Erdogan (left) and Mr Macron try to soothe the row? Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Trump said Mr Macron's statement was ""very, very nasty"", adding: ""You just can't go around making statements like that about Nato. It's very disrespectful"". He arrived in the UK on Mondayahead of a reception to be hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening. Mr Trump is set to hold separate talks with the German and French leaders, and Nato's secretary-general. Turkey is posing a major and developing problem for Nato; a problem that if not resolved, could test the very boundaries of its membership. It is effectively holding hostage a response plan for the rapid reinforcement of the Baltic region - which must be approved by all 29 Nato members - until it gets what it wants in its own region. Turkey wants all other Nato countries to regard Kurdish separatist groups in Turkey as terrorists. This would effectively take Nato into domestic security matters which most allies see as none of their business. Add to this Turkey's unilateral actions in Syria; President Erdogan's recent row with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron over the Kurds; and Turkey's purchase of a sophisticated Russian air defence system - an extraordinary step for a key Nato player - and you are well on the way to a full-blown crisis between Ankara and the alliance. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is the world's most powerful regional defence alliance It was set up in 1949, after World War Two, amid anxiety at Soviet expansion It was founded on the principle of collective defence between allies Originally had 12 members, but now has 29 Read more about Nato ""The PM's position is that Nato is the most enduring and successful alliance in military history and that it continues to adapt to the evolving threats that we face,"" the prime minister's spokesman added. ""The PM will emphasise that all members must be united behind shared priorities so Nato can adapt to the challenges ahead."" Another key division is over the countries' contributions. Nato estimates for 2019 showthere are now eight countries - in addition to the US - meeting the targetagreed by all Nato members to spend 2% or more of their gross domestic product (GDP, a measure of economic output) on defence. Mr Stoltenberg said on Friday that by 2020, European allies and Canada would have invested $130bn (Â£100bn) more since 2016, the year President Trump was elected. What is Nato for? In 80 secs.

"The warming experienced over the past decade is taking its toll on the natural world Scientists say that average temperatures from 2010-2019 look set to make it the warmest decade on record. Provisional figures released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) suggest this year is on course to be the second or third warmest year ever. If those numbers hold, 2015-2019 would end up being the warmest five-year period in the record. This ""exceptional"" global heat is driven by greenhouse gas emissions, the WMO says.

What is climate change? The organisation's State of the Global Climate report for 2019 covers the year up to October, when the global mean temperature for the period was 1.1 degrees C above the ""baseline"" level in 1850. Many parts of the world experienced unusual levels of warmth this year. South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania were warmer than the recent average, while many parts of North America were colder than usual. The impacts of climate change play out through extreme and ""abnormal"" weather Two major heat waves hit Europe in June and July this year, with a new national record of 46C set in France on 28 June. New national records were also set in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and the UK. In Australia, the mean summer temperature was the highest on record by almost a degree. Wildfire activity in South America this year was the highest since 2010. The WMO clearly links the record temperatures seen over the past decade to ongoing emissions of greenhouse gases, from human activities such as driving cars, cutting down forests and burning coal for energy. In 2018, concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide all reached new record highs. The WMO says the warming experienced over the past decade is taking its toll on the natural world. The ice is melting at both poles and sea level rise has accelerated since the start of satellite measurements in 1993. Much of the heat generated by greenhouse gas emissions is going into the oceans, says the WMO. The waters are more acidic as a result and marine heat waves are becoming more common. As well as hurting nature, the increased heat is also affecting humans, with heat waves posing a particular risk to the elderly. Once in a century events are becoming more common, says the WMO's secretary-general ""On a day-to-day basis, the impacts of climate change play out through extreme and 'abnormal' weather. And, once again in 2019, weather and climate-related risks hit hard,"" said the WMO's secretary-general Petteri Taalas. ""Heat waves and floods which used to be 'once in a century' events are becoming more regular occurrences. Countries ranging from the Bahamas to Japan to Mozambique suffered the effect of devastating tropical cyclones. Wildfires swept through the Arctic and Australia,"" Mr Taalas continued. Since the 1980s, every successive decade has been warmer than the one that preceded it. Other scientists reacted to the release of the report with concern. ""It's shocking how much climate change in 2019 has already led to lives lost, poor health, food insecurity and displaced populations,"" said Dr Joanna House, from the University of Bristol. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA ""Even as a climate scientist who knows the evidence and the projections, I find this deeply upsetting.  What is more shocking is how long very little has been done about this. We have the information, the solutions, what we need now is urgent action."" The report has been released at global climate talks taking place in Madrid. Negotiators here have started two weeks of talks aimed at improving the world's pledges to cut carbon. Some of those attending the meeting say the WMO report would help concentrate minds on dealing with the root causes of climate change. ""Now we know that global temperatures are rising to record levels and without action we can expect more climate suffering. It's vital we phase out fossil fuels as fast as possible,"" said Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid. ""The good news is this is a timely wake-up call at the start of the COP25 climate summit in Madrid. Delegates have no excuse to block progress or drag their feet when the science is showing how urgently action is needed.""

"This video can not be played Reporters ask the US president his thoughts on the upcoming UK general election US President Donald Trump has said he could ""work with anybody"" in No 10 - nine days ahead of a general election. Speaking on a three-day visit to the UK, Mr Trump said he would ""stay out of the election"", that he was a ""fan of Brexit"" and he thought PM Boris Johnson was ""very capable"". Mr Trump is in the UK for a Nato summit being held in Watford on Wednesday. He attended a reception hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace and later went to an event at Downing Street. The US president's comments in a press conference came moments after he told reporters that he was staying out of the election on 12 December ""because I don't want to complicate it"". Trump and Macron clash at tense Nato summit Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing? Troubled Nato not in party mood for 70th birthday This video can not be played President Trump talks about the UK's National Health Service The US wanted ""absolutely nothing to do with"" the NHS, when asked if it would form any part of future trade talks. He said he wouldn't touch it even if it was handed to his administration ""on a silver platter"", adding: ""Never even thought about it, honestly"" He himself was ""a very easy person to work with"" The passersby who tackled a man during a ""terrible attack"" on London Bridge on Friday did ""an amazing job"". He said: ""I was very proud of those people who grabbed him"", referring toUsman Khan who killed two people and injured three othersbefore armed police shot him dead French President Emmanuel Macron was ""very disrespectful""for suggesting Nato was ""brain dead"" OnPrince Andrew stepping down from royal duties,he said: ""I don't know Prince Andrew, but that's a tough story, it's a very tough story."" The Duke of York has been facing questions over his ties to disgraced financierJeffrey Epstein.Mr Trumpmet the duke,externalon his last visit to the UK in June President Trump is visiting the UK to attend a Nato summit commemorating the 70th anniversary of the transatlantic organisation. He had a breakfast meeting with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the US ambassador's residence in London. Mr Trumpheld separate talkswith French President Emmanuel Macron. Later, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were kept waiting for around 40 minutes before the US president and First Lady Melania Trump arrived at the prince's residence, Clarence House, for afternoon tea. Mr Trump and his wife went on to join other Nato leaders and senior royals at a Buckingham Palace reception, hosted by the Queen. The first couple later attended a reception at Downing Street with other world leaders. Melania and Donald Trump had tea with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House They later met the Queen at a Buckingham Palace reception It is unclear whether Mr Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Mr Johnson during his visit to the UK. The US president said he would be meeting the British prime minister during his visit, adding: ""I have meetings set up with lots of different countries"". Mr Johnson said he would be discussing Syria, Russia and China during discussions with Nato leaders. Boris Johnson at the reception at Buckingham Palace after hosting Mr Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at No 10 Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who held a meeting with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - said arrangements for such bilateral meetings were ""always quite fluid"". BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said the Conservatives' HQ is not keen on such a meeting ""to avoid pictures that could be used by his (Boris Johnson's) opponents"" in the upcoming general election. Mr Johnson and Mr Trump did speak on Saturday, when Mr Trump expressed his condolences after the London Bridge attack. There'll be an almighty shuddering sigh of relief reverberating around the walls of Downing Street. Because there was real apprehension in No 10 about exactly what the president might say. In fact, he's given Boris Johnson an almighty helping hand in this election. Most importantly, we heard Donald Trump seeking to counter what has become one of the main attack lines of the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn during this campaign, that if you re-elect Boris Johnson he will ensure that the NHS is on the table in trade talks with the US. And yet we heard Mr Trump being pretty unequivocal that he's not interested in the NHS, even if it was presented to him on a silver platter and also suggesting he didn't know why it was being raised as an issue, even though, in fact, it was Mr Trump who first raised it as an issue when he was here in June at a news conference saying everything should be on the table. Be that as it may, I think Team Johnson will be mightily relieved that he has, as it were, provided them with a get-out-of-jail-free card to Labour claims that the NHS would be on the table. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who called for Mr Trump to be treated ""with respect and politeness"" during his visit, wrote to Mr Trump ahead of his visit, demanding assurances that theNHS will be ""off the table""in any post-Brexit US-UK trade talks. Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Jeremy Vine show that he would seek assurances from Mr Trump at the Buckingham Palace reception later. What we learned from Trump's last visit to the UK ""I will say, look, welcome to this country. I hope you'll understand how precious our national health service is,"" he said. ""And in any future trade relationship with the USA, none of our public services are on the table, none of our public services are for sale."" Mr Trump has previously been criticised for voicing his opinions of British political leaders. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK and US  ""traditionally don't get involved in each other's elections"" The US president was warned against getting involved in the upcoming general election by Mr Johnson last week. Nigel Farage said it was ""awkward"" that his ""friend"", Mr Trump, had arrived during the election campaign, adding that he didn't intend to speak to him. The Brexit Party leader said if there were ""personal exchanges"", they would be ""purely personal"" and he would keep them private. Scotland Yard has saidroad closures will be in place in central London,externalduring the summit. Protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square, before heading to Buckingham Palace ahead of the reception for Nato leaders. BBC journalist Charlotte Gallagher, who was at the protest, said it was a real mixture of people ""but they all had one thing in common - an intense dislike of President Trump"". ""There were people with concerns about the future of the NHS, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, while others were demanding the release of Julian Assange."" She said she also spoke to several US tourists who decided to come to the protest to show how unhappy they were with their own president. The mother of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn was among the protesters. Mr Dunn's death has led to a diplomatic row between the US and UK after a suspect over his death returned to America, claiming diplomatic immunity. Charlotte Charles said the response from other protesters outside the palace to her campaign for justice had been ""heart-warming"". The Foreign Office said Mr Raab raised ""UK concerns"" about the case with his US counterpart at a meeting earlier. Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing?

"Pictures from the Tattoo Malaysia Expo have gone viral online A Malaysian minister has called a tattoo exhibition ""obscene"" and ordered an investigation after pictures of half-naked men and women went viral. The minister for tourism, arts and culture said that while a permit was issued, there was no green light for any form of nudity at the event. Mohammadin Ketapi said the show ""was not Malaysian culture...the majority of Malaysians are Muslim"". Recently, there has been more debate about Islamic conservatism in Malaysia. Malaysia 'needs a new narrative of Islam' 'I regret getting tattoos on my face' Nipple tattooist 'keeps getting Facebook ban' The Tattoo Malaysia Expo drew participants from some 35 countries and was held over the weekend in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. The show has taken place since 2015, but only this year drew criticism from the government, which announced ""firm action"" against the organisers. ""It is impossible for the ministry to approve of any programme that contains obscenity such as this,"" Mr Ketapisaid in a statement,external. Pictures showed heavily-tattooed participants in semi-nude poses. Malaysian media blurred some of the images. Mr Ketapi said: ""We will wait for the full investigation report and will not hesitate to take legal action if they are found to have been in violation of set conditions."" Around 60% of Malaysia's 32 million people are Muslim, and critics say the country has been moving towards more religious conservatism. A religious court this year sentenced five men to jail, caning and fines for attempting gay sex. In 2018, two women were caned for lesbian sex in the conservative state of Terengganu.

"The government's rules on gender-neutral passports are ""unlawful"" and breach human rights, a court has heard. Judges at the Court of Appeal are hearing the case of campaigner Christie Elan-Cane, who wants passports to have an ""X"" category for those who do not identify as fully male nor female. The campaigner believes the UK's passport process is ""inherently discriminatory"". Lawyers representing the home secretary are contesting the legal challenge. The case centres on whether the current policy run by the UK passport office - which is part of the Home Office - is lawful. Currently, all UK passport holders have to specify whether they are male or female. Christie Elan-Cane believes the policy breaches the right to respect for private life, and the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of gender or sex, under the European Convention on Human Rights. The campaign for recognition of non-gendered identity in UK law and society started more than 25 years ago. Last year,a High Court challengecalling for gender-neutral passports was lost but the case has now been taken to the Court of Appeal. First Dutch gender-neutral passport issued 'Why I want gender-neutral UK passports' On Tuesday, Christie Elan-Cane's lawyer, Kate Gallafent, told the three judges: ""There is little which is more fundamental and deeply personal than an individual's gender identity."" She said those affected by the government's current passport rules ""face a choice between the degrading experience of applying for, bearing and using a passport that does not accurately reflect their gender identity, or forgoing the use of a passport at all."" People who do not consider themselves as exclusively male or female include members of the trans community and intersex people. TheUN says up to 1.7% of the world's population,externalare born with intersex traits - about the same number of people with red hair. The ""X"" stands for unspecified for people who do not identify as male or female. Earlier this year,Canada introduced,externalgender-neutral passports with an X category. Australia,Denmark,the Netherlands,Germany, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, India and Nepal already have a third category. The International Civil Aviation Organisation - the UN agency in charge of air travel - also recognises the ""X"" option. Speaking ahead of Tuesday's legal action, Christie Elan-Cane said: ""Legitimate identity is a fundamental human right but non-gendered people are treated as though we have no rights. ""It is unacceptable that someone who defines as neither male nor female is forced to declare an inappropriate gender in order to obtain a passport."" It comes as the government prepares to publish its response to a consultation on reforming the Gender Recognition Act 2004, the piece of law that sets out the legal process by which a person can change their gender. Thegovernment said,externalit had more than 100,000 responses to the consultation, which it called ""exceptionally high"". In October, the minister for women and equalities,Liz Truss, said,externalit needed time for consideration and she wanted to study it closely. During last year's High Court proceedings, Christie Elan-Cane's lawyers challenged the lawfulness of the policy administered by Her Majesty's Passport Office. James Eadie, acting for the home secretary, said the policy maintains an ""administratively coherent system for the recognition of gender"" and ensures security at national borders. Ruling on the case in June, a judge said that although he was not at that time satisfied the policy was unlawful, part of the reasoning for the decision was that a comprehensive review had not been completed.

"The Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests the basic skills of teenagers in places around the world Wales has seen its performance improve in international tests in reading, maths and science but scores remain lower than in other parts of the UK. Pisa tests are taken every three years by a sample of 15-years-olds in 79 countries and regions. Thebiggest improvement was in maths, while science is also now close to the international average.,external Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was positive as a whole ""but not perfect - we can go further still"". Q&A: Why are Pisa tests seen as important? Why Estonian pupils shine in global tests UK improving in international school rankings Mixed Pisa report for Scotlandandreading improvement in Northern Ireland The Programme for International Student Assessment (or Pisa) is set by the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and allows us to compare the basic skills of teenagers in places right across the world. Altogether, 3,165 pupils from 107 schools across Wales took the tests, which are set every three years. In mathematics, the Wales average score (487) is close to the international average - and the highest score in the five tests so far. It almost matched Scotland's average, after being 30 points behind it in 2012. The Welsh score was the same as Italy and just behind Russia, but ranks higher than the United States, Luxembourg, Lithuania and Hungary. The number of high-performing students in Wales rose from 4% to 7%. There was also no significant gender gap for the first time. In reading, Wales scored 483 - ranking just behind Austria and Switzerland but ahead of nations including Latvia, Italy, Croatia and Lithuania. It is also the highest average score since Wales started doing the tests in 2006 - although still behind the other UK nations, with Scotland showing the biggest improvement. The number of high-performing students in reading rose from 3% in 2015 to 7% in 2018. Are teenagers falling out of love with reading books? Girls also out-performed boys. However, 44% of pupils in Wales rarely or never read books compared with 35% on average in the OECD. A survey of pupils taking the test found attitudes towards reading had in general become more negative in the last decade, with the change in Wales greater than across other nations and regions on average. In science, Wales (488) is now very close to the international average and although an improvement on 2015, it is still below the 505 scored in 2006. It scores above countries like Latvia and Spain and just behind the likes of Austria, Catalonia and Portugal. There was a smaller increase in the proportion of high-performing Welsh students in science from 4% to 5%. Pisa tests boss: Wales education system 'lost its soul' 500-score Pisa target dropped in Wales 2016: Wales still worst in UK in world education tests Across the world, 600,000 students - representing 32 million 15-year-olds - took the two-hour tests last year. The Chinese provinces of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang - with a combined population of 180m - outperformed all other nations and regions, scoring 555 in reading, 591 in maths and 590 in science. Within the UK's four devolved education systems, England was the highest achiever in all three subjects. Wales remained the lowest performing within the UK for all subjects, with Scotland better than Northern Ireland at reading and Northern Ireland outperforming Scotland at maths and science. In reading tests, Wales scored below the average for OECD countries, while England, Scotland and Northern Ireland were all above average. Meanwhile, head teachers in Wales reported to the researchers greater shortages or inadequacies of equipment and books than their UK counterparts. Andreas Schleicher, head of education and skills at the OECD, said past results in Wales reflected a system wheretoo many young people were leaving education without the basic skills they needed. But he said poor Pisa results had been a ""very healthy wake-up call"" which had led to important reforms. The quality of teaching has been identified as an area which needs to improve, and there have been recent changes to teacher training. Mr Schleicher said the new curriculum being introduced from 2022 had some ""very inspiring ideas"" but how it is implemented will be the key. Ellie, from Porthcawl Comprehensive School, Bridgend county said: ""I found it a lot easier on the computer than writing in an exam - you could go back and re-do the answer if you thought it was wrong. It wasn't too much of a big deal."" Fellow pupil Jack said: ""It was pretty easy - we were only told the day before we'd be doing them. It was just two hours doing multiple-choice questions."" Krista added: ""It didn't seem much of a big deal - it was quite a chilled atmosphere in there. I don't really remember them - so it must mean it wasn't that scarring in terms of how awful it was. They weren't the same level as doing GCSE, it was just testing skills and how we coped with them."" You can try Pisa test questions here,external When the OECD asked pupils about their own feelings about their experiences in life, it found 54% of pupils in Wales ""sometimes"" or ""always"" felt miserable. This compared to the international average of 39%, while 63% of pupils ""sometimes"" or ""always"" felt worried (compared to a 50% OECD average). Carole Willis, chief executive of the National Foundation for Educational Research, which carried out the study for the OECD, said: ""While most pupils are generally happy, the results from Pisa highlight the importance of a focus on wellbeing in schools."" Education Minister Ms Williams said Wales was ""for the first time ever..in the international mainstream, thanks to the efforts of our teachers and students"". ""We have caught up, we are continuing to improve in all areas and as a nation we must be determined to keep up this momentum."" She called the increase in high-performers a ""big step forward"" and a ""culture change"" for Wales. ""But there's still more to do, as we're not quite at the OECD average for this aspect yet,"" she said. ""Not only have our overall scores gone up, we've also reduced the attainment gap. We can be proud that in Wales we truly partner equity with excellence."" Ms Williams added that Wales was heading in the right direction with reforms. Dr Eithne Hughes, director of teaching union, the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, called the results a ""real boost"". ""Of course, we want to do a good deal better than this in the future and our national ambition is to make our education system among the very best in the world,"" she said. ""We would always caution people against over-claiming or over-blaming any one factor on the difference in results between countries. Pisa is just one measure of an education system and cannot possibly tell the full story about our schools."" The National Education Union in Wales said Pisa rankings were not the ""be all and end all"" of a country's educational performance and ""striving to secure pupil happiness and well-being should be the emphasis for the Welsh Government going forward"". The head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it was vital schools and new reforms were ""funded properly and fairly"" so improvements could continue. Are teenagers falling out of love with books?

"The Trump administration is threatening to slap import taxes on $2.4bn worth of French goods, including cheese, champagne, make-up and handbags. The planned tariffs come in response to a new French digital services tax that would affect companies including Google, Amazon and Facebook. France, along with several other European countries, wants to limit the tech giants' ability to avoid taxes. But trade officials in Washington say US firms are being unfairly targeted. French minister Bruno Le Maire called the US threat to impose tariffs in response to the tax ""unacceptable"" and suggested France would be prepared to retaliate. France has long been concerned that US technology giants are avoiding taxes in the European Union. France says taxes should be based on where the digital activity - browsing the page - takes place, not where firms have their headquarters. It is not the only country to raise concerns and a group of nations are drawing up new multilateral rules via the OECD. But France does not want to wait for that to bear fruit, so this summer drew up its own tax. It is imposing a 3% tax on any digital company with revenue of more than â¬750m ($850m; Â£670m), of which at least â¬25m is generated in France. The tax will be back-dated to early 2019, and is expected to raise about â¬400m this year. About 30 companies are expected to pay it, mostly US firms such as Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon has already responded by raising fees for French businesses by 3%. Robert Lighthizer, the US Trade Representative (USTR), has publisheda list of French products that could face tariffs,external, including champagne and sparkling wine, Roquefort and other cheeses, make-up, handbags, and homeware such as porcelain and bone china. Some of the tariffs are as high as 100% of the import price, and are likely to push up the price of these products for US consumers. However, before the tariffs are confirmed, there will now be what the US calls a period for public comment, including a hearing in Washington in January. The US says the French tax unfairly targets some US multinationals. Mr Lighthizer said the threat of tariffs  was intended to deter other countries from taking similar steps. The trade official said the move ""sends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on US companies"". Mr Lighthizer warned that the US intended to look into digital taxes introduced by Austria, Italy and Turkey. US attacks UK plan for digital services tax on tech giants France tech tax: What's being done to make internet giants pay more? A digital sales tax has long been on the UK agenda too. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's flagship election pledge -to give every home and business in the UK free full-fibre broadband by 2030- was to be funded, at least in part, by a tax on ""multinationals"". In the party's press release about the plans last month, ""Amazon, Facebook and Google"" were mentioned specifically. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also backed the idea, calling out the so-called ""FAANG"" stocks - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - as paying ""virtually nothing"". The Tory manifesto pledges its own Digital Services Tax to fund improvements in broadband infrastructure, among other things. Both leaders are capitalising on the growing momentum in Europe to tax tech firms based on their sales in a country - rather than profits, which are often funnelled through counties with a lower tax rate, such as Ireland. But while promising a ""Google tax"" sounds great on the campaign trail, it only strengthens the view in Washington that American success stories are being unfairly targeted. And the move today suggests the US is ready to start fighting back. Here's what might happen next: France has said it would drop its digital tax if Europe could, as a bloc, come up with an alternative that's consistent across the Union; a strength-in-numbers move that would be more difficult for the US to counteract. But the UK, post-Brexit, would be on its own - and needs to stay in Washington's good graces. The US reaction to France's digital services tax suggests it would not go down well if the UK were to follow suit. Earlier this year, US firms were at pains to make it clear to the US Trade Representative that any such UK digital tax would be a big concern for them, with some even suggesting it would need to be dealt with before trade negotiations could go ahead. The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam says the issue has split the UK government, with some in the current cabinet believing the tech tax would be an obstacle to a future US trade deal. While the matter has not yet been openly discussed, in the recently leaked trade documents UK negotiators clearly anticipate that the issue would emerge during later parts of the process. The US technology sector has welcomed the Trump administration's tougher stance, although it still hopes for a negotiated settlement before the tariffs are imposed. Jennifer McCloskey, vice-president for policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include the major US tech firms, said the French tax was ""discriminatory"" and welcomed the USTR's ""strong trade response"". However, the US move has unnerved investors. Mr Lighthizer's comment that he sees the French tax as part of a ""growing protectionism of EU member states,"" raised concerns that this latest spat could be part of a wider trade war with the EU that has drawn in car companies and planemaker Airbus. Shares in leading French luxury-goods companies fell on Tuesday, with LVMH, Kering and Hermes down 1.4% to 1.5% in early trading. Some US business lobby groups have warned against tariffs because of fears of escalating another trade fight, despite their opposition to the French law. The US Chamber of Commerce, for example, had said tariffs ""may elicit additional rounds of retaliatory measures that represent a substantial risk to US economic growth and job creation"".

"Jerk tells the story of Tim (second right), who uses his cerebral palsy to get away with things The BBC has promised a more ""authentic and distinctive"" representation of disabled people on screen. The corporation has announced a string of new shows and said there will be an ""enhanced portrayal in existing programmes"". New commissions include a ""deeply personal film"" from BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner. The Last Leg's Alex Brooker will tackle ""the true nature of his disability for the first time"" in Disability And Me. Meanwhile, actor and writer Mat Fraser will curate ""challenging"" monologues, all performed by someone with a disability. Comedy Jerk, which follows a man who knows having cerebral palsy means he can get away with almost anything, will return for a new series. This disabled comedian is a Jerk Visual impairment no barrier to pantomime star 'I never thought I'd be presenting' Announcing the ""concerted drive to go further on representation"" in 2020, the BBC also said there would include better ""incidental and integrated"" representation in existing shows. Blind broadcaster and entrepreneur Amar Latif will join the line-up of Pilgrimage, and actress and comedian Liz Carr will delve into her family tree in Who Do You Think You Are? Disabled panellists will also appear on Celebrity Mastermind and Would I Lie To You? Frank Gardner will front Being Frank, 16 years after he was shot by al-Qaeda gunmen in Saudi Arabia The broadcaster has also put forward new measures to give disabled people more opportunities behind the scenes. A scheme called BBC Elevate is designed to allow production staff to get experience on hit shows like Strictly Come Dancing, The Apprentice and EastEnders. It is intended to ""make a tangible difference to the careers of many talented disabled people in TV, who face some particular challenges with progression"", the corporation said. Alison Kirkham, controller of factual commissioning, said the industry ""hasn't always done enough to offer opportunities for disabled people and so has missed out on their talent"". ""We want to set the bar forever higher, for the entire industry, both with off-screen talent and on-screen representation,"" she said. Disabled workers suffer pay penalty How to talk about disability without being awkward The BBC has committed to increasing the number of disabled people in its workforce to 12% by 2022. The latest official figure, from March 2018, stood at 10.4%. The broadcaster will also introduce a ""BBC Passport"" to ensure staff with disabilities get the right support when they change jobs. Disability equality charity Scope welcomed the BBC's commitment, which was made on International Day Of People With Disabilities on Tuesday. ""Disability remains hugely underrepresented on our screens and behind the scenes, particularly as one in five people are disabled,"" Scope's head of communications Warren Kirwan said. ""When disabled people don't see themselves represented, talent and potential go unrecognised and negative attitudes and stigma goes unchallenged."" Awareness of  how the media portrays disabilityhas grown in recent years. This ranges from theincreasingly vocal outcryover non-disabled actors playing characters with disabilities to the embracing of Paddy Smyth, recent winner of reality show The Circle, who openly addressed his cerebral palsy throughout. This means the BBC's commitment is timely, spurred on as it is by last year'sdamning industry representation findings. It also marks a natural progression at a time when The Travel Show host and ex-Paralympian Ade Adepitan recently visited Africa to front an eponymous prime-time series for BBC Two, alongside his Children in Need presenting duties. While it is one thing to use recognised disabled talent for disability-related stories, the true test will be how deep-rooted and wide-reaching the integration becomes. How much narrative control will be afforded to journalists who live the stories we want to tell? How far will disability representation seep into mainstream storylines, and how many disabled staff will become permanent fixtures off screen? As a journalist who entered the BBC through itsExtend scheme,externaltwo years ago, I am aware of the efforts being made. This latest commitment marks a promising start for broader change, but there's more work to do.

Comedian Sandi Toksvig co-founded the Women's Equality Party in 2015 The Womenâs Equality Party is fielding candidates in three
seats, with the aim of drawing attention to unresolved sexual harassment cases
and what it says is the lack of action by political parties. In Dover, Luton North and Bury South, the MPs who represented the
constituency in the last Parliament faced allegations of sexual harassment. All
three have denied the allegations. The WEPâs candidates - Eljai Morais (Dover), Serena Laidley
(Luton North) and Gemma Evans (Bury South) â are all themselves survivors of
sexual assault and violence. They are campaigning for changes to the law to give constituents
the power to remove MPs if an independent third party finds them guilty of
harassment or violence. MPs who are being investigated over harassment claims should be
suspended from duty, they say, not just lose the party whip as has happened in
the past. They are also seeking guaranteed funding for services that
support women and girls who have experienced violence and abuse as well as
universal free childcare from the age of nine months. The party says none of its rivals are âambitious enoughâ when it
comes to tackling the issue and only it is pursuing the radical action required
to âcreate a society where women can live free from fearâ.

This video can not be played What a split from Labour led to in the past A huge force in British politics in the 1980s, the Social
Democratic Party is fielding 20 candidates in the election - its largest number
for more than 40 years. It is mainly targeting Labour voters in constituencies which
backed Brexit and which it hopes will be attracted by its âsensible blend of
red and blue policiesâ. The party backs the UK leaving the EU by 31 January, come
what may â either with the current withdrawal agreement if it is backed by
Parliament or without a deal. It is calling for a public inquiry into the governmentâs
handling of Brexit preparations and negotiations, including the roles played by
Theresa May and David Cameron. It is also proposing a big shake-up of taxation. It wants to
reinstate a starting rate of income tax axed in 2008. It would raise the
rate of tax paid by the highest-earners from 45% to 47%. Other policies include:  Leader William Clouston says the SDP is âre-emergingâ as a

The Liberal Party would scrap the Trident nuclear weapons system First up in our mini-series of posts about smaller parties is the Liberal Party. It says its 20 candidates are standing on a
platform of âreal liberalismâ that will put power in the hands of the people. Unlike the much larger Liberal Democrats, the party says the
Brexit referendum vote must be respected and the UK has to leave the EU. Its president, Steve Radford, says âold wounds should not be
re-openedâ and everyone should come together to try to make a success of
Brexit. On tax, the party wants the low paid to keep as much of
their income as possible. It would overhaul inheritance tax, slashing rates
from 40% to 10% while scrapping allowances and exemptions and giving all
25-year-olds a one-off universal inheritance payment. The Liberal Party would scrap the Trident nuclear weapons system,

The row between the Lib Dems and Open Democracy relates to a story about the party selling personal data - something the party denies. The Lib Dems accused the website of not including a response from the party in its story.

US President Donald Trump is the latest Nato leader to arrive in Downing Street after a trip to Buckingham Palace. Mr Trump and First Lady Melania Trump had to wait outside for several minutes before they were let into No 10, though. That's because they were caught in a line-up of leaders - French President Emmanuel Macron, who arrived at the same time as the US leader, was being photographed on the doorstep by members of the press. Mr and Mrs Trump stood and listened to carol singers before giving the cameras a wave and heading inside. Raoul Li-Everington, 27, is a junior doctor working for the NHS in
north London. Speaking from the protest, he says the health service is in ""decline"" due to
""austerity"" policies. ""It's clear to me that the next step is for the Americans
to start investing in the NHS, buying up the NHS. That only leads to universal coverage not existing
anymore,"" he says. ""People will have poorer care and we will inherit a lot of
America's health problems in terms of their system. I'm here on behalf of all the junior doctors in this
country worried about the path the NHS is heading down, which is
depressing,"" he adds. Desiree Cranenburgh, 62, from Hammersmith in London and a former
NHS employee in a pharmacy department, says: ""I don't think we can trust
Trump and Boris Johnson on not doing some sort of a deal, it's big business
(for) the pharmaceutical companies.""  Boris Johnson and Donald Trump have both today said the NHS is not on the table for trade deals. Others in the crowd say they are protesting against the Nato
gathering in London. Sue Roebuck, 73, from London, said: ""I think Nato is a
war-mongering organisation, it's not there for peace at all."" ""It's all about militarising the whole world,"" she
added. She argues investment in tackling cyber-crime and environmental
concerns should come before spending on the military and nuclear defences. NHS workers and anti-war activists are targeting US President Donald Trump and Nato in a protest in central London. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square before
marching towards Buckingham Palace, where Mr Trump and other Nato leaders are being hosted by the Queen. Some protesters are concerned about the possible impact
of a future trade deal between the US and the UK affecting the NHS. Their placards bear a range of messages for Mr Trump and for Nato, including about the NHS and in relation to global conflicts. No 10 has issued a statement following Boris Johnson's talks earlier with Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Downing Street said the quartet discussed the situation in Syria and Libya, joint counter-terrorism work and defence partnerships, including through Nato. On Syria, it said the leaders agreed on the need to facilitate humanitarian access and a role for the United Nations in determining the supply of aid in the north-east of the country following Turkey'scontroversial incursion in October. According to human rights organisations, the Turkish offensive - which began days after the US pulled its troops out of the region - has led to the deaths of more than 70 civilians in Syria and left 300,000 people displaced. The quartet also promised to work together to secure a lasting ceasefire in Syria and a political settlement, as well as the safe return of refugees.

Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent On a farm in Essex, Jo Swinson's been talking about the same issue as many of the other parties today - a potential post-Brexit trade deal with the US. But the Lib Dems aren't talking about the NHS in relation to this (like the other parties). Instead, they're discussing the potential impact that a trade deal with the US could have on farming and food imports. In particular, party leader Ms Swinson has been warning about the impact of things like chlorinated chicken and testosterone-filled beef. The US has said in the past that the UK should be open to these kinds of farming methods and standards.  Ms Swinson says a Brexit that leaves the UK ""begging Donald Trump for a trade deal"" is likely to lead to ""pressure to weaken food quality standards - and that's not something that will be good for farmers"". Of course, the Lib Dem argument on all of this is that if you stop Brexit, food standards will be maintained and British farmers' subsidies will be protected. David CornockBBC Parliamentary correspondent Jo Swinson has been campaigning at a farm near Chelmsford this afternoon Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson confirms a member of the partyâs staff has been suspended for
allegedly âfakingâ an email. Speaking on a visit to an arable farm near Chelmsford, Essex, Ms Swinson says the incident was
âcompletely unacceptableâ and an investigation has been launched. The Guardian reports an unnamed person was suspended for forging an email to back up
a legal threat against the media platform, Open Democracy. Ms Swinson does not confirm the identity of
the staff member but says: âThere was an email that was
sent which was inaccurate, which was faked. Thatâs not acceptable, thereâs an
investigation, the member of staff has been suspended and Iâm not going to
comment further on staffing matters.â She says the action was ""unacceptable... and itâs right that we have taken that action"". The Lib Dems have been accused of distributing misleading information during this campaign -read our Reality Check piece about some of the accusations. Ms Swinson says: âObviously we communicate
with people across the country through our 'focus' newsletters, through
newspapers that we put out, through letters that we send to people, through a
wide variety of campaigning methods and that is common not just for Liberal
Democrats. âThat is what other parties do as well so

"The NHS has been one of the key focuses of the election campaign with the political parties battling it out to be seen as champions of the health service. This should come as no surprise. While many assumed this election was going to be largely about one issue - Brexit - the future of the NHS has actually been up there as the other big priority for voters. Some polls even suggest it is more important. But what separates the promises the parties are making? The three main parties in England - health is devolved so the Westminster politicians do not control policy in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland - have sought to use both their pre-manifesto announcements as well as their manifesto launches to highlight their health policies. Labour, in particular, has gone on the attack, accusing the Tories of plotting to sell off the NHS in a future post-Brexit trade deal with the US - something the Tories are insistent they will not do, even making it part of their manifesto pledges. It all suggests there is some kind of ideological difference in the approach to the NHS. But dig beneath the surface and what is quite remarkable is just how similar the policies actually are rather than how different. Let's take the most important factor first - funding. All three parties are promising above-inflation increases to the budget for front-line care. And, importantly, in each case this is at a faster rate than has been the case since the financial crash of 2008. Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like the environment, Brexit and the NHS. General election manifesto guide 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election The Tories - being the party in government - had already set out their plans ahead of the election. During 2018 they put forward a five-year spending plan which is seeing the budget rising by 3.4% a year above inflation. It means by 2023-24 there will be Â£149bn of funding available. By comparison Labour has proposed increasing it by 3.9% - that will bring the budget to Â£155bn by 2023-24. The Lib Dems are marginally behind this coming in at Â£154bn. But some experts say the Â£6bn gap between Labour and the Tories could in fact be slightly narrower. The Treasury - under the Tories - has already promised tohelp meet the rising cost of NHS pensions, and if you factor that in, the difference could be around Â£3.5bn. That is enough to make an impact, but hardly points to a great division in approach given the size of the budget. That much is clear from the sort of things that all of the parties are promising to spend their money on: more staffing, including extra GPs and nurses in particular more support for students doing nursing degrees by bringing back maintenance grants (although Labour is also proposing to scrap tuition fees as part of its education policy) improving hospital waiting times because of the growing pressure in areas such as A&E, routine operations and cancer an increased focus on mental health with all committed to increasing the proportion of the budget spent in this area a recognition that the social care system needs reform to help relieve pressure on the NHS CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? Even when there appear to be significant differences in ambition, the truth is much more nuanced. Take nurses, for example - theTory promise of 50,000may seem to be more generous than the Labour pledge of 24,000. But the Tories have factored in improving retention (an important issue if you are going to grow the workforce) whereas Labour has not. It makes determining which plan is more ambitious incredibly difficult. But regardless of that, what is missing from all the pledges is the detail on how exactly any of this will be achieved. This lack of detail is also apparent in other areas away from the front-line budget. All three parties have talked about investing in buildings. Labour is promising to increase the annual budget to over Â£10bn by the end of the next Parliament - it is currently Â£7bn. The Lib Dems, once again, are not far behind that. The Tories say spending will increase, but are not saying by how much. Although, it is clear from their focus on buildings - Boris Johnson is constantly championing the40 new hospitals he wants to see builtover the next decade - that the budget will be going up. So when it comes to the NHS, is there actually a big decision in terms of who to vote for? At the end of the day, all you have heard during the election are promises and projections. What matters is who can deliver - and that means making judgements about competency and which party will be best for the economy. That in turn means looking at their policies on Brexit, tax and the nation's finances - in short deciding who in reality will have the most money to spend on health. It is those things that will go a long way to determining the health of the NHS in the future.

"The issue of tactical voting is looming large in discussions about how the 2019 general election will play out. Tactical voting happens when a voter abandons the party or candidate they prefer, and votes for one with a better chance of winning locally - often, but not always, in order to defeat a disliked candidate. Relatively small changes in the number of votes a candidate receives have the potential to make a big difference. At the 2017 election174 MPs were elected with less than half the vote,and in 2015it was 334 out of 650. In those constituencies, supporters of the parties that came third place or lower, could have defeated the MP by backing the second-placed party. Surveys after recent elections saw about one in 10 voters - around 3 million people - saying they voted tactically. The number of people voting tactically has not changed very much since the 1990s, despite the fact that peopleswitch votes between elections more frequently,external. It seems that tactical voting is not driven by political sophistication or general willingness to consider switching, so much as how much support there is for lower-placed candidates in constituencies, and how much supporters of those lower-placed candidates like their second-choice party and dislike one of the top contenders. Tactical voting is not particularly more likely to happen in closely fought constituencies, where a relatively small number of voters can make more of a difference. People often vote tactically in relatively safe seats too. Since it is not always clear what order the parties are going to come in, some voters make mistakes and vote tactically the wrong way - that is, for a party that ends up doing worse than the voter's preferred party. Typically though, people are more likely to vote tactically the clearer it is that their preferred party is out of contention. In the 1990s, after the Conservatives had been in power for over a decade, Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters were often willing to vote tactically for each other depending on who was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. This reacheda high point in 1997,externalwhen tactical voting was estimated to have cost the Conservatives around 46 seats, with Labour taking 35 and the Liberal Democrats 11 of them. Tactical voting played a part in Tony Blair's 1997 election victory However, if tactical voting fails to happen in large enough numbers, it doesn't make a difference. At the 2015 election, shortly after the Scottish independence referendum, there was an attempt to co-ordinateanti-nationalist tactical voting,externalamong opponents of the Scottish National Party (SNP). It even involved Conservative supporters voting Labour. It almost certainly saved Labour from a total wipe-out in Scotland, securing their one remaining seat north of the border that year. But it was not enough to stop the SNP fromwinning nearly all the seats(56 out of 59) with just less than half the overall vote in Scotland. Tactical voting in the 2019 general election is likely to be shaped mainly by divisions over Brexit, even more so than it was in 2017. Among Leave supporters, tactical voting is likely to come into play in constituencies where the Brexit Party and the Conservatives are competing to take a seat from a party that is sympathetic to another referendum (the Brexit Party has alreadystood down its candidatesin seats that the Conservatives won last time). The Conservatives' message - ""get Brexit done"" - is aimed partly at encouraging Brexit Party supporters to use their vote tactically in seats where the Conservatives have a better chance of winning (that is, most, if not all, of them). Tactical voting among Remain supporters is much more complicated because it involves more parties, withvarying Brexit policies. The Lib Dems the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party are all pro-Remain. The Labour Party is in favour of a referendum but has not committed to supporting Remain or Leave. Pro-Remain parties also disagree on other issues, and they do not always say nice things about each other's party leaders. For all of these reasons, many supporters of these parties are not keen on switching tactically in favour of one of the others. It is often difficult to identify Remain candidates best placed to win seats from Conservatives. This is because different pro-Remain parties did well in different places at the last general election. General election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? What's more, there have been big changes in the opinion polls since 2017. On average in the polls, the Labour vote has dropped by 10 percentage points since the last election, while the Lib Dem vote has increased by six points. This suggests the Lib Dems may have overtaken Labour in as many as 55 of the 273 seats where Conservatives are defending and Labour came second last time. At this and previous elections there have been constituency polls to guide people in some high profile places. Now there are also sophisticated statistical models of polling data attempting to show how support for the parties stands in every constituency. These models have been used by campaign groups to set up websites encouraging people to vote tactically for particular parties in particular constituencies. What is the secret behind tactical voting? Are ads and leaflets on tactical voting misleading people? Some go so far as to organise vote swapping - matching people from different constituencies so they can both vote tactically, knowing that someone somewhere else will be voting for their preferred party. Tactical voting websites largely agree on which pro-Remain parties are best placed to win in which constituencies, but they do not entirely agree. There have also been changes in public opinion since those websites were set up, and there might well be further changes before election day. And, of course, all polls and forecasts may be inaccurate. So tactical voting websites cannot be entirely relied on. Voters have to form their own judgements as to whom they want to vote for and why.

"Essex Police urged the public not to speculate on the circumstances of the crash A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 12-year-old boy who died in a hit-and-run outside a school. The 51-year-old was also detained on suspicion of the attempted murder of four other teenagers and a 23-year-old woman who were hurt in the crash. It happened near Debden Park High School in Loughton, Essex, at about 15:20 GMT on Monday. Essex Police said officers were looking for a silver Ford KA that was ""likely to have damage to [its] front"". Earlier, the force took the step of naming Terry Glover, 51, as someone they wanted to speak to in connection with the crash. It is understood that all the injured children - two 15-year-old boys, a 13-year-old boy, and a girl, 16 - are pupils at the school. Flowers have been laid outside the school Debden Park'shead teacher Helen Gascoyne, said,external: ""Our thoughts are with the family and all those affected. ""The school will be open [on Tuesday] with a number of counsellors on hand to support our community."" Christian Cavanagh, executive head teacher, described the boy's death as ""a young life so tragically lost"". He said: ""This young man had made his mark on the school and was liked and loved by staff and students. ""We will consult with the family and our school community to decide how best to commemorate his life."" Christian Cavanagh said the dead boy had been ""liked and loved by staff and pupils"" Donna Mills, the mother of Alfie Barnes who was one of the 15-year-olds struck by the car, said he was ""still in shock"", ""battered and bruised"". ""He remembers the car coming towards him, he remembers getting hit but it is a bit of a blur. He hit his head and I think he blacked out for a bit,"" she said. ""It was a bit scary, very scary for him. ""Alfie rang me and said 'mum I have been hit by a car', so I shot down there as fast as I could, it was horrendous. ""It was... horrible to see, kids laying on the floor, just terrible."" There is likely to be a ""prolonged investigation"", police said Det Ch Insp Rob Kirby described the crash as ""truly shocking"" and appealed for dashcam footage. ""I would like to thank the many members of the public who have called us with information and spoken to our officers, as well as those who provided crucial medical assistance at the scene,"" he said. Willingale Road, where the crash happened, cannot be accessed from junctions on either side of the school and remains cordoned off. Charlotte Rose, BBC Essex Pupils arriving to school this morning knew today was not going to be an ordinary day. Many of them may have witnessed some of the events that unfolded on Willingale Road as they left school last night, many more who may not have seen it firsthand will probably have seen reports on social media. The school has decided to open in order that pupils can come in, can be with their friends, fellow pupils and teachers and can receive counselling if they want or need it. A number of students have laid floral tributes, some with cards and messages for the family. Chris Whitbread, leader of Epping Forest District Council, said any parent who had heard about the crash would have been ""devastated and shocked"". Sixth-form student Scarlett Bearman, 17, said exams had been cancelled for the day and counselling was being provided to pupils. She said: ""From my point of view the school has handled it extremely well. I expect the mood there to be quite low today.""

"Members of the Royal College of Nursing union outside the Royal Victoria Hospital on Tuesday Industrial action by healthcare workers is intensifying as Northern Ireland's nurses take part in 24 hours of action. Health workers are  industrial action in protest at pay and staffing levels which they claim are ""unsafe"". In an unprecedented joint statement, the six health trusts said the action was likely to result in ""a significant risk to patient safety"". Last week, the Royal College of Surgeons warnedNI's healthcare system was ""at the point of collapse"". On Tuesday, members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) are refusing to do any work that is not directly related to patient care. Full details and advice on current health care services can be found on theHealth and Social Care Board website,external. Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride called on all sides involved to step back, pause and resume negotiations. ""We now need to compromise, all parties need to compromise and I would appeal to all parties to compromise."" ""Let's get around the table, let's find a way through this, let's find a way through that recognises that, at present, the department neither has the authority nor the budget to meet the trade unions' demands - the reasonable demands they are making."" Patricia Cowan said she took part in cancer diagnosis testing on Monday Meanwhile, it has emerged that a nurse has said cancer diagnosis appointments continued at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) despite claims by the Belfast Trust that they had been cancelled. Patricia Cowan, a specialist dermatologist nurse, said she took part in those diagnoses on Monday. On Monday, chief executiveMartin Dillon said outpatient cancellations meant people due to have cancer diagnostic tests this week had had their appointments postponed. The nurse said that about two thirds of booked patients turned up for appointments on Monday morning and, in the afternoon, only one person in a clinic booked for 12 people did not show. ""They were new patients who had waited for goodness knows who long for an appointment which was cancelled by the trust,"" she said. In a statement, the Belfast Trust said it was ""always aware that some staff would be available despite the industrial action"". But the trust said that it could not guarantee the required level of staffing to provide the outpatient appointments ""The decision to cancel appointments remains the only responsible course of action in the circumstances. Otherwise, large number of patients would be attending in circumstances where we could not guarantee they would be provided."" Dr Stevens called for a political solution to an ""acute financial problem"" Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Dr Tony Stevens, chief executive of the Northern Health Trust said the system was ""coping, but just coping"". ""We have got a system that copes, that is safe, but it has very little tolerance. Our concern is the strike action will just tip us that little bit beyond where we're comfortable,"" he said in an interview on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. ""There is an increased risk that somebody is going to get missed or that something is going to happen."" Dr Stevens said he had ""every sympathy"" with health care staff and their frustration, but he said the Department of Health had been clear about its lack of resources. The trust chief called for a ""political solution"" to what he described as ""a long-standing and now acute financial problem"". Former health chief John Compton told BBC NI's Talkback that there had been ""a pretty profound breakdown in trust between the work force and the system"". ""For me, this is a political decision at the end of the day,"" he said. ""The only political entity that we have at this point in time is the secretary of state. Therefore, I think it really is incumbent on the political system to respond to what is a growing and really quite unpleasant set of circumstances - of course for the staff - but mostly for the citizens of this country."" Speaking about the industrial action, Kevin McAdam of Unite, said: ""If it has inconvenienced our public, we ask you to understand that this is your fight. ""We are fighting this fight for you for better services to make sure there is enough staff to deliver the healthcare you rightly expect."" He said he firmly believed there was money to pay health workers in line with their colleagues England, Scotland and Wales. The RCN said it has about 16,000 members in Northern Ireland, where some 17,000 nurses and 5,000 nursing support workers are employed in total. In November,nurses voted to take part in strike action for the first time in the 103-year historyof the RCN union. On its first day of industrial action - which started at 00:01 GMT on Tuesday and lasts for 24 hours - RCN members are not striking, but are refusing to do any task that is not directly ""patient specific"". This includes things like: not working bank or overtime shifts not working unpaid hours not completing paper work other than individual patient records Not answering phones on wards Not doing administrative tests Not collecting prescriptions or pharmacy in the community Two more days of industrial action, short of strike action, are to be held on 10 and 11 December. The first day of full strike action by RCN members is set to happen the week before Christmas, on 18 December. On Monday night, the Unite trade union said its members had also voted to strike on 18 December. It said it has 4,000 members who work in the health service and they would join members of the Royal College of Nursing, Unison and NIPSA in strike action. The chief executives of the health and social care trusts and the head of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said they recognised the dedication of health staff, as well as the need for ""a long-term funding settlement that addresses service, workforce and pay pressures in a sustainable manner"". ""The level of escalation... is causing us real concern with regard to service continuity during what is already a very demanding period,"" they said. ""We have been struggling with a system where funding has been made available on a yearly basis, which makes it impossible to plan for the long term. ""Demand is increasing and will continue to do so, meaning that the current system is simply unsustainable."" Members of Unison - NI's largest health workers' union - started their industrial action last week As a result of the industrial action, the Belfast Health Trust cancelled more than 10,000 outpatient appointments and surgeries this week. The South Eastern Health Trust has also cancelled some services but on a smaller scale. In Belfast, the following hospitals cancelled all outpatient appointments, day case procedures and planned surgeries on Tuesday and Thursday: Royal Victoria Hospital (including the children's hospital, maternity hospital and school of dentistry) Belfast City Hospital Mater Hospital Musgrave Park Hospital However, some outpatient appointments are going ahead at these places: Health and wellbeing centres Community facilities Chemotherapy or radiotherapy at either the Bridgewater suite or cancer centre at Belfast City Hospital Macular clinic at Fairview Paediatric oncology at the Children's Hospital On Wednesday, all outpatient services will run as normal. Planned surgeries and day case procedures will still be postponed. Emergency services and day centres are not affected by the industrial action. In the South Eastern Health Trust area, all routine outpatient appointments at the Ulster Hospital have been cancelled on Wednesday, with the exception of maternity and children's services. On Friday, outpatient departments at Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley Hospital, Downe Hospital, Ards Hospital and Bangor Hospital will be closed in the afternoon.

"This video can not be played Industrial action 'may delay cancer diagnoses' says Belfast Trust Patients in Northern Ireland are facing a week of disruption, with more than 10,000 outpatient appointments and surgeries cancelled in Belfast. Some people referred by their GPs on suspicion of cancer could have their diagnosis delayed, the head of the Belfast Health Trust has said. The trust apologised, blaming industrial action on pay and staffing. But the trade union Unison said it had been asked to exempt cancer services from its action and had agreed to that. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith told BBC News NI he was ""extremely concerned"" about the challenges facing the health service. He said: ""The government is clear this is one of a number of the urgent problems that we need a restored executive to tackle and that is why we are so focused on getting Stormont back."" Full details of the cancellations and advice for patients can be found on theHealth and Social Care Board website,external. Belfast Health Trust chief executive Martin Dillon said outpatient cancellations meant people due to have cancer diagnostic tests this week had had their appointments postponed. Martin Dillon said some people suspected of having cancer may have to wait for tests Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show, Mr Dillon said: ""There are some patients whose GPs may well have a suspicion of cancer - not yet confirmed. ""Some of those people will have been due to have tests this week that would have confirmed that one way or the other. ""Regrettably we've had to stand those appointments down. ""This could potentially lead to a delay in diagnosis and could potentially lead to a delay in treatment."" Mr Dillon confirmed that all patients who are having cancer treatment would have their treatment as planned this week. Unison union members are carrying out waves of four-hour strikes on Monday. Patricia McKeown, Unison's regional secretary, said that in talks with the Belfast Health Trust last week union officials were asked to exempt cancer services from their industrial action. ""Unison agreed to this along with a range of other exemptions,"" she said. ""The trust did not indicate any intention to cancel cancer diagnostic treatment - if it had done so it would have been exempted. ""We ask the Belfast Trust to urgently engage with Unison's local representatives to explain why they have taken this action and to put it right."" Ms McKeown also argued that three of the trusts had announced they would cancel all elective surgery some weeks ago, before her union confirmed its members were taking industrial action. Patricia McKeown said the situation was not of Unison's making She said the industrial action would be ""cumulative"" and it would be ""an escalation"". ""Right across the whole system, Unison members are working to rule. ""They are coming in to do their contracted jobs, they are stopping giving the tens of thousands of free hours they give to the health service every week in order to cover for missing colleagues."" The Royal College of Nursing's Northern Ireland director Pat Cullen said her union's members were ""absolutely devastated"" by such widespread cancellations. ""We as yet have no idea why such significant appointments will be cancelled because our nurses will be there to care for their patients,"" she said. Nurses planned to take industrial action on Tuesday but would continue to do all direct patient care, she added. They will not do the tasks usually performed by porters or administrators. Some outpatient appointments will still take place at the places listed above ""We have been describing what has been a perfect storm in terms of the levels of vacancies within the nursing workforce and that has fallen on deaf ears,"" she said. ""Nurses cannot continue to work in the environment they are working in."" The trust is asking patients not to phone to reschedule due to the large numbers of people affected. The South Eastern Health Trust is also cancelling some services but on a smaller scale. Last week the Royal College of Surgeons warnedNorthern Ireland's healthcare system was ""at the point of collapse""after waiting times reached an all-time high. In Belfast, the following hospitals will have all outpatient appointments, day case procedures and planned surgeries cancelled on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday: Royal Victoria Hospital (including the children's hospital, maternity hospital and school of dentistry) Belfast City Hospital Mater Hospital Musgrave Park Hospital However, some outpatient appointments will go ahead at these places: Health and wellbeing centres Community facilities Chemotherapy or radiotherapy at either the Bridgewater suite or cancer centre at Belfast City Hospital Macular clinic at Fairview Paediatric oncology at the children's hospital On Wednesday, all outpatient services will run as normal.

The Department of Health said the serious disruption to services was ""extremely distressing"". It said its offer of an independent conciliation process on the dispute stands. ""As we have been saying for some time, we simply don't have the money or authority to resolve this impasse and we strongly believe that patients should not be the ones to suffer because of that,"" the department said. ""Like our trust colleagues we would still wish to apologise to everyone affected."" The Northern Health Trust told the BBC that at present none of its services are affected.

"Health workers across Northern Ireland are staging industrial action in protest against pay and staffing levels which they say are ""unsafe"". Last month,Northern Ireland's nurses voted for the first time ever to go on strike, with members of the largest health union following suit days later. The Belfast Trust has blamed the industrial action for its cancellation ofmore than 10,000 outpatient appointments and surgeries in Belfast this week. BBC News NI explains the background to the crisis. The problem of pay and funding for nurses and healthcare staff dates back to about 2010. A series of cuts to nursing places and bursaries was exacerbated by the beginning ofa two-year pay freeze for public sector workers, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year. Until January 2017, it was the responsibility of a health minister in the Stormont executive to decide on pay for healthcare staff in Northern Ireland. But then devolution collapsed, following a bitter row between the power-sharing Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party, because of a green energy financial scandal. Since then, the top civil servant in the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, has been in charge. Health is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland, as is the issue of pay for staff. Nurses in Northern Ireland have their training fees and bursaries paid for, while those in England and Wales do not. Five Stormont health ministers - from 2010 until the collapse of devolution - were at the helm regarding pay issues for health care workers: Michael McGimpsey - Ulster Unionist party Edwin Poots, Jim Wells and Simon Hamilton of the DUP Michelle O'Neill - Sinn FÃ©in While changes to policy were in the hands of ministers, decisions about saving money were rubber-stamped by the Stormont executive, which up until 2016 included ministers from all five main parties. Members of NI's largest health union to go on strike NI nurses vote to strike for first time Pay cap to end for NI health workers In late 2014, then-Health Minister Jim Wells said hewould impose a ""degree of restraint"",externalon pay for health care workers, due to financial challenges in the department. A differential developed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, where pay rises for nurses and healthcare workers in Northern Ireland did not increase in line with those in Scotland, England and Wales. Yes, but those have not been without criticism either. In January 2016, then-Health Minister Simon Hamilton announced an imposed 1% pay awardthat almost triggered industrial action. At the time, the unions said the 1% rise was a one-off payment for most staff rather than an increase in annual salaries, which had been the case in other parts of the UK. Mr Hamilton argued that the demands from the unions were ""unaffordable"". In August 2016, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, who had taken over the health minister brief by then,wrote to the NHS Pay Review Body,external, as part of its annual remit, saying the arrangements on pay would remain unchanged. In her letter, she said the Northern Ireland Executive had ""endorsed the principle of adherence to the UK government's public sector pay policy and, therefore, any proposals will be constrained by HM Treasury's call for future pay restraint"". In 2017, the Westminster government agreed a pay deal that guaranteed an increase over three years for NHS workers. Unlike elsewhere in the UK, the deal was not implemented in Northern Ireland due to the lack of a functioning executive. Since the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in 2017, talks have been ongoing between the health unions and the Department of Health. To date, little has been agreed, which has led to nurses and members of Northern Ireland's largest health union, Unison,voting for strike action. The Department of Health has said it remains ""focused on finding a way forward"" and is finalising a formal pay offer for 2019-20, which would be ""the best offer possible within the budget available"" given intense budgetary pressures. Some health workers began their first phase of industrial action on 25 November Some health workers begantheir first phase of industrial action on 25 November. That will end on 18 December, with a second phase of action running until March 2020. It includes the withdrawal of labour at different times, across a number of hospitals in Northern Ireland. Other services outside hospitals are likely to be affected by the strike as drivers will not be taking patients to facilities or service providers. The council of the Royal College of Nursing says its members will take their first day of strike action on 18 December. It is planned as 12 hours of strike action. The first day of industrial action, which includes refusing to do any task that is not patient specific, will be on 3 December. It includes: Not working overtime on days of industrial action Not working unpaid hours Not completing paperwork other than individual patient records Unions have said they are receiving strong public support, and the Stormont civil service said intensive contingency planning is being undertaken to mitigate the impact of industrial action on patients and other service users.

"Nurses voted to take the action by an overwhelming majority with the result announced on Thursday. Nurses in Northern Ireland have voted to strike over staffing numbers and pay disputes. It is the first time in the Royal College of Nursing's (RCN) 103-year-history such action has been taken in the UK. In a ballot which lasted four weeks, nurses were asked if they were willing to take industrial action, including strike action. RCN NI director Pat Cullen said nurses had ""spoken clearly"". ""Nurses are no longer willing to see patients being denied the health care services to which they are entitled,"" she said. Millions spent hiring NI nurses from agency 1,800 unfilled jobs in NI health care ""The 3,000 nursing vacancies that currently exist within Health and Social Care (the public health body in Northern Ireland) are having a detrimental impact upon patient care and adding enormous pressure to the existing nursing workforce."" Ms Cullen said pay in Northern Ireland had ""fallen significantly"" behind the rest of the UK. She said this made it ""difficult to recruit and retain the nurses that we desperately need"". The total number of those balloted was around 8,000, with turnout of 43.3%. The union now has four weeks to inform employers how they plan to proceed. Analysis - Strike will be embarrassing for election candidates: Strike action is always significant but this one is particularly so as there is no devolved government or health minister in place for the nurses to negotiate with. Unless a resolution is found, it will play out during an election.  It is unprecedented and somewhat incredible. So why bother? Sources tell me there is never a good time to strike and things are so bad the RCN could not backpedal. The strike will make the doorstep chats for politicians even more awkward and for some parties equally embarrassing. Northern Ireland is used to unique predicaments, but potentially this could prove to be the most difficult to negotiate and to settle. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said it would be holding ""detailed discussions"" with the RCN and other trade unions on Friday. ""Dialogue remains the only way forward,"" the spokesperson said. ""With a Northern Ireland public sector pay policy now in place for 2019/2020, we plan to table a formal pay offer as soon as possible. ""The budgetary pressures across health and social care are clear for all to see. ""Despite claims to the contrary, there is no separate or untapped source of funding for pay increases."" ""It all comes out of the one health budget. Every pound spent on one priority area is a pound not available for another."" There are almost 3,000 unfilled nursing posts across the system in Northern Ireland. The department added that it accepted staff felt ""deeply frustrated"". According to the RCN, nurses' pay within the health service continues to fall behind England, Scotland and Wales. It argues that the real value of nurses' pay here has fallen by 15% over the past eight years. Due to nursing shortages however, the cost of securing nursing staff via agencies has increased to over Â£32m last year. There was a campaign of strike action over NHS pay in 2014, but while some nurses from other unions took part, the RCN did not.

"This video can not be played Industrial action 'may delay cancer diagnoses' says Belfast Trust Patients in Northern Ireland are facing a week of disruption, with more than 10,000 outpatient appointments and surgeries cancelled in Belfast. Some people referred by their GPs on suspicion of cancer could have their diagnosis delayed, the head of the Belfast Health Trust has said. The trust apologised, blaming industrial action on pay and staffing. But the trade union Unison said it had been asked to exempt cancer services from its action and had agreed to that. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith told BBC News NI he was ""extremely concerned"" about the challenges facing the health service. He said: ""The government is clear this is one of a number of the urgent problems that we need a restored executive to tackle and that is why we are so focused on getting Stormont back."" Full details of the cancellations and advice for patients can be found on theHealth and Social Care Board website,external. Belfast Health Trust chief executive Martin Dillon said outpatient cancellations meant people due to have cancer diagnostic tests this week had had their appointments postponed. Martin Dillon said some people suspected of having cancer may have to wait for tests Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show, Mr Dillon said: ""There are some patients whose GPs may well have a suspicion of cancer - not yet confirmed. ""Some of those people will have been due to have tests this week that would have confirmed that one way or the other. ""Regrettably we've had to stand those appointments down. ""This could potentially lead to a delay in diagnosis and could potentially lead to a delay in treatment."" Mr Dillon confirmed that all patients who are having cancer treatment would have their treatment as planned this week. Unison union members are carrying out waves of four-hour strikes on Monday. Patricia McKeown, Unison's regional secretary, said that in talks with the Belfast Health Trust last week union officials were asked to exempt cancer services from their industrial action. ""Unison agreed to this along with a range of other exemptions,"" she said. ""The trust did not indicate any intention to cancel cancer diagnostic treatment - if it had done so it would have been exempted. ""We ask the Belfast Trust to urgently engage with Unison's local representatives to explain why they have taken this action and to put it right."" Ms McKeown also argued that three of the trusts had announced they would cancel all elective surgery some weeks ago, before her union confirmed its members were taking industrial action. Patricia McKeown said the situation was not of Unison's making She said the industrial action would be ""cumulative"" and it would be ""an escalation"". ""Right across the whole system, Unison members are working to rule. ""They are coming in to do their contracted jobs, they are stopping giving the tens of thousands of free hours they give to the health service every week in order to cover for missing colleagues."" The Royal College of Nursing's Northern Ireland director Pat Cullen said her union's members were ""absolutely devastated"" by such widespread cancellations. ""We as yet have no idea why such significant appointments will be cancelled because our nurses will be there to care for their patients,"" she said. Nurses planned to take industrial action on Tuesday but would continue to do all direct patient care, she added. They will not do the tasks usually performed by porters or administrators. Some outpatient appointments will still take place at the places listed above ""We have been describing what has been a perfect storm in terms of the levels of vacancies within the nursing workforce and that has fallen on deaf ears,"" she said. ""Nurses cannot continue to work in the environment they are working in."" The trust is asking patients not to phone to reschedule due to the large numbers of people affected. The South Eastern Health Trust is also cancelling some services but on a smaller scale. Last week the Royal College of Surgeons warnedNorthern Ireland's healthcare system was ""at the point of collapse""after waiting times reached an all-time high. In Belfast, the following hospitals will have all outpatient appointments, day case procedures and planned surgeries cancelled on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday: Royal Victoria Hospital (including the children's hospital, maternity hospital and school of dentistry) Belfast City Hospital Mater Hospital Musgrave Park Hospital However, some outpatient appointments will go ahead at these places: Health and wellbeing centres Community facilities Chemotherapy or radiotherapy at either the Bridgewater suite or cancer centre at Belfast City Hospital Macular clinic at Fairview Paediatric oncology at the children's hospital On Wednesday, all outpatient services will run as normal. Planned surgeries and day case procedures will still be postponed. Emergency services and day centres are not affected by the industrial action. In the South Eastern Health Trust area, all routine outpatient appointments at the Ulster Hospital have been cancelled on Wednesday, with the exception of maternity and children's services. On Friday, outpatient departments at Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley Hospital, Downe Hospital, Ards Hospital and Bangor Hospital will be closed in the afternoon. Members of Unison - NI's largest health workers' union - started their industrial action last week Health workers across Northern Ireland are staging industrial action in protest at pay and staffing levels which they claim are ""unsafe"". On Monday night, the Unite trade union said its members had voted to strike on 18 December. It said it has 4,000 members who work in the health service and they would join members of the Royal College of Nursing, Unison and NIPSA in strike action. The Department of Health said the serious disruption to services was ""extremely distressing"". It said its offer of an independent conciliation process on the dispute stands. ""As we have been saying for some time, we simply don't have the money or authority to resolve this impasse and we strongly believe that patients should not be the ones to suffer because of that,"" the department said. ""Like our trust colleagues we would still wish to apologise to everyone affected."" The Northern Health Trust told the BBC that at present none of its services are affected. However, the trust said it was working with Unison, with industrial action due to take place on Friday. Updates can be found on itswebsite,external.

"Emily Broughton says she loves to rent as she can try new looks Emily Broughton, 24, a lifestyle blogger and entrepreneur, spends Â£200 a month on clothing on average, but she now spends part of that budget on renting clothes. ""I love to rent because you can get such amazing high quality items and try new looks,"" she says. Once a regular High Street shopper, buying lots of cheap outfits, she now prefers to buy either second-hand designer clothes from vintage stores and charity shops, or to rent fashion from a range of platforms  such as By Rotation, Hirestreet and My Wardrobe HQ. ""A few years ago I'd be going round to my friends' houses and sharing clothes with them from their wardrobes, and rental is opening that up,"" says Ms Broughton, whose blog Saving the Grace focuses on sustainable living. Not all the outfits are expensive - she says she has rented clothes for as little as Â£10 for three days and typically rents one item of clothing a month. Shoppers like Ms Broughton, could help drive a shift in how we shop, claims retail veteran Jane Shepherdson. She's the new chairman of a high-end fashion rental start-up called My Wardrobe HQ, which is hoping to make renting clothes rather than buying them popular in the UK. Ms Shepherdson, who has spent 35 years in the industry and is credited with building Topshop into a global brand, sees renting designer clothes as an opportunity for people to be able to wear beautiful clothing, shoes and accessories that they wouldn't typically be able to afford. For example, she envisages women renting a dress or a fancy pair of Jimmy Choo shoes for Â£60 to wear to a wedding or fancy function, rather than buying them for several hundred pounds. But she also sees the service as a way for people who have bought expensive garments to earn some money by hiring them out several times in a season. ""Anything we can do to slow down the mass purchasing of clothes and share each piece a little bit more, the better. It's kind of trying to reward a more conscientious way of purchasing,"" she told the BBC. ""I don't think it's going to solve the fast fashion problem immediately. What I hope is that in the longer term it will start to change people's behaviour slowly."" Jane Shepherdson is credited with building Topshop into a global brand It's a potentially lucrative sector. US rival Rent the Runway, which claims to have pioneered the fashion rental concept in 2009, was recently valued at $1bn (Â£770m). It has a subscriber base of about 100,000 people who pay a subscription fee of $160 a month for unlimited rentals. However, at Â£60 per dress, handbag or pair of shoes from My Wardrobe HQ, you'd still need to have a reasonable amount of disposable income in order to be able to afford such a lifestyle. It therefore seems unlikely that renting clothes at this level would appeal to Generation Z and younger millennials who are buying Â£5 dresses online. Ms Shepherdson acknowledges that it will take a while before the British consumer is ready to spend this much on clothing that they don't get to keep. The idea of renting clothing is not new in itself - in the West, men have rented wedding suits for years, while in Southeast Asia many women now rent several wedding gowns for photoshoots and ceremonies. However, it has never really been a particularly popular option for womenswear, as consumers prefer to own garments, whether they be brand new or secondhand. Is fashion rental only really applicable to people who have a lot of disposable income? Popular mainstream brands such as American Eagle, Urban Outfitters and Ann Taylor are already offering retail rental services, while in Europe, major fast fashion retailer H&M recently begun a trial of renting out clothes at its flagship store in Stockholm, Sweden. According to retail expert Natalie Berg, the future of retail is for products to become services, because it helps retailers to retain customer loyalty, as well as staying relevant. She cites several examples of this, such as Ikea renting out furniture, electronic retailer AO renting out washing machines, and sports brand Adidas asking consumers to bring back old worn-out shoes and then trading up for a newer model. ""It's about consumers prioritising access over ownership,"" Ms Berg explains. H&M is also using its clothing rental service to offer a new personal styling service, which serves to tie customers to its brand. And although consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious, Ms Berg doesn't think that fast fashion will ever really go away, because cheap clothes are always in demand. She said: ""The reality is that fashion is a remarkably wasteful industry, and I think there's just this growing awareness across demographics that we need to do more as a society to address our culture of waste.""

"The Trump administration is threatening to slap import taxes on $2.4bn worth of French goods, including cheese, champagne, make-up and handbags. The planned tariffs come in response to a new French digital services tax that would affect companies including Google, Amazon and Facebook. France, along with several other European countries, wants to limit the tech giants' ability to avoid taxes. But trade officials in Washington say US firms are being unfairly targeted. French minister Bruno Le Maire called the US threat to impose tariffs in response to the tax ""unacceptable"" and suggested France would be prepared to retaliate. France has long been concerned that US technology giants are avoiding taxes in the European Union. France says taxes should be based on where the digital activity - browsing the page - takes place, not where firms have their headquarters. It is not the only country to raise concerns and a group of nations are drawing up new multilateral rules via the OECD. But France does not want to wait for that to bear fruit, so this summer drew up its own tax. It is imposing a 3% tax on any digital company with revenue of more than â¬750m ($850m; Â£670m), of which at least â¬25m is generated in France. The tax will be back-dated to early 2019, and is expected to raise about â¬400m this year. About 30 companies are expected to pay it, mostly US firms such as Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon has already responded by raising fees for French businesses by 3%. Robert Lighthizer, the US Trade Representative (USTR), has publisheda list of French products that could face tariffs,external, including champagne and sparkling wine, Roquefort and other cheeses, make-up, handbags, and homeware such as porcelain and bone china. Some of the tariffs are as high as 100% of the import price, and are likely to push up the price of these products for US consumers. However, before the tariffs are confirmed, there will now be what the US calls a period for public comment, including a hearing in Washington in January. The US says the French tax unfairly targets some US multinationals. Mr Lighthizer said the threat of tariffs  was intended to deter other countries from taking similar steps. The trade official said the move ""sends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on US companies"". Mr Lighthizer warned that the US intended to look into digital taxes introduced by Austria, Italy and Turkey. US attacks UK plan for digital services tax on tech giants France tech tax: What's being done to make internet giants pay more? A digital sales tax has long been on the UK agenda too. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's flagship election pledge -to give every home and business in the UK free full-fibre broadband by 2030- was to be funded, at least in part, by a tax on ""multinationals"". In the party's press release about the plans last month, ""Amazon, Facebook and Google"" were mentioned specifically. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also backed the idea, calling out the so-called ""FAANG"" stocks - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - as paying ""virtually nothing"". The Tory manifesto pledges its own Digital Services Tax to fund improvements in broadband infrastructure, among other things. Both leaders are capitalising on the growing momentum in Europe to tax tech firms based on their sales in a country - rather than profits, which are often funnelled through counties with a lower tax rate, such as Ireland. But while promising a ""Google tax"" sounds great on the campaign trail, it only strengthens the view in Washington that American success stories are being unfairly targeted. And the move today suggests the US is ready to start fighting back. Here's what might happen next: France has said it would drop its digital tax if Europe could, as a bloc, come up with an alternative that's consistent across the Union; a strength-in-numbers move that would be more difficult for the US to counteract. But the UK, post-Brexit, would be on its own - and needs to stay in Washington's good graces. The US reaction to France's digital services tax suggests it would not go down well if the UK were to follow suit. Earlier this year, US firms were at pains to make it clear to the US Trade Representative that any such UK digital tax would be a big concern for them, with some even suggesting it would need to be dealt with before trade negotiations could go ahead. The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam says the issue has split the UK government, with some in the current cabinet believing the tech tax would be an obstacle to a future US trade deal. While the matter has not yet been openly discussed, in the recently leaked trade documents UK negotiators clearly anticipate that the issue would emerge during later parts of the process. The US technology sector has welcomed the Trump administration's tougher stance, although it still hopes for a negotiated settlement before the tariffs are imposed. Jennifer McCloskey, vice-president for policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include the major US tech firms, said the French tax was ""discriminatory"" and welcomed the USTR's ""strong trade response"". However, the US move has unnerved investors. Mr Lighthizer's comment that he sees the French tax as part of a ""growing protectionism of EU member states,"" raised concerns that this latest spat could be part of a wider trade war with the EU that has drawn in car companies and planemaker Airbus. Shares in leading French luxury-goods companies fell on Tuesday, with LVMH, Kering and Hermes down 1.4% to 1.5% in early trading. Some US business lobby groups have warned against tariffs because of fears of escalating another trade fight, despite their opposition to the French law. The US Chamber of Commerce, for example, had said tariffs ""may elicit additional rounds of retaliatory measures that represent a substantial risk to US economic growth and job creation"".

"US troops on a Nato exercise in Lithuania in June 2018 Turkey has said it will oppose a Nato defence plan for Baltic countries, exposing tensions in the alliance ahead of a summit for its 70th anniversary. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants the military bloc to recognise the groups Turkey is fighting as terrorists but members are reluctant to do so. Last month, the French president angered some countries by suggesting the alliance is ""brain dead"". The UK prime minister is set to call for unity at the meeting near London. As host of the two-day meeting, Boris Johnson is expected to reiterate the importance of Nato staying united, calling it ""the cornerstone of Euro-Atlantic security"" that helps ""keep a billion people safe"", his spokesman said. Troubled Nato not in party mood What does the US do for Nato? UK election: Corbyn tells Trump no trade deal if NHS included Tensions have grown since the election of US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly complained that Europe's Nato countries are not contributing enough to the bloc, created to counter the threat of post-World War Two communist expansion. The summit takes place as President Trump faces an impeachment inquiry at home and eyes a re-election campaign next year. At the same time, the UK will hold a general election next week amid its complicated Brexit process. Nato members pledge to come to the aid of one another should any of the 29 allies come under attack. Ahead of his departure from Ankara to London, Mr Erdogan said Turkey would not approve a plan to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the event of a Russian attack unless Nato recognises the Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists. The YPG lead the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), key allies of the US-led coalition against the Islamic State group in Syria. In October, Turkey launched an operation in Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Syria to create a ""security zone"" along its border. ""If our friends at Nato don't recognise as terrorist organisations those we consider terrorist organisations... we will stand against any step that will be taken there,"" he said about the plan. This video can not be played Nato explained in 80 seconds That military action deepened fractures between Turkey and other Nato members and took place after President Trump controversially pulled US forces out of the region reportedly without consulting allies. In an interview last month,French President Emmanuel Macron described Nato as ""brain dead"", stressing what he saw as a waning commitment to the transatlantic alliance by its main guarantor - Washington. Last Friday, Mr Erdogan hit back, suggesting that Mr Macron was in fact the one who was ""brain dead"". He accused him of ""a sick and shallow understanding"" of terrorism. President Macron had also angered Turkey by in November hosting an official from the SDF. Both Mr Macron and Mr Erdogan will be attending the Nato event and will be hosted, alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, by Mr Johnson at Downing Street on Tuesday. Will Mr Erdogan (left) and Mr Macron try to soothe the row? Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Trump said Mr Macron's statement was ""very, very nasty"", adding: ""You just can't go around making statements like that about Nato. It's very disrespectful"". He arrived in the UK on Mondayahead of a reception to be hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening. Mr Trump is set to hold separate talks with the German and French leaders, and Nato's secretary-general. Turkey is posing a major and developing problem for Nato; a problem that if not resolved, could test the very boundaries of its membership. It is effectively holding hostage a response plan for the rapid reinforcement of the Baltic region - which must be approved by all 29 Nato members - until it gets what it wants in its own region. Turkey wants all other Nato countries to regard Kurdish separatist groups in Turkey as terrorists. This would effectively take Nato into domestic security matters which most allies see as none of their business. Add to this Turkey's unilateral actions in Syria; President Erdogan's recent row with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron over the Kurds; and Turkey's purchase of a sophisticated Russian air defence system - an extraordinary step for a key Nato player - and you are well on the way to a full-blown crisis between Ankara and the alliance. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is the world's most powerful regional defence alliance It was set up in 1949, after World War Two, amid anxiety at Soviet expansion It was founded on the principle of collective defence between allies Originally had 12 members, but now has 29 Read more about Nato ""The PM's position is that Nato is the most enduring and successful alliance in military history and that it continues to adapt to the evolving threats that we face,"" the prime minister's spokesman added. ""The PM will emphasise that all members must be united behind shared priorities so Nato can adapt to the challenges ahead."" Another key division is over the countries' contributions. Nato estimates for 2019 showthere are now eight countries - in addition to the US - meeting the targetagreed by all Nato members to spend 2% or more of their gross domestic product (GDP, a measure of economic output) on defence. Mr Stoltenberg said on Friday that by 2020, European allies and Canada would have invested $130bn (Â£100bn) more since 2016, the year President Trump was elected. What is Nato for? In 80 secs.

The Last Leg's Alex Brooker will tackle ""the true nature of his disability for the first time"" in Disability And Me. Meanwhile, actor and writer Mat Fraser will curate ""challenging"" monologues, all performed by someone with a disability. Comedy Jerk, which follows a man who knows having cerebral palsy means he can get away with almost anything, will return for a new series. This disabled comedian is a Jerk Visual impairment no barrier to pantomime star 'I never thought I'd be presenting' Announcing the ""concerted drive to go further on representation"" in 2020, the BBC also said there would include better ""incidental and integrated"" representation in existing shows.

Disabled panellists will also appear on Celebrity Mastermind and Would I Lie To You? Frank Gardner will front Being Frank, 16 years after he was shot by al-Qaeda gunmen in Saudi Arabia The broadcaster has also put forward new measures to give disabled people more opportunities behind the scenes. A scheme called BBC Elevate is designed to allow production staff to get experience on hit shows like Strictly Come Dancing, The Apprentice and EastEnders. It is intended to ""make a tangible difference to the careers of many talented disabled people in TV, who face some particular challenges with progression"", the corporation said. Alison Kirkham, controller of factual commissioning, said the industry ""hasn't always done enough to offer opportunities for disabled people and so has missed out on their talent"". ""We want to set the bar forever higher, for the entire industry, both with off-screen talent and on-screen representation,"" she said. Disabled workers suffer pay penalty How to talk about disability without being awkward The BBC has committed to increasing the number of disabled people in its workforce to 12% by 2022. The latest official figure, from March 2018, stood at 10.4%. The broadcaster will also introduce a ""BBC Passport"" to ensure staff with disabilities get the right support when they change jobs. Disability equality charity Scope welcomed the BBC's commitment, which was made on International Day Of People With Disabilities on Tuesday. ""Disability remains hugely underrepresented on our screens and behind the scenes, particularly as one in five people are disabled,"" Scope's head of communications Warren Kirwan said. ""When disabled people don't see themselves represented, talent and potential go unrecognised and negative attitudes and stigma goes unchallenged."" Awareness of  how the media portrays disabilityhas grown in recent years. This ranges from theincreasingly vocal outcryover non-disabled actors playing characters with disabilities to the embracing of Paddy Smyth, recent winner of reality show The Circle, who openly addressed his cerebral palsy throughout. This means the BBC's commitment is timely, spurred on as it is by last year'sdamning industry representation findings. It also marks a natural progression at a time when The Travel Show host and ex-Paralympian Ade Adepitan recently visited Africa to front an eponymous prime-time series for BBC Two, alongside his Children in Need presenting duties. While it is one thing to use recognised disabled talent for disability-related stories, the true test will be how deep-rooted and wide-reaching the integration becomes. How much narrative control will be afforded to journalists who live the stories we want to tell? How far will disability representation seep into mainstream storylines, and how many disabled staff will become permanent fixtures off screen? As a journalist who entered the BBC through itsExtend scheme,externaltwo years ago, I am aware of the efforts being made. This latest commitment marks a promising start for broader change, but there's more work to do. And disabled talent needs to be trusted to lead this change across the industry as a whole, not simply be a part of it. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Phu Tran was found alive on Tuesday in Australia's Northern Territory A second person has been found alive two weeks after becoming stranded in Australia's outback. Phu Tran, 40, was discovered on Tuesday on a remote farm in the Northern Territory (NT), police said. Mr Tran was part of a trio who became stranded when their car got stuck in a riverbed on 19 November. They later split up to find help. Tamra McBeath-Riley, 52, was found on Sunday, but her partner, 46-year-old Claire Hockridge, remains missing. Mr Tran was found by a farmer who was performing checks on the vast property - known locally as a station - about 160km (100 miles) south of the town of Alice Springs, NT Police said. Woman survives 12 days in outback on groundwater He had survived by finding groundwater and would be treated for heat exposure in hospital, they added. ""If you believe in miracles, I'm saying it's a miracle,"" Supt Pauline Vicary said. The group and Ms McBeath-Riley's dog, Raya, had been travelling from Alice Springs to go on a hike when they became bogged in the Hugh River. Ms McBeath-Riley said the group had stayed by the car for around three days in an attempt to free it. The group became stranded in the remote Northern Territory ""We tried many times to try to get out, but just couldn't get out, the river was just too large,"" she told reporters outside hospital on Monday. ""During the day it's just really hot so we dug ourselves under the car. At night [we] could sleep in the car."" They used up all their supplies of water, as well as some vodka drinks, biscuits and beef noodles they had in the car. They eventually found a watering hole, and boiled the ""quite dirty"" water before sieving it through a shirt, police said. The group eventually decided to split up to get help. Mr Tran and Ms Hockridge planned to head towards a highway, while Ms McBeath-Riley stayed in the area, thinking her dog would not survive a long walk. Police despatched helicopters to search for the trio. They spotted Ms McBeath-Riley about 1.5km (0.9 miles) away from the car area after a local resident reported seeing tyre tracks. Mr Tran was discovered about 12km from the vehicle, two days after he and Ms Hockridge had separated after finding the station's fence. ""He decided to follow the fence line, and he left her there,""Supt Vicary was quoting as saying by the NT News,external. ""He continued to walk along the fence line for two days and approached the pastoralist [farmer] today and the first thing he did was get some water."" Tamra McBeath-Riley and her dog Raya had been on a drive to the outback Mr Tran was ""slightly disoriented"" but had been given food by the farmer and appeared to be in good spirits, she added. Police said Mr Tran's account had further narrowed down their search area for Ms Hockridge, adding it was unclear if she still had water. ""It's quite a diverse terrain - there's sandy dunes, there's hard clay, there's areas of dense trees but there is also rocks and ranges in the area as well,"" Supt Vicary told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday.

"US troops on a Nato exercise in Lithuania in June 2018 Turkey has said it will oppose a Nato defence plan for Baltic countries, exposing tensions in the alliance ahead of a summit for its 70th anniversary. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants the military bloc to recognise the groups Turkey is fighting as terrorists but members are reluctant to do so. Last month, the French president angered some countries by suggesting the alliance is ""brain dead"". The UK prime minister is set to call for unity at the meeting near London. As host of the two-day meeting, Boris Johnson is expected to reiterate the importance of Nato staying united, calling it ""the cornerstone of Euro-Atlantic security"" that helps ""keep a billion people safe"", his spokesman said. Troubled Nato not in party mood What does the US do for Nato? UK election: Corbyn tells Trump no trade deal if NHS included Tensions have grown since the election of US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly complained that Europe's Nato countries are not contributing enough to the bloc, created to counter the threat of post-World War Two communist expansion. The summit takes place as President Trump faces an impeachment inquiry at home and eyes a re-election campaign next year. At the same time, the UK will hold a general election next week amid its complicated Brexit process. Nato members pledge to come to the aid of one another should any of the 29 allies come under attack. Ahead of his departure from Ankara to London, Mr Erdogan said Turkey would not approve a plan to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the event of a Russian attack unless Nato recognises the Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists. The YPG lead the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), key allies of the US-led coalition against the Islamic State group in Syria. In October, Turkey launched an operation in Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Syria to create a ""security zone"" along its border. ""If our friends at Nato don't recognise as terrorist organisations those we consider terrorist organisations... we will stand against any step that will be taken there,"" he said about the plan. This video can not be played Nato explained in 80 seconds That military action deepened fractures between Turkey and other Nato members and took place after President Trump controversially pulled US forces out of the region reportedly without consulting allies. In an interview last month,French President Emmanuel Macron described Nato as ""brain dead"", stressing what he saw as a waning commitment to the transatlantic alliance by its main guarantor - Washington. Last Friday, Mr Erdogan hit back, suggesting that Mr Macron was in fact the one who was ""brain dead"". He accused him of ""a sick and shallow understanding"" of terrorism. President Macron had also angered Turkey by in November hosting an official from the SDF. Both Mr Macron and Mr Erdogan will be attending the Nato event and will be hosted, alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, by Mr Johnson at Downing Street on Tuesday. Will Mr Erdogan (left) and Mr Macron try to soothe the row? Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Trump said Mr Macron's statement was ""very, very nasty"", adding: ""You just can't go around making statements like that about Nato. It's very disrespectful"". He arrived in the UK on Mondayahead of a reception to be hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening. Mr Trump is set to hold separate talks with the German and French leaders, and Nato's secretary-general. Turkey is posing a major and developing problem for Nato; a problem that if not resolved, could test the very boundaries of its membership. It is effectively holding hostage a response plan for the rapid reinforcement of the Baltic region - which must be approved by all 29 Nato members - until it gets what it wants in its own region. Turkey wants all other Nato countries to regard Kurdish separatist groups in Turkey as terrorists. This would effectively take Nato into domestic security matters which most allies see as none of their business. Add to this Turkey's unilateral actions in Syria; President Erdogan's recent row with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron over the Kurds; and Turkey's purchase of a sophisticated Russian air defence system - an extraordinary step for a key Nato player - and you are well on the way to a full-blown crisis between Ankara and the alliance. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is the world's most powerful regional defence alliance It was set up in 1949, after World War Two, amid anxiety at Soviet expansion It was founded on the principle of collective defence between allies Originally had 12 members, but now has 29 Read more about Nato ""The PM's position is that Nato is the most enduring and successful alliance in military history and that it continues to adapt to the evolving threats that we face,"" the prime minister's spokesman added. ""The PM will emphasise that all members must be united behind shared priorities so Nato can adapt to the challenges ahead."" Another key division is over the countries' contributions. Nato estimates for 2019 showthere are now eight countries - in addition to the US - meeting the targetagreed by all Nato members to spend 2% or more of their gross domestic product (GDP, a measure of economic output) on defence. Mr Stoltenberg said on Friday that by 2020, European allies and Canada would have invested $130bn (Â£100bn) more since 2016, the year President Trump was elected. What is Nato for? In 80 secs.

"This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have very different accounts of what happened in March 2001 - so how do they differ? Five women who accuse Jeffrey Epstein of abusing them say Prince Andrew witnessed how people were given massages at the sex offender's homes. The lawyer for the women has toldBBC Panoramahe plans to serve subpoenas to force the Duke of York to testify as a witness in all five cases. He says the prince could have important information about sex trafficking. The prince says he did not witness or suspect any suspicious behaviour during visits to Epstein's homes. Epstein took his own life in a jail cellin August, aged 66, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The lawyer for victims of the US financier, David Boies, said: ""One of the things that we have tried is to interview Prince Andrew and to try to get what his explanation is. He was a frequent visitor. They ought to submit to an interview. They ought to talk about it."" The subpoenas - court summonses to give testimony - have been prepared for all five cases and would have to be signed off by a judge once the prince was on US soil. He would then be able to challenge the subpoena in court if he did not want to give evidence. Another lawyer, Spencer Kuvin, who questioned Epstein a decade ago and now represents several of his unnamed alleged victims, made a personal plea for Prince Andrew to give a sworn testimony. ""Be a man, stand up for what you believe and what you're saying is the truth and come forward,"" said Mr Kuvin on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Kuvin said he is not planning to serve a subpoena but added: ""If he truly wants to help these victims, then step forward."" Letter casts doubt on when duke met Epstein Six things we learned from the duke's interview Panorama also uncovered new information about the infamous photo of Prince Andrew with his arm around 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre - then called Virginia Roberts. She said that she, the prince, Epstein and his then girlfriend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, went to Tramp nightclub in London. Ms Giuffre said that in the car on the way back ""Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey and that just made me sick"". When they got back to the house, she said she asked Epstein to take a picture of her to show her family. She then carried out the instructions to entertain the prince. ""Well there was a bath and it started there and then it led into the bedroom and it didn't last very long, the whole entire procedure. ""It was disgusting. He wasn't mean or anything, but he got up and he said thanks and walked out."" Prince Andrew emphatically denies any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Giuffre and says any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation. He said he has no recollection of ever meeting her. On Tuesday, lawyer Lisa Bloom - who represents five other Epstein accusers - told ITV's This Morning that she has a witness who says she was at Tramp nightclub on the night when the alleged incident happened, and ""saw Prince Andrew with Virginia"". ""She remembers it vividly because she was told 'this is a member of the Royal Family',"" said Ms Bloom. ""That was a very big thing to her, she was shocked and she saw Virginia there with him and so I'm going to take her to the FBI."" Virginia Giuffre describes how she asked Jeffrey Epstein to take this picture of her with Andrew The photo of them together was first published in 2011 after the Mail on Sunday tracked down Ms Giuffre and paid her $160,000 for her story. This year palace sources started suggesting the photo was a fake - but Prince Andrew stopped just short of that inhis interview with BBC Newsnight. He said: ""You can't prove whether or not that photograph is faked because it's a photograph of a photograph of a photograph."" ""It's very difficult to be able to prove it but I don't remember that photograph being taken. That's me but whether that's my handâ¦ I have simply no recollection of the photograph ever being taken."" The prince also said he thought he had never been upstairs in his friend Ghislaine Maxwell's house, where the photo appears to have been taken. But Ms Giuffre told Panorama the photo is genuine and she gave the original to the FBI in 2011. ""I think the world is getting sick of these ridiculous excuses. It's a real photo,"" she said. ""I've given it to the FBI for their investigation and it's an authentic photo. There's a date on the back of it from when it was printed."" She said the date on the back of the photo is 13 March 2001 - two days after she left London on her trip with Epstein and Ms Maxwell. Panorama also spoke to the freelance photographer Michael Thomas who first copied the picture in 2011. He is convinced the picture is genuine because he found it in the middle of a bundle of photos that Ms Giuffre handed him from her travels with Epstein and Ms Maxwell. He said: ""It was nothing sophisticated. These were 5x7 photos that looked like they had come from Boots the chemist. They were typical teenage snaps."" The programme also found evidence that supports Ms Giuffre's claim that she gave the original to the FBI. A redacted court document shows she gave 20 photos to the FBI in 2011 and they were scanned front and back. But there are only 19 photos shown in the public version. Panorama has been told the Prince Andrew photo was removed from the public document to protect his privacy. The news that five women say that Prince Andrew witnessed Epstein and his guests receiving massages and have prepared subpoenas should he travel to the US is bad for the prince on several fronts. He says he had at no time seen, witnessed or suspected suspicious behaviour at Epstein residences. This flatly contradicts that. The existence of subpoenas - court-backed demands for sworn testimony - makes any visit to the US by the prince vanishingly unlikely.  It's pretty extraordinary:  the Queen's second son is now effectively unable to travel to the US, unless he fancies being forced to give a deposition. The subpoenas can be challenged, but it would be a huge risk getting embroiled in the US legal system. This news, and the rest of the programme, with a powerful interview by Virginia Giuffre, puts Prince Andrew, his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and his denials, back into the spotlight. The controversy refuses to go away; instead, it grows. Another Epstein victim, Sarah Ransome told Panorama Ghislaine Maxwell, one of Prince Andrew's oldest friends, worked hand in hand with Epstein. ""Ghislaine controlled the girls. She was like the Madam,"" she said. ""She was like the nuts and bolts of the sex trafficking operation and she would always visit Jeffrey on the island to make sure the girls were doing what they were supposed to be doing. ""She knew what Jeffrey liked. She worked and helped maintain Jeffrey's standard by intimidation, by intimidating the girls, so this was very much a joint effort."" Ms Maxwell could not be reached for comment but has previously denied any involvement in or knowledge of Epstein's abuse. Allegations of sex abuse against her were first made  public in court documents in 2009, but Prince Andrew has maintained the friendship. Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell attended Ascot in June 2000. Panorama uncovered an email from 2015 which suggests he even asked for Ms Maxwell's help in dealing with Virginia Giuffre's claims. She was known at the time by her maiden name Virginia Roberts. In the email the prince told Ms Maxwell: ""Let me know when we can talk. Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts."" She replied: ""Have some info. Call me when you have a moment."" Prince Andrew declined to answer Panorama's detailed questions but he said in a statement that he deplores the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour. ""The Duke of York unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein's suicide left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims. The duke deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure. ""It is his hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. The duke is willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.""
