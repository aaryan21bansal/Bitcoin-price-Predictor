"The rate at which the Covid-19 virus is spreading appears to be speeding up. The R number, indicating how fast the coronavirus epidemic is growing, has risen from 1.1-1.4 to 1.2-1.5. An Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey estimated there were 9,600 new cases a day in England in the week to 19 September - up from 6,000 the week before and three times that being picked up by general testing. It comes as more restrictions come into effect in parts of England and Wales. On Friday, the daily number of positive cases in the UK picked up by coronavirus testing rose to a new high of 6,874,government figures show.,external A further 34 deaths were announced, although figures were not available for Scotland because of a power cut at the National Records of Scotland. Infection rates are highest in the north west of England and in London. As infection rates rise, new restrictions are being brought into effect in the following areas: Cardiff and the county of Swanseawill go into lockdown at 18:00 BST on Sunday- 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli In Leeds, Stockport, Wigan and Blackpooldifferent households will be banned from meeting in private homes or gardensfrom midnight on Friday London has been added to the government's Covid-19 watch-list, meaning all of its boroughs are now classed as ""areas of concern"" but will not yet have additional restrictions An R or reproduction number above one means the epidemic is growing. It's a measure of how many extra people each coronavirus case is infecting, In March, before any control measures were put in place, R was thought to be just under three. The ONS's estimates of how much of the population is currently infected are based on testing a representative sample of people with or without symptoms. It is different to the number published daily by the Department of Health and Social Care. That records positive cases in people with potential Covid symptoms who request tests. And in the week up to 19 September, the DHSC data showed roughly 3,000 positive tests a day in England - a total of 23,378. UK sees highest Covid cases since mass tests began UHow many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Is there a North-South infection divide in England? In contrast, the ONS survey suggest there were actually 103,600  people in England with the virus, equating to an estimated one in 500 people in private homes. The number does not include cases in hospitals and care homes. The ONS said there was ""clear evidence"" of an increase in the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in all age groups, but rates are currently highest in those aged 17-24. Infection rates are highest across the north of England and in London, with smaller increases seen in the Midlands. In Wales, cases appear to have risen dramatically but because there are fewer people in the sample, there is a lot of uncertainty around the precise figure. But central estimates suggest they could have risen almost seven-fold, from 1,500 people in total having Covid the previous week to more than 10,000. The ONS has also begun surveying people in Northern Ireland, where early figures suggest one in 300 people had the virus in the period 6-19 September. These figures only take us up to the end of last week, and as such may be an underestimate of the current situation. Cases have been rising over the past few weeks, and have begun to translate to a rise in hospital admissions. Data from the Covid Symptom Study app, run by King's College London and tech company ZOE, put the daily figure for England at 12,883 - higher than the ONS. Its figures are based on people who download and use the app, so it is not a random sample - but does include a larger number of positive tests. The ZOE figures are also more up to date than the ONS's and so may be capturing more recent rises. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

"Demand for coronavirus tests has almost trebled among young children in England this month - but only 1% were found to have the virus, figures show. In the first two weeks of September, more than 200,000 under-nines were tested, according to government's test-and-trace programme. That is nearly three times as many as in the previous fortnight. A large study review,externalhas also confirmed that children are less likely to be infected than adults. But the role that children and adolescents play in transmitting the virus ""remains unclear"", it said. Government figures reveal that in England demand for tests increased across all age groups under 40, but was particularly noticeable among the under-20s. Coronavirus: Children 'half as likely to catch it' Study shows Covid risk to schoolchildren is 'tiny' This sharp rise in demand coincided with children returning to school in England. Combined with an increase in cases among young people and lab testing capacity being reached, this put pressure on the system and led to delays in accessing tests. Only 1% of those children who had a test actually had the virus, compared with 3.5% in older age groups, including adolescents, and people in their 20s and 30s. Symptoms caused by colds and flu viruses shared around children who hadn't mixed for many months may have been a factor in the increased demand. As winter approaches, when respiratory viruses are common and the symptoms overlap with coronavirus, even greater demand could be created among younger age groups. But if children do become infected with the virus, they are at very low risk of becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19. Writing in JAMA Pediatrics, a UK-led research team found that children and adolescents under the age of 20 had 44% lower odds of being infected with Sars-CoV-2 - the scientific name given to the coronavirus - than adults over 20. This was particularly apparent in children younger than 10. This chimes with a previous finding that the under-20s are approximately half as susceptible to the virus as adults. Children's role in virus spread puzzles scientists Could reopening schools spread coronavirus? The latest review based its findings on 32 studies from 21 countries, mostly in East Asia and Europe, involving nearly 42,000 children and adolescents and 270,000 adults. But the researchers were not able to come to any conclusions on whether children were any less likely to pass on the virus than adults. Children are more likely to be asymptomatic when infected. The theory is that if they are not coughing or unwell with the virus, they are less likely to infect others. So their role in transmission may be down to their risk of exposure, the quantity of the virus, or viral load, they develop, their behaviour and the social contacts they make across age groups. The researchers said larger contact-tracing studies were needed to find out more about how the virus is spread by adults and children. Now that children throughout the UK are back at school, the need to understand this aspect of the virus is even more pressing.

"Neil is known as one of the BBC's most ferocious political interviewers Broadcaster Andrew Neil has paid tribute to the BBC after announcing he will be leaving after 25 years. The 71-year-old journalist is to become chairman of new TV channel GB News, which is due to launch early next year. He said he was leaving the BBC, where he has presented shows such as Daily Politics and helped front its election coverage, with a ""heavy heart"". The BBC said he had ""informed and entertained millions of viewers"" over the years. Neil's last appearance for the BBC will be in early November when he will help lead its coverage of the US presidential election. The former Sunday Times editor has been at the heart of the BBC's political coverage for the best part of three decades. As well as presenting Daily Politics and its successor Politics Live, he was the host of the popular late-night discussion show This Week for many years. Andrew Neil Show ends as BBC News unveils cuts His penetrating and often combative general election interviews with party leaders won him wide critical acclaim. He was involved in a row with Downing Street prior to last year's election when he publicly challenged Boris Johnson on air to appear on his show, saying his absence from the screens represented a ""question of trust"". The PM was the only one of the main party leaders not to be questioned by Neil. Earlier this year, the BBC said the weekly Andrew Neil Interview show, which had been broadcast since 2019, would not be recommissioned but it was in discussion with him about other formats.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson is supporting a new global vaccine-sharing scheme. The UK is to give Â£500m to a new global vaccine-sharing scheme designed to ensure treatments for Covid-19 are distributed fairly. Prime Minister Boris Johnson made the announcement in a speech to the United Nations general assembly. He called on world leaders to overcome their differences as he set out plans to prevent future global pandemics. He also promised extra funding for the World Health Organization. New coronavirus vaccine begins trials in the UK How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Mr Johnson told his foreign counterparts at the UN that the ""notion of the international community looks tattered"" after the Covid-19 crisis. He called for states to ""reach across borders and repair these ugly rifts"", as he announced a plan, developed with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and The Wellcome Trust, to help stop future pandemics. The proposals include developing a global network of ""zoonotic hubs"" to identify dangerous pathogens before they jump from animals to humans, as well as improving manufacturing capacity for treatments and vaccines. In a pre-recorded speech on Saturday afternoon, the prime minister said: ""After nine months of fighting Covid, the very notion of the international community looks tattered. ""We know that we cannot continue in this way. Unless we unite and turn our fire against our common foe, we know that everyone will lose. ""Now is the time, therefore, here at what I devoutly hope will be the first and last ever Zoom UNGA, for humanity to reach across borders and repair these ugly rifts. ""Here in the UK, the birthplace of Edward Jenner who pioneered the world's first vaccine, we are determined to do everything in our power to work with our friends across the UN to heal those divisions and to heal the world."" Other measures being proposed include designing a global pandemic early warning system, improving the ability to collect and analyse samples and distribute the findings. The plan also calls for common protocols to be agreed on sharing data. Mr Johnson is also proposing states reduce trade barriers on Covid-critical products, such as soap, to help the global response. The Â£500m in aid funding will go to the Covax vaccines procurement pool, which aims to help poorer countries access a coronavirus jab when one is developed. There are about 40 different coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials - including one being developed by the University of Oxford that is inan advanced stage of testing. A successful vaccine that can protect people from Covid-19 is still widely seen as the main exit strategy from the current restrictions on people's lives. However, Mr Johnson said ""we must never cut corners"" or ""sacrifice safety to speed"" in the search for a vaccine. ""Because it would be an absolute tragedy if, in our eagerness, we were to boost the nut-jobs - the anti-vaxers, dangerous obsessives who campaign against the whole concept of vaccination and who would risk further millions of lives,"" he said. The PM also promised Â£340m to the World Health Organization over the next four years - a 30% increase on the previous period, making the UK one of its biggest donors. Romilly Greenhill, UK director of The One Campaign, which fights extreme poverty and preventable disease, said the British government was showing ""powerful leadership"" at a moment when it ""could not be more important"". ""It will give the global fight against Covid-19 a shot in the arm, helping ensure everyone, everywhere can access a vaccine."" UK supports global vaccine-sharing scheme.

"A sign on a pub window warns customers of the curfew Police patrols have been stepped up across Scotland to ensure the smooth introduction of a new pub and restaurant curfew. All hospitality must now close at 22:00 in the latest raft of measures designed to halt Covid transmission. Scotland's chief constable promised extra policing as he urged citizens to act responsibly. He also issued a blunt warning that organising, hosting or attending house parties was now breaking the law. The Scottish government has revealed that 36% of positive cases handled by Test and Protect mention social exposure, through hospitality or socialising with friends and family. It said the aim of the measures was to reduce the amount of time people can spend in licensed premises and therefore curtail the spread of the virus in high risk environments while still allowing businesses to trade. Soaring infection rates have prompted the introduction of strict measures on the hospitality industry across the UK. Every pub has been ordered to observe the 22:00 curfew, with the threat of permanent closure for those who do not comply. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone from Police Scotland said extra patrols would be deployed around closing time to ensure the change was being adhered to. Curfew takes effect for bars and restaurants Scottish university students told not to go to pubs Curfew could be 'fatal blow' to some pubs and bars At Friday's Scottish government coronavirus briefing he said: ""Additional officers will be deployed across Scotland to support colleagues from local authorities and to monitor compliance. ""I think it's important for me to say that the vast majority of licensees have acted with great responsibility during this very challenging period - I pay credit to them and undertake that policing will continue to support and work with the licensed trade."" Chief Constable Iain Livingstone warned people that house parties were now illegal He said that officers would ""continue to use good sense"" when enforcing the new rules. He also issued a stark warning over the temptation to spill from the pub to a gathering within a house. The chief constable admitted that the curfew could see an increase in house parties or gatherings as customers refused to end their nights early. But he made it clear this would not be tolerated. He said: ""During this extraordinary time where people's freedoms, liberty and family relationships are subject to restrictions never seen before, it is right and proper that the police service looks to engage with people, explain what is required of them. ""If they refuse to do what their fellow citizens, their neighbours are doing, we will take enforcement action. ""What is absolutely clear is that house parties andhouse gatherings are not permitted under any circumstances, there can be no excuse for arranging or attending a house party. ""You must not organise, host or attend a house party or house gathering, it is against the law."" With local ""September weekend"" public holidays in many areas, the curfew marks one of a set of increased measures introduced to combat the rise of new infections. On Friday there were 558 new positive cases of coronavirus reported in Scotland since in the previous 24 hours - the highest daily total since the outbreak began. Of these, 255 were in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, where there has been a significant outbreak at University of Glasgow student accommodation Students were ordered to quarantine and stay away from pubs after an outbreak at Glasgow University's Murano Halls Students at all Scottish universities have beentold not to visit hospitality venuesthis weekend and Universities Scotland said students who go to parties or socialise with anyone outside their accommodationrisks losing their place at university.,external Universities will adopt a ""yellow card/red card"" approach to breaches of discipline, with students warned the consequences could include ""potential discontinuation of study"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she sympathised with students and she hoped disciplinary action would only be taken as a ""last resort"" against those who ""flagrantly"" broke the rules. The Scottish government also said it appreciated how difficult it was for pubs and other hospitality outlets, but that restrictions were based on the fundamental need to reduce transmissions. A spokeswoman said: ""Recent management information from our Covid-19 case management system suggests that around 36% of cases mention social/recreational exposure, including hospitality or socialising with friends/family. ""Although this data has many caveats and limitations, and therefore cannot prove causality in terms of where transmission has taken place, it does help guide our response to help prevent transmission in such settings."" The hospitality curfew comes a week after the ""rule of six"" came into effect in Scotland, limiting all gatherings, including those in pubs and restaurants, to no more than six adults from two households. Venues are also forbidden from playing background music, must enforce strict rules on hygiene and distancing, and record customers' details for track and trace data. Hospitality industry organisations said the latest restrictions were a ""potentially fatal blow"" for many business. Indoor visits between households are also banned across Scotland for the foreseeable future until the risk of transmission is reduced. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"This video can not be played ""Don't treat this weekend as a big blow-out"" Wales' two biggest cities will go into lockdown as part of new restrictions being imposed in three areas. Cardiff and the county of Swansea go into lockdown at 18:00 BST on Sunday, 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli. It means 1.5 million people, about half of Wales' population, will be under lockdown by the end of the weekend. But cases in Caerphilly, the first area to lockdown, have fallen significantly, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said. The restrictions will be the same as those already affecting people living in Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly, which are already in lockdown. Mr Gething said people in Cardiff and Swansea should not ""treat this weekend as a big blow-out"". He also said cases in Carmarthenshire had ""overwhelmingly"" been linked to Llanelli, with eight out of 10 cases there. ""In Llanelli we have a particular challenge around the town that is well identified, a significant spread that is not in control,"" he said at a Welsh Government press conference. ""We've spoken to the local authority, we've spoken to the local health board and we understand the need to act and act as soon as possible."" What can I do during local lockdowns? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Where do the 14.6 million people under new rules live?,external Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea council, said:  ""We have seen a rapid and sharp increase in the number of covid cases in Swansea during the past few weeks. ""So, like much of the population of Wales, we are now in a lockdown. This will mean changes to people's everyday lives but they will help to protect people and our communities."" He described a ""balanced judgement"" being taken that the rules should come into force in Cardiff and Swansea a day later to ""allow people to plan"". There will be nine areas of Wales under restrictions In the past seven days, 85 of 109 cases in Carmarthenshire have been in Llanelli where the rate of infection is 151.6 per 100,000 people, compared to 57.7 in the wider county. The Llanelli lockdown is the first not to cover a whole local authority area. A postcode finder will be made available online to make clear which areas are under lockdown, said Mr Gething. The majority of cases in Llanelli have been linked to people socialising without social distancing. Burry Port, which is also in Carmarthenshire, will not be included in the area under restrictions. Swansea has recorded 63.6 cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days, while Cardiff has recorded 46.1. The seven-day case rate for the whole of Wales is just shy of 57 per 100,000. Cardiff, Swansea and Llanelli are the latest areas to be locked down Meanwhile, cases of coronavirus have been traced to three pubs in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, with customers encouraged to look out for symptoms. PHW said a number of people had tested positive for the virus after visiting The Royal Oak in South Road, The Marine on the Esplanade and The Pier on the Esplanade on the evening of 11 September. Gemma Northey, chairwoman of the multi-agency incident management team for PHW, said anyone who has visited the pubs and been identified as a contact would be contacted by the Test, Trace, Protect team and given further advice. She said those who had visited the pubs and developed symptoms must self-isolate, along with any household members, and book a coronavirus test promptly, but those who were not symptomatic did not need to take action. The new restrictions mean people in lockdown can only shop in their own counties, or in the case of Llanelli, their own town. Mike Richards, who owns an antique shop in Llanelli, is angry the town has been singled out. ""It's totally unacceptable,"" he said. ""We're part of Carmarthenshire - the council are supposed to look after us and Carmarthen.Â ""We'd be goldfish bowls - local customers only - 60% of my trade is from outside Llanelli. I'll have to live with that but I'm not living with Carmarthen having their own way.Â ""With respect, everywhere else they've locked down an area. We'll be the first town to lock down. Why?"" Matteo Moruzzi says Verdi's cafe gets a lot of trade from outside of Swansea county Matteo Moruzzi, from Verdi's cafe in Mumbles, Swansea, said the lack of tourism would hit the business hard. He said: ""We don't just get people coming from other areas of Wales, but also England. ""We had people from Somerset call earlier who'd arranged to come next week but they can't come anymore. ""I think it will affect a lot of the trade. We prepared for the first lockdown but not so much for the local one."" As students return, Mr Gething said the effect on university towns will be monitored. He said: ""One of the things we'll need to do is to understand how the pattern is changing within those university towns and cities once students have been there for a period of time. ""At this point in time with a large movement of people across the UK, we need to understand what that does in terms of local prevalence so I don't think now is the time to make a definitive choice about what would happen in the end of your recess but it's an obvious question for us to consider."" Under the rules, nobody is able to enter or leave the eight counties and one townwithout a ""reasonable excuse"". People are allowed to travel to outside the area for a limited number of reasons. These include going to work if they are not able to work from home, to go to school, give care and buy food or medical supplies. Dr Keith Reid, executive director of public health at Swansea Bay health board, said: ""How long Swansea stays in local lockdown is entirely up to the people of Swansea. You have it in your gift to end this lockdown as early as possible and save lives."" Aside from the areas being locked down, Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales, said Vale of Glamorgan, Carmarthen, Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire and Flintshire were all ""areas of concern to us and we are watching the data from there carefully"". Ministers and officials said they would look at data over the weekend before deciding whether restrictions needed to be extended to Neath Port Talbot, Vale of Glamorgan and Torfaen, Mr Gething said. Meetings will also take place next week with council leaders in north Wales, where Mr Gething said the picture was ""more mixed"". Leader of Neath Port Talbot council, Rob Jones, said it was ""inevitable"" the county would follow neighbouring Swansea into local lockdown if cases continued to rise. Carmarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said: ""It is worrying to see how sharply the number of positive cases has risen in the Llanelli area, and action has had to be taken to help stop the spread and break the chain of infections concentrated in this area to prevent a whole county lockdown. ""We must all do the right thing, follow the advice and protect each other. In parts of Llanelli, we're asking people and businesses to make even greater sacrifices - we fully appreciate the impact this will have, but there is no other way. We must stop the spread.""

"The 54-year-old was a keen rugby union coach as well as being a fan of performance motorcycles and weight-training A long-serving police officer shot dead in a custody centre in south London has been named as Sgt Matiu Ratana. New Zealand-born Sgt Ratana, known as Matt, was shot in the chest in Croydon as a suspect, who was still in handcuffs, was being checked in. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick described the 54-year-old as ""talented officer"" who was ""big in heart"". After the shooting at about 02:15 BST the suspect, 23, is then thought to have shot himself. This video can not be played Dame Cressida Dick paid tribute to Sgt Ratana, saying he was ""big in stature, big in heart"" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the man was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class B drugs with intent to supply and possession of ammunition. He is currently in a critical condition in hospital. Police officers have been arriving at Croydon Police Station to pay their respects The IOPC confirmed he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back and had been taken to the custody centre in a police vehicle, before being escorted into the building. The shots were fired as officers prepared to search the suspect, who was still handcuffed, with a metal detector, the IOPC said. ""A non-police issue firearm, which appears to be a revolver, has been recovered from the scene. Further ballistic work will be required,"" said IOPC regional director Sal Naseem. This video can not be played Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Home Secretary Priti Patel joined Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick for a minute's silence A minute's silence was held at 16:00 BST at New Scotland Yard and Croydon Police Station to pay tribute to Sgt Ratana, who was heavily involved in rugby coaching when he was not working. He would have been eligible for retirement in just two months. ""Matt spent very nearly 30 years as a uniformed police officer serving the public of London,"" said Dame Cressida. ""He will be remembered so fondly in Croydon and missed there, as well as in the Met and the rugby world,"" she said. She added that he ""leaves a partner and he leaves an adult son from a previous relationship. Our thoughts are with them."" Sgt Ratana joined the Met in 1991, having moved to the UK in 1989. He was originally from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand and was educated at Palmerston North Boy's High School's, a town north of the capital, Wellington. The officer has been described as a professional and inspirational colleague He served in various parts of London including Hackney and Selhurst, with his last posting as custody sergeant in Croydon, where he managed suspects who are brought into the cells. ""He worked in our detention command at Croydon but frequently volunteered for duty in custody suites across London,"" Dame Cressida added. Sgt Ratana had led rugby teams in Worthing, close to Goring-by-Sea where he then lived and in East Grinstead, where he was living when he died. Ryan Morlen, assistant head coach at East Grinstead Rugby Club, described him as ""an absolutely lovely bloke"". ""He is a bloke who is just so passionate about what he does - it does not matter whether you're the most talented or least talented, he will treat you equal,"" he said. Sgt Ratana had taken part in weightlifting competitions Earlier, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was believed the suspect was known to counter-terrorism police. He had been referred to the anti-extremism ""Prevent"" programme, though the Met said the murder inquiry was not being treated as terrorism-related. Croydon police shooting: Mourners pay tribute Police officer shot dead at custody centre The Met said a murder investigation was under way, but the shooting was not being treated as a counter-terrorism incident. Dame Cressida said she understood ""the great concern about how this happened"" and that officers ""will establish the facts"". ""We owe it to Matt, his loved ones and all other officers. But we need to give investigators space to do their job,"" she said. London's Mayor Sadiq Khan earlier said the police were currently ""reviewing the safety of custody suites"" and ""there could be changes very soon"". Tributes have been left outside Croydon Police Station Police officers and members of the public have been arriving at Croydon Police Station during the day to lay tributes. The owner of a gym in Lancing, Sussex, told the BBC how Sgt Ratana had helped when his business was going through financial difficulty. Neil Donohue, 54, said: ""He came in one day and gave me 200 quid out of the blue, I said no no, I can't accept that and gave it back to him. ""But the next day he wired it into my account. That's the sort of guy he was."" Sgt Ratana joined the Met in 1991 A number of police officers have been turning their social media profile pictures black with a blue stripe to pay their respects. John Davies, a retired officer who worked with Sgt Ratana when he was based in Hillingdon, said he was ""a truly remarkable, strong and unique individual"" who ""left an impression on all those he came into contact with"". East Grinstead RFC also released a tribute to their ""much-loved"" head coach. ""Matt was an inspiring and much-loved figure at the club and there are truly no words to describe how we are feeling,"" said Bob Marsh, the club's chairman, and the club's president Andy Poole.

"The attack happened outside the former offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo Seven people have been detained in connection with an attack outside the former offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, officials say. A man armed with a meat cleaver wounded two people in the attack on Friday. The main suspect, identified as an 18-year-old man of Pakistani origin, was arrested near the scene. Police said six others were in custody and being questioned. The attack is being treated as a terrorist incident. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said it was ""clearly an act of Islamist terrorism"". He said police had underestimated the threat level in the area. The attack came as a high-profile trial was under way of 14 people accused of helping two jihadists carry out the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were killed. Charlie Hebdo vacated its offices after the 2015 attack, and the building is now used by a television production company. The two victims of Friday's attack have not been officially named but police said they were a man and woman who worked at the production company. Prime Minister Jean Castex told reporters at the scene - near Boulevard Richard-Lenoir - that their lives were not in danger. Charlie Hebdo's head of HR 'forced out of home' Charlie Hebdo is now run from a secret location. In an interview with state broadcaster France 2 late on Friday, Mr Darmanin described the stabbing as ""a new bloody attack against our country, against journalists"". ""It's the street where Charlie Hebdo used to be. This is the way the Islamist terrorists operate,"" the interior minister said. He said he had ordered security to be stepped up around synagogues this weekend for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The main suspect has not been named, but Mr Darmanin said he arrived in the country three years ago ""as an isolated minor"" of Pakistani nationality. The minister added that the suspect was not known for being radicalised, but had a previous arrest for carrying a screwdriver - and gave no details. Colleagues of the victims said they had been outside the Premieres Lignes news production agency smoking a cigarette when they were attacked. The firm has offices Rue Nicolas Appert, a street off Boulevard Richard-Lenoir where Charlie Hebdo's offices used to be located. A mural honouring those killed in the January 2015 attack is nearby. ""I went to the window and saw a colleague, bloodied, being chased by a man with a machete,"" one employee, who asked not to be named, said. ""They were both very badly wounded,"" Paul Moreira, the founder and co-head of Premieres Lignes, told AFP news agency. A local trader, who took this photo of a victim being treated, said there was panic outside his store Police quickly sealed off the area and a blade - described as a machete or a meat cleaver - was recovered nearby. The main suspect was arrested on the nearby Place de la Bastille. Shortly afterwards a 33-year-old Algerian national was also taken into custody over possible links to the attack. Five others - born between 1983 and 1996 and said to be of Pakistani origin - were later detained during the search of property north of Paris believed to be the home of the main suspect, officials say. French Prime Minister Jean Castex visited the scene flanked by Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo In a tweet, Charlie Hebdo expressed its ""support and solidarity with its former neighbours... and the people affected by this odious attack"". Charlie Hebdo marked the start of the trial earlier this month by reprinting its controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The original cartoons had sparked anger and protests in several Muslim majority countries. In response to the reprinting, the militant group al-Qaeda - which claimed the 2015 attack - renewed its threat against the magazine. The magazine's head of human resources said earlier this week thatshe had moved out of her home after receiving death threats. The defendants are also accused of helping another jihadist carry out related attacks, killing four people. The 17 victims were killed over a period of three days. All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead. On 7 January that year, two French Muslim gunmen - brothers ChÃ©rif and SaÃ¯d Kouachi - stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices Rue Nicolas-Appert before opening fire on its staff. The editor, StÃ©phane Charbonnier, better known as Charb, was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed. A mural in tribute to those killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack was erected on the Rue Nicolas-Appert The gunmen were eventually killed by security forces after a manhunt. Their victims were eight journalists, two police officers, a caretaker and a visitor. In a related attack just days later, jihadist gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed three customers and an employee in a hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket in the east of Paris. He had earlier shot dead a policewoman in the city. Security forces eventually stormed the supermarket before killing him and freeing the remaining hostages.

"This video can not be played Student Joe Gallagher believes the outbreak was ""inevitable"" About 1,700 university students have been told to self-isolate after 127 tested positive for Covid-19. Students at two Manchester Metropolitan University accommodation blocks have been told to stay in their rooms for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms. Students said ""police and security were outside"" and self-isolation had ""left morale really low"". A university spokesman said disciplinary action will be taken against any breaches. The restrictions affect students in accommodation blocks at Birley campus and Cambridge Halls after  ""127 students have tested positive with a number of others symptomatic or self-isolating"", Manchester City Council said. Students across the cityhave been urgedto attend virtual freshers' events and avoid big parties. But some said they had no warning of a lockdown and are now trapped in halls of residence. Students at two accommodation blocks are self-isolating for a fortnight Megan Tingy, who studies at Manchester Metropolitan, said on Friday ""We were getting ready to go out and looked out to security and police outside the halls. They say we can't leave. ""We haven't received any emails from university about this and they seem to be holding us in against our will."" Student Trisha Kakooza, who is from London, said: ""We had eight hours to go get food to last us for two weeks. ""We have to get any other food delivered, which is expensive. ""I have a job and it helps me make extra money since student finance isn't enough but now I can't go out to work. ""We can study remotely but I won't get paid by the agency I work for."" Police break up parties at student halls Students told to isolate after 124 test positive Covid 'cluster' linked to university sports teams 'Critical moment' as students return to university Chip Wilson, 19, said: ""We have been told we are not allowed to leave and, if we do, we cannot come back, so now we are all stuck inside. ""On top of all this, many of us here have Covid symptoms but we cannot get tests. We can only get drive-through tests and none of us have cars, and even if we did we can't leave now."" Most parts of Greater Manchester have beensubject to stricter restrictions,externalsince July after a spike in coronavirus cases. The rate has also doubled in the city of Manchester to 1,026 positive tests in the week up to 22 September, compared to 515 cases in the previous week. The lockdown comes asstudents in Scotlandwere told not to go to pubs, parties or restaurants this weekend in to stem the spread of the virus. NHS staff hand out test kits to Glasgow University students, who are also subject to restrictions Joe Barnes, who recently started at Manchester Metropolitan University, told BBC Breakfast that self-isolation had ""left the morale of my flat really low"". He said lessons were being conducted online ""so theoretically I could go and study from home but that defeats the point - I've not just come for my studies but to meet new people and enjoy the experience."" He added: ""I've heard horror stories of massive parties in some of the halls around hereâ¦ it is just frustrating that no one else could have foreseen that."" The National Union of Students said affected students should be able ""to return to their families if they wish, as being trapped in university accommodation will only add anxiety at an already difficult time"". ""All students affected must be supported by their universities with food deliveries, shopping and access to mental health services if needed,"" a spokesperson said. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said the Manchester incident was ""the latest catastrophe in a week where wholly predictable - and predicted - Covid outbreaks have caused havoc on campuses across the UK"". ""We warned last month of the problems with moving thousands of students across the country and the time has come for urgent action from ministers and universities to protect staff and students."" She urged university leaders to drop face-to-face classes until the government improves the test-and-trace system. A university spokesman said: ""We are fully supportive of the [lockdown] decision. ""Services such as wellbeing support and the library will remain available to our students online. ""Our security teams will increase patrols to support the lockdown and we will take disciplinary action against any students found to have breached requirements."" Councillor Bev Craig, executive member for adult health and wellbeing for the city council, said: ""We understand that local residents may be concerned about this situation. ""We want to reassure them that the evidence so far suggests that transmission has been within the student community only and has not been more widespread.""

"Anti-racism protesters threw the statue of slave trader Edward Colston into Bristol harbour in June Public statues of controversial historical figures should be ""retained and explained"" instead of being taken down, the government has said. Culture Minister Matt Warman told MPs the UK's heritage should not be removed from view ""however contentious"". The toppling of slave trader Edward Colston's statue in Bristol in June, during Black Lives Matter protests, led to a fierce debate on the issue. Mr Warman said statues played a role in ""teaching us about the past"". In the government's first official policy statement about the issue, he told the Commons ministers believed in the ""right to retain statues however contentious"". A number of memorials to wealthy merchants who profited from the slave trade were removed this summer during a wave of anti-racism protests in the UK sparked by the murder of George Floyd in the US. A statue of the slave owner and philanthropistEdward Colston was torn downand thrown into Bristol harbourwhile a monument to Robert Milligan, an 18th Century Scottish merchant, was removed from London's Docklands and taken to a museum. Why we need a say over public statues Oxford Rhodes statue staying until next year National Trust details colonialism and slave links How many statues of black people does the UK have? Other institutions came under pressure to act, with the governing body of Oxford's Oriel College saying it backed the removal of a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes from its main building pending a review of its future. There have been calls for statues of other major historical figures, including Sir Robert Clive and Sir Francis Drake, to be taken down as part of a reappraisal of the UK's colonial history. Labour-controlled councils across England have been carrying out an audit of statues on their land, while the National Trust recently outlined all its properties' historical links to the Atlantic slave trade and British Empire. The statue of Cecil Rhodes in Oxford will stay in place until a review group reports back next year Speaking in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate about statues, Mr Warman said he wanted organisations to ""retain and explain not remove our heritage"". Whilst individuals such as Colston or Rhodes may have ""said or done things we may find deeply offensive"", he said they played an important role in teaching us about a past ""with all its faults"". ""We should seek to contextualise or reinterpret them in a way that enables to public to learn about them in their entirety,"" he added. Following a recent row over the playing of patriotic songs at the Last Night of the Proms, Boris Johnson said it was time the UK ""stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history"".

"This video can not be played Tighter rules to curb the spread of coronavirus have been introduced in Leeds Different households in Leeds will be banned from meeting in private homes or gardens in a bid to slow rising Covid-19 rates, the government has confirmed. The measure will begin at midnight and would bring the city in line with rules in Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale, said council leader Judith Blake. Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the rule in a written statement. The city council said there had been a ""steep rise"" in infections, with the rate at 98.5 per 100,000 people. The move will have an impact on 780,000 people but some exemptions are expected, including for those with caring responsibilities. Residents in Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale are currently strongly advised not to socialise in any public venues with people they do not live with. The council said the measures for Leeds will match those areas, with the national ""rule of six'"" and 22:00 venue curfew continuing alongside. Councillors asked the government to allow households to meet in private gardens, but this request was rejected. The measures in Leeds are expect to reflect restrictions in neighbouring Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale In his statement, Mr Hancock said: ""We are making regulations which take effect from Saturday, 26 September and will impose restrictions on inter-household mixing in private dwellings and gardens in Leeds, Stockport, Wigan and Blackpool. ""People who live in these areas will not be allowed to gather in a private dwelling or garden with any other household unless in a support bubble. ""People from anywhere else will also not be allowed to gather with another household in a private dwelling or garden in these areas."" Ms Blake said the duration of the new measures ""will depend on everyone playing their part"". ""We are acutely aware that nobody wants to see further restrictions placed on life in Leeds and alongside our partners we have been doing absolutely everything within our power to avoid that,"" she said. ""But the safety of the city and the public simply has to come first and we have now reached a point where we all need to take additional steps to contain the spread of this terrible virus within our communities."" Yorkshire: Latest news and coronavirus updates New restrictions in West Yorkshire explained Victoria Eaton, the city's director of public health, said there was ""very widespread community transmissions right across the city"", with compliance with self-isolation rules still low. ""The expectation is the restrictions will be in place for a longer period of time, potentially right through the winter,"" she said. Not to meet people you do not live with inside a private home or garden, except where you have formed a support bubble Not to visit someone else's home or garden even if they live outside of Leeds, unless they are in your support bubble You are advised not to socialise with people you do not live with in any public venue in Leeds or elsewhere Examples of these include pubs, restaurants, cafes, shops, places of worship, community centres, leisure or entertainment venues, visitor attractions and parks Friends and family can still provide informal childcare for children under 14 You are advised not to visit friends or family in care homes, other than in exceptional circumstances Exemptions to the home and garden rule include visiting a person who is dying, to fulfil a legal obligation, for work purposes, for the provision of voluntary or charitable services, for the purposes of education or training, to provide emergency assistance, to facilitate a house move, to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person and to attend a birth at the mother's request Source: Leeds City Council By David Rhodes, BBC Yorkshire data journalist Despite repeated warnings from Leeds City Council, the number of Covid-19 cases in the city has risen throughout September. In the seven days to 21 September there was a record 829 new infections identified. That surpasses the peak of new cases in the first wave of the pandemic back in late April. Whilst mass testing has only been available since May, the sharp increase in cases in the past month has alarmed officials - as the number of new cases has quadrupled in the space of three weeks. Leeds is not alone in West Yorkshire - Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees have all seen record numbers of new cases in the latest week's data. Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale have been part of local restrictions since July along with areas of east Lancashire and Greater Manchester. While most of the rest of England had seen lower rates of new coronavirus infections over the summer, these three parts of West Yorkshire were regularly in the top 20 of the 315 districts and boroughs, Leeds had been on Public Health England's watchlist as an ""area of enhanced support"", meaning it received greater national assistance and extra testing capacity, but had so far escaped the tighter restrictions of its neighbours. Leeds is one of 32 local authority areas where the rate in the week to 21 September was in excess of 100 cases per 100,000 people. There were 829 new infections in the city that week, up from 607 the week before, according to data released on Thursday. Tom Riordan, chief executive of Leeds City Council, said: ""It looks like we are in the middle of the second wave, so we do support these household restrictions having to be brought in at this stage. ""That is something we really need the people of the city to get behind."" By James Vincent, BBC Yorkshire political editor Expect this to last for a while. The council doesn't know whether these new restrictions will still be in place at Christmas - but it's clear Leeds needs to be braced for a long haul. The ""rule of six"" and the curfew on pubs and restaurants will stay in place - now it's likely that hundreds of thousands of people are going to be apart from their families for the foreseeable future. It will come into force at midnight and although it will be reviewed weekly, it may not change for some time.

"Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu has been a close adviser to Pope Francis High-ranking Vatican official Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu has unexpectedly resigned but has revealed he was told to do so by Pope Francis. He said he was suspected of giving Church money to his brothers, and denied any wrongdoing. Cardinal Becciu was a close aide to the Pope and previously had a key job in the Vatican's Secretariat of State. He became involved in a controversial deal to invest in a luxury London building with Church funds. That investment has since been the subject of a financial investigation. Resignations at this level of the Vatican are extremely rare and the Holy See said little in its communique released late on Thursday. ""The Holy Father accepted the resignation from the office of Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and from the rights connected to the Cardinalate, presented by His Eminence Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu,"" a statement said. But the cardinal, 72, told Italian website Domani he was being forced out because he was suspected of giving Church money to his brothers. ""I didn't steal even one euro. I am not under investigation but if they send me to trial, I will defend myself,"" he was quoted as saying. Speaking later at a news conference, the cardinal said his removal had come ""like a bolt out of the blue"". He said the Pope ""was suffering"" when he delivered the news. ""It's all surreal. Up until yesterday... I felt I was a friend of the Pope, the faithful executor of the Pope. ""Then the Pope told me that he no longer had faith in me because he got a report from magistrates that I committed an act of misappropriation."" Cardinal Becciu insisted there had been ""a misunderstanding"", adding: ""I am ready to explain everything to the Pope. I have not done anything wrong."" ""I said to the Pope: why are you doing this to me, in front of the whole world?"" The anguished words of one of the Church's most senior cardinals - now fired and stripped of his right to choose the next Pope. Giovanni Angelo Becciu had served as Deputy Secretary of State - a role with unfettered access to Pope Francis - and was latterly head of the department that chooses future saints. But on Thursday evening, he was summoned for a reportedly tense meeting with his boss. Cardinal Becciu had managed a controversial â¬200m (Â£180m) purchase of a London property with Church funds, including alms money. Other reports allege he propped up a failing Roman hospital which employed his niece. The cardinal has insisted he did not steal one euro and has vowed to defend himself ""The Holy Father explained that I had given favours to my brothers and their businesses with Church moneyâ¦ but I am certain there are no crimes"", he told new Italian newspaper Domani. But his denial was not enough. It's been dubbed an ""earthquake at the Vatican"". The choreography of his dismissal may seem cloak-and-dagger - but it is a reminder yet again that the scandal and corruption that beset governments across the world also reach the highest echelons of the Holy See. Giovanni Angelo Becciu, who is Italian, spent the early years of his career in the Vatican's diplomatic service. Then, from 2011 to 2018, he had the powerful role of Substitute for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State, when he met the Pope on a daily basis. Giovanni Angelo Becciu became a cardinal in June 2018 It was Pope Francis who made him cardinal in 2018, when he took up a new role of running the department that looks after sainthoods and beatifications. ""It's a blow for me, my family, the people of my country. I've accepted out of a spirit of obedience and love of the Church and the Pope,"" Italian media quoted the cardinal as saying on Friday morning. It was during the cardinal's time as Substitute for General Affairs that he was linked to a luxury property deal in a wealthy area of London. The $200m (Â£155m) purchase of the apartment block in Sloane Avenue was bought out of Church money through offshore funds and companies. Five members of staff were suspended last year following a raid of the offices of the Secretariat last year. Vatican police officers seized documents and computers. Then, in June, Italian businessman Gianluigi Torzi was arrested by Vatican police on suspicion of extortion and embezzlement. Pope denounces media over leaks Vatican anger over 'gay link' to quakes Earlier this year, Cardinal Becciu defended the purchase. ""An investment was made on a building. It was good and opportune occasion, which many people envy us for today,""he said in February,external. He also denied that money collected for the poor, called Peter's Pence, had been used in the deal. The cardinal's sudden departure may not just be linked to the London deal. In his interview on Friday, the cardinal said the Pope confronted him over Church money he had given to co-operatives and businesses run by his brothers. A co-operative in Sardinia, run by his brother Tonino Becciu, provided help to migrants and the cardinal said all the money had been accounted for. Other funding was used to renovate the Holy See's building in Cuba. Italian reports also suggest the Pope was unhappy with the use of Peter's Pence funds for other investments. Last year, Italian weekly L'Espresso published a report from the Vatican's anti-corruption authority alleging more widespread speculative investments amounting to $725m. Cardinal Becciu will keep his title despite his resignation from the congregation. However, he will not be able to vote for the next Pope. The last cardinal to give up his right to vote for a new Pope was Scottish Cardinal Keith O'Brien who resigned in 2013 amid a sex scandal. He died five years later.

"WHO expert says deaths of two million people from Covid-19 is 'very likely' without global action A further 6,874 UK Covid-19 cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, with 34 deaths New restrictions are announced in Leeds, where the city council reported a ""steep rise"" in infections on Thursday Two of Wales' biggest cities - Cardiff and Swansea - will go into lockdown from 18:00 BST on Sunday London is at a ""very worrying tipping point"" amid a resurgence of Covid-19, the mayor has warned In Madrid, over a million people will be under local lockdown restrictions from Monday as curbs are extended More than 32 million virus cases have been confirmed globally with nearly 984,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Paul Gribben We're pausing the coronavirus live page for now but will be back on Saturday morning. We leave you with a
round-up of today's biggest developments from the UK.  Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, Joseph Lee,
Victoria Bissett, Paul Gribben, Joshua Nevett and Emma Harrison Thanks for joining us. Marseille's restaurant and bar owners have rebelled against coronavirus restrictions Weâre pausing our live coverage for the day soon. In case you missed them, here are some of todayâs main headlines from around the world. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned of a looming spike in infections Two of Canada's most populous provinces have moved to impose further restrictions on social gatherings, as they seek to stem rising coronavirus infections. In Quebec, Health Minister Christian DubÃ© urged people to avoid social gatherings
for 28 days. DubÃ© made the plea as the eastern province recorded a further 637 new cases on Friday, up 10% from the day before. Ontario, the most populous province, also saw a rise in new cases. In response, Premier Doug Ford announced on Friday that bars, restaurants
and strip clubs will have to close by midnight, and stop serving alcohol by 23:00 local time. On a national level, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resumed his daily Covid-19 briefing, which he had paused over the summer as cases declined. In a televised address on Tuesday, he warned that ""we are on the brink of a fall
that could be much worse than the spring"". Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics This weekâs report on
coronavirus hotspots from Public Health England has a new analysis. It shows that the most common
activity people recall doing before their coronavirus symptoms began is eating
out. MPs wrote to Baroness Dido
Harding, the head of NHS Test and Trace, earlier this week asking her to share
the evidence behind the 22:00 curfew and table service restrictions. Contact tracers asked people
what activities they had been doing in the days leading up to their coronavirus
symptoms. The most common answer from
the 45,000 people questioned was eating out (15%) closely followed by shopping
(13%). We canât say for certain if
this is where people picked up their infection, and canât say anything about
the people who donât pick up the phone to contact tracers. But it adds some evidence to
the public debate about the measures the government have announced. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem A political row has continued over the tightening of Covid-19 restrictions in Israel, a week after the country became the first in the world to begin asecond nationwide lockdown. Critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accuse him of trying to block the regular protests against him and his handling of the crisis. New rules came into effect at 14:00 (12:00 BST) local time, just ahead of the Israeli weekend. They close most workplaces and markets. Synagogues are to stay closed except on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which begins on Sunday evening. In parliament, Netanyahu was blocked from pushing through emergency measures to prevent the protests that have become a regular event outside his Jerusalem residence. However, anti-Netanyahu groups now say they will form a protest convoy to make their way there with participants, going no further than the 1km (0.6 mile) limit from their homes. One group is urging protesters to stage events on their balconies. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The original app was trialled on the Isle of Wight The original NHS Covid-19 app, which was shelved, would have worked on a larger number of handsets than the app which launched in England and Wales this week, I have discovered. VMware Pivotal, the firm behind it, has just published its software code. It shows that it works on 97.5% of handsets, and provides more accurate measurements of contacts between users. One expert told me the first app was better - but VMware Pivotal says it does not wish to compete. The new app doesn't work with a variety of older phones, including iPhones made before 2015, and Android phones not running the Android 6.0 operating system or above. It can also generate false readings of close contacts in a third of cases. Read
more Restaurants were allowed to expand outdoor dining in New York City earlier this year Outdoor dining will be a permanent, year-round fixture of the restaurant scene in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced. The Open Restaurant initiative allowed 9,000 restaurants to reopen their doors and expand outdoor-dining services to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The initiative was set to expire on 31 October, but on Friday Mayor de Blasio said it would continue indefinitely. Outdoor dining throughout the cooler autumn and winter months would be an âimportant part of how we recover as a cityâ, he said. âI believe this is going to make it a lot easier for restaurants to survive,â the mayor said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the initiative will help restaurants survive Restaurants will be required to observe social-distancing restrictions when indoor dining returns in New York City on 30 September. More outdoor space will enable restaurants to accommodate more customers, saving thousands of jobs. The industry has welcomed the mayorâs announcement, with restaurant group NYC Hospitality Alliance hailing the move as a âcritical lifeline for thousands of small businessesâ. We reported earlier on confirmation from London Councils, which represents the city's 33 councils, that the UK capital had beenput on the coronavirus watchlist. Public Health England's latestcoronavirus weekly surveillance report,externalhas now been published and confirms all of London's boroughs have been made areas of ""concern"". The report shows the incidence rates in the capital, with the rate in the City of London estimated at 11.5 per 100,000 people, while in Havering it is 30.3. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said: ""The placement of London on the watchlist as an area of concern is a reflection of the rising number of cases of Covid-19 being shown by a range of indicators. ""We are currently seeing much more widespread transmission in the city and being recognised as an area of concern is an important step in our efforts to control the virus."" He says the new status ""will enable us to respond more rapidly and with additional measures should cases rise further and faster"". Dr Mike Ryan said two million deaths were possible even with an effective vaccine The deaths of two million people with Covid-19 is âvery likelyâ unless the world takes comprehensive action to curb the spread of the disease, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) expert has warned. Dr Mike Ryan was asked on Friday whether two million fatalities worldwide was possible before a vaccine against the disease became available. âItâs certainly unimaginable, but itâs not impossible,â Dr Ryan told a media briefing at the WHOâs headquarters in Geneva. Almost one million people have died with coronavirus worldwide since the disease first emerged in China late last year. Dr Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies team, said fatality rates were dropping as treatments for the disease improve. But he said better treatments and even an effective vaccine would not be enough on their own to prevent further deaths. âAre we prepared to do what it takes to avoid that number?,â Dr Ryan said, calling on governments to do everything within their power to control Covid-19. âUnless we do it all, the number you speak about is not only imaginable, but unfortunately and sadly, very likely.â Peter Mwai and Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the Covid-19 outbreak in Africa may have passed its peak, but warns governments not to be complacent as countries relax their restrictions. The number of new daily confirmed cases overall has been dropping for about two months now, although some countries are still seeing a rise in cases. The humanitarian relief body International Rescue Committee says it believes the true scale of the pandemic may be hiddenbecause of a lack of testing and issues with data.,external Andthe WHO says changes in testing capacity and strategycan also affect numbers. A series of local lockdowns have been announced today in the
north of England and in parts of Wales, including its two biggest cities. Different householdsin Leeds,Stockport,
Wigan and Blackpoolare banned from meeting in private homes or gardens in
an effort to slow rising cases of coronavirus from midnight. In Wales, Cardiff and the county of Swanseago into lockdown at 18:00 BST on
Sunday, 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli. People will not be able to enter or leave the areas without a
reasonable excuse, the Welsh government says. They will also not be able to meet indoors with anyone they do
not live with, with extended households suspended. Find outhow many coronavirus cases there are in your area  Denmark has had fewer cases than its European neighbours so far Denmark is the latest European country to see a second spike of coronavirus infections, mirroring a concerning pattern happening across the world. On Friday, Danish health minister Magnus Heunicke said restrictions already in place would be extended by two weeks until 19 October. ""A rise in new infections was expected, but it has come earlier than we had anticipated,"" Heunicke told a news conference. Under the rules, public gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. Denmark has fared better than many other European countries,recording 24,357 cases and 643 deaths,external, the latest WHO data shows. However, the country has seen a pronounced spike in recent days, tallying 678 on Friday. The US remains in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, because infections have not decreased sufficiently since the initial outbreak, the country's leading infectious diseases expert has said. Dr Anthony Fauci said the second wave of a pandemic happens when infections of a disease subside significantly before a marked resurgence at a later date. During the flu pandemic of 1918, for example, infections spiked in the spring then ""literally disappeared"", before an âexplosionâ of cases in autumn, Dr Fauci said. ""Rather than say, 'a second wave,' why don't we say, 'are we prepared for the challenge of the fall and the winter?',""Dr Fauci told CNN,external. World Health Organization (WHO) data shows,externalthe US has recorded more than 13,000 new infections of coronavirus a day since late March. New cases dipped slightly after hitting a peak of 74,354 on 19 July, but have continued to increase by at least 40,000 a day since then, according to the data. At least 202,000 people have died with Covid-19 so far in the US, the highest number of fatalities in the world. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students should not be made ""scapegoats"" for a wave of Covid outbreaks, says a lecturers' leader. Jo Grady of the UCU university staff union said it was the ""completely predictable"" outcome of encouraging large numbers of students to return. With universities in England returning, she called for them to switch as much as possible to online teaching. The Department for Education says it is supporting universities to have a mix of online and face-to-face teaching. Dr Grady saidtough restrictions on students in Scotlandand increasing warnings for students in England did not mean outbreaks were a consequence of ""reckless behaviour"" by students. Earlier, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid students were not
to blamefor recent outbreaks at the country's universities. Some students have claimed that they are being ""singled
out"" after they were told not to visit pubs or restaurants over the
weekend. Read
more from Sean Dr Tedros said he ""didn't believe"" the US's decision to withdraw from the WHO President Donald Trump ""doesn't have any good reason to withdraw"" the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said. President Trump announced the termination of the country's relationship with the WHO in May, accusing the UN agency of failing to hold China to account over the coronavirus pandemic. âMy first reaction was, to be honest, I didnât believe it,âDr Tedros said in an interview with Time Magazine,external. ""Even now I believe that the US administration doesnât have any good reason to withdraw from WHO."" In 2019, the US was the global health agency's largest single contributor,providing 15.18% of its total budget,external. Dr Tedros said the impact of US withdrawal was uncertain, but stressed it was the countryâs ""global leadership"" that mattered more to him than its financial contribution. Nevertheless, Dr Tedros was hopeful co-operation would prevail over division, especially when vaccines against Covid-19 are distributed. ""The basic principle we're following now, in terms of distribution of the vaccines, is to give vaccines to some people in all countries, not all people in some countries,"" he said. A policeman speaking to shop owners at a market in Jerusalem It has been a week since Israel went into its second nationwide lockdown, and nownew restrictions have come into effectto help stop the rise in cases. From this afternoon, businesses not officially considered essential were ordered closed, and travel restricted to 1km (0.6 miles) from people's homes. Other planned rules which would affect protesters and synagogue-goers have not yet been approved by parliament, amid disagreements. Covid-19 cases in Israel have continued to rise despite the latest lockdown. A new record of more than 8,000 infections for a single day were recorded on Thursday in Israel, which has one of the highest rates of infections per capita in the world. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam - and his wife Pamela - tested positive The governor of the US state of Virginia has tested positive for coronavirus. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam and his wife Pamela were both tested on Thursday, after a member of staff at their residence was found to have Covid-19, a statement released on the governor's website said. The governor is currently asymptomatic, while the first lady has mild symptoms. Both will isolate for 10 days, the statement added. He is the second governor in as many days to test positive, after Missouri Governor Mike Parson and his wife announced they had been infected on Thursday. The news comes ahead of a planned rally by President Donald Trump in the state, which health officials have warned could pose a ""severe health risk"". According to the Washington Post, the director of the local health district had asked the company that operates the airport where the rally is planned to adhere to the state's 250-person limit on gatherings. A further 6,874 UK coronavirus cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, according to thelatest government figures,external. There have also been 34 deaths, according to the statistics, but the government says this does not including Scotland due to a power outage at National Records of Scotland. In
an interview with the Guardian,external, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says household
visits must soon be banned for the capital's nine million residents. His remarks come after London councils said that London is now on England's coronavirus watchlist - which is expected to be confirmed by Public Health England later. Khan tells the the newspaper: ""It's obviously bad news that London is an area of concern. ""But the good news is that finally the government will pull their finger out and give us additional support."" He said he had lobbied the prime minister for tougher measures in London, saying: ""If you go too late, we will already be in a north-east, north-west, Birmingham-type situation. You've got to go early, particular in the absence of testing. ""One of the things that I said to the prime minister is: I think we should be following what's happening around the country and stopping social mixing of households , and I say that with a heavy heart."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the rise in cases was ""very worrying"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has expressed alarm over a âworryingâ rise of coronavirus infections in the Netherlands, warning of new measures to control the disease. Rutte issued the warning as the country saw another daily record of new coronavirus infections on Friday, tallying 2,777 over the past 24 hours.

"A local trader, who took this photo of a victim being treated, said there was panic outside his store Two people have been stabbed and seriously hurt in Paris near the former offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Two suspects have been arrested. One of them was seized in the nearby Bastille area with blood on his clothing, police told the BBC. Anti-terrorism police have taken over the investigation. A security cordon has been set up in the 11th arrondissement in eastern Paris. Nearby metro stations were closed and five schools in the area immediately went into lockdown. The schools were allowed to reopen some hours later. A blade - described as a machete or a meat cleaver - was recovered at the scene of the attack near the Boulevard Richard-Lenoir. Charlie Hebdo's head of HR 'forced out of home' Police quoted by French media said the ""main suspect"" was from Pakistan and the second person arrested was from Algeria. They have not yet been named and any connection between them has not been disclosed. The conditions of the victims have not been made public although French Prime Minister Jean Castex told reporters at the scene that their lives were not in danger. The attack comes as a high-profile trial is under way in Paris of 14 people accused of helping two jihadists carry out the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were killed. Heavily-armed police quickly sealed off the area The two people wounded were staff at a TV production company, one of their colleagues told AFP news agency. ""Two colleagues were smoking a cigarette outside the building, in the street. I heard shouting. I went to the window and saw one of my colleagues, covered in blood, being chased by a man with a machete in the street,"" another member of staff at the PremiÃ¨res Lignes production firm said. The firm has offices in the Rue Nicolas Appert, a side street off Boulevard Richard Lenoir where the former Charlie Hebdo offices are located. A mural to the 12 people killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack is nearby. The satirical magazine has since moved to a secret location. Mr Castex visited the scene accompanied by Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. The prime minister reiterated the government's ""firm commitment to combat terrorism by all possible means"". French Prime Minister Jean Castex visited the scene flanked by Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo At a news conference, anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard confirmed that the ""main perpetrator"" had been arrested and said a ""second individual"" was also in custody. ""The investigation will continue,"" he said. Charles Michel, President of the European Council and former Belgian PM, expressed his ""full solidarity with the French people"". ""All my thoughts are with the victims of this cowardly act of violence. Terror has no place on European territory,"" he tweeted. In a tweet, Charlie Hebdo expressed its ""support and solidarity with its former neighbours... and the people affected by this odious attack"". Charlie Hebdo has marked the start of the trial by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked protests in several Muslim countries. In response, the militant group al-Qaeda renewed its threat to the magazine. The magazine's head of human resources said earlier this week thatshe had moved out of her home after receiving death threats. The defendants in the trial are also accused of helping another jihadist carry out a related attack in which he shot dead a policewoman, then attacked a Jewish store, killing four people. The 17 victims were killed over a period of three days. All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead.

"Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu has been a close adviser to Pope Francis High-ranking Vatican official Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu has unexpectedly resigned but has revealed he was told to do so by Pope Francis. He said he was suspected of giving Church money to his brothers, and denied any wrongdoing. Cardinal Becciu was a close aide to the Pope and previously had a key job in the Vatican's Secretariat of State. He became involved in a controversial deal to invest in a luxury London building with Church funds. That investment has since been the subject of a financial investigation. Resignations at this level of the Vatican are extremely rare and the Holy See said little in its communique released late on Thursday. ""The Holy Father accepted the resignation from the office of Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and from the rights connected to the Cardinalate, presented by His Eminence Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu,"" a statement said. But the cardinal, 72, told Italian website Domani he was being forced out because he was suspected of giving Church money to his brothers. ""I didn't steal even one euro. I am not under investigation but if they send me to trial, I will defend myself,"" he was quoted as saying. Speaking later at a news conference, the cardinal said his removal had come ""like a bolt out of the blue"". He said the Pope ""was suffering"" when he delivered the news. ""It's all surreal. Up until yesterday... I felt I was a friend of the Pope, the faithful executor of the Pope. ""Then the Pope told me that he no longer had faith in me because he got a report from magistrates that I committed an act of misappropriation."" Cardinal Becciu insisted there had been ""a misunderstanding"", adding: ""I am ready to explain everything to the Pope. I have not done anything wrong."" ""I said to the Pope: why are you doing this to me, in front of the whole world?"" The anguished words of one of the Church's most senior cardinals - now fired and stripped of his right to choose the next Pope. Giovanni Angelo Becciu had served as Deputy Secretary of State - a role with unfettered access to Pope Francis - and was latterly head of the department that chooses future saints. But on Thursday evening, he was summoned for a reportedly tense meeting with his boss. Cardinal Becciu had managed a controversial â¬200m (Â£180m) purchase of a London property with Church funds, including alms money. Other reports allege he propped up a failing Roman hospital which employed his niece. The cardinal has insisted he did not steal one euro and has vowed to defend himself ""The Holy Father explained that I had given favours to my brothers and their businesses with Church moneyâ¦ but I am certain there are no crimes"", he told new Italian newspaper Domani. But his denial was not enough. It's been dubbed an ""earthquake at the Vatican"". The choreography of his dismissal may seem cloak-and-dagger - but it is a reminder yet again that the scandal and corruption that beset governments across the world also reach the highest echelons of the Holy See. Giovanni Angelo Becciu, who is Italian, spent the early years of his career in the Vatican's diplomatic service. Then, from 2011 to 2018, he had the powerful role of Substitute for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State, when he met the Pope on a daily basis. Giovanni Angelo Becciu became a cardinal in June 2018 It was Pope Francis who made him cardinal in 2018, when he took up a new role of running the department that looks after sainthoods and beatifications. ""It's a blow for me, my family, the people of my country. I've accepted out of a spirit of obedience and love of the Church and the Pope,"" Italian media quoted the cardinal as saying on Friday morning. It was during the cardinal's time as Substitute for General Affairs that he was linked to a luxury property deal in a wealthy area of London. The $200m (Â£155m) purchase of the apartment block in Sloane Avenue was bought out of Church money through offshore funds and companies. Five members of staff were suspended last year following a raid of the offices of the Secretariat last year. Vatican police officers seized documents and computers. Then, in June, Italian businessman Gianluigi Torzi was arrested by Vatican police on suspicion of extortion and embezzlement. Pope denounces media over leaks Vatican anger over 'gay link' to quakes Earlier this year, Cardinal Becciu defended the purchase. ""An investment was made on a building. It was good and opportune occasion, which many people envy us for today,""he said in February,external. He also denied that money collected for the poor, called Peter's Pence, had been used in the deal. The cardinal's sudden departure may not just be linked to the London deal. In his interview on Friday, the cardinal said the Pope confronted him over Church money he had given to co-operatives and businesses run by his brothers. A co-operative in Sardinia, run by his brother Tonino Becciu, provided help to migrants and the cardinal said all the money had been accounted for. Other funding was used to renovate the Holy See's building in Cuba. Italian reports also suggest the Pope was unhappy with the use of Peter's Pence funds for other investments. Last year, Italian weekly L'Espresso published a report from the Vatican's anti-corruption authority alleging more widespread speculative investments amounting to $725m. Cardinal Becciu will keep his title despite his resignation from the congregation. However, he will not be able to vote for the next Pope. The last cardinal to give up his right to vote for a new Pope was Scottish Cardinal Keith O'Brien who resigned in 2013 amid a sex scandal. He died five years later.

Marseille's restaurant and bar owners have rebelled against coronavirus restrictions Weâre pausing our live coverage for the day soon. In case you missed them, here are some of todayâs main headlines from around the world. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned of a looming spike in infections Two of Canada's most populous provinces have moved to impose further restrictions on social gatherings, as they seek to stem rising coronavirus infections. In Quebec, Health Minister Christian DubÃ© urged people to avoid social gatherings
for 28 days. DubÃ© made the plea as the eastern province recorded a further 637 new cases on Friday, up 10% from the day before. Ontario, the most populous province, also saw a rise in new cases. In response, Premier Doug Ford announced on Friday that bars, restaurants
and strip clubs will have to close by midnight, and stop serving alcohol by 23:00 local time. On a national level, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resumed his daily Covid-19 briefing, which he had paused over the summer as cases declined. In a televised address on Tuesday, he warned that ""we are on the brink of a fall
that could be much worse than the spring"". Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics This weekâs report on
coronavirus hotspots from Public Health England has a new analysis. It shows that the most common
activity people recall doing before their coronavirus symptoms began is eating
out. MPs wrote to Baroness Dido
Harding, the head of NHS Test and Trace, earlier this week asking her to share
the evidence behind the 22:00 curfew and table service restrictions. Contact tracers asked people
what activities they had been doing in the days leading up to their coronavirus
symptoms. The most common answer from
the 45,000 people questioned was eating out (15%) closely followed by shopping
(13%). We canât say for certain if
this is where people picked up their infection, and canât say anything about
the people who donât pick up the phone to contact tracers. But it adds some evidence to
the public debate about the measures the government have announced. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem A political row has continued over the tightening of Covid-19 restrictions in Israel, a week after the country became the first in the world to begin asecond nationwide lockdown. Critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accuse him of trying to block the regular protests against him and his handling of the crisis. New rules came into effect at 14:00 (12:00 BST) local time, just ahead of the Israeli weekend. They close most workplaces and markets. Synagogues are to stay closed except on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which begins on Sunday evening. In parliament, Netanyahu was blocked from pushing through emergency measures to prevent the protests that have become a regular event outside his Jerusalem residence. However, anti-Netanyahu groups now say they will form a protest convoy to make their way there with participants, going no further than the 1km (0.6 mile) limit from their homes. One group is urging protesters to stage events on their balconies. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The original app was trialled on the Isle of Wight The original NHS Covid-19 app, which was shelved, would have worked on a larger number of handsets than the app which launched in England and Wales this week, I have discovered. VMware Pivotal, the firm behind it, has just published its software code. It shows that it works on 97.5% of handsets, and provides more accurate measurements of contacts between users. One expert told me the first app was better - but VMware Pivotal says it does not wish to compete. The new app doesn't work with a variety of older phones, including iPhones made before 2015, and Android phones not running the Android 6.0 operating system or above. It can also generate false readings of close contacts in a third of cases. Read
more Restaurants were allowed to expand outdoor dining in New York City earlier this year Outdoor dining will be a permanent, year-round fixture of the restaurant scene in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced. The Open Restaurant initiative allowed 9,000 restaurants to reopen their doors and expand outdoor-dining services to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The initiative was set to expire on 31 October, but on Friday Mayor de Blasio said it would continue indefinitely. Outdoor dining throughout the cooler autumn and winter months would be an âimportant part of how we recover as a cityâ, he said. âI believe this is going to make it a lot easier for restaurants to survive,â the mayor said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the initiative will help restaurants survive Restaurants will be required to observe social-distancing restrictions when indoor dining returns in New York City on 30 September. More outdoor space will enable restaurants to accommodate more customers, saving thousands of jobs. The industry has welcomed the mayorâs announcement, with restaurant group NYC Hospitality Alliance hailing the move as a âcritical lifeline for thousands of small businessesâ. We reported earlier on confirmation from London Councils, which represents the city's 33 councils, that the UK capital had beenput on the coronavirus watchlist. Public Health England's latestcoronavirus weekly surveillance report,externalhas now been published and confirms all of London's boroughs have been made areas of ""concern"". The report shows the incidence rates in the capital, with the rate in the City of London estimated at 11.5 per 100,000 people, while in Havering it is 30.3. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said: ""The placement of London on the watchlist as an area of concern is a reflection of the rising number of cases of Covid-19 being shown by a range of indicators. ""We are currently seeing much more widespread transmission in the city and being recognised as an area of concern is an important step in our efforts to control the virus."" He says the new status ""will enable us to respond more rapidly and with additional measures should cases rise further and faster"". Dr Mike Ryan said two million deaths were possible even with an effective vaccine The deaths of two million people with Covid-19 is âvery likelyâ unless the world takes comprehensive action to curb the spread of the disease, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) expert has warned. Dr Mike Ryan was asked on Friday whether two million fatalities worldwide was possible before a vaccine against the disease became available. âItâs certainly unimaginable, but itâs not impossible,â Dr Ryan told a media briefing at the WHOâs headquarters in Geneva. Almost one million people have died with coronavirus worldwide since the disease first emerged in China late last year. Dr Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies team, said fatality rates were dropping as treatments for the disease improve. But he said better treatments and even an effective vaccine would not be enough on their own to prevent further deaths. âAre we prepared to do what it takes to avoid that number?,â Dr Ryan said, calling on governments to do everything within their power to control Covid-19. âUnless we do it all, the number you speak about is not only imaginable, but unfortunately and sadly, very likely.â Peter Mwai and Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the Covid-19 outbreak in Africa may have passed its peak, but warns governments not to be complacent as countries relax their restrictions. The number of new daily confirmed cases overall has been dropping for about two months now, although some countries are still seeing a rise in cases. The humanitarian relief body International Rescue Committee says it believes the true scale of the pandemic may be hiddenbecause of a lack of testing and issues with data.,external Andthe WHO says changes in testing capacity and strategycan also affect numbers. A series of local lockdowns have been announced today in the
north of England and in parts of Wales, including its two biggest cities. Different householdsin Leeds,Stockport,
Wigan and Blackpoolare banned from meeting in private homes or gardens in
an effort to slow rising cases of coronavirus from midnight. In Wales, Cardiff and the county of Swanseago into lockdown at 18:00 BST on
Sunday, 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli. People will not be able to enter or leave the areas without a
reasonable excuse, the Welsh government says. They will also not be able to meet indoors with anyone they do
not live with, with extended households suspended. Find outhow many coronavirus cases there are in your area  Denmark has had fewer cases than its European neighbours so far Denmark is the latest European country to see a second spike of coronavirus infections, mirroring a concerning pattern happening across the world. On Friday, Danish health minister Magnus Heunicke said restrictions already in place would be extended by two weeks until 19 October. ""A rise in new infections was expected, but it has come earlier than we had anticipated,"" Heunicke told a news conference. Under the rules, public gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. Denmark has fared better than many other European countries,recording 24,357 cases and 643 deaths,external, the latest WHO data shows. However, the country has seen a pronounced spike in recent days, tallying 678 on Friday. The US remains in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, because infections have not decreased sufficiently since the initial outbreak, the country's leading infectious diseases expert has said. Dr Anthony Fauci said the second wave of a pandemic happens when infections of a disease subside significantly before a marked resurgence at a later date. During the flu pandemic of 1918, for example, infections spiked in the spring then ""literally disappeared"", before an âexplosionâ of cases in autumn, Dr Fauci said. ""Rather than say, 'a second wave,' why don't we say, 'are we prepared for the challenge of the fall and the winter?',""Dr Fauci told CNN,external. World Health Organization (WHO) data shows,externalthe US has recorded more than 13,000 new infections of coronavirus a day since late March. New cases dipped slightly after hitting a peak of 74,354 on 19 July, but have continued to increase by at least 40,000 a day since then, according to the data. At least 202,000 people have died with Covid-19 so far in the US, the highest number of fatalities in the world. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students should not be made ""scapegoats"" for a wave of Covid outbreaks, says a lecturers' leader. Jo Grady of the UCU university staff union said it was the ""completely predictable"" outcome of encouraging large numbers of students to return. With universities in England returning, she called for them to switch as much as possible to online teaching. The Department for Education says it is supporting universities to have a mix of online and face-to-face teaching. Dr Grady saidtough restrictions on students in Scotlandand increasing warnings for students in England did not mean outbreaks were a consequence of ""reckless behaviour"" by students. Earlier, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid students were not
to blamefor recent outbreaks at the country's universities. Some students have claimed that they are being ""singled
out"" after they were told not to visit pubs or restaurants over the
weekend. Read
more from Sean Dr Tedros said he ""didn't believe"" the US's decision to withdraw from the WHO President Donald Trump ""doesn't have any good reason to withdraw"" the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said. President Trump announced the termination of the country's relationship with the WHO in May, accusing the UN agency of failing to hold China to account over the coronavirus pandemic. âMy first reaction was, to be honest, I didnât believe it,âDr Tedros said in an interview with Time Magazine,external. ""Even now I believe that the US administration doesnât have any good reason to withdraw from WHO."" In 2019, the US was the global health agency's largest single contributor,providing 15.18% of its total budget,external. Dr Tedros said the impact of US withdrawal was uncertain, but stressed it was the countryâs ""global leadership"" that mattered more to him than its financial contribution. Nevertheless, Dr Tedros was hopeful co-operation would prevail over division, especially when vaccines against Covid-19 are distributed. ""The basic principle we're following now, in terms of distribution of the vaccines, is to give vaccines to some people in all countries, not all people in some countries,"" he said. A policeman speaking to shop owners at a market in Jerusalem It has been a week since Israel went into its second nationwide lockdown, and nownew restrictions have come into effectto help stop the rise in cases. From this afternoon, businesses not officially considered essential were ordered closed, and travel restricted to 1km (0.6 miles) from people's homes. Other planned rules which would affect protesters and synagogue-goers have not yet been approved by parliament, amid disagreements. Covid-19 cases in Israel have continued to rise despite the latest lockdown. A new record of more than 8,000 infections for a single day were recorded on Thursday in Israel, which has one of the highest rates of infections per capita in the world. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam - and his wife Pamela - tested positive The governor of the US state of Virginia has tested positive for coronavirus. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam and his wife Pamela were both tested on Thursday, after a member of staff at their residence was found to have Covid-19, a statement released on the governor's website said. The governor is currently asymptomatic, while the first lady has mild symptoms. Both will isolate for 10 days, the statement added. He is the second governor in as many days to test positive, after Missouri Governor Mike Parson and his wife announced they had been infected on Thursday. The news comes ahead of a planned rally by President Donald Trump in the state, which health officials have warned could pose a ""severe health risk"". According to the Washington Post, the director of the local health district had asked the company that operates the airport where the rally is planned to adhere to the state's 250-person limit on gatherings. A further 6,874 UK coronavirus cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, according to thelatest government figures,external. There have also been 34 deaths, according to the statistics, but the government says this does not including Scotland due to a power outage at National Records of Scotland. In
an interview with the Guardian,external, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says household
visits must soon be banned for the capital's nine million residents. His remarks come after London councils said that London is now on England's coronavirus watchlist - which is expected to be confirmed by Public Health England later. Khan tells the the newspaper: ""It's obviously bad news that London is an area of concern. ""But the good news is that finally the government will pull their finger out and give us additional support."" He said he had lobbied the prime minister for tougher measures in London, saying: ""If you go too late, we will already be in a north-east, north-west, Birmingham-type situation. You've got to go early, particular in the absence of testing. ""One of the things that I said to the prime minister is: I think we should be following what's happening around the country and stopping social mixing of households , and I say that with a heavy heart."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the rise in cases was ""very worrying"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has expressed alarm over a âworryingâ rise of coronavirus infections in the Netherlands, warning of new measures to control the disease. Rutte issued the warning as the country saw another daily record of new coronavirus infections on Friday, tallying 2,777 over the past 24 hours. Cases have risen sharply since the beginning of September. ""The figures look downright terrible,â the PM told reporters at a news conference. âIn short, the situation is very worrisome and will force us to take extra measures.â He said the new measures will be announced next week.

The new app doesn't work with a variety of older phones, including iPhones made before 2015, and Android phones not running the Android 6.0 operating system or above. It can also generate false readings of close contacts in a third of cases. Read
more Restaurants were allowed to expand outdoor dining in New York City earlier this year Outdoor dining will be a permanent, year-round fixture of the restaurant scene in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced. The Open Restaurant initiative allowed 9,000 restaurants to reopen their doors and expand outdoor-dining services to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The initiative was set to expire on 31 October, but on Friday Mayor de Blasio said it would continue indefinitely. Outdoor dining throughout the cooler autumn and winter months would be an âimportant part of how we recover as a cityâ, he said. âI believe this is going to make it a lot easier for restaurants to survive,â the mayor said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the initiative will help restaurants survive Restaurants will be required to observe social-distancing restrictions when indoor dining returns in New York City on 30 September. More outdoor space will enable restaurants to accommodate more customers, saving thousands of jobs. The industry has welcomed the mayorâs announcement, with restaurant group NYC Hospitality Alliance hailing the move as a âcritical lifeline for thousands of small businessesâ. We reported earlier on confirmation from London Councils, which represents the city's 33 councils, that the UK capital had beenput on the coronavirus watchlist. Public Health England's latestcoronavirus weekly surveillance report,externalhas now been published and confirms all of London's boroughs have been made areas of ""concern"". The report shows the incidence rates in the capital, with the rate in the City of London estimated at 11.5 per 100,000 people, while in Havering it is 30.3. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said: ""The placement of London on the watchlist as an area of concern is a reflection of the rising number of cases of Covid-19 being shown by a range of indicators. ""We are currently seeing much more widespread transmission in the city and being recognised as an area of concern is an important step in our efforts to control the virus."" He says the new status ""will enable us to respond more rapidly and with additional measures should cases rise further and faster"". Dr Mike Ryan said two million deaths were possible even with an effective vaccine The deaths of two million people with Covid-19 is âvery likelyâ unless the world takes comprehensive action to curb the spread of the disease, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) expert has warned. Dr Mike Ryan was asked on Friday whether two million fatalities worldwide was possible before a vaccine against the disease became available. âItâs certainly unimaginable, but itâs not impossible,â Dr Ryan told a media briefing at the WHOâs headquarters in Geneva. Almost one million people have died with coronavirus worldwide since the disease first emerged in China late last year. Dr Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies team, said fatality rates were dropping as treatments for the disease improve. But he said better treatments and even an effective vaccine would not be enough on their own to prevent further deaths. âAre we prepared to do what it takes to avoid that number?,â Dr Ryan said, calling on governments to do everything within their power to control Covid-19. âUnless we do it all, the number you speak about is not only imaginable, but unfortunately and sadly, very likely.â Peter Mwai and Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the Covid-19 outbreak in Africa may have passed its peak, but warns governments not to be complacent as countries relax their restrictions. The number of new daily confirmed cases overall has been dropping for about two months now, although some countries are still seeing a rise in cases. The humanitarian relief body International Rescue Committee says it believes the true scale of the pandemic may be hiddenbecause of a lack of testing and issues with data.,external Andthe WHO says changes in testing capacity and strategycan also affect numbers. A series of local lockdowns have been announced today in the
north of England and in parts of Wales, including its two biggest cities. Different householdsin Leeds,Stockport,
Wigan and Blackpoolare banned from meeting in private homes or gardens in
an effort to slow rising cases of coronavirus from midnight. In Wales, Cardiff and the county of Swanseago into lockdown at 18:00 BST on
Sunday, 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli. People will not be able to enter or leave the areas without a
reasonable excuse, the Welsh government says. They will also not be able to meet indoors with anyone they do
not live with, with extended households suspended. Find outhow many coronavirus cases there are in your area  Denmark has had fewer cases than its European neighbours so far Denmark is the latest European country to see a second spike of coronavirus infections, mirroring a concerning pattern happening across the world. On Friday, Danish health minister Magnus Heunicke said restrictions already in place would be extended by two weeks until 19 October. ""A rise in new infections was expected, but it has come earlier than we had anticipated,"" Heunicke told a news conference. Under the rules, public gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. Denmark has fared better than many other European countries,recording 24,357 cases and 643 deaths,external, the latest WHO data shows. However, the country has seen a pronounced spike in recent days, tallying 678 on Friday. The US remains in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, because infections have not decreased sufficiently since the initial outbreak, the country's leading infectious diseases expert has said. Dr Anthony Fauci said the second wave of a pandemic happens when infections of a disease subside significantly before a marked resurgence at a later date. During the flu pandemic of 1918, for example, infections spiked in the spring then ""literally disappeared"", before an âexplosionâ of cases in autumn, Dr Fauci said. ""Rather than say, 'a second wave,' why don't we say, 'are we prepared for the challenge of the fall and the winter?',""Dr Fauci told CNN,external. World Health Organization (WHO) data shows,externalthe US has recorded more than 13,000 new infections of coronavirus a day since late March. New cases dipped slightly after hitting a peak of 74,354 on 19 July, but have continued to increase by at least 40,000 a day since then, according to the data. At least 202,000 people have died with Covid-19 so far in the US, the highest number of fatalities in the world. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students should not be made ""scapegoats"" for a wave of Covid outbreaks, says a lecturers' leader. Jo Grady of the UCU university staff union said it was the ""completely predictable"" outcome of encouraging large numbers of students to return. With universities in England returning, she called for them to switch as much as possible to online teaching. The Department for Education says it is supporting universities to have a mix of online and face-to-face teaching. Dr Grady saidtough restrictions on students in Scotlandand increasing warnings for students in England did not mean outbreaks were a consequence of ""reckless behaviour"" by students. Earlier, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid students were not
to blamefor recent outbreaks at the country's universities. Some students have claimed that they are being ""singled
out"" after they were told not to visit pubs or restaurants over the
weekend. Read
more from Sean Dr Tedros said he ""didn't believe"" the US's decision to withdraw from the WHO President Donald Trump ""doesn't have any good reason to withdraw"" the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said. President Trump announced the termination of the country's relationship with the WHO in May, accusing the UN agency of failing to hold China to account over the coronavirus pandemic. âMy first reaction was, to be honest, I didnât believe it,âDr Tedros said in an interview with Time Magazine,external. ""Even now I believe that the US administration doesnât have any good reason to withdraw from WHO."" In 2019, the US was the global health agency's largest single contributor,providing 15.18% of its total budget,external. Dr Tedros said the impact of US withdrawal was uncertain, but stressed it was the countryâs ""global leadership"" that mattered more to him than its financial contribution. Nevertheless, Dr Tedros was hopeful co-operation would prevail over division, especially when vaccines against Covid-19 are distributed. ""The basic principle we're following now, in terms of distribution of the vaccines, is to give vaccines to some people in all countries, not all people in some countries,"" he said. A policeman speaking to shop owners at a market in Jerusalem It has been a week since Israel went into its second nationwide lockdown, and nownew restrictions have come into effectto help stop the rise in cases. From this afternoon, businesses not officially considered essential were ordered closed, and travel restricted to 1km (0.6 miles) from people's homes. Other planned rules which would affect protesters and synagogue-goers have not yet been approved by parliament, amid disagreements. Covid-19 cases in Israel have continued to rise despite the latest lockdown. A new record of more than 8,000 infections for a single day were recorded on Thursday in Israel, which has one of the highest rates of infections per capita in the world. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam - and his wife Pamela - tested positive The governor of the US state of Virginia has tested positive for coronavirus. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam and his wife Pamela were both tested on Thursday, after a member of staff at their residence was found to have Covid-19, a statement released on the governor's website said. The governor is currently asymptomatic, while the first lady has mild symptoms. Both will isolate for 10 days, the statement added. He is the second governor in as many days to test positive, after Missouri Governor Mike Parson and his wife announced they had been infected on Thursday. The news comes ahead of a planned rally by President Donald Trump in the state, which health officials have warned could pose a ""severe health risk"". According to the Washington Post, the director of the local health district had asked the company that operates the airport where the rally is planned to adhere to the state's 250-person limit on gatherings. A further 6,874 UK coronavirus cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, according to thelatest government figures,external. There have also been 34 deaths, according to the statistics, but the government says this does not including Scotland due to a power outage at National Records of Scotland. In
an interview with the Guardian,external, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says household
visits must soon be banned for the capital's nine million residents. His remarks come after London councils said that London is now on England's coronavirus watchlist - which is expected to be confirmed by Public Health England later. Khan tells the the newspaper: ""It's obviously bad news that London is an area of concern. ""But the good news is that finally the government will pull their finger out and give us additional support."" He said he had lobbied the prime minister for tougher measures in London, saying: ""If you go too late, we will already be in a north-east, north-west, Birmingham-type situation. You've got to go early, particular in the absence of testing. ""One of the things that I said to the prime minister is: I think we should be following what's happening around the country and stopping social mixing of households , and I say that with a heavy heart."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the rise in cases was ""very worrying"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has expressed alarm over a âworryingâ rise of coronavirus infections in the Netherlands, warning of new measures to control the disease. Rutte issued the warning as the country saw another daily record of new coronavirus infections on Friday, tallying 2,777 over the past 24 hours. Cases have risen sharply since the beginning of September. ""The figures look downright terrible,â the PM told reporters at a news conference. âIn short, the situation is very worrisome and will force us to take extra measures.â He said the new measures will be announced next week.

"A trial of a new vaccine that appears to train the immune system to fight coronavirus has begun in the UK. Early tests showed the jab, developed by US biotechnology company Novavax, leads to high levels of virus-fighting antibodies being produced. The trial on 10,000 people will now see if the vaccine can prevent people getting ill. The UK government has already ordered 60 million doses in case it proves successful. A vaccine that can protect people from Covid-19 is still widely seen as the main exit strategy from the restrictions on all our lives. The Novavax jab is only the second to enter large scale trials in the UK; the otherhas been developed by the University of Oxford. Some of the vaccines being developed for Covid-19 use either completely new or barely proven technologies. Novavax are using traditional methods - proteins from the coronavirus that cannot replicate in the body and a chemical, called an adjuvant, to boost the immune response. ""It's a technology that we are more familiar with,"" Prof Paul Heath, who is leading the trial at St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, told the BBC. He added: ""This is an open field and we don't know what will work, that is the truthful answer here,. And that's the reason there are so many different vaccine candidates."" SYMPTOMS:85% of people have one of these three symptoms VACCINES:How close are we to a vaccine? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? Early trial data on 83 people,published in the New England Journal of Medicine,external, showed the vaccine appeared safe. Blood samples from those injected showed the volunteers were producing antibodies that could neutralise the coronavirus and another part of the immune system, called T-cells, were also trained to fight the virus. While this is a promising sign, it is not enough to prove the vaccine can either stop infection or prevent someone developing the severest form of the disease. Ten thousand people will take part in the trial and at least a quarter of them will be over 65, the age-group most at risk of severe Covid-19. Some of the volunteers will be picked from those who havesigned up to take part in clinical trials run by the NHS,external. Half will be given two doses of the vaccine, three weeks apart, and the rest will be given a dummy jab called a placebo. However, it will take months - probably early 2021 - before we know if the vaccine is successful. The vaccine has been tested in animals and small numbers of people already ""This is a really exciting moment, this is only the second phase three efficacy trial in the UK,"" Prof Heath told the BBC. ""This vaccine looks like an excellent candidate to be protective against Covid-19, but we need now to prove that."" The vaccine will be manufactured in Stockton-on-Tees. Kate Bingham, chairwoman of the government's Vaccines Taskforce, said: ""Finding a safe and effective vaccine that works for the majority of the UK population is the best way to tackle this devastating disease. ""Whilst social distancing, testing and other measures can help reduce the impact of coronavirus, the only long-term solution to beating it will be finding a vaccine.""

"Universities must make sure food and essentials are delivered to students self-isolating at campuses across Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Several unisare dealing with coronavirus outbreaks, with many students in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen and Edinburgh being told to stay in. The first minister will remind university heads of their ""big responsibility"" to students later. Scotland students have beentold to avoid pubs and partiesthis weekend. The stricter guidelines have been criticised by the National Union of Students Scotland as ""unjustified"" and ""deeply concerning"". President Matt Crilly said it showed a ""complete disregard"" for students' mental health and wellbeing. Speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat's political editor Daniel Rosney, Ms Sturgeon said she wasn't blaming students. ""It's not their fault, it's nobody's fault. Covid is nobody's fault. ""But we all have to play our parts and try and to get it under control."" A total of 172 Glasgow University students have so far tested positive, with 600 in isolation, while all 500 residents at the Parker House halls in Dundee have been told to quarantine. The first minister said students were being asked not to go to the pub just for this weekend, adding that it was incorrect to say the measures were in place for longer. ""I think last night, there was a sense that we were saying to students, for the foreseeable future, do not to go to pubs. That's not what we're saying."" But she didn't rule out that it could happen again. ""I've tried to be really straight with people in how we're dealing with this. ""I can't see into the future in any certain sense. I don't have a crystal ball."" Self-isolation: PPE to pee and running out of food What do campus outbreaks mean for students? Sex and coronavirus: What are the rules? Household mixing is banned under stricter regulations announced this week for Scotland, and Nicola Sturgeon expects students to follow the rules. That means the start of university is very different to normal. When asked about sex with new partners, she said: ""There are limits to what I'm going to say to students about the regulation of their intimate private lives. ""But I, a student, anybody else, is not allowed to be in somebody else's house right now. ""Because we know that is one of the big risks of the virus spreading.""

"The areas join other regions where people are told not to mix in homes and gardens Coronavirus restrictions are to be tightened again in Stockport and Wigan and introduced in Blackpool for the first time amid rising cases. People will be banned from mixing with other households in their homes or private gardens from midnight. Wigan's weekly infection rate rose to 107 cases per 100,000 on 20 Sep. Stockport had 71 cases per 100,000 in the same week and Blackpool had 70. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the measures would be kept under review. Similar rules are already in place,externalacross Greater Manchester andthe rest of Lancashire. Bolton hastighter restrictions,including bars and pubs being takeaway only. Mr Hancock said it would be ""difficult news"" for people but the government did not take these decisions lightly. Blackpool had been excluded from a Lancashire-wide ban on households mixing introduced,along with parts of West Yorkshire and the Midlands, last week. Blackpool Council's director of public health, Dr Arif Rajpura, said there had since been a ""significant rise"" and figures showed ""a lot of our transmission has been in households"" so it was ""appropriate"" to impose a restriction on household mixing. Wigan MP Lisa Nandytweeted,external: ""I know how hard it is but to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed please follow the guidance."" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said there was a steady rise of cases across the region Rules wereeased in Wiganon 26 August, just a month after Greater Manchester-wide restrictions came into force, as the council said residents had ""done their bit"" to reduce cases. Stockporthad its restrictions liftedthe following week. The new measures are in addition to national restrictions, includingthe rule of 6anda curfew for bars and restaurantsof 22:00. Conservative MP for Hazel Grove William Wragg said he had argued that national measures should have been allowed to ""bed in first"" and he hoped this would be ""reviewed frequently"" and lifted as soon as possible. Mr Hancock said he was imposing restrictions on inter-household mixing in Stockport, Wigan, Blackpool and alsoLeeds. People living in these areas will: Not be allowed to gather in a private dwelling or garden with any other household Not be allowed to visit people in private dwellings or gardens in other areas Support bubbles will not be affected by the new rules and friends and family can still provideinformal childcarefor children under 14. There are also exemptions for work purposes or to provide care to a vulnerable person. Other areas like Oldham have been under restrictions since August Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham earlier said figures were ""creeping up"" across Greater Manchester but it was ""happening steadily"". Eight out of 10 boroughs have more than 100 cases per 100,000 and Bolton has more than 200, he said. Mr Burnham said it was ""difficult to argue against measures which seek to try and bring those numbers under control but there is a limit to what any restrictions like this could achieve"". ""Fixing NHS Test and Trace seems to be better than piling more restrictions on,"" he said. Neil Jack, chief executive of Blackpool Council, said the health of the town's residents was of ""paramount importance"". He said there was ""no evidence"" of any direct links between increased infection rates and tourism, but he would continue to put a high focus on ensuring visitors and tourism businesses ""do the right thing"".

"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to place limits on the number of items shoppers can buy, following a similar move by rival Morrisons. It now has a three-items per customer limit on flour, dried pasta, toilet roll, baby wipes and some wet wipes. The supermarkets are acting to prevent a repeat of the panic-buying that led to shortages in March. The managing director of Iceland told the BBC he is urging shoppers to ""calm down and carry on as normal"". Richard Walker said his supermarket chain was not currently considering limiting purchases on any lines.  He said there had been a small uptick in interest in the ""usual suspect products"" like toilet roll, but it was ""nothing like last time"". Mr Walker said that, in March and April, this had resulted in elderly and vulnerable people, as well as NHS workers, being faced with empty shelves.  He described panic buying as socially divisive, only an option to those who can afford it. Tesco said it had ""introduced bulk-buy limits on a small number of products"". It said this was to ""ensure that everyone can keep buying what they need"". ""We have good availability, with plenty of stock to go round, and we would encourage our customers to shop as normal,"" it said. The supermarket has introduced additional limits for a small number of products online, such as rice and canned veg. Morrisons introduced a limit of three items per customeron some ranges on Thursday, including toilet rolls and disinfectant products. It said stock levels ""were good"", but it wanted to ""make sure they were available for everyone"". In March, UK supermarkets were forced to take steps to prevent shoppers from panic-buying around the height of the pandemic. Many introduced limits on the number of certain items that customers could buy, such as flour, pasta or toilet roll. Enhanced measures introduced in recent weeks have not triggered stock-piling by customers, according to several supermarkets approached by the BBC earlier this week.Tesco joins Morrisons to limit sales of some items Asda said it still had good availability in-store and online, while Waitrose said it had ""good levels"" of stock and that it had also looked at the items people bought early in lockdown and planned ahead accordingly.

We leave you with a
round-up of today's biggest developments from the UK.  Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, Joseph Lee,
Victoria Bissett, Paul Gribben, Joshua Nevett and Emma Harrison Thanks for joining us. Marseille's restaurant and bar owners have rebelled against coronavirus restrictions Weâre pausing our live coverage for the day soon. In case you missed them, here are some of todayâs main headlines from around the world. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned of a looming spike in infections Two of Canada's most populous provinces have moved to impose further restrictions on social gatherings, as they seek to stem rising coronavirus infections. In Quebec, Health Minister Christian DubÃ© urged people to avoid social gatherings
for 28 days. DubÃ© made the plea as the eastern province recorded a further 637 new cases on Friday, up 10% from the day before. Ontario, the most populous province, also saw a rise in new cases. In response, Premier Doug Ford announced on Friday that bars, restaurants
and strip clubs will have to close by midnight, and stop serving alcohol by 23:00 local time. On a national level, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resumed his daily Covid-19 briefing, which he had paused over the summer as cases declined. In a televised address on Tuesday, he warned that ""we are on the brink of a fall
that could be much worse than the spring"". Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics This weekâs report on
coronavirus hotspots from Public Health England has a new analysis. It shows that the most common
activity people recall doing before their coronavirus symptoms began is eating
out. MPs wrote to Baroness Dido
Harding, the head of NHS Test and Trace, earlier this week asking her to share
the evidence behind the 22:00 curfew and table service restrictions. Contact tracers asked people
what activities they had been doing in the days leading up to their coronavirus
symptoms. The most common answer from
the 45,000 people questioned was eating out (15%) closely followed by shopping
(13%). We canât say for certain if
this is where people picked up their infection, and canât say anything about
the people who donât pick up the phone to contact tracers. But it adds some evidence to
the public debate about the measures the government have announced. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem A political row has continued over the tightening of Covid-19 restrictions in Israel, a week after the country became the first in the world to begin asecond nationwide lockdown. Critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accuse him of trying to block the regular protests against him and his handling of the crisis. New rules came into effect at 14:00 (12:00 BST) local time, just ahead of the Israeli weekend. They close most workplaces and markets. Synagogues are to stay closed except on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which begins on Sunday evening. In parliament, Netanyahu was blocked from pushing through emergency measures to prevent the protests that have become a regular event outside his Jerusalem residence. However, anti-Netanyahu groups now say they will form a protest convoy to make their way there with participants, going no further than the 1km (0.6 mile) limit from their homes. One group is urging protesters to stage events on their balconies. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The original app was trialled on the Isle of Wight The original NHS Covid-19 app, which was shelved, would have worked on a larger number of handsets than the app which launched in England and Wales this week, I have discovered. VMware Pivotal, the firm behind it, has just published its software code. It shows that it works on 97.5% of handsets, and provides more accurate measurements of contacts between users. One expert told me the first app was better - but VMware Pivotal says it does not wish to compete. The new app doesn't work with a variety of older phones, including iPhones made before 2015, and Android phones not running the Android 6.0 operating system or above. It can also generate false readings of close contacts in a third of cases. Read
more Restaurants were allowed to expand outdoor dining in New York City earlier this year Outdoor dining will be a permanent, year-round fixture of the restaurant scene in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced. The Open Restaurant initiative allowed 9,000 restaurants to reopen their doors and expand outdoor-dining services to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The initiative was set to expire on 31 October, but on Friday Mayor de Blasio said it would continue indefinitely. Outdoor dining throughout the cooler autumn and winter months would be an âimportant part of how we recover as a cityâ, he said. âI believe this is going to make it a lot easier for restaurants to survive,â the mayor said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the initiative will help restaurants survive Restaurants will be required to observe social-distancing restrictions when indoor dining returns in New York City on 30 September. More outdoor space will enable restaurants to accommodate more customers, saving thousands of jobs. The industry has welcomed the mayorâs announcement, with restaurant group NYC Hospitality Alliance hailing the move as a âcritical lifeline for thousands of small businessesâ. We reported earlier on confirmation from London Councils, which represents the city's 33 councils, that the UK capital had beenput on the coronavirus watchlist. Public Health England's latestcoronavirus weekly surveillance report,externalhas now been published and confirms all of London's boroughs have been made areas of ""concern"". The report shows the incidence rates in the capital, with the rate in the City of London estimated at 11.5 per 100,000 people, while in Havering it is 30.3. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said: ""The placement of London on the watchlist as an area of concern is a reflection of the rising number of cases of Covid-19 being shown by a range of indicators. ""We are currently seeing much more widespread transmission in the city and being recognised as an area of concern is an important step in our efforts to control the virus."" He says the new status ""will enable us to respond more rapidly and with additional measures should cases rise further and faster"". Dr Mike Ryan said two million deaths were possible even with an effective vaccine The deaths of two million people with Covid-19 is âvery likelyâ unless the world takes comprehensive action to curb the spread of the disease, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) expert has warned. Dr Mike Ryan was asked on Friday whether two million fatalities worldwide was possible before a vaccine against the disease became available. âItâs certainly unimaginable, but itâs not impossible,â Dr Ryan told a media briefing at the WHOâs headquarters in Geneva. Almost one million people have died with coronavirus worldwide since the disease first emerged in China late last year. Dr Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies team, said fatality rates were dropping as treatments for the disease improve. But he said better treatments and even an effective vaccine would not be enough on their own to prevent further deaths. âAre we prepared to do what it takes to avoid that number?,â Dr Ryan said, calling on governments to do everything within their power to control Covid-19. âUnless we do it all, the number you speak about is not only imaginable, but unfortunately and sadly, very likely.â Peter Mwai and Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the Covid-19 outbreak in Africa may have passed its peak, but warns governments not to be complacent as countries relax their restrictions. The number of new daily confirmed cases overall has been dropping for about two months now, although some countries are still seeing a rise in cases. The humanitarian relief body International Rescue Committee says it believes the true scale of the pandemic may be hiddenbecause of a lack of testing and issues with data.,external Andthe WHO says changes in testing capacity and strategycan also affect numbers. A series of local lockdowns have been announced today in the
north of England and in parts of Wales, including its two biggest cities. Different householdsin Leeds,Stockport,
Wigan and Blackpoolare banned from meeting in private homes or gardens in
an effort to slow rising cases of coronavirus from midnight. In Wales, Cardiff and the county of Swanseago into lockdown at 18:00 BST on
Sunday, 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli. People will not be able to enter or leave the areas without a
reasonable excuse, the Welsh government says. They will also not be able to meet indoors with anyone they do
not live with, with extended households suspended. Find outhow many coronavirus cases there are in your area  Denmark has had fewer cases than its European neighbours so far Denmark is the latest European country to see a second spike of coronavirus infections, mirroring a concerning pattern happening across the world. On Friday, Danish health minister Magnus Heunicke said restrictions already in place would be extended by two weeks until 19 October. ""A rise in new infections was expected, but it has come earlier than we had anticipated,"" Heunicke told a news conference. Under the rules, public gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. Denmark has fared better than many other European countries,recording 24,357 cases and 643 deaths,external, the latest WHO data shows. However, the country has seen a pronounced spike in recent days, tallying 678 on Friday. The US remains in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, because infections have not decreased sufficiently since the initial outbreak, the country's leading infectious diseases expert has said. Dr Anthony Fauci said the second wave of a pandemic happens when infections of a disease subside significantly before a marked resurgence at a later date. During the flu pandemic of 1918, for example, infections spiked in the spring then ""literally disappeared"", before an âexplosionâ of cases in autumn, Dr Fauci said. ""Rather than say, 'a second wave,' why don't we say, 'are we prepared for the challenge of the fall and the winter?',""Dr Fauci told CNN,external. World Health Organization (WHO) data shows,externalthe US has recorded more than 13,000 new infections of coronavirus a day since late March. New cases dipped slightly after hitting a peak of 74,354 on 19 July, but have continued to increase by at least 40,000 a day since then, according to the data. At least 202,000 people have died with Covid-19 so far in the US, the highest number of fatalities in the world. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students should not be made ""scapegoats"" for a wave of Covid outbreaks, says a lecturers' leader. Jo Grady of the UCU university staff union said it was the ""completely predictable"" outcome of encouraging large numbers of students to return. With universities in England returning, she called for them to switch as much as possible to online teaching. The Department for Education says it is supporting universities to have a mix of online and face-to-face teaching. Dr Grady saidtough restrictions on students in Scotlandand increasing warnings for students in England did not mean outbreaks were a consequence of ""reckless behaviour"" by students. Earlier, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid students were not
to blamefor recent outbreaks at the country's universities. Some students have claimed that they are being ""singled
out"" after they were told not to visit pubs or restaurants over the
weekend. Read
more from Sean Dr Tedros said he ""didn't believe"" the US's decision to withdraw from the WHO President Donald Trump ""doesn't have any good reason to withdraw"" the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said. President Trump announced the termination of the country's relationship with the WHO in May, accusing the UN agency of failing to hold China to account over the coronavirus pandemic. âMy first reaction was, to be honest, I didnât believe it,âDr Tedros said in an interview with Time Magazine,external. ""Even now I believe that the US administration doesnât have any good reason to withdraw from WHO."" In 2019, the US was the global health agency's largest single contributor,providing 15.18% of its total budget,external. Dr Tedros said the impact of US withdrawal was uncertain, but stressed it was the countryâs ""global leadership"" that mattered more to him than its financial contribution. Nevertheless, Dr Tedros was hopeful co-operation would prevail over division, especially when vaccines against Covid-19 are distributed. ""The basic principle we're following now, in terms of distribution of the vaccines, is to give vaccines to some people in all countries, not all people in some countries,"" he said. A policeman speaking to shop owners at a market in Jerusalem It has been a week since Israel went into its second nationwide lockdown, and nownew restrictions have come into effectto help stop the rise in cases. From this afternoon, businesses not officially considered essential were ordered closed, and travel restricted to 1km (0.6 miles) from people's homes. Other planned rules which would affect protesters and synagogue-goers have not yet been approved by parliament, amid disagreements. Covid-19 cases in Israel have continued to rise despite the latest lockdown. A new record of more than 8,000 infections for a single day were recorded on Thursday in Israel, which has one of the highest rates of infections per capita in the world. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam - and his wife Pamela - tested positive The governor of the US state of Virginia has tested positive for coronavirus. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam and his wife Pamela were both tested on Thursday, after a member of staff at their residence was found to have Covid-19, a statement released on the governor's website said. The governor is currently asymptomatic, while the first lady has mild symptoms. Both will isolate for 10 days, the statement added. He is the second governor in as many days to test positive, after Missouri Governor Mike Parson and his wife announced they had been infected on Thursday. The news comes ahead of a planned rally by President Donald Trump in the state, which health officials have warned could pose a ""severe health risk"". According to the Washington Post, the director of the local health district had asked the company that operates the airport where the rally is planned to adhere to the state's 250-person limit on gatherings. A further 6,874 UK coronavirus cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, according to thelatest government figures,external. There have also been 34 deaths, according to the statistics, but the government says this does not including Scotland due to a power outage at National Records of Scotland. In
an interview with the Guardian,external, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says household
visits must soon be banned for the capital's nine million residents. His remarks come after London councils said that London is now on England's coronavirus watchlist - which is expected to be confirmed by Public Health England later. Khan tells the the newspaper: ""It's obviously bad news that London is an area of concern. ""But the good news is that finally the government will pull their finger out and give us additional support."" He said he had lobbied the prime minister for tougher measures in London, saying: ""If you go too late, we will already be in a north-east, north-west, Birmingham-type situation. You've got to go early, particular in the absence of testing. ""One of the things that I said to the prime minister is: I think we should be following what's happening around the country and stopping social mixing of households , and I say that with a heavy heart."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the rise in cases was ""very worrying"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has expressed alarm over a âworryingâ rise of coronavirus infections in the Netherlands, warning of new measures to control the disease. Rutte issued the warning as the country saw another daily record of new coronavirus infections on Friday, tallying 2,777 over the past 24 hours. Cases have risen sharply since the beginning of September. ""The figures look downright terrible,â the PM told reporters at a news conference. âIn short, the situation is very worrisome and will force us to take extra measures.â He said the new measures will be announced next week. The coronavirus situation in The Hague, Rotterdam and Amsterdam was of particular concern, he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

""But the good news is that finally the government will pull their finger out and give us additional support."" He said he had lobbied the prime minister for tougher measures in London, saying: ""If you go too late, we will already be in a north-east, north-west, Birmingham-type situation.

"This video can not be played Nell Manson and Lucy Owens are self-isolating at the University of Glasgow Students caught up in a spate of Covid outbreaks have questioned why university halls were allowed to open. They have been told not tovisit pubs or restaurants this weekendor go home after hundreds of students across Scotland tested positive for the virus. However, many have called the outbreaks inevitable given students were encouraged back to campus. The Scottish government said all efforts were focused on stopping further transmission of the virus. Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? One of the worst affected halls is Glasgow University's Murano Street residences where at least 172 students have tested positive for Covid-19 and hundreds more are self isolating. Lucy Owens, a student living in the Murano complex and who has coronavirus, questioned why students had been brought back given so much learning had moved online. She asked on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""What are we paying for? I could do everything I am doing from my house, so why have they sent us here? ""I know we're making the most of this accommodation because we're stuck in it all day but we're not really making the most of being at university. ""Putting two thousand students into such a confined area, something like this was bound to happen."" Scottish university students told not to go to pubs PPE to pee and running out of food University outbreaks 'should have been predicted' Fellow student Nell Manson said keeping students out of pubs and restaurants was not the answer. She said: ""More things will be happening in accommodations. ""In pubs and restaurants there are lots of social distancing measures, you can't even get up from your table without a mask. ""It lends itself to people socialising in other ways where there's not such strict rules."" Students in Glasgow have been getting tests and told to self isolate Tessa Morrison, 17, who is studying politics at Glasgow University, said she has had a positive Covid diagnosis and is living with 10 other people, some of whom also have the virus. The students all have their own rooms but share two bathrooms and one kitchen. She said it was ""difficult to avoid people"" in this setup, adding, ""They should have waited until at least Christmas to let us come here, I do think they are just trying to make money off us being in halls and they knew this was inevitably going to happen."" Glasgow University said the positive cases were due to social activity during Freshers Week There are currently about 250,000 students in Scotland, with up to 35,000 living in university halls and 10,000 in private halls. Covid outbreaks have been reported at halls of residence in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Arturo Morselli, a student from Italy studying at St Andrews University but living in Dundee, said he felt left in limbo by the current situation. He said: ""My belief is that universities are trying to avoid accountability in the sense that they are not taking decisions. ""We students are caught up in the fact that no one wants to take responsibility for what's going on and we are the ones caught up in it and we don't know if it's worth the money we are paying."" Isobelle Robinson-Gordon described her university experience to date as ""very ostracising"" Isobelle Robinson-Gordon, a first year student at Edinburgh University, said her experience had been ""very isolating"" so far. She said: ""I've moved to Edinburgh. I'm in accommodation, but all the learning is online. I'm frustrated. ""A lot of students are here and ready to learn, but it's all online. It's the lack of direction. It's debilitating. ""We've not had any guidance from the university. Everything we're learning is from the news media."" Helen Kirkpatrick's daughter is a second year student at Glasgow's Strathclyde University and is staying in private halls. She said: ""After going back there she has found out that all classes will be online for the first semester. ""She's signed an agreement and paid a lot of money to stay there and what for? Now she is essentially imprisoned? ""She could have studied at home - I think the Scottish government could have handled this a lot better."" Universities in Scotland have agreed to introduce a ""yellow card, red card"" system for breaches of student discipline that put students and others at risk, which could result in an end to their studies. Higher Education Minister Richard Lochhead said this, and curbs on going to hospitality this weekend, was about trying to stop the virus spreading. He said: ""This is an ask of the student population of Scotland from universities. The Scottish  government support that, but the universities are asking the students jointly across Scotland this weekend - given we've got a number of outbreaks of the virus and some campuses across Scotland - to have the weekend off from socialising out-with the households."" ""The vast majority of students have been so responsible, it's a very tough time for them."" Mr Lochhead added that ""it's not stigmatising students, it's not about saying they're particularly to blame for what's happening."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government was trying to strike the right balance between protecting public health and ensuring there is a ""degree of normality around education"". She told Radio 1 Newsbeat: ""Students deserve to have a campus experience. They deserve to have some kind of normality in their life. So people will have different views about the rights and wrongs."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"WHO expert says deaths of two million people from Covid-19 is 'very likely' without global action A further 6,874 UK Covid-19 cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, with 34 deaths New restrictions are announced in Leeds, where the city council reported a ""steep rise"" in infections on Thursday Two of Wales' biggest cities - Cardiff and Swansea - will go into lockdown from 18:00 BST on Sunday London is at a ""very worrying tipping point"" amid a resurgence of Covid-19, the mayor has warned In Madrid, over a million people will be under local lockdown restrictions from Monday as curbs are extended More than 32 million virus cases have been confirmed globally with nearly 984,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Paul Gribben We're pausing the coronavirus live page for now but will be back on Saturday morning. We leave you with a
round-up of today's biggest developments from the UK.  Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, Joseph Lee,
Victoria Bissett, Paul Gribben, Joshua Nevett and Emma Harrison Thanks for joining us. Marseille's restaurant and bar owners have rebelled against coronavirus restrictions Weâre pausing our live coverage for the day soon. In case you missed them, here are some of todayâs main headlines from around the world. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned of a looming spike in infections Two of Canada's most populous provinces have moved to impose further restrictions on social gatherings, as they seek to stem rising coronavirus infections. In Quebec, Health Minister Christian DubÃ© urged people to avoid social gatherings
for 28 days. DubÃ© made the plea as the eastern province recorded a further 637 new cases on Friday, up 10% from the day before. Ontario, the most populous province, also saw a rise in new cases. In response, Premier Doug Ford announced on Friday that bars, restaurants
and strip clubs will have to close by midnight, and stop serving alcohol by 23:00 local time. On a national level, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resumed his daily Covid-19 briefing, which he had paused over the summer as cases declined. In a televised address on Tuesday, he warned that ""we are on the brink of a fall
that could be much worse than the spring"". Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics This weekâs report on
coronavirus hotspots from Public Health England has a new analysis. It shows that the most common
activity people recall doing before their coronavirus symptoms began is eating
out. MPs wrote to Baroness Dido
Harding, the head of NHS Test and Trace, earlier this week asking her to share
the evidence behind the 22:00 curfew and table service restrictions. Contact tracers asked people
what activities they had been doing in the days leading up to their coronavirus
symptoms. The most common answer from
the 45,000 people questioned was eating out (15%) closely followed by shopping
(13%). We canât say for certain if
this is where people picked up their infection, and canât say anything about
the people who donât pick up the phone to contact tracers. But it adds some evidence to
the public debate about the measures the government have announced. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem A political row has continued over the tightening of Covid-19 restrictions in Israel, a week after the country became the first in the world to begin asecond nationwide lockdown. Critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accuse him of trying to block the regular protests against him and his handling of the crisis. New rules came into effect at 14:00 (12:00 BST) local time, just ahead of the Israeli weekend. They close most workplaces and markets. Synagogues are to stay closed except on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which begins on Sunday evening. In parliament, Netanyahu was blocked from pushing through emergency measures to prevent the protests that have become a regular event outside his Jerusalem residence. However, anti-Netanyahu groups now say they will form a protest convoy to make their way there with participants, going no further than the 1km (0.6 mile) limit from their homes. One group is urging protesters to stage events on their balconies. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The original app was trialled on the Isle of Wight The original NHS Covid-19 app, which was shelved, would have worked on a larger number of handsets than the app which launched in England and Wales this week, I have discovered. VMware Pivotal, the firm behind it, has just published its software code. It shows that it works on 97.5% of handsets, and provides more accurate measurements of contacts between users. One expert told me the first app was better - but VMware Pivotal says it does not wish to compete. The new app doesn't work with a variety of older phones, including iPhones made before 2015, and Android phones not running the Android 6.0 operating system or above. It can also generate false readings of close contacts in a third of cases. Read
more Restaurants were allowed to expand outdoor dining in New York City earlier this year Outdoor dining will be a permanent, year-round fixture of the restaurant scene in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced. The Open Restaurant initiative allowed 9,000 restaurants to reopen their doors and expand outdoor-dining services to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The initiative was set to expire on 31 October, but on Friday Mayor de Blasio said it would continue indefinitely. Outdoor dining throughout the cooler autumn and winter months would be an âimportant part of how we recover as a cityâ, he said. âI believe this is going to make it a lot easier for restaurants to survive,â the mayor said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the initiative will help restaurants survive Restaurants will be required to observe social-distancing restrictions when indoor dining returns in New York City on 30 September. More outdoor space will enable restaurants to accommodate more customers, saving thousands of jobs. The industry has welcomed the mayorâs announcement, with restaurant group NYC Hospitality Alliance hailing the move as a âcritical lifeline for thousands of small businessesâ. We reported earlier on confirmation from London Councils, which represents the city's 33 councils, that the UK capital had beenput on the coronavirus watchlist. Public Health England's latestcoronavirus weekly surveillance report,externalhas now been published and confirms all of London's boroughs have been made areas of ""concern"". The report shows the incidence rates in the capital, with the rate in the City of London estimated at 11.5 per 100,000 people, while in Havering it is 30.3. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said: ""The placement of London on the watchlist as an area of concern is a reflection of the rising number of cases of Covid-19 being shown by a range of indicators. ""We are currently seeing much more widespread transmission in the city and being recognised as an area of concern is an important step in our efforts to control the virus."" He says the new status ""will enable us to respond more rapidly and with additional measures should cases rise further and faster"". Dr Mike Ryan said two million deaths were possible even with an effective vaccine The deaths of two million people with Covid-19 is âvery likelyâ unless the world takes comprehensive action to curb the spread of the disease, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) expert has warned. Dr Mike Ryan was asked on Friday whether two million fatalities worldwide was possible before a vaccine against the disease became available. âItâs certainly unimaginable, but itâs not impossible,â Dr Ryan told a media briefing at the WHOâs headquarters in Geneva. Almost one million people have died with coronavirus worldwide since the disease first emerged in China late last year. Dr Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies team, said fatality rates were dropping as treatments for the disease improve. But he said better treatments and even an effective vaccine would not be enough on their own to prevent further deaths. âAre we prepared to do what it takes to avoid that number?,â Dr Ryan said, calling on governments to do everything within their power to control Covid-19. âUnless we do it all, the number you speak about is not only imaginable, but unfortunately and sadly, very likely.â Peter Mwai and Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the Covid-19 outbreak in Africa may have passed its peak, but warns governments not to be complacent as countries relax their restrictions. The number of new daily confirmed cases overall has been dropping for about two months now, although some countries are still seeing a rise in cases. The humanitarian relief body International Rescue Committee says it believes the true scale of the pandemic may be hiddenbecause of a lack of testing and issues with data.,external Andthe WHO says changes in testing capacity and strategycan also affect numbers. A series of local lockdowns have been announced today in the
north of England and in parts of Wales, including its two biggest cities. Different householdsin Leeds,Stockport,
Wigan and Blackpoolare banned from meeting in private homes or gardens in
an effort to slow rising cases of coronavirus from midnight. In Wales, Cardiff and the county of Swanseago into lockdown at 18:00 BST on
Sunday, 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli. People will not be able to enter or leave the areas without a
reasonable excuse, the Welsh government says. They will also not be able to meet indoors with anyone they do
not live with, with extended households suspended. Find outhow many coronavirus cases there are in your area  Denmark has had fewer cases than its European neighbours so far Denmark is the latest European country to see a second spike of coronavirus infections, mirroring a concerning pattern happening across the world. On Friday, Danish health minister Magnus Heunicke said restrictions already in place would be extended by two weeks until 19 October. ""A rise in new infections was expected, but it has come earlier than we had anticipated,"" Heunicke told a news conference. Under the rules, public gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. Denmark has fared better than many other European countries,recording 24,357 cases and 643 deaths,external, the latest WHO data shows. However, the country has seen a pronounced spike in recent days, tallying 678 on Friday. The US remains in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, because infections have not decreased sufficiently since the initial outbreak, the country's leading infectious diseases expert has said. Dr Anthony Fauci said the second wave of a pandemic happens when infections of a disease subside significantly before a marked resurgence at a later date. During the flu pandemic of 1918, for example, infections spiked in the spring then ""literally disappeared"", before an âexplosionâ of cases in autumn, Dr Fauci said. ""Rather than say, 'a second wave,' why don't we say, 'are we prepared for the challenge of the fall and the winter?',""Dr Fauci told CNN,external. World Health Organization (WHO) data shows,externalthe US has recorded more than 13,000 new infections of coronavirus a day since late March. New cases dipped slightly after hitting a peak of 74,354 on 19 July, but have continued to increase by at least 40,000 a day since then, according to the data. At least 202,000 people have died with Covid-19 so far in the US, the highest number of fatalities in the world. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students should not be made ""scapegoats"" for a wave of Covid outbreaks, says a lecturers' leader. Jo Grady of the UCU university staff union said it was the ""completely predictable"" outcome of encouraging large numbers of students to return. With universities in England returning, she called for them to switch as much as possible to online teaching. The Department for Education says it is supporting universities to have a mix of online and face-to-face teaching. Dr Grady saidtough restrictions on students in Scotlandand increasing warnings for students in England did not mean outbreaks were a consequence of ""reckless behaviour"" by students. Earlier, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid students were not
to blamefor recent outbreaks at the country's universities. Some students have claimed that they are being ""singled
out"" after they were told not to visit pubs or restaurants over the
weekend. Read
more from Sean Dr Tedros said he ""didn't believe"" the US's decision to withdraw from the WHO President Donald Trump ""doesn't have any good reason to withdraw"" the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said. President Trump announced the termination of the country's relationship with the WHO in May, accusing the UN agency of failing to hold China to account over the coronavirus pandemic. âMy first reaction was, to be honest, I didnât believe it,âDr Tedros said in an interview with Time Magazine,external. ""Even now I believe that the US administration doesnât have any good reason to withdraw from WHO."" In 2019, the US was the global health agency's largest single contributor,providing 15.18% of its total budget,external. Dr Tedros said the impact of US withdrawal was uncertain, but stressed it was the countryâs ""global leadership"" that mattered more to him than its financial contribution. Nevertheless, Dr Tedros was hopeful co-operation would prevail over division, especially when vaccines against Covid-19 are distributed. ""The basic principle we're following now, in terms of distribution of the vaccines, is to give vaccines to some people in all countries, not all people in some countries,"" he said. A policeman speaking to shop owners at a market in Jerusalem It has been a week since Israel went into its second nationwide lockdown, and nownew restrictions have come into effectto help stop the rise in cases. From this afternoon, businesses not officially considered essential were ordered closed, and travel restricted to 1km (0.6 miles) from people's homes. Other planned rules which would affect protesters and synagogue-goers have not yet been approved by parliament, amid disagreements. Covid-19 cases in Israel have continued to rise despite the latest lockdown. A new record of more than 8,000 infections for a single day were recorded on Thursday in Israel, which has one of the highest rates of infections per capita in the world. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam - and his wife Pamela - tested positive The governor of the US state of Virginia has tested positive for coronavirus. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam and his wife Pamela were both tested on Thursday, after a member of staff at their residence was found to have Covid-19, a statement released on the governor's website said. The governor is currently asymptomatic, while the first lady has mild symptoms. Both will isolate for 10 days, the statement added. He is the second governor in as many days to test positive, after Missouri Governor Mike Parson and his wife announced they had been infected on Thursday. The news comes ahead of a planned rally by President Donald Trump in the state, which health officials have warned could pose a ""severe health risk"". According to the Washington Post, the director of the local health district had asked the company that operates the airport where the rally is planned to adhere to the state's 250-person limit on gatherings.

"Mr Kim said the incident should never have happened North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has issued a rare personal apology for the killing of a South Korean official, Seoul says. Mr Kim reportedly told South Korean leader Moon Jae-in that the ""disgraceful affair"" should not have happened. South Korea has said the 47-year-old man was found by troops floating in the North's waters. He was then shot dead and his body was set alight, according to Seoul. It is not known what the man was doing there. The South Korean government has said he may have been trying to defect to the North but his family has denied this. The killing - the first of a South Korean citizen by North Korean forces for a decade - has caused outrage in the South. The border between the Koreas is tightly policed, and the North is thought to have a ""shoot-to-kill"" policy in place to prevent coronavirus from entering the country. Kim Yo-jong: North Korea's heir apparent? Kim Jong-un and the brutal North Korea rumour mill The apology came in the form of a letter sent to President Moon which acknowledged that the incident should not have happened, according to South Korea's presidential office, also known as the Blue House. The South Korean island of Yeonpyeong sits near the border with the North Mr Kim called it a ""disgraceful affair"" and said he felt ""very sorry"" for ""disappointing"" Mr Moon and the South Korean people, the Blue House said. It is the North's first official comment on the incident. The North also gave the South the results of its investigation - it said more than 10 shots were fired at the man, who had entered North Korean waters and then failed to reveal his identity and tried to flee, South Korea's director of national security Suh Hoon said. However the North insisted that it had not burned the man's body but rather the ""floating material"" that was carrying him. ""The troops could not locate the unidentified trespasser during a search after firing the shots, and burned the device under national emergency disease prevention measures,"" Mr Suh told a briefing, referring to the North Korean account. The presidential office in Seoul has also decided to release recent letters between the two leaders. In them Kim Jong-un said he understood ""more than anyone the kind of pressure and hardship"" required to overcome the coronavirus pandemic and damage from recent typhoons. It was the ""heartfelt truth"" that he shared the ""pain and suffering of the Southern people"", he said. This incident could have been a disaster for any hopes of rekindling talks between the South's President Moon and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. As it is many South Koreans will not forgive or forget easily. They are shocked and outraged at what appears to have been the brutal killing of an unarmed civilian in North Korean waters. It is yet another reminder of North Korea's often merciless regime. It's also worth noting that the North's account of the killing does not match the details given by officials in the South. However, this rare personal apology from Kim Jong-un may go some way to assuage Southern anger. If there had been no apology, Mr Kim's warm letter to Mr Moon would have been wasted. By at least attempting to smooth things over, Mr Kim may be signalling his willingness to keep talking. The father-of-two, who worked for the fisheries department, was on his patrol boat about 10km (6 miles) from the border with the North, near the island of Yeonpyeong, when he disappeared on Monday, the South Korean defence ministry said. He had left his shoes behind on the boat. South Korean media said he had recently divorced and had financial problems. A North Korean patrol boat found the man, who was wearing a life jacket, at sea at around 15:30 local time on Tuesday. They put gas masks on and questioned him from a distance before ""orders from [a] superior authority"" came in that the man be killed, South Korea said. He was shot dead in the water. South Korea says North Korean troops then burned the corpse at sea. President Moon Jae-in called the killing a ""shocking"" incident that could not be tolerated. He urged the North to take ""responsible"" measures over the attack. The country's National Security Council said the North could ""not justify shooting and burning the corpse of our unarmed citizen who showed no sign of resistance"". Officials said they had done a ""thorough analysis of diverse intelligence"", but it was not clear how exactly they had gathered the information. The military hotline between North and South was cut in June, and the inter-Korean liaison office, which was built to help both sides communicate,was destroyed by North Korea. But South Korean military is known to intercept the North's radio communications, AFP news agency reports. Mr Kim's apology comes at a time when relations between the North and South are at a low point and there is a stand-off between Pyongyang and Washington over the North's nuclear programme. South Korea has in the past demanded apologies from the North but these have rarely been forthcoming. The Northhas refused to apologise for the sinking of a South Korean warshipin 2010, in which 46 sailors died, and denies responsibility. It also refused to apologise for shelling a South Korean island the same year, killing two soldiers and two construction workers. The tiny South Korean island watching the horizon Why did North Korea destroy liaison office? Why was Korea divided? North Korea may be taking extra-tough measures to prevent the coronavirus from entering the country because it is thought to be preparing for a huge military parade on 10 October to mark the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party. Pyongyang closed its border with China in January to try to prevent the spread Covid-19. In July, North Korean state media said the country had raised its state of emergency to the maximum level. Last month, the commander of the US military's forces in South Korea, Robert Abrams, said the North had introduced a new ""buffer zone"" of one to two kilometres on the Chinese border, and that the country had special operation forces in place with orders to ""shoot-to-kill"" anyone coming across the border. In the past, North Korea has also returned people who have wandered into their territory. In 2017, state news agency KCNA said officials would repatriate a South Korean fishing boat which ""illegally"" crossed the border, in what was seen as a rare humanitarian move.

Two suspects have been arrested. One of them was seized in the nearby Bastille area with blood on his clothing, police told the BBC. Anti-terrorism police have taken over the investigation. A security cordon has been set up in the 11th arrondissement in eastern Paris. Nearby metro stations were closed and five schools in the area immediately went into lockdown. The schools were allowed to reopen some hours later. A blade - described as a machete or a meat cleaver - was recovered at the scene of the attack near the Boulevard Richard-Lenoir. Charlie Hebdo's head of HR 'forced out of home' Police quoted by French media said the ""main suspect"" was from Pakistan and the second person arrested was from Algeria. They have not yet been named and any connection between them has not been disclosed. The conditions of the victims have not been made public although French Prime Minister Jean Castex told reporters at the scene that their lives were not in danger. The attack comes as a high-profile trial is under way in Paris of 14 people accused of helping two jihadists carry out the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were killed. Heavily-armed police quickly sealed off the area The two people wounded were staff at a TV production company, one of their colleagues told AFP news agency. ""Two colleagues were smoking a cigarette outside the building, in the street. I heard shouting. I went to the window and saw one of my colleagues, covered in blood, being chased by a man with a machete in the street,"" another member of staff at the PremiÃ¨res Lignes production firm said. The firm has offices in the Rue Nicolas Appert, a side street off Boulevard Richard Lenoir where the former Charlie Hebdo offices are located. A mural to the 12 people killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack is nearby. The satirical magazine has since moved to a secret location. Mr Castex visited the scene accompanied by Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. The prime minister reiterated the government's ""firm commitment to combat terrorism by all possible means"". French Prime Minister Jean Castex visited the scene flanked by Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo At a news conference, anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard confirmed that the ""main perpetrator"" had been arrested and said a ""second individual"" was also in custody. ""The investigation will continue,"" he said. Charles Michel, President of the European Council and former Belgian PM, expressed his ""full solidarity with the French people"". ""All my thoughts are with the victims of this cowardly act of violence. Terror has no place on European territory,"" he tweeted. In a tweet, Charlie Hebdo expressed its ""support and solidarity with its former neighbours... and the people affected by this odious attack"". Charlie Hebdo has marked the start of the trial by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked protests in several Muslim countries. In response, the militant group al-Qaeda renewed its threat to the magazine. The magazine's head of human resources said earlier this week thatshe had moved out of her home after receiving death threats. The defendants in the trial are also accused of helping another jihadist carry out a related attack in which he shot dead a policewoman, then attacked a Jewish store, killing four people. The 17 victims were killed over a period of three days. All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead.

"Cardiff, Swansea and Llanelli will face local restrictions from the weekend Health minister Vaughan Gething made the announcement at the Welsh Government's regular coronavirus briefing Six council areas in the south are already under tighter restrictions It means about 1.5 million people will not be allowed to leave their area without a reasonable excuse like work or education The rules will last for at least another week in Caerphilly, the first area in Wales to enter local lockdown Three more people have died with the virus, Public Health Wales figures show Caleb Spencer and Richard Porter Thanks for joining us for the news that new areas - Cardiff, Swansea and Llanelli - will be facing further restrictions from the weekend. You can read all the detailshere. And find out what the new rules mean withthis guide. You can watch Health Minister Vaughan Gething explaining the decision in this video. This video can not be played ""Don't treat this weekend as a big blow-out""  The infection rates in areas to be placed in local lockdowns this weekend are among the highest in Wales, latest Public Health Wales figures show. In the last seven days, Swansea had 56.3 positive cases per 100,000 people and Cardiff had 37.9. Carmarthenshire, which is home to Llanelli, had 45 cases per 100,000 people. Blaenau Gwent - already under lockdown - has the highest rate in Wales with 201.8 per 100,000. Vaughan Gething said ministers would be looking at the data for Neath Port Talbot (25.8),
the Vale of Glamorgan (24) and Torfaen (28.7) over the weekend to decide whether measures will be needed in those counties. There have been three further deaths with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales, bringing the total to 1,609. The number of new cases of coronavirus has increased by 320, bringing the total to 22,215. It comes asrestrictions are announcedfor
Cardiff and Swansea counties and Llanelli - by Sunday eight counties and one
town will be in lockdown in Wales. ""There isn't a need to go and to buy large amounts of items,"" Vaughan Gething said, responding to reports of panic buying at supermarkets across Wales. ""It's about people still being calm and reflecting the fact that there has
always been enough food on the shelves and other items throughout the very
height of the first wave, and we're taking action at an earlier point than we
did [before]."" He said he did not think he had
to comment on the ""morality of people stocking up"".  The Brexit Party's Mark Reckless has taken to social media to ""strongly oppose"" the health minister's announcement of further local lockdowns.

Not all of Llanelli will be subject to tighter restrictions on Saturday. People can check by entering their post code onthe council's website,external. The wards covered will be: The Welsh Conservatives' health spokesman says he is ""confused"" about the reasons for imposing lockdowns on different days. Llanelli will see tighter restrictions from Saturday, while Cardiff and Swansea will enter local lockdown on Sunday. Andrew RT Davies said the party had been ""calling for the use of more detailed data and the introduction of smart, hyperlocal lockdowns"". He said he took ""some comfort"" it had happened in Llanelli, but questioned why it was not possible in Swansea and Cardiff. âI have to say Iâm also confused as to why the local
lockdowns are being imposed on different days in Cardiff and Swansea, and
Llanelli,"" he added. ""Covid doesnât know one day from the next, and I didnât find the health ministerâs explanation that satisfactory."" Imposing restrictions in Cardiff and Swansea on Sunday rather than Saturday will allow people ""to plan for and prepare for moving out over the weekend"", the health minister said. ""There are
likely to be more people across Cardiff and Swansea who need to reorder what
they are already doing,"" Vaughan Gething added. Plaid Cymru says the Welsh Government's ""hyperlocal"" lockdown of Llanelli ""makes sense"", but are calling for it to be used elsewhere. The party's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth called for ""the earlier closing of pubs and bars as a temporary measure in other areas, so as to help avoid further county-wide restrictions"". âThe domino effect of local authority areas being closed
doesnât have to be inevitable, but will become so if more far-reaching
preventative measures are not brought in."" As Cardiff, Swansea and Llanelli head into lockdown, how will it affect what you can and can't do? Read more here. Asked why Llanelli will be subject to tighter restrictions rather than the broader Carmarthenshire county, Mr Gething said there was âa particular challenge around the town
that is well identified, a significant spread that is not in control"". ""Weâve spoken to the local authority,"" he continued, ""weâve spoken to the local health board and
we understand the need to act and act as soon as possible. ""If the same
prevalence rates were in Cardiff and Swansea then the rates of infection would
be much much higher."" Asked why he was not announcing
a lockdown across the whole of Wales, Vaughan Gething said ministers were making decisions
based on ""intelligence around the country"". Answering questions from journalists,
he said there was a ""different pattern in north Wales compared to south
Wales"". The health minister said there
would be meetings with ""colleagues across the government but also local
authority leaders through the weekend and [weâll] then have to make
choices"". He said the ""pattern of
coronavirus can change so significantly and so quickly"". Here's a list of the nine areas which will face local restrictions as of 18:00 BST on Sunday: Llanelli will be the first area that is not an entire county to be locked down The Welsh Government does not currently have any ""additional financial provision"" for businesses in local lockdown areas, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said it was in discussion with the UK government about further support, but said Chancellor Rishi Sunak's statement on Thursday did not set out more cash for businesses affected. Mr Gething said the Welsh Government's
budget was to ""help us survive known threats we do have"". He called on the UK government for a ""further package"". The new lockdowns are âto protect health and prevent the further spread of coronavirusâ, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. But people in Cardiff and Swansea should not âtreat this weekend
as a final blow-outâ, he said. The Llanelli lockdown is the first not to cover a whole
local authority area. A postcode finder will be made available online to
make clear which areas are under lockdown, said Mr Gething. He said eight out of 10 cases in Carmarthenshire were in the town of Llanelli. Cardiff and Swansea will be placed under local lockdown
measures from 18:00 BST on Sunday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. The same measures will also apply in Llanelli from 18:00 on Saturday. People living
in Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and
Newport cannot leave their areas without a reasonable excuse after they were placed in lockdown. The changes mean around 1.5m people will be under local
restrictions, a little under half the Welsh population. Cardiff, Swansea and Llanelli will become the latest areas
to face local restrictions, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has announced. The rules will come into force in the capital and Swansea
on Sunday, while people living in Llanelli will be subject to them from
Saturday. There are currently six counties under local restrictions in Wales after Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and Newport joined Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly in facing new rules. For the 854,000 people in those areas, it means a number of things have changed for the foreseeable future. Here's a guideto what you can and can't do. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Cardiff has seen 38.2 cases per 100,000 people in the past week Wales' capital city is facing a local lockdown as coronavirus cases rise ""rapidly"". Cardiff council leader Huw Thomas has warned of potential restrictions on travel and different households mixing. He told a virtual meeting of the authority that over the past seven days, the area has seen 38.2 cases per 100,000 people. Mr Thomas said the city was on the verge of entering the Welsh Government's ""red zone"". He said if that was to happen ""then I fully expect that we will be implementing further restrictions as we have seen elsewhere"" in south Wales. Urdd Eisteddfod 2021 'at risk' UK sees highest Covid cases since mass tests began Cardiff is home to 366,903 people and would be the seventh area to have tighter restrictions imposed. People living in Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and Newport cannot leave their areas without a reasonable excuse. Should Cardiff follow them into lockdown, it would mean more than a 1.2 million people - about a third of Wales' population - would be under tighter restrictions than the rest of the country. Conservative councillor Jayne Cowan asked Mr Thomas if Cardiff would be put into a local lockdown in the next 48 hours. He replied: ""We'll look at the numbers again in the morning and make a decision based on that."" It comes asCaerphilly's lockdown has been confirmedfor at least a further seven days. Mr Thomas said restrictions could be introduced ""at speed"" and could include a ban on households meeting or travel outside of Cardiff. The council leader said the coronavirus test positivity rate stood at 3.8%, which exceeds the government's amber threshold of 2.5%. There has been a sharp rise in hospital emergency attendance in the past week, he added, with the spread of infection ""most frequently found within household settings"". ""Our test trace and protect data suggests this is particularly in cases where family bubble rules have been breached, and also where people are mixing in indoor home settings and not following the rule of six,"" he said. ""The truth is that indoor mixing with people not in extended households in homes, cafes, bars and restaurants is happening far too frequently."" Cardiff city centre at the end of July Mr Thomas said there had been a significant rise in those aged 35 to 50 testing positive. Any new restrictions would need to be introduced by the Welsh Government. Mr Thomas said he met First Minister Mark Drakeford and Health Minister Vaughan Gething prior to Thursday night's council meeting. The threshold for foreign countries to be added to the list of destinations where people need to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in the UK is 20 cases per 100,000. Cardiff councillor Jayne Cowan told BBC Radio Wales a local lockdown was ""inevitable"" but feared the impact on businesses. ""Many businesses won't survive another lockdown,"" she said. ""We're seeing many thousands of cases of people having livelihoods stripped away. As part of the first lockdown, I was made redundant from my part time job. ""The Welsh Government needs to come up with the goods."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman, Andrew RT Davies, tweeted that a ""it's incumbent on the Welsh Labour government to bring forward a package of financial support for the many businesses (particularly hospitality) that will be devastated by the news"". He said a blanket lockdown of the city ""really isn't local"". Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru health spokesman, said: ""Shutting pubs slightly earlier isn't going to be enough - the Welsh Government must think of a suite of new steps, which are perhaps stricter but for a shorter period, in order to control these new spikes.""

"This video can not be played Tighter rules to curb the spread of coronavirus have been introduced in Leeds Different households in Leeds will be banned from meeting in private homes or gardens in a bid to slow rising Covid-19 rates, the government has confirmed. The measure will begin at midnight and would bring the city in line with rules in Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale, said council leader Judith Blake. Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the rule in a written statement. The city council said there had been a ""steep rise"" in infections, with the rate at 98.5 per 100,000 people. The move will have an impact on 780,000 people but some exemptions are expected, including for those with caring responsibilities. Residents in Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale are currently strongly advised not to socialise in any public venues with people they do not live with. The council said the measures for Leeds will match those areas, with the national ""rule of six'"" and 22:00 venue curfew continuing alongside. Councillors asked the government to allow households to meet in private gardens, but this request was rejected. The measures in Leeds are expect to reflect restrictions in neighbouring Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale In his statement, Mr Hancock said: ""We are making regulations which take effect from Saturday, 26 September and will impose restrictions on inter-household mixing in private dwellings and gardens in Leeds, Stockport, Wigan and Blackpool. ""People who live in these areas will not be allowed to gather in a private dwelling or garden with any other household unless in a support bubble. ""People from anywhere else will also not be allowed to gather with another household in a private dwelling or garden in these areas."" Ms Blake said the duration of the new measures ""will depend on everyone playing their part"". ""We are acutely aware that nobody wants to see further restrictions placed on life in Leeds and alongside our partners we have been doing absolutely everything within our power to avoid that,"" she said. ""But the safety of the city and the public simply has to come first and we have now reached a point where we all need to take additional steps to contain the spread of this terrible virus within our communities."" Yorkshire: Latest news and coronavirus updates New restrictions in West Yorkshire explained Victoria Eaton, the city's director of public health, said there was ""very widespread community transmissions right across the city"", with compliance with self-isolation rules still low. ""The expectation is the restrictions will be in place for a longer period of time, potentially right through the winter,"" she said. Not to meet people you do not live with inside a private home or garden, except where you have formed a support bubble Not to visit someone else's home or garden even if they live outside of Leeds, unless they are in your support bubble You are advised not to socialise with people you do not live with in any public venue in Leeds or elsewhere Examples of these include pubs, restaurants, cafes, shops, places of worship, community centres, leisure or entertainment venues, visitor attractions and parks Friends and family can still provide informal childcare for children under 14 You are advised not to visit friends or family in care homes, other than in exceptional circumstances Exemptions to the home and garden rule include visiting a person who is dying, to fulfil a legal obligation, for work purposes, for the provision of voluntary or charitable services, for the purposes of education or training, to provide emergency assistance, to facilitate a house move, to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person and to attend a birth at the mother's request Source: Leeds City Council By David Rhodes, BBC Yorkshire data journalist Despite repeated warnings from Leeds City Council, the number of Covid-19 cases in the city has risen throughout September. In the seven days to 21 September there was a record 829 new infections identified. That surpasses the peak of new cases in the first wave of the pandemic back in late April. Whilst mass testing has only been available since May, the sharp increase in cases in the past month has alarmed officials - as the number of new cases has quadrupled in the space of three weeks. Leeds is not alone in West Yorkshire - Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees have all seen record numbers of new cases in the latest week's data. Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale have been part of local restrictions since July along with areas of east Lancashire and Greater Manchester. While most of the rest of England had seen lower rates of new coronavirus infections over the summer, these three parts of West Yorkshire were regularly in the top 20 of the 315 districts and boroughs, Leeds had been on Public Health England's watchlist as an ""area of enhanced support"", meaning it received greater national assistance and extra testing capacity, but had so far escaped the tighter restrictions of its neighbours. Leeds is one of 32 local authority areas where the rate in the week to 21 September was in excess of 100 cases per 100,000 people. There were 829 new infections in the city that week, up from 607 the week before, according to data released on Thursday. Tom Riordan, chief executive of Leeds City Council, said: ""It looks like we are in the middle of the second wave, so we do support these household restrictions having to be brought in at this stage. ""That is something we really need the people of the city to get behind."" By James Vincent, BBC Yorkshire political editor Expect this to last for a while. The council doesn't know whether these new restrictions will still be in place at Christmas - but it's clear Leeds needs to be braced for a long haul. The ""rule of six"" and the curfew on pubs and restaurants will stay in place - now it's likely that hundreds of thousands of people are going to be apart from their families for the foreseeable future. It will come into force at midnight and although it will be reviewed weekly, it may not change for some time.

"This video can not be played ""Don't treat this weekend as a big blow-out"" Wales' two biggest cities will go into lockdown as part of new restrictions being imposed in three areas. Cardiff and the county of Swansea go into lockdown at 18:00 BST on Sunday, 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli. It means 1.5 million people, about half of Wales' population, will be under lockdown by the end of the weekend. But cases in Caerphilly, the first area to lockdown, have fallen significantly, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said. The restrictions will be the same as those already affecting people living in Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly, which are already in lockdown. Mr Gething said people in Cardiff and Swansea should not ""treat this weekend as a big blow-out"". He also said cases in Carmarthenshire had ""overwhelmingly"" been linked to Llanelli, with eight out of 10 cases there. ""In Llanelli we have a particular challenge around the town that is well identified, a significant spread that is not in control,"" he said at a Welsh Government press conference. ""We've spoken to the local authority, we've spoken to the local health board and we understand the need to act and act as soon as possible."" What can I do during local lockdowns? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Where do the 14.6 million people under new rules live?,external Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea council, said:  ""We have seen a rapid and sharp increase in the number of covid cases in Swansea during the past few weeks. ""So, like much of the population of Wales, we are now in a lockdown. This will mean changes to people's everyday lives but they will help to protect people and our communities."" He described a ""balanced judgement"" being taken that the rules should come into force in Cardiff and Swansea a day later to ""allow people to plan"". There will be nine areas of Wales under restrictions In the past seven days, 85 of 109 cases in Carmarthenshire have been in Llanelli where the rate of infection is 151.6 per 100,000 people, compared to 57.7 in the wider county. The Llanelli lockdown is the first not to cover a whole local authority area. A postcode finder will be made available online to make clear which areas are under lockdown, said Mr Gething. The majority of cases in Llanelli have been linked to people socialising without social distancing. Burry Port, which is also in Carmarthenshire, will not be included in the area under restrictions. Swansea has recorded 63.6 cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days, while Cardiff has recorded 46.1. The seven-day case rate for the whole of Wales is just shy of 57 per 100,000. Cardiff, Swansea and Llanelli are the latest areas to be locked down Meanwhile, cases of coronavirus have been traced to three pubs in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, with customers encouraged to look out for symptoms. PHW said a number of people had tested positive for the virus after visiting The Royal Oak in South Road, The Marine on the Esplanade and The Pier on the Esplanade on the evening of 11 September. Gemma Northey, chairwoman of the multi-agency incident management team for PHW, said anyone who has visited the pubs and been identified as a contact would be contacted by the Test, Trace, Protect team and given further advice. She said those who had visited the pubs and developed symptoms must self-isolate, along with any household members, and book a coronavirus test promptly, but those who were not symptomatic did not need to take action. The new restrictions mean people in lockdown can only shop in their own counties, or in the case of Llanelli, their own town. Mike Richards, who owns an antique shop in Llanelli, is angry the town has been singled out. ""It's totally unacceptable,"" he said. ""We're part of Carmarthenshire - the council are supposed to look after us and Carmarthen.Â ""We'd be goldfish bowls - local customers only - 60% of my trade is from outside Llanelli. I'll have to live with that but I'm not living with Carmarthen having their own way.Â ""With respect, everywhere else they've locked down an area. We'll be the first town to lock down. Why?"" Matteo Moruzzi says Verdi's cafe gets a lot of trade from outside of Swansea county Matteo Moruzzi, from Verdi's cafe in Mumbles, Swansea, said the lack of tourism would hit the business hard. He said: ""We don't just get people coming from other areas of Wales, but also England. ""We had people from Somerset call earlier who'd arranged to come next week but they can't come anymore. ""I think it will affect a lot of the trade. We prepared for the first lockdown but not so much for the local one."" As students return, Mr Gething said the effect on university towns will be monitored. He said: ""One of the things we'll need to do is to understand how the pattern is changing within those university towns and cities once students have been there for a period of time. ""At this point in time with a large movement of people across the UK, we need to understand what that does in terms of local prevalence so I don't think now is the time to make a definitive choice about what would happen in the end of your recess but it's an obvious question for us to consider."" Under the rules, nobody is able to enter or leave the eight counties and one townwithout a ""reasonable excuse"". People are allowed to travel to outside the area for a limited number of reasons. These include going to work if they are not able to work from home, to go to school, give care and buy food or medical supplies. Dr Keith Reid, executive director of public health at Swansea Bay health board, said: ""How long Swansea stays in local lockdown is entirely up to the people of Swansea. You have it in your gift to end this lockdown as early as possible and save lives."" Aside from the areas being locked down, Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales, said Vale of Glamorgan, Carmarthen, Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire and Flintshire were all ""areas of concern to us and we are watching the data from there carefully"". Ministers and officials said they would look at data over the weekend before deciding whether restrictions needed to be extended to Neath Port Talbot, Vale of Glamorgan and Torfaen, Mr Gething said. Meetings will also take place next week with council leaders in north Wales, where Mr Gething said the picture was ""more mixed"". Leader of Neath Port Talbot council, Rob Jones, said it was ""inevitable"" the county would follow neighbouring Swansea into local lockdown if cases continued to rise. Carmarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said: ""It is worrying to see how sharply the number of positive cases has risen in the Llanelli area, and action has had to be taken to help stop the spread and break the chain of infections concentrated in this area to prevent a whole county lockdown. ""We must all do the right thing, follow the advice and protect each other.

"The government funded the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme in August The UK government borrowed Â£35.9bn in August as tackling the economic fallout of pandemic took its toll on the public finances, official figures show. The figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£30.5bn more than it borrowed in August last year. The increase meant that the borrowing figure hit its highest amount for August since records began in 1993. Borrowing between April and August totalled Â£173.7bn - also a record. August's monthly borrowing figure was, however, less than economists had predicted at Â£38bn, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also revised down,externalits estimate for UK borrowing in July, by more than Â£11bn, to Â£15.4bn, demonstrating how difficult tracking the economy during the pandemic can be. It also said that total UK debt passed Â£2 trillion for the first time in history in August, rather than in July as previously thought. In August, debt hit Â£2.024tn, Â£249.5bn more than the same time in 2019. That figure now exceeds the size of the UK economy, the highest level of debt seen since the 1960s. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that rising borrowing figures were down to the government absorbing ""much of the cost of the Covid-19 crisis"". The government has been forced to cover a wide range coronavirus-related costs - from the furlough scheme and bailouts for rail firms to business rates holidays and VAT cuts for hospitality and tourism. It has also set aside Â£500m to cover the cost of the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme, where diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August. Where do governments borrow money? Uncertainty as industries miss out on job support Rishi Sunak's post-furlough plan: At-a-glance But ""the big picture is that fiscal support will fade over the autumn causing many more job losses to be realised"", Mr Wishart added. The latest figures from the ONS show that while billions have been pumped into propping up the economy, tax receipts have dropped sharply. The amount collected by central government in taxes dropped to Â£37.3bn in August, which is Â£7.5bn less than a year before. The amount of VAT, corporation tax and income tax collected fell ""considerably"", the ONS said. It was another month of heavy government borrowing - though many economists thought it would be even more. As always, the outlook will depend on specific spending and tax measures and the strength of the economy. The leading headline from the chancellor's announcement yesterday was the coming replacement of the furlough scheme with the less generous Job Support Scheme. That will curb spending compared with extending the furlough scheme, though it's almost certain to mean substantial job losses. Another of his measures - the extension of the VAT cut for hospitality and tourism - will reduce tax revenue. The resurgence in Covid cases and the renewed restrictions intended to contain the pandemic are likely to cast a shadow over the economic recovery. Some economists expect the economy to stagnate for the rest of the year.  To the extent that does happen, it will undermine tax revenue. The new figures came the day after Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a series of extensions to existing coronavirus programmes, including a replacement for the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of October. Under the new wage ""top-up"" scheme, if bosses bring back workers part-time, the government will help top up their wages to at least three-quarters of their full-time pay. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Bank, said that the government's borrowing figures may ""partly correct themselves"" next year as a number of the chancellor's measures expire. Mr Shaw pointed out though that in order to bring down debt, the chancellor ""will have difficult decisions to make on fiscal policy"". But ""with the focus currently on trying to maintain the recovery, this is not the time,"" he added. Looking ahead, the ONS said that the chancellor was likely to borrow about Â£370bn in the 2020 financial year.

"Rishi Sunak's new jobs support scheme will slow but not stop, ""major"" job losses, influential think tank the Resolution Foundation has warned. The chancellor said he hoped the new plan,announced on Thursday, would ""benefit large numbers"". But the Resolution Foundation said the fact firms had to pay employees for hours not worked meant many would have ""little or no incentive"" to use it. The plan ""will not significantly reduce the rise in unemployment,"" it said. The Foundation also highlighted that around six million of the UK's poorest households could see their incomes cut by Â£20 a week from next April, when the government's temporary boost to basic benefits comes to an end. The Job Support Scheme, which will replace the furlough scheme, will see workers get three quarters of their normal salaries for six months. To be eligible, employees must work for at least one third of their normal hours. For the hours not worked, the government and employer will each pay one-third of the remaining wages. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said the higher contribution required from firms, compared to the furlough scheme, meant the new Job Support Scheme ""will not live up to its promise to significantly reduce the rise in unemployment."" At the start of the pandemic the government sought to reduce the economic impact of lockdown measures by temporarily boosting the standard allowance you collect if you claim benefits by Â£20 to Â£94.25 a week. That served to soften the income shock endured by workers moving from a job to benefits, which pay less than a fifth of the average wage. The Resolution Foundation's analysis points out that the Chancellor Rishi Sunak has chosen not to extend that temporary boost beyond April next year. That means that in April, at a time when unemployment is likely to be rising quickly, well over six million families already on benefits will see their incomes cut by Â£20 a week. And because they'd be forced to spend less, it would also reduce the overall level of demand in the economy, making more job losses more likely. The Foundation's report notes, for example, that it would cost a firm Â£1,500 to employ one full-time worker on Â£17,000, but more than Â£2,000 a month to employ two half-time workers on the same full-time equivalent salary. One full-time worker on Â£10,000 would cost Â£800 a month, compared with Â£1,100 a month for two half-time workers. Thousands of retail jobs unviable, Next boss warns What is replacing furlough? Sunak's post-furlough plan: At-a-glance Kuenssberg: No hiding now - for Sunak or businesses The government has stressed the scheme has been gratefully received in many quarters. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Steve Barclay, told BBC Breakfast that ""many employers value the flexibility of being able to tailor how much time employees are working as we go through uncertainty of winter months"". Mr Barclay said the scheme has been ""so warmly welcomed"" by the likes of the CBI, FSB, business leaders and trade unions, as well as sectors such as aerospace and hospitality, He said that businesses want to retain their skills and expertise of the labour market, and ""wanted the ability to bring people back on a part time basis"". The Foundation said that a single adult homeowner earning Â£20,000-a-year would face an income reduction of around 19% if they worked a third of their previous hours on the jobs support scheme, compared with a 70% drop were they to lose their job completely and move onto Universal Credit. However, employees only benefit from the Job Support Scheme (JSS) where employers choose to use it, and the scheme is far less generous for firms which gives them little or no incentive to use it, the Foundation said. Meanwhile, industries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic are facing further uncertainty after missing out on help in the chancellor's new emergency jobs scheme. Hospitality, events and retail workers and businesses have expressed concern, as have those on zero-hours contracts. Rishi Sunak said employees must be in ""viable"" jobs to benefit from the wage top-up scheme. This means people working in industries currently closed - such as nightclubs - may lose out as there isn't any work. Mr Sunak said he hoped the new plan, announced on Thursday, would ""benefit large numbers"", but warnedthe government ""can't save every job"". Opposition politicians have called for more emphasis on training for workers losing their jobs. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the BBC a national training strategy was needed ""so that when people become unemployed, they can hopefully be retrained with new skills"". The Lib Dems' Christine Jardine also criticised the lack of focus on training. She told the BBC that while the jobs plan was described as a ""bridge for the economy"", she wanted to know ""where will it take us?"" The government will subsidise the pay of employees who are working fewer than normal hours due to lower demand It will apply to staff who can work at least a third of their usual hours Employers will pay staff for the hours they work For the hours employees can't work, the government and the employer will each cover one third of the lost pay The grant will be capped at Â£697.92 per month All small and medium-sized businesses will be eligible Larger business will be eligible if their turnover has fallen during the crisis It will be open to employers across the UK even if they have not used the furlough scheme It will run for six months starting in November FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends?

"The rate at which the Covid-19 virus is spreading appears to be speeding up. The R number, indicating how fast the coronavirus epidemic is growing, has risen from 1.1-1.4 to 1.2-1.5. An Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey estimated there were 9,600 new cases a day in England in the week to 19 September - up from 6,000 the week before and three times that being picked up by general testing. It comes as more restrictions come into effect in parts of England and Wales. On Friday, the daily number of positive cases in the UK picked up by coronavirus testing rose to a new high of 6,874,government figures show.,external A further 34 deaths were announced, although figures were not available for Scotland because of a power cut at the National Records of Scotland. Infection rates are highest in the north west of England and in London. As infection rates rise, new restrictions are being brought into effect in the following areas: Cardiff and the county of Swanseawill go into lockdown at 18:00 BST on Sunday- 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli In Leeds, Stockport, Wigan and Blackpooldifferent households will be banned from meeting in private homes or gardensfrom midnight on Friday London has been added to the government's Covid-19 watch-list, meaning all of its boroughs are now classed as ""areas of concern"" but will not yet have additional restrictions An R or reproduction number above one means the epidemic is growing. It's a measure of how many extra people each coronavirus case is infecting, In March, before any control measures were put in place, R was thought to be just under three. The ONS's estimates of how much of the population is currently infected are based on testing a representative sample of people with or without symptoms. It is different to the number published daily by the Department of Health and Social Care. That records positive cases in people with potential Covid symptoms who request tests. And in the week up to 19 September, the DHSC data showed roughly 3,000 positive tests a day in England - a total of 23,378. UK sees highest Covid cases since mass tests began UHow many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Is there a North-South infection divide in England? In contrast, the ONS survey suggest there were actually 103,600  people in England with the virus, equating to an estimated one in 500 people in private homes. The number does not include cases in hospitals and care homes. The ONS said there was ""clear evidence"" of an increase in the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in all age groups, but rates are currently highest in those aged 17-24. Infection rates are highest across the north of England and in London, with smaller increases seen in the Midlands. In Wales, cases appear to have risen dramatically but because there are fewer people in the sample, there is a lot of uncertainty around the precise figure. But central estimates suggest they could have risen almost seven-fold, from 1,500 people in total having Covid the previous week to more than 10,000. The ONS has also begun surveying people in Northern Ireland, where early figures suggest one in 300 people had the virus in the period 6-19 September. These figures only take us up to the end of last week, and as such may be an underestimate of the current situation. Cases have been rising over the past few weeks, and have begun to translate to a rise in hospital admissions. Data from the Covid Symptom Study app, run by King's College London and tech company ZOE, put the daily figure for England at 12,883 - higher than the ONS. Its figures are based on people who download and use the app, so it is not a random sample - but does include a larger number of positive tests. The ZOE figures are also more up to date than the ONS's and so may be capturing more recent rises. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

"Mr Kim said the incident should never have happened North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has issued a rare personal apology for the killing of a South Korean official, Seoul says. Mr Kim reportedly told South Korean leader Moon Jae-in that the ""disgraceful affair"" should not have happened. South Korea has said the 47-year-old man was found by troops floating in the North's waters. He was then shot dead and his body was set alight, according to Seoul. It is not known what the man was doing there. The South Korean government has said he may have been trying to defect to the North but his family has denied this. The killing - the first of a South Korean citizen by North Korean forces for a decade - has caused outrage in the South. The border between the Koreas is tightly policed, and the North is thought to have a ""shoot-to-kill"" policy in place to prevent coronavirus from entering the country. Kim Yo-jong: North Korea's heir apparent? Kim Jong-un and the brutal North Korea rumour mill The apology came in the form of a letter sent to President Moon which acknowledged that the incident should not have happened, according to South Korea's presidential office, also known as the Blue House. The South Korean island of Yeonpyeong sits near the border with the North Mr Kim called it a ""disgraceful affair"" and said he felt ""very sorry"" for ""disappointing"" Mr Moon and the South Korean people, the Blue House said. It is the North's first official comment on the incident. The North also gave the South the results of its investigation - it said more than 10 shots were fired at the man, who had entered North Korean waters and then failed to reveal his identity and tried to flee, South Korea's director of national security Suh Hoon said. However the North insisted that it had not burned the man's body but rather the ""floating material"" that was carrying him. ""The troops could not locate the unidentified trespasser during a search after firing the shots, and burned the device under national emergency disease prevention measures,"" Mr Suh told a briefing, referring to the North Korean account. The presidential office in Seoul has also decided to release recent letters between the two leaders. In them Kim Jong-un said he understood ""more than anyone the kind of pressure and hardship"" required to overcome the coronavirus pandemic and damage from recent typhoons. It was the ""heartfelt truth"" that he shared the ""pain and suffering of the Southern people"", he said. This incident could have been a disaster for any hopes of rekindling talks between the South's President Moon and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. As it is many South Koreans will not forgive or forget easily. They are shocked and outraged at what appears to have been the brutal killing of an unarmed civilian in North Korean waters. It is yet another reminder of North Korea's often merciless regime. It's also worth noting that the North's account of the killing does not match the details given by officials in the South. However, this rare personal apology from Kim Jong-un may go some way to assuage Southern anger. If there had been no apology, Mr Kim's warm letter to Mr Moon would have been wasted. By at least attempting to smooth things over, Mr Kim may be signalling his willingness to keep talking. The father-of-two, who worked for the fisheries department, was on his patrol boat about 10km (6 miles) from the border with the North, near the island of Yeonpyeong, when he disappeared on Monday, the South Korean defence ministry said. He had left his shoes behind on the boat. South Korean media said he had recently divorced and had financial problems. A North Korean patrol boat found the man, who was wearing a life jacket, at sea at around 15:30 local time on Tuesday. They put gas masks on and questioned him from a distance before ""orders from [a] superior authority"" came in that the man be killed, South Korea said. He was shot dead in the water. South Korea says North Korean troops then burned the corpse at sea. President Moon Jae-in called the killing a ""shocking"" incident that could not be tolerated. He urged the North to take ""responsible"" measures over the attack. The country's National Security Council said the North could ""not justify shooting and burning the corpse of our unarmed citizen who showed no sign of resistance"". Officials said they had done a ""thorough analysis of diverse intelligence"", but it was not clear how exactly they had gathered the information. The military hotline between North and South was cut in June, and the inter-Korean liaison office, which was built to help both sides communicate,was destroyed by North Korea. But South Korean military is known to intercept the North's radio communications, AFP news agency reports. Mr Kim's apology comes at a time when relations between the North and South are at a low point and there is a stand-off between Pyongyang and Washington over the North's nuclear programme. South Korea has in the past demanded apologies from the North but these have rarely been forthcoming. The Northhas refused to apologise for the sinking of a South Korean warshipin 2010, in which 46 sailors died, and denies responsibility. It also refused to apologise for shelling a South Korean island the same year, killing two soldiers and two construction workers. The tiny South Korean island watching the horizon Why did North Korea destroy liaison office? Why was Korea divided? North Korea may be taking extra-tough measures to prevent the coronavirus from entering the country because it is thought to be preparing for a huge military parade on 10 October to mark the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party. Pyongyang closed its border with China in January to try to prevent the spread Covid-19. In July, North Korean state media said the country had raised its state of emergency to the maximum level. Last month, the commander of the US military's forces in South Korea, Robert Abrams, said the North had introduced a new ""buffer zone"" of one to two kilometres on the Chinese border, and that the country had special operation forces in place with orders to ""shoot-to-kill"" anyone coming across the border. In the past, North Korea has also returned people who have wandered into their territory. In 2017, state news agency KCNA said officials would repatriate a South Korean fishing boat which ""illegally"" crossed the border, in what was seen as a rare humanitarian move.

"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to place limits on the number of items shoppers can buy, following a similar move by rival Morrisons. It now has a three-items per customer limit on flour, dried pasta, toilet roll, baby wipes and some wet wipes. The supermarkets are acting to prevent a repeat of the panic-buying that led to shortages in March. The managing director of Iceland told the BBC he is urging shoppers to ""calm down and carry on as normal"". Richard Walker said his supermarket chain was not currently considering limiting purchases on any lines.  He said there had been a small uptick in interest in the ""usual suspect products"" like toilet roll, but it was ""nothing like last time"". Mr Walker said that, in March and April, this had resulted in elderly and vulnerable people, as well as NHS workers, being faced with empty shelves.  He described panic buying as socially divisive, only an option to those who can afford it. Tesco said it had ""introduced bulk-buy limits on a small number of products"". It said this was to ""ensure that everyone can keep buying what they need"". ""We have good availability, with plenty of stock to go round, and we would encourage our customers to shop as normal,"" it said. The supermarket has introduced additional limits for a small number of products online, such as rice and canned veg. Morrisons introduced a limit of three items per customeron some ranges on Thursday, including toilet rolls and disinfectant products. It said stock levels ""were good"", but it wanted to ""make sure they were available for everyone"". In March, UK supermarkets were forced to take steps to prevent shoppers from panic-buying around the height of the pandemic. Many introduced limits on the number of certain items that customers could buy, such as flour, pasta or toilet roll. Enhanced measures introduced in recent weeks have not triggered stock-piling by customers, according to several supermarkets approached by the BBC earlier this week.Tesco joins Morrisons to limit sales of some items Asda said it still had good availability in-store and online, while Waitrose said it had ""good levels"" of stock and that it had also looked at the items people bought early in lockdown and planned ahead accordingly. ""We would like to reassure customers that there is no need to worry about buying more than they need,"" a spokesperson said. The British Retail Consortium said supply chains were good and has urged consumers to ""shop as you normally would"". Director of food and sustainability at the BRC, Andrew Opie, said: ""Supply chains are stronger than ever before and we do not anticipate any issues in the availability of food or other goods under a future lockdown. ""Nonetheless, we urge consumers to be considerate of others."" Aldi boss Giles Hurley has written to customers saying: ""There is no need to buy more than you usually would. I would like to reassure you that our stores remain fully stocked and ask that you continue to shop considerately.""

"Royal accounts could suffer a potential Â£35m shortfall due to coronavirus. The impact of lockdown on visitor numbers to venues such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will lead to an estimated Â£15m loss of income over the next three years, the Keeper of the Privy Purse said. And a 10-year Â£369m budget to refurbish Buckingham Palace is expected to be Â£20m short, Sir Michael Stevens added. He said the royal household had ""no intention"" of asking for extra funding. Sir Michael said the royal household would try to manage the ""financial challenges"" of the pandemic ""through our own efforts and efficiencies"". A pay freeze for royal staff was implemented in April and there is also a halt on recruitment, with only business-critical posts being filled, though staff have not been furloughed. Harry and Meghan to make shows with Netflix Prince Charles calls for 'swift' action on climate The financial report covers the 12 months to 31 March - shortly after the UK government brought in restrictions on daily life, to curb the spread of coronavirus. Other details revealed in the report include: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's high-profile tour of southern Africa was the most costly official overseas trip in the past year, at nearlyÂ£246,000, including planning trips for royal staff Expenses for a two-day visit by the Prince of Wales to Oman to pay his condolences following the death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said included a charter flight which costÂ£210,345 The Duke of York took a charter flight to Northern Ireland to attend the Royal Portrush Golf Club's Open championship, which costÂ£15,848 Funding for the Cambridges and Sussexes contributed to aÂ£5.6mbill for the Prince of Wales in 2019-2020, up11%on the previous year. The Queen's Sovereign Grant from the Treasury increased to Â£82.4m in 2019-20, up Â£200,000 on the previous year. It includes Â£33m set aside for major work to update the electrical cabling, plumbing and heating at Buckingham Palace. All major expenditure areas have increased, from payroll (up Â£1.2m to Â£24.4m), to travel (up Â£700,000 to Â£5.3m), and housekeeping and hospitality (up Â£300,000 to Â£2.6m). According to a senior Palace source, Prince Harry and Meghan have made a ""substantial contribution"" to the Sovereign Grant for the rent and refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage,estimated at Â£2.4m in 2018-19. The payment will be disclosed in next year's report. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's tour of southern Africa in 2019 was the most costly trip in the past year The Sovereign Grant isfunded by profits from the Crown Estate,external- a multibillion-pound property portfolio that ranges from London's Regent Street to Ascot Racecourse. The estate is managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers. Republic, a campaign group calling for the abolition of the monarchy, said the Sovereign Grant was ""madness"" and should be scrapped. The group's chief executive, Graham Smith, said: ""A 15% increase in travel costs when hospitals can't deliver the very best care to every person in need, when teachers are struggling to pay for the necessary books and equipment and the police are stretched to breaking point is scandalous."" Separate accounts published last week show the Crown Estate had a Â£345m profit for the Treasury for the last financial year but there were concerns about the future financial impact of Covid-19. The Royal Collection Trust pays fees, in relation to running the opening of royal residences such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, to supplement the Sovereign Grant. But closures due to the lockdown are likely to cause its income to fall by tens of millions.

"This video can not be played Nell Manson and Lucy Owens are self-isolating at the University of Glasgow Students caught up in a spate of Covid outbreaks have questioned why university halls were allowed to open. They have been told not tovisit pubs or restaurants this weekendor go home after hundreds of students across Scotland tested positive for the virus. However, many have called the outbreaks inevitable given students were encouraged back to campus. The Scottish government said all efforts were focused on stopping further transmission of the virus. Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? One of the worst affected halls is Glasgow University's Murano Street residences where at least 172 students have tested positive for Covid-19 and hundreds more are self isolating. Lucy Owens, a student living in the Murano complex and who has coronavirus, questioned why students had been brought back given so much learning had moved online. She asked on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""What are we paying for? I could do everything I am doing from my house, so why have they sent us here? ""I know we're making the most of this accommodation because we're stuck in it all day but we're not really making the most of being at university. ""Putting two thousand students into such a confined area, something like this was bound to happen."" Scottish university students told not to go to pubs PPE to pee and running out of food University outbreaks 'should have been predicted' Fellow student Nell Manson said keeping students out of pubs and restaurants was not the answer. She said: ""More things will be happening in accommodations. ""In pubs and restaurants there are lots of social distancing measures, you can't even get up from your table without a mask. ""It lends itself to people socialising in other ways where there's not such strict rules."" Students in Glasgow have been getting tests and told to self isolate Tessa Morrison, 17, who is studying politics at Glasgow University, said she has had a positive Covid diagnosis and is living with 10 other people, some of whom also have the virus. The students all have their own rooms but share two bathrooms and one kitchen. She said it was ""difficult to avoid people"" in this setup, adding, ""They should have waited until at least Christmas to let us come here, I do think they are just trying to make money off us being in halls and they knew this was inevitably going to happen."" Glasgow University said the positive cases were due to social activity during Freshers Week There are currently about 250,000 students in Scotland, with up to 35,000 living in university halls and 10,000 in private halls. Covid outbreaks have been reported at halls of residence in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Arturo Morselli, a student from Italy studying at St Andrews University but living in Dundee, said he felt left in limbo by the current situation. He said: ""My belief is that universities are trying to avoid accountability in the sense that they are not taking decisions. ""We students are caught up in the fact that no one wants to take responsibility for what's going on and we are the ones caught up in it and we don't know if it's worth the money we are paying."" Isobelle Robinson-Gordon described her university experience to date as ""very ostracising"" Isobelle Robinson-Gordon, a first year student at Edinburgh University, said her experience had been ""very isolating"" so far. She said: ""I've moved to Edinburgh. I'm in accommodation, but all the learning is online. I'm frustrated. ""A lot of students are here and ready to learn, but it's all online. It's the lack of direction. It's debilitating. ""We've not had any guidance from the university. Everything we're learning is from the news media."" Helen Kirkpatrick's daughter is a second year student at Glasgow's Strathclyde University and is staying in private halls. She said: ""After going back there she has found out that all classes will be online for the first semester. ""She's signed an agreement and paid a lot of money to stay there and what for? Now she is essentially imprisoned? ""She could have studied at home - I think the Scottish government could have handled this a lot better."" Universities in Scotland have agreed to introduce a ""yellow card, red card"" system for breaches of student discipline that put students and others at risk, which could result in an end to their studies. Higher Education Minister Richard Lochhead said this, and curbs on going to hospitality this weekend, was about trying to stop the virus spreading. He said: ""This is an ask of the student population of Scotland from universities. The Scottish  government support that, but the universities are asking the students jointly across Scotland this weekend - given we've got a number of outbreaks of the virus and some campuses across Scotland - to have the weekend off from socialising out-with the households."" ""The vast majority of students have been so responsible, it's a very tough time for them."" Mr Lochhead added that ""it's not stigmatising students, it's not about saying they're particularly to blame for what's happening."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government was trying to strike the right balance between protecting public health and ensuring there is a ""degree of normality around education"". She told Radio 1 Newsbeat: ""Students deserve to have a campus experience. They deserve to have some kind of normality in their life. So people will have different views about the rights and wrongs."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"WHO expert says deaths of two million people from Covid-19 is 'very likely' without global action A further 6,874 UK Covid-19 cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, with 34 deaths New restrictions are announced in Leeds, where the city council reported a ""steep rise"" in infections on Thursday Two of Wales' biggest cities - Cardiff and Swansea - will go into lockdown from 18:00 BST on Sunday London is at a ""very worrying tipping point"" amid a resurgence of Covid-19, the mayor has warned In Madrid, over a million people will be under local lockdown restrictions from Monday as curbs are extended More than 32 million virus cases have been confirmed globally with nearly 984,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Paul Gribben We're pausing the coronavirus live page for now but will be back on Saturday morning. We leave you with a
round-up of today's biggest developments from the UK.  Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, Joseph Lee,
Victoria Bissett, Paul Gribben, Joshua Nevett and Emma Harrison Thanks for joining us. Marseille's restaurant and bar owners have rebelled against coronavirus restrictions Weâre pausing our live coverage for the day soon. In case you missed them, here are some of todayâs main headlines from around the world. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned of a looming spike in infections Two of Canada's most populous provinces have moved to impose further restrictions on social gatherings, as they seek to stem rising coronavirus infections. In Quebec, Health Minister Christian DubÃ© urged people to avoid social gatherings
for 28 days. DubÃ© made the plea as the eastern province recorded a further 637 new cases on Friday, up 10% from the day before. Ontario, the most populous province, also saw a rise in new cases. In response, Premier Doug Ford announced on Friday that bars, restaurants
and strip clubs will have to close by midnight, and stop serving alcohol by 23:00 local time. On a national level, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resumed his daily Covid-19 briefing, which he had paused over the summer as cases declined. In a televised address on Tuesday, he warned that ""we are on the brink of a fall
that could be much worse than the spring"". Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics This weekâs report on
coronavirus hotspots from Public Health England has a new analysis. It shows that the most common
activity people recall doing before their coronavirus symptoms began is eating
out. MPs wrote to Baroness Dido
Harding, the head of NHS Test and Trace, earlier this week asking her to share
the evidence behind the 22:00 curfew and table service restrictions. Contact tracers asked people
what activities they had been doing in the days leading up to their coronavirus
symptoms. The most common answer from
the 45,000 people questioned was eating out (15%) closely followed by shopping
(13%). We canât say for certain if
this is where people picked up their infection, and canât say anything about
the people who donât pick up the phone to contact tracers. But it adds some evidence to
the public debate about the measures the government have announced. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem A political row has continued over the tightening of Covid-19 restrictions in Israel, a week after the country became the first in the world to begin asecond nationwide lockdown. Critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accuse him of trying to block the regular protests against him and his handling of the crisis. New rules came into effect at 14:00 (12:00 BST) local time, just ahead of the Israeli weekend. They close most workplaces and markets. Synagogues are to stay closed except on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which begins on Sunday evening. In parliament, Netanyahu was blocked from pushing through emergency measures to prevent the protests that have become a regular event outside his Jerusalem residence. However, anti-Netanyahu groups now say they will form a protest convoy to make their way there with participants, going no further than the 1km (0.6 mile) limit from their homes. One group is urging protesters to stage events on their balconies. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The original app was trialled on the Isle of Wight The original NHS Covid-19 app, which was shelved, would have worked on a larger number of handsets than the app which launched in England and Wales this week, I have discovered. VMware Pivotal, the firm behind it, has just published its software code. It shows that it works on 97.5% of handsets, and provides more accurate measurements of contacts between users. One expert told me the first app was better - but VMware Pivotal says it does not wish to compete. The new app doesn't work with a variety of older phones, including iPhones made before 2015, and Android phones not running the Android 6.0 operating system or above. It can also generate false readings of close contacts in a third of cases. Read
more Restaurants were allowed to expand outdoor dining in New York City earlier this year Outdoor dining will be a permanent, year-round fixture of the restaurant scene in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced. The Open Restaurant initiative allowed 9,000 restaurants to reopen their doors and expand outdoor-dining services to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The initiative was set to expire on 31 October, but on Friday Mayor de Blasio said it would continue indefinitely. Outdoor dining throughout the cooler autumn and winter months would be an âimportant part of how we recover as a cityâ, he said. âI believe this is going to make it a lot easier for restaurants to survive,â the mayor said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the initiative will help restaurants survive Restaurants will be required to observe social-distancing restrictions when indoor dining returns in New York City on 30 September. More outdoor space will enable restaurants to accommodate more customers, saving thousands of jobs. The industry has welcomed the mayorâs announcement, with restaurant group NYC Hospitality Alliance hailing the move as a âcritical lifeline for thousands of small businessesâ. We reported earlier on confirmation from London Councils, which represents the city's 33 councils, that the UK capital had beenput on the coronavirus watchlist. Public Health England's latestcoronavirus weekly surveillance report,externalhas now been published and confirms all of London's boroughs have been made areas of ""concern"". The report shows the incidence rates in the capital, with the rate in the City of London estimated at 11.5 per 100,000 people, while in Havering it is 30.3. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said: ""The placement of London on the watchlist as an area of concern is a reflection of the rising number of cases of Covid-19 being shown by a range of indicators. ""We are currently seeing much more widespread transmission in the city and being recognised as an area of concern is an important step in our efforts to control the virus."" He says the new status ""will enable us to respond more rapidly and with additional measures should cases rise further and faster"". Dr Mike Ryan said two million deaths were possible even with an effective vaccine The deaths of two million people with Covid-19 is âvery likelyâ unless the world takes comprehensive action to curb the spread of the disease, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) expert has warned. Dr Mike Ryan was asked on Friday whether two million fatalities worldwide was possible before a vaccine against the disease became available. âItâs certainly unimaginable, but itâs not impossible,â Dr Ryan told a media briefing at the WHOâs headquarters in Geneva. Almost one million people have died with coronavirus worldwide since the disease first emerged in China late last year. Dr Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies team, said fatality rates were dropping as treatments for the disease improve. But he said better treatments and even an effective vaccine would not be enough on their own to prevent further deaths. âAre we prepared to do what it takes to avoid that number?,â Dr Ryan said, calling on governments to do everything within their power to control Covid-19. âUnless we do it all, the number you speak about is not only imaginable, but unfortunately and sadly, very likely.â Peter Mwai and Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the Covid-19 outbreak in Africa may have passed its peak, but warns governments not to be complacent as countries relax their restrictions. The number of new daily confirmed cases overall has been dropping for about two months now, although some countries are still seeing a rise in cases. The humanitarian relief body International Rescue Committee says it believes the true scale of the pandemic may be hiddenbecause of a lack of testing and issues with data.,external Andthe WHO says changes in testing capacity and strategycan also affect numbers. A series of local lockdowns have been announced today in the
north of England and in parts of Wales, including its two biggest cities. Different householdsin Leeds,Stockport,
Wigan and Blackpoolare banned from meeting in private homes or gardens in
an effort to slow rising cases of coronavirus from midnight. In Wales, Cardiff and the county of Swanseago into lockdown at 18:00 BST on
Sunday, 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli. People will not be able to enter or leave the areas without a
reasonable excuse, the Welsh government says. They will also not be able to meet indoors with anyone they do
not live with, with extended households suspended. Find outhow many coronavirus cases there are in your area  Denmark has had fewer cases than its European neighbours so far Denmark is the latest European country to see a second spike of coronavirus infections, mirroring a concerning pattern happening across the world. On Friday, Danish health minister Magnus Heunicke said restrictions already in place would be extended by two weeks until 19 October. ""A rise in new infections was expected, but it has come earlier than we had anticipated,"" Heunicke told a news conference. Under the rules, public gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. Denmark has fared better than many other European countries,recording 24,357 cases and 643 deaths,external, the latest WHO data shows. However, the country has seen a pronounced spike in recent days, tallying 678 on Friday. The US remains in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, because infections have not decreased sufficiently since the initial outbreak, the country's leading infectious diseases expert has said. Dr Anthony Fauci said the second wave of a pandemic happens when infections of a disease subside significantly before a marked resurgence at a later date. During the flu pandemic of 1918, for example, infections spiked in the spring then ""literally disappeared"", before an âexplosionâ of cases in autumn, Dr Fauci said. ""Rather than say, 'a second wave,' why don't we say, 'are we prepared for the challenge of the fall and the winter?',""Dr Fauci told CNN,external. World Health Organization (WHO) data shows,externalthe US has recorded more than 13,000 new infections of coronavirus a day since late March. New cases dipped slightly after hitting a peak of 74,354 on 19 July, but have continued to increase by at least 40,000 a day since then, according to the data. At least 202,000 people have died with Covid-19 so far in the US, the highest number of fatalities in the world. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students should not be made ""scapegoats"" for a wave of Covid outbreaks, says a lecturers' leader. Jo Grady of the UCU university staff union said it was the ""completely predictable"" outcome of encouraging large numbers of students to return. With universities in England returning, she called for them to switch as much as possible to online teaching. The Department for Education says it is supporting universities to have a mix of online and face-to-face teaching. Dr Grady saidtough restrictions on students in Scotlandand increasing warnings for students in England did not mean outbreaks were a consequence of ""reckless behaviour"" by students. Earlier, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid students were not
to blamefor recent outbreaks at the country's universities. Some students have claimed that they are being ""singled
out"" after they were told not to visit pubs or restaurants over the
weekend. Read
more from Sean Dr Tedros said he ""didn't believe"" the US's decision to withdraw from the WHO President Donald Trump ""doesn't have any good reason to withdraw"" the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said. President Trump announced the termination of the country's relationship with the WHO in May, accusing the UN agency of failing to hold China to account over the coronavirus pandemic. âMy first reaction was, to be honest, I didnât believe it,âDr Tedros said in an interview with Time Magazine,external. ""Even now I believe that the US administration doesnât have any good reason to withdraw from WHO."" In 2019, the US was the global health agency's largest single contributor,providing 15.18% of its total budget,external. Dr Tedros said the impact of US withdrawal was uncertain, but stressed it was the countryâs ""global leadership"" that mattered more to him than its financial contribution. Nevertheless, Dr Tedros was hopeful co-operation would prevail over division, especially when vaccines against Covid-19 are distributed. ""The basic principle we're following now, in terms of distribution of the vaccines, is to give vaccines to some people in all countries, not all people in some countries,"" he said. A policeman speaking to shop owners at a market in Jerusalem It has been a week since Israel went into its second nationwide lockdown, and nownew restrictions have come into effectto help stop the rise in cases. From this afternoon, businesses not officially considered essential were ordered closed, and travel restricted to 1km (0.6 miles) from people's homes. Other planned rules which would affect protesters and synagogue-goers have not yet been approved by parliament, amid disagreements. Covid-19 cases in Israel have continued to rise despite the latest lockdown. A new record of more than 8,000 infections for a single day were recorded on Thursday in Israel, which has one of the highest rates of infections per capita in the world. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam - and his wife Pamela - tested positive The governor of the US state of Virginia has tested positive for coronavirus. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam and his wife Pamela were both tested on Thursday, after a member of staff at their residence was found to have Covid-19, a statement released on the governor's website said. The governor is currently asymptomatic, while the first lady has mild symptoms. Both will isolate for 10 days, the statement added. He is the second governor in as many days to test positive, after Missouri Governor Mike Parson and his wife announced they had been infected on Thursday. The news comes ahead of a planned rally by President Donald Trump in the state, which health officials have warned could pose a ""severe health risk"". According to the Washington Post, the director of the local health district had asked the company that operates the airport where the rally is planned to adhere to the state's 250-person limit on gatherings. A further 6,874 UK coronavirus cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, according to thelatest government figures,external. There have also been 34 deaths, according to the statistics, but the government says this does not including Scotland due to a power outage at National Records of Scotland. In
an interview with the Guardian,external, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says household
visits must soon be banned for the capital's nine million residents. His remarks come after London councils said that London is now on England's coronavirus watchlist - which is expected to be confirmed by Public Health England later. Khan tells the the newspaper: ""It's obviously bad news that London is an area of concern. ""But the good news is that finally the government will pull their finger out and give us additional support."" He said he had lobbied the prime minister for tougher measures in London, saying: ""If you go too late, we will already be in a north-east, north-west, Birmingham-type situation. You've got to go early, particular in the absence of testing. ""One of the things that I said to the prime minister is: I think we should be following what's happening around the country and stopping social mixing of households , and I say that with a heavy heart."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the rise in cases was ""very worrying"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has expressed alarm over a âworryingâ rise of coronavirus infections in the Netherlands, warning of new measures to control the disease. Rutte issued the warning as the country saw another daily record of new coronavirus infections on Friday, tallying 2,777 over the past 24 hours. Cases have risen sharply since the beginning of September. ""The figures look downright terrible,â the PM told reporters at a news conference. âIn short, the situation is very worrisome and will force us to take extra measures.â He said the new measures will be announced next week. The coronavirus situation in The Hague, Rotterdam and Amsterdam was of particular concern, he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Police said all 43 regional forces in England and Wales were involved in the raids More than 1,000 people have been arrested and an estimated Â£1.2m worth of drugs seized in a police crackdown on so-called ""county lines"" gangs. Young and vulnerable people are used as couriers to move drugs and cash between cities and smaller towns. Police said raids in the past week, involving all 43 regional forces in England and Wales, had been the most successful of their kind. Almost 200 weapons and Â£526,000 in cash were also seized. During a week-long operation, police forces also shut down about 10% of the phone lines (102) being used for drug dealing. County lines is the term used to describe criminal gangs who move illegal drugs from big cities to more rural locations and sell them via dedicated mobile phone lines. It is a ""business model"" which now dominates the drug trade, according to BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds. Investigators said restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic and a better understanding of mobile phone data had helped them target the drug dealers operating the lines. Nikki Holland, director of investigations with the National Crime Agency, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Drugs dealers were a lot more visible on empty trains and on roads that are less busy so it was much easier to be able to spot the drugs dealers."" She added the police forces had worked with phone companies to share intelligence with each other and now had a ""greater understanding"" of how phone lines are used when they are passed on from one group to another. By liaising with law enforcement overseas the NCA had been able to ""choke the supply"" of drugs, she said. Class A drugs, Â£526,000 in cash and almost 200 weapons were seized The operation resulted in: 1,041 arrests The discovery of an estimated Â£876,000 worth of cocaine, Â£87,000 worth of crack cocaine and Â£234,000 worth of heroin Seizure of Â£526,000 of cash Confiscation of 196 weapons including 130 knives, 18 firearms, 5 samurai swords and 10 knuckledusters 102 ""deal line"" devices, linked to phone numbers used to buy drugs, were shut down 1,551 vulnerable people were contacted by police for safeguarding purposes 69 referrals to the National Referral Mechanism as potential victims of human trafficking/modern slavery Visits to 861 cuckooed addresses - a practice where drugs gangs take over the homes of vulnerable people to sell drugs Key to the county lines trade are mobile phone numbers advertised in smaller towns but controlled by gang leaders in cities like London, Birmingham and Liverpool. The gangs send bulk text messages to customers informing them of what is on offer, with cocaine and heroin the most common drugs for sale. Gangs then have to transport the drugs to the areas where they are sold, often using young or vulnerable people, who are enticed or threatened into being involved. The phones used are usually pay-as-you-go, but police are obtaining communications data from network providers and analysing the calls and texts sent and received to work out who controls the line. The evidence is so strong, defendants often plead guilty without going to trial, police said. This video can not be played 'They are made to work in horrific circumstances' Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Graham McNulty, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for county lines, said: ""We know now what a county lines phone looks like."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said the results of the operation were ""hugely impressive"" and tackling county lines was a ""priority"" for the government. She said it had invested Â£25m in the ""crucial work"". Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"Shoppers are being urged to buy early this year for online Christmas gifts. With three months to go before the big day, the online retail industry is gearing up for a huge surge in demand. It's warning that firms may struggle to cope if we leave all our festive shopping till the last minute. ""We think the volumes are going to be really very excessive this year,"" said Andy Mulcahy from IMRG, the industry body for online retailers. ""Whilst that in itself is not a problem, getting too much of it too close to Christmas is going to be a bit of a problem,"" he said. ""If you can spread out your shopping and do quite a lot of it in November, maybe even a bit of it now, then that would really help."" Even before lockdown, online sales in the first months of 2020 were roughly 5% higher than last year. But since Covid-19 hit, the numbers have soared, with growth rates of around 40-50%, according to IMRG. And they've remained high ever since. ""At this point, I think we can expect an increase of at least 30% for the peak festive trading season, but if stores have to close this might push to 50%, "" Mr Mulcahy thinks. But he stressed that here's no need for shoppers to panic buy - as there's still plenty of time before the big day. So how will retailers and logistics companies manage this huge potential uplift in the run up to Christmas? ""It's been like Christmas for the last six months for us,"" said Mike Hancox, the boss of delivery firm Yodel. Yodel sorting centre in Hatfield It is one of the UK's biggest parcel couriers handling more than 150 million packages a year. But it had to adapt quickly in March, even partnering with taxi firms at one stage to help deliver the extra packages. Yodel's now preparing for a period of sustained demand this autumn and winter as shoppers flock online for convenience as social distancing restrictions remain in place. It's adding 2,500 self-employed drivers and nearly 500 staff in its sorting centres across the UK to bolter its operations. ""We think it will be the biggest online Christmas ever, by some way,"" Mr Hancox said. ""Certainly at Yodel it will be our biggest ever year. We're planning for success and I think every other delivery carrier will be expecting the same."" He's planning on handling a million extra parcels in the busiest week. But with rising unemployment and uncertainty over future coronavirus measures, many families may feel less able or willing to spend. The boss of Boots, Seb James, admits he ""just doesn't know"" what demand will look like - but there are three things he does feel sure about. ""Firstly, it will be much more online, so we've tripled our online capacity,"" he said. ""The second thing is people are going to be much more anxious about money so value is going to be much more important this Christmas. ""And the third thing is that everyone has to shop safely... we won't be able to cram people in as we normally do at Christmas, we have to be very careful,"" he said. One of its new safety measures will be bookable out-of-hours shopping slots for customers over 60. Boots is also going early with some festive ranges, which are already in stores. Mr James says this was in response to customer demand. ""I think people are planning ahead and they're right to do so.

The John Lewis Christmas shop opens on Friday And it has already seen a surge in sales for some products.

"Cardiff has seen 38.2 cases per 100,000 people in the past week Wales' capital city is facing a local lockdown as coronavirus cases rise ""rapidly"". Cardiff council leader Huw Thomas has warned of potential restrictions on travel and different households mixing. He told a virtual meeting of the authority that over the past seven days, the area has seen 38.2 cases per 100,000 people. Mr Thomas said the city was on the verge of entering the Welsh Government's ""red zone"". He said if that was to happen ""then I fully expect that we will be implementing further restrictions as we have seen elsewhere"" in south Wales. Urdd Eisteddfod 2021 'at risk' UK sees highest Covid cases since mass tests began Cardiff is home to 366,903 people and would be the seventh area to have tighter restrictions imposed. People living in Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and Newport cannot leave their areas without a reasonable excuse. Should Cardiff follow them into lockdown, it would mean more than a 1.2 million people - about a third of Wales' population - would be under tighter restrictions than the rest of the country. Conservative councillor Jayne Cowan asked Mr Thomas if Cardiff would be put into a local lockdown in the next 48 hours. He replied: ""We'll look at the numbers again in the morning and make a decision based on that."" It comes asCaerphilly's lockdown has been confirmedfor at least a further seven days. Mr Thomas said restrictions could be introduced ""at speed"" and could include a ban on households meeting or travel outside of Cardiff. The council leader said the coronavirus test positivity rate stood at 3.8%, which exceeds the government's amber threshold of 2.5%. There has been a sharp rise in hospital emergency attendance in the past week, he added, with the spread of infection ""most frequently found within household settings"". ""Our test trace and protect data suggests this is particularly in cases where family bubble rules have been breached, and also where people are mixing in indoor home settings and not following the rule of six,"" he said. ""The truth is that indoor mixing with people not in extended households in homes, cafes, bars and restaurants is happening far too frequently."" Cardiff city centre at the end of July Mr Thomas said there had been a significant rise in those aged 35 to 50 testing positive. Any new restrictions would need to be introduced by the Welsh Government. Mr Thomas said he met First Minister Mark Drakeford and Health Minister Vaughan Gething prior to Thursday night's council meeting. The threshold for foreign countries to be added to the list of destinations where people need to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in the UK is 20 cases per 100,000. Cardiff councillor Jayne Cowan told BBC Radio Wales a local lockdown was ""inevitable"" but feared the impact on businesses. ""Many businesses won't survive another lockdown,"" she said. ""We're seeing many thousands of cases of people having livelihoods stripped away. As part of the first lockdown, I was made redundant from my part time job. ""The Welsh Government needs to come up with the goods."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman, Andrew RT Davies, tweeted that a ""it's incumbent on the Welsh Labour government to bring forward a package of financial support for the many businesses (particularly hospitality) that will be devastated by the news"". He said a blanket lockdown of the city ""really isn't local"". Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru health spokesman, said: ""Shutting pubs slightly earlier isn't going to be enough - the Welsh Government must think of a suite of new steps, which are perhaps stricter but for a shorter period, in order to control these new spikes.""

"Mr Kim said the incident should never have happened North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has issued a rare personal apology for the killing of a South Korean official, Seoul says. Mr Kim reportedly told South Korean leader Moon Jae-in that the ""disgraceful affair"" should not have happened. South Korea has said the 47-year-old man was found by troops floating in the North's waters. He was then shot dead and his body was set alight, according to Seoul. It is not known what the man was doing there. The South Korean government has said he may have been trying to defect to the North but his family has denied this. The killing - the first of a South Korean citizen by North Korean forces for a decade - has caused outrage in the South. The border between the Koreas is tightly policed, and the North is thought to have a ""shoot-to-kill"" policy in place to prevent coronavirus from entering the country. Kim Yo-jong: North Korea's heir apparent? Kim Jong-un and the brutal North Korea rumour mill The apology came in the form of a letter sent to President Moon which acknowledged that the incident should not have happened, according to South Korea's presidential office, also known as the Blue House. The South Korean island of Yeonpyeong sits near the border with the North Mr Kim called it a ""disgraceful affair"" and said he felt ""very sorry"" for ""disappointing"" Mr Moon and the South Korean people, the Blue House said. It is the North's first official comment on the incident. The North also gave the South the results of its investigation - it said more than 10 shots were fired at the man, who had entered North Korean waters and then failed to reveal his identity and tried to flee, South Korea's director of national security Suh Hoon said. However the North insisted that it had not burned the man's body but rather the ""floating material"" that was carrying him. ""The troops could not locate the unidentified trespasser during a search after firing the shots, and burned the device under national emergency disease prevention measures,"" Mr Suh told a briefing, referring to the North Korean account. The presidential office in Seoul has also decided to release recent letters between the two leaders. In them Kim Jong-un said he understood ""more than anyone the kind of pressure and hardship"" required to overcome the coronavirus pandemic and damage from recent typhoons. It was the ""heartfelt truth"" that he shared the ""pain and suffering of the Southern people"", he said. This incident could have been a disaster for any hopes of rekindling talks between the South's President Moon and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. As it is many South Koreans will not forgive or forget easily. They are shocked and outraged at what appears to have been the brutal killing of an unarmed civilian in North Korean waters. It is yet another reminder of North Korea's often merciless regime. It's also worth noting that the North's account of the killing does not match the details given by officials in the South. However, this rare personal apology from Kim Jong-un may go some way to assuage Southern anger. If there had been no apology, Mr Kim's warm letter to Mr Moon would have been wasted. By at least attempting to smooth things over, Mr Kim may be signalling his willingness to keep talking. The father-of-two, who worked for the fisheries department, was on his patrol boat about 10km (6 miles) from the border with the North, near the island of Yeonpyeong, when he disappeared on Monday, the South Korean defence ministry said. He had left his shoes behind on the boat. South Korean media said he had recently divorced and had financial problems. A North Korean patrol boat found the man, who was wearing a life jacket, at sea at around 15:30 local time on Tuesday. They put gas masks on and questioned him from a distance before ""orders from [a] superior authority"" came in that the man be killed, South Korea said. He was shot dead in the water. South Korea says North Korean troops then burned the corpse at sea. President Moon Jae-in called the killing a ""shocking"" incident that could not be tolerated. He urged the North to take ""responsible"" measures over the attack. The country's National Security Council said the North could ""not justify shooting and burning the corpse of our unarmed citizen who showed no sign of resistance"". Officials said they had done a ""thorough analysis of diverse intelligence"", but it was not clear how exactly they had gathered the information. The military hotline between North and South was cut in June, and the inter-Korean liaison office, which was built to help both sides communicate,was destroyed by North Korea. But South Korean military is known to intercept the North's radio communications, AFP news agency reports. Mr Kim's apology comes at a time when relations between the North and South are at a low point and there is a stand-off between Pyongyang and Washington over the North's nuclear programme. South Korea has in the past demanded apologies from the North but these have rarely been forthcoming. The Northhas refused to apologise for the sinking of a South Korean warshipin 2010, in which 46 sailors died, and denies responsibility. It also refused to apologise for shelling a South Korean island the same year, killing two soldiers and two construction workers. The tiny South Korean island watching the horizon Why did North Korea destroy liaison office? Why was Korea divided? North Korea may be taking extra-tough measures to prevent the coronavirus from entering the country because it is thought to be preparing for a huge military parade on 10 October to mark the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party. Pyongyang closed its border with China in January to try to prevent the spread Covid-19. In July, North Korean state media said the country had raised its state of emergency to the maximum level. Last month, the commander of the US military's forces in South Korea, Robert Abrams, said the North had introduced a new ""buffer zone"" of one to two kilometres on the Chinese border, and that the country had special operation forces in place with orders to ""shoot-to-kill"" anyone coming across the border. In the past, North Korea has also returned people who have wandered into their territory. In 2017, state news agency KCNA said officials would repatriate a South Korean fishing boat which ""illegally"" crossed the border, in what was seen as a rare humanitarian move.

"Students in Glasgow have been getting tests after an outbreak Students in Scotland are being told not to go to pubs, parties or restaurants this weekend in a bid to stem a spate of coronavirus outbreaks. Hundreds of university students have tested positive at campuses across the country, with many more self-isolating. Universities have now pledged to make it ""absolutely clear"" to students that there must be no parties. And they will not be allowed to socialise with anyone outside of their accommodation. Students have also been warned that any breaches of the new rules ""will not be tolerated"". Thestricter guidelines,externalwere announced after opposition leaders accused First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of a ""basic failure"" to anticipate the problem and provide more testing on university campuses. However they have been criticised by the National Union of Students Scotland as ""unjustified""and ""deeply concerning"". President Matt Crilly said it was especially concerning for students who relied on income from hospitality jobs, and showed ""complete disregard"" for their mental health and wellbeing. Mary Senior, of the University and College Union, said she was ""absolutely astounded"" by the announcement, saying the outbreaks were ""inevitable"". Speaking on BBCGood Morning Scotlandshe questioned the motives of universities in bringing students back to campus, pointing out that student accommodation ""provides important commercial income for universities"" and ""cross subsidies teaching"". Meanwhile the Children and Young People's Commissioner Scotland has raisedconcerns about the ""human rights implications"",externalof the restrictions. Self-isolation: PPE to pee and running out of food What do campus outbreaks mean for students? University outbreaks 'should have been predicted' Universities Scotland said the new guidance that had been agreed with the Scottish government was a ""necessary step at this crucial moment of managing the virus in the student population, to protect students and the wider community"". The new rules state that all universities will ""make absolutely clear to students that there must be no parties, and no socialising outside their households"". They go on to say: ""This weekend, the first of the new tighter Scottish government guidance, we will require students to avoid all socialising outside of their households and outside of their accommodation. ""We will ask them not to go to bars or other hospitality venues."" Extra staff will be brought into student accommodation to watch for any breaches of the guidance and to support students who are self-isolating. LaterUniversities Scotland denied the move amounted to a ban,externalbut admitted it was a ""big ask"". And Nicola Sturgeon clarified,externalthat the rules about avoiding hospitality applied only to this weekend. One Glasgow University student, Elise, told BBC Scotland that she was angry at the new rules imposing strict restrictions on their social lives. The first-year student is currently isolating at Murano Street halls, after one of her flatmates tested positive. She described the new restrictions as ""quite ridiculous"" and said it was wrong to pin the blame on students for spreading the virus. She asked why the university told them to move into the halls when they could have followed their online courses from home. ""We were told to come to university halls - 48 people from across the country in one building- it was inevitable that it was going to spread,"" she said. ""We are getting punished for just living here but we were told to come. ""There's no reason for us to be here because everything is online."" Another student at the Murano halls asked how the requirement not to go to pubs was going to be policed. ""Will there be officers going up to students and asking if they are students? ""We are isolating so we won't be going to pubs anyway but what about those students who are fine? It's a depressing and bleak situation."" Police Scotland will also be monitoring student behaviour off-campus and in private accommodation. And private providers of student accommodation will also be urged to strictly enforce the guidance. Students will also be required to download the Protect Scotland app. The guidance warns: ""We will take a strict 'Yellow Card/Red Card' approach to breaches of student discipline that put students and others at risk. ""While we first want to advise students about breaches of discipline, we will not hesitate to escalate this to disciplinary action including potential discontinuation of study."" In aTwitter message directed at students,external, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was sorry Covid was ""making this special time of your lives so tough"". ""But it won't be forever and the more we get this virus back under control now, the sooner you'll get a bit of normality back,"" she said. Several universities across the country are dealing with major outbreaks of the virus, with many students in halls of residence in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen and Edinburgh all being told to self-isolate. A total of 172 Glasgow University students have so far tested positive, with 600 in isolation, while all 500 residents at the Parker House halls in Dundeehave been told to quarantine. And 120 cases have been identified in an outbreak at Edinburgh Napier University. Opposition parties have argued that the Scottish government should have been better prepared for outbreaks when university students returned for the new term. Ms Sturgeon has said the number of positive cases at universities was likely to increase, but claimed this showed that the test and protect system ""is working, and we must continue to have confidence in that"". She urged students to follow the latest guidance and said she was sorry that the pandemic was ""making this special time of your lives so tough"". Life for university students was already very different this term. Most students were already set to learn mostly online, but the university experience is a social one as much as an academic one. Perhaps the most significant move is to appeal to students not to visit bar or hospitality venues. Ultimately students who break the rules on campus or in university accommodation face expulsion. However, universities know they also have to appeal to the individual's sense of responsibility and common sense. It will still be a big ask. Homesick students won't usually be able to go back inside the family home they lived in until a few weeks ago. Starting university can be a difficult experience - a student may not like their course or may find it hard to live away from home or make new friends. This year it will be even tougher so for that reason, it will be more important than ever to consider the wellbeing and mental health of students. Are you a student in Scotland?

"Shoppers are being urged to buy early this year for online Christmas gifts. With three months to go before the big day, the online retail industry is gearing up for a huge surge in demand. It's warning that firms may struggle to cope if we leave all our festive shopping till the last minute. ""We think the volumes are going to be really very excessive this year,"" said Andy Mulcahy from IMRG, the industry body for online retailers. ""Whilst that in itself is not a problem, getting too much of it too close to Christmas is going to be a bit of a problem,"" he said. ""If you can spread out your shopping and do quite a lot of it in November, maybe even a bit of it now, then that would really help."" Even before lockdown, online sales in the first months of 2020 were roughly 5% higher than last year. But since Covid-19 hit, the numbers have soared, with growth rates of around 40-50%, according to IMRG. And they've remained high ever since. ""At this point, I think we can expect an increase of at least 30% for the peak festive trading season, but if stores have to close this might push to 50%, "" Mr Mulcahy thinks. But he stressed that here's no need for shoppers to panic buy - as there's still plenty of time before the big day. So how will retailers and logistics companies manage this huge potential uplift in the run up to Christmas? ""It's been like Christmas for the last six months for us,"" said Mike Hancox, the boss of delivery firm Yodel. Yodel sorting centre in Hatfield It is one of the UK's biggest parcel couriers handling more than 150 million packages a year. But it had to adapt quickly in March, even partnering with taxi firms at one stage to help deliver the extra packages. Yodel's now preparing for a period of sustained demand this autumn and winter as shoppers flock online for convenience as social distancing restrictions remain in place. It's adding 2,500 self-employed drivers and nearly 500 staff in its sorting centres across the UK to bolter its operations. ""We think it will be the biggest online Christmas ever, by some way,"" Mr Hancox said. ""Certainly at Yodel it will be our biggest ever year. We're planning for success and I think every other delivery carrier will be expecting the same."" He's planning on handling a million extra parcels in the busiest week. But with rising unemployment and uncertainty over future coronavirus measures, many families may feel less able or willing to spend. The boss of Boots, Seb James, admits he ""just doesn't know"" what demand will look like - but there are three things he does feel sure about. ""Firstly, it will be much more online, so we've tripled our online capacity,"" he said. ""The second thing is people are going to be much more anxious about money so value is going to be much more important this Christmas. ""And the third thing is that everyone has to shop safely... we won't be able to cram people in as we normally do at Christmas, we have to be very careful,"" he said. One of its new safety measures will be bookable out-of-hours shopping slots for customers over 60. Boots is also going early with some festive ranges, which are already in stores. Mr James says this was in response to customer demand. ""I think people are planning ahead and they're right to do so. Last minute cramming is just not going to work... we hope that people will spread out their shopping."" John Lewis's online Christmas shop opened in August after a spike in searches by customers. The John Lewis Christmas shop opens on Friday And it has already seen a surge in sales for some products. The company says sales of trees were up 233% at the end of last week, compared with the previous year. Christmas decorations, meanwhile, were up 156%. Who knows how jolly this festive season will be. But one thing seems clear, it will be the most digital one yet for shopping.

"Police said all 43 regional forces in England and Wales were involved in the raids More than 1,000 people have been arrested and an estimated Â£1.2m worth of drugs seized in a police crackdown on so-called ""county lines"" gangs. Young and vulnerable people are used as couriers to move drugs and cash between cities and smaller towns. Police said raids in the past week, involving all 43 regional forces in England and Wales, had been the most successful of their kind. Almost 200 weapons and Â£526,000 in cash were also seized. During a week-long operation, police forces also shut down about 10% of the phone lines (102) being used for drug dealing. County lines is the term used to describe criminal gangs who move illegal drugs from big cities to more rural locations and sell them via dedicated mobile phone lines. It is a ""business model"" which now dominates the drug trade, according to BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds. Investigators said restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic and a better understanding of mobile phone data had helped them target the drug dealers operating the lines. Nikki Holland, director of investigations with the National Crime Agency, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Drugs dealers were a lot more visible on empty trains and on roads that are less busy so it was much easier to be able to spot the drugs dealers."" She added the police forces had worked with phone companies to share intelligence with each other and now had a ""greater understanding"" of how phone lines are used when they are passed on from one group to another. By liaising with law enforcement overseas the NCA had been able to ""choke the supply"" of drugs, she said. Class A drugs, Â£526,000 in cash and almost 200 weapons were seized The operation resulted in: 1,041 arrests The discovery of an estimated Â£876,000 worth of cocaine, Â£87,000 worth of crack cocaine and Â£234,000 worth of heroin Seizure of Â£526,000 of cash Confiscation of 196 weapons including 130 knives, 18 firearms, 5 samurai swords and 10 knuckledusters 102 ""deal line"" devices, linked to phone numbers used to buy drugs, were shut down 1,551 vulnerable people were contacted by police for safeguarding purposes 69 referrals to the National Referral Mechanism as potential victims of human trafficking/modern slavery Visits to 861 cuckooed addresses - a practice where drugs gangs take over the homes of vulnerable people to sell drugs Key to the county lines trade are mobile phone numbers advertised in smaller towns but controlled by gang leaders in cities like London, Birmingham and Liverpool. The gangs send bulk text messages to customers informing them of what is on offer, with cocaine and heroin the most common drugs for sale. Gangs then have to transport the drugs to the areas where they are sold, often using young or vulnerable people, who are enticed or threatened into being involved. The phones used are usually pay-as-you-go, but police are obtaining communications data from network providers and analysing the calls and texts sent and received to work out who controls the line. The evidence is so strong, defendants often plead guilty without going to trial, police said. This video can not be played 'They are made to work in horrific circumstances' Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Graham McNulty, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for county lines, said: ""We know now what a county lines phone looks like."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said the results of the operation were ""hugely impressive"" and tackling county lines was a ""priority"" for the government.

"This video can not be played Lord Wolfson says it's going to be ""very uncomfortable"" for a lot of people who work in retail The boss of one of the UK's most successful and resilient High Street chains has told the BBC that hundreds of thousands of traditional retail jobs may not survive in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Lord Wolfson, who runs clothing firm Next, said there was a clear threat to thousands of jobs, which are now ""unviable"" because the lockdown has triggered a permanent shift to online shopping. ""I wouldn't want to underestimate the difficulty that is going to cause a lot of people who work in retail, I think it's going to be very uncomfortable,"" he said. His comments came just hours after the chancellor announceda new Job Support Schemethat would see the government top up the pay of people unable to work full time. But the government's contribution to workers' pay will fall sharply compared with the furlough scheme. Under furlough, it initially paid 80% of a monthly wage up to Â£2,500 - under the new scheme this will drop to 22%. ""We don't think we need it,"" Lord Wolfson said. ""But we think there are other sectors that desperately will."" And while he welcomed the chancellor's announcement, he said it was important that businesses eventually learn to live without government support. ""It seems like a very sensible scheme to me,"" he said. ""I think it's important that employers begin to pay a little bit more for the schemes and that employees get a little bit less - because otherwise I think there's a risk that our economy will just become hooked on it."" Next is considered one of the best run retail businesses in the UK and Lord Wolfson was confident that compulsory redundancies in his own business would be minimal and new jobs would be added in call centres and distribution centres. ""We think by the time it gets to the end of October, there'll be enough work through the normal build up to Christmas to employ all the people that we've currently got on furlough,"" he said. ""We've got less than 10% of our staff on (furlough) at the moment."" But he expressed fears for others. Next's sales have proved resilient compared to its rivals, even eking out a small profit for the first half of this year, thanks to its strong online business and a strong presence in retail parks, which have regained popularity as shoppers shunned city centres and public transport. ""I don't think so,"" Lord Wolfson said. ""But I think they're going to have to change and change very radically."" He wants to see that change come from ""the bottom up"", driven by entrepreneurs. And he thinks that freeing up property would be good for the country, especially if the government allows people to do what they want with those sites. ""The one thing that we are desperately short of in Britain is property, we haven't got enough space to live in,"" he said. The value of city centre retail property is plummeting. Many tenants have found themselves unable to pay their rent and have relied on government intervention to save them from eviction by landlords. But Lord Wolfson says we should not be too quick to demonise landlords as their investment will be needed to create the High Streets of the future. ""If city centres and town centres are going to regenerate, it is only going to be from the investment that landlords make in those properties."" But he says the confidence of those landlords would be damaged if tenants tear up rental agreements. But one gripe he does share with his retail competitors is the increasing burden of business rates, which he says have become increasingly divorced from the value of the properties on which they are charged. ""Rates have become unfair,"" he said. ""One of the great principles of taxation is that it should be in proportion to your ability to pay. A gulf has opened up between what rates were being charged and what rates we should be charged at a fair price."" But that would leave a massive hole in government finances. Should the government raise rates on the warehouses and logistics centres of the online retailers? ""That is exactly what government should do,"" Lord Wolfson said. ""Over the last six or seven years the price of warehousing has gone up dramatically, and the price of shops have come down dramatically, but both of their rates have remained exactly the same. ""So we think that, actually, you could raise rates on warehousing between 30% and 50% and that would make up for some of the loss and that would be fair."" Lord Wolfson was a prominent supporter of Brexit - so what does he make of the dire warnings of thousands of trucks queuing on the roads of Kent, a chronic shortage of customs officers and potential chaos at the ports as the UK leaves the EU for real when the transition period ends in 97 days? ""There's a lot of speculation about what it will look like and I'm certainly not going to get involved in that type of speculation,"" he said. ""All I can say is that we've worked very hard  for over two years on making sure that the company is ready to deal with all the administrative changes that will come with a no deal Brexit. ""I hope we don't, but if we do end up in that situation, certainly, the business I work for will be ready.""

"Rishi Sunak's new jobs support scheme will slow but not stop, ""major"" job losses, influential think tank the Resolution Foundation has warned. The chancellor said he hoped the new plan,announced on Thursday, would ""benefit large numbers"". But the Resolution Foundation said the fact firms had to pay employees for hours not worked meant many would have ""little or no incentive"" to use it. The plan ""will not significantly reduce the rise in unemployment,"" it said. The Foundation also highlighted that around six million of the UK's poorest households could see their incomes cut by Â£20 a week from next April, when the government's temporary boost to basic benefits comes to an end. The Job Support Scheme, which will replace the furlough scheme, will see workers get three quarters of their normal salaries for six months. To be eligible, employees must work for at least one third of their normal hours. For the hours not worked, the government and employer will each pay one-third of the remaining wages. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said the higher contribution required from firms, compared to the furlough scheme, meant the new Job Support Scheme ""will not live up to its promise to significantly reduce the rise in unemployment."" At the start of the pandemic the government sought to reduce the economic impact of lockdown measures by temporarily boosting the standard allowance you collect if you claim benefits by Â£20 to Â£94.25 a week. That served to soften the income shock endured by workers moving from a job to benefits, which pay less than a fifth of the average wage. The Resolution Foundation's analysis points out that the Chancellor Rishi Sunak has chosen not to extend that temporary boost beyond April next year. That means that in April, at a time when unemployment is likely to be rising quickly, well over six million families already on benefits will see their incomes cut by Â£20 a week. And because they'd be forced to spend less, it would also reduce the overall level of demand in the economy, making more job losses more likely. The Foundation's report notes, for example, that it would cost a firm Â£1,500 to employ one full-time worker on Â£17,000, but more than Â£2,000 a month to employ two half-time workers on the same full-time equivalent salary. One full-time worker on Â£10,000 would cost Â£800 a month, compared with Â£1,100 a month for two half-time workers. Thousands of retail jobs unviable, Next boss warns What is replacing furlough? Sunak's post-furlough plan: At-a-glance Kuenssberg: No hiding now - for Sunak or businesses The government has stressed the scheme has been gratefully received in many quarters. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Steve Barclay, told BBC Breakfast that ""many employers value the flexibility of being able to tailor how much time employees are working as we go through uncertainty of winter months"". Mr Barclay said the scheme has been ""so warmly welcomed"" by the likes of the CBI, FSB, business leaders and trade unions, as well as sectors such as aerospace and hospitality, He said that businesses want to retain their skills and expertise of the labour market, and ""wanted the ability to bring people back on a part time basis"". The Foundation said that a single adult homeowner earning Â£20,000-a-year would face an income reduction of around 19% if they worked a third of their previous hours on the jobs support scheme, compared with a 70% drop were they to lose their job completely and move onto Universal Credit. However, employees only benefit from the Job Support Scheme (JSS) where employers choose to use it, and the scheme is far less generous for firms which gives them little or no incentive to use it, the Foundation said. Meanwhile, industries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic are facing further uncertainty after missing out on help in the chancellor's new emergency jobs scheme. Hospitality, events and retail workers and businesses have expressed concern, as have those on zero-hours contracts. Rishi Sunak said employees must be in ""viable"" jobs to benefit from the wage top-up scheme. This means people working in industries currently closed - such as nightclubs - may lose out as there isn't any work. Mr Sunak said he hoped the new plan, announced on Thursday, would ""benefit large numbers"", but warnedthe government ""can't save every job"". Opposition politicians have called for more emphasis on training for workers losing their jobs. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the BBC a national training strategy was needed ""so that when people become unemployed, they can hopefully be retrained with new skills"". The Lib Dems' Christine Jardine also criticised the lack of focus on training. She told the BBC that while the jobs plan was described as a ""bridge for the economy"", she wanted to know ""where will it take us?"" The government will subsidise the pay of employees who are working fewer than normal hours due to lower demand It will apply to staff who can work at least a third of their usual hours Employers will pay staff for the hours they work For the hours employees can't work, the government and the employer will each cover one third of the lost pay The grant will be capped at Â£697.92 per month All small and medium-sized businesses will be eligible Larger business will be eligible if their turnover has fallen during the crisis It will be open to employers across the UK even if they have not used the furlough scheme It will run for six months starting in November FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends?

"The government funded the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme in August The UK government borrowed Â£35.9bn in August as tackling the economic fallout of pandemic took its toll on the public finances, official figures show. The figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£30.5bn more than it borrowed in August last year. The increase meant that the borrowing figure hit its highest amount for August since records began in 1993. Borrowing between April and August totalled Â£173.7bn - also a record. August's monthly borrowing figure was, however, less than economists had predicted at Â£38bn, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also revised down,externalits estimate for UK borrowing in July, by more than Â£11bn, to Â£15.4bn, demonstrating how difficult tracking the economy during the pandemic can be. It also said that total UK debt passed Â£2 trillion for the first time in history in August, rather than in July as previously thought. In August, debt hit Â£2.024tn, Â£249.5bn more than the same time in 2019. That figure now exceeds the size of the UK economy, the highest level of debt seen since the 1960s. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that rising borrowing figures were down to the government absorbing ""much of the cost of the Covid-19 crisis"". The government has been forced to cover a wide range coronavirus-related costs - from the furlough scheme and bailouts for rail firms to business rates holidays and VAT cuts for hospitality and tourism. It has also set aside Â£500m to cover the cost of the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme, where diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August. Where do governments borrow money? Uncertainty as industries miss out on job support Rishi Sunak's post-furlough plan: At-a-glance But ""the big picture is that fiscal support will fade over the autumn causing many more job losses to be realised"", Mr Wishart added. The latest figures from the ONS show that while billions have been pumped into propping up the economy, tax receipts have dropped sharply. The amount collected by central government in taxes dropped to Â£37.3bn in August, which is Â£7.5bn less than a year before. The amount of VAT, corporation tax and income tax collected fell ""considerably"", the ONS said. It was another month of heavy government borrowing - though many economists thought it would be even more. As always, the outlook will depend on specific spending and tax measures and the strength of the economy. The leading headline from the chancellor's announcement yesterday was the coming replacement of the furlough scheme with the less generous Job Support Scheme. That will curb spending compared with extending the furlough scheme, though it's almost certain to mean substantial job losses. Another of his measures - the extension of the VAT cut for hospitality and tourism - will reduce tax revenue. The resurgence in Covid cases and the renewed restrictions intended to contain the pandemic are likely to cast a shadow over the economic recovery. Some economists expect the economy to stagnate for the rest of the year.  To the extent that does happen, it will undermine tax revenue. The new figures came the day after Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a series of extensions to existing coronavirus programmes, including a replacement for the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of October. Under the new wage ""top-up"" scheme, if bosses bring back workers part-time, the government will help top up their wages to at least three-quarters of their full-time pay. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Bank, said that the government's borrowing figures may ""partly correct themselves"" next year as a number of the chancellor's measures expire. Mr Shaw pointed out though that in order to bring down debt, the chancellor ""will have difficult decisions to make on fiscal policy"". But ""with the focus currently on trying to maintain the recovery, this is not the time,"" he added. Looking ahead, the ONS said that the chancellor was likely to borrow about Â£370bn in the 2020 financial year.

for 28 days. DubÃ© made the plea as the eastern province recorded a further 637 new cases on Friday, up 10% from the day before. Ontario, the most populous province, also saw a rise in new cases. In response, Premier Doug Ford announced on Friday that bars, restaurants
and strip clubs will have to close by midnight, and stop serving alcohol by 23:00 local time. On a national level, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resumed his daily Covid-19 briefing, which he had paused over the summer as cases declined. In a televised address on Tuesday, he warned that ""we are on the brink of a fall
that could be much worse than the spring"". Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics This weekâs report on
coronavirus hotspots from Public Health England has a new analysis. It shows that the most common
activity people recall doing before their coronavirus symptoms began is eating
out. MPs wrote to Baroness Dido
Harding, the head of NHS Test and Trace, earlier this week asking her to share
the evidence behind the 22:00 curfew and table service restrictions. Contact tracers asked people
what activities they had been doing in the days leading up to their coronavirus
symptoms. The most common answer from
the 45,000 people questioned was eating out (15%) closely followed by shopping
(13%). We canât say for certain if
this is where people picked up their infection, and canât say anything about
the people who donât pick up the phone to contact tracers. But it adds some evidence to
the public debate about the measures the government have announced. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem A political row has continued over the tightening of Covid-19 restrictions in Israel, a week after the country became the first in the world to begin asecond nationwide lockdown. Critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accuse him of trying to block the regular protests against him and his handling of the crisis. New rules came into effect at 14:00 (12:00 BST) local time, just ahead of the Israeli weekend. They close most workplaces and markets. Synagogues are to stay closed except on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which begins on Sunday evening. In parliament, Netanyahu was blocked from pushing through emergency measures to prevent the protests that have become a regular event outside his Jerusalem residence. However, anti-Netanyahu groups now say they will form a protest convoy to make their way there with participants, going no further than the 1km (0.6 mile) limit from their homes. One group is urging protesters to stage events on their balconies.

more Restaurants were allowed to expand outdoor dining in New York City earlier this year Outdoor dining will be a permanent, year-round fixture of the restaurant scene in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced. The Open Restaurant initiative allowed 9,000 restaurants to reopen their doors and expand outdoor-dining services to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The initiative was set to expire on 31 October, but on Friday Mayor de Blasio said it would continue indefinitely. Outdoor dining throughout the cooler autumn and winter months would be an âimportant part of how we recover as a cityâ, he said. âI believe this is going to make it a lot easier for restaurants to survive,â the mayor said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the initiative will help restaurants survive Restaurants will be required to observe social-distancing restrictions when indoor dining returns in New York City on 30 September. More outdoor space will enable restaurants to accommodate more customers, saving thousands of jobs. The industry has welcomed the mayorâs announcement, with restaurant group NYC Hospitality Alliance hailing the move as a âcritical lifeline for thousands of small businessesâ. We reported earlier on confirmation from London Councils, which represents the city's 33 councils, that the UK capital had beenput on the coronavirus watchlist. Public Health England's latestcoronavirus weekly surveillance report,externalhas now been published and confirms all of London's boroughs have been made areas of ""concern"". The report shows the incidence rates in the capital, with the rate in the City of London estimated at 11.5 per 100,000 people, while in Havering it is 30.3. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said: ""The placement of London on the watchlist as an area of concern is a reflection of the rising number of cases of Covid-19 being shown by a range of indicators. ""We are currently seeing much more widespread transmission in the city and being recognised as an area of concern is an important step in our efforts to control the virus."" He says the new status ""will enable us to respond more rapidly and with additional measures should cases rise further and faster"". Dr Mike Ryan said two million deaths were possible even with an effective vaccine The deaths of two million people with Covid-19 is âvery likelyâ unless the world takes comprehensive action to curb the spread of the disease, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) expert has warned. Dr Mike Ryan was asked on Friday whether two million fatalities worldwide was possible before a vaccine against the disease became available. âItâs certainly unimaginable, but itâs not impossible,â Dr Ryan told a media briefing at the WHOâs headquarters in Geneva. Almost one million people have died with coronavirus worldwide since the disease first emerged in China late last year. Dr Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies team, said fatality rates were dropping as treatments for the disease improve. But he said better treatments and even an effective vaccine would not be enough on their own to prevent further deaths. âAre we prepared to do what it takes to avoid that number?,â Dr Ryan said, calling on governments to do everything within their power to control Covid-19. âUnless we do it all, the number you speak about is not only imaginable, but unfortunately and sadly, very likely.â Peter Mwai and Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the Covid-19 outbreak in Africa may have passed its peak, but warns governments not to be complacent as countries relax their restrictions. The number of new daily confirmed cases overall has been dropping for about two months now, although some countries are still seeing a rise in cases. The humanitarian relief body International Rescue Committee says it believes the true scale of the pandemic may be hiddenbecause of a lack of testing and issues with data.,external Andthe WHO says changes in testing capacity and strategycan also affect numbers.

an effort to slow rising cases of coronavirus from midnight. In Wales, Cardiff and the county of Swanseago into lockdown at 18:00 BST on
Sunday, 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli. People will not be able to enter or leave the areas without a
reasonable excuse, the Welsh government says. They will also not be able to meet indoors with anyone they do
not live with, with extended households suspended. Find outhow many coronavirus cases there are in your area  Denmark has had fewer cases than its European neighbours so far Denmark is the latest European country to see a second spike of coronavirus infections, mirroring a concerning pattern happening across the world. On Friday, Danish health minister Magnus Heunicke said restrictions already in place would be extended by two weeks until 19 October. ""A rise in new infections was expected, but it has come earlier than we had anticipated,"" Heunicke told a news conference. Under the rules, public gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. Denmark has fared better than many other European countries,recording 24,357 cases and 643 deaths,external, the latest WHO data shows. However, the country has seen a pronounced spike in recent days, tallying 678 on Friday. The US remains in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, because infections have not decreased sufficiently since the initial outbreak, the country's leading infectious diseases expert has said. Dr Anthony Fauci said the second wave of a pandemic happens when infections of a disease subside significantly before a marked resurgence at a later date. During the flu pandemic of 1918, for example, infections spiked in the spring then ""literally disappeared"", before an âexplosionâ of cases in autumn, Dr Fauci said. ""Rather than say, 'a second wave,' why don't we say, 'are we prepared for the challenge of the fall and the winter?',""Dr Fauci told CNN,external. World Health Organization (WHO) data shows,externalthe US has recorded more than 13,000 new infections of coronavirus a day since late March. New cases dipped slightly after hitting a peak of 74,354 on 19 July, but have continued to increase by at least 40,000 a day since then, according to the data. At least 202,000 people have died with Covid-19 so far in the US, the highest number of fatalities in the world. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students should not be made ""scapegoats"" for a wave of Covid outbreaks, says a lecturers' leader. Jo Grady of the UCU university staff union said it was the ""completely predictable"" outcome of encouraging large numbers of students to return. With universities in England returning, she called for them to switch as much as possible to online teaching. The Department for Education says it is supporting universities to have a mix of online and face-to-face teaching. Dr Grady saidtough restrictions on students in Scotlandand increasing warnings for students in England did not mean outbreaks were a consequence of ""reckless behaviour"" by students.

more from Sean Dr Tedros said he ""didn't believe"" the US's decision to withdraw from the WHO President Donald Trump ""doesn't have any good reason to withdraw"" the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said. President Trump announced the termination of the country's relationship with the WHO in May, accusing the UN agency of failing to hold China to account over the coronavirus pandemic. âMy first reaction was, to be honest, I didnât believe it,âDr Tedros said in an interview with Time Magazine,external. ""Even now I believe that the US administration doesnât have any good reason to withdraw from WHO."" In 2019, the US was the global health agency's largest single contributor,providing 15.18% of its total budget,external. Dr Tedros said the impact of US withdrawal was uncertain, but stressed it was the countryâs ""global leadership"" that mattered more to him than its financial contribution. Nevertheless, Dr Tedros was hopeful co-operation would prevail over division, especially when vaccines against Covid-19 are distributed. ""The basic principle we're following now, in terms of distribution of the vaccines, is to give vaccines to some people in all countries, not all people in some countries,"" he said. A policeman speaking to shop owners at a market in Jerusalem It has been a week since Israel went into its second nationwide lockdown, and nownew restrictions have come into effectto help stop the rise in cases. From this afternoon, businesses not officially considered essential were ordered closed, and travel restricted to 1km (0.6 miles) from people's homes. Other planned rules which would affect protesters and synagogue-goers have not yet been approved by parliament, amid disagreements. Covid-19 cases in Israel have continued to rise despite the latest lockdown. A new record of more than 8,000 infections for a single day were recorded on Thursday in Israel, which has one of the highest rates of infections per capita in the world. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam - and his wife Pamela - tested positive The governor of the US state of Virginia has tested positive for coronavirus. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam and his wife Pamela were both tested on Thursday, after a member of staff at their residence was found to have Covid-19, a statement released on the governor's website said. The governor is currently asymptomatic, while the first lady has mild symptoms. Both will isolate for 10 days, the statement added. He is the second governor in as many days to test positive, after Missouri Governor Mike Parson and his wife announced they had been infected on Thursday. The news comes ahead of a planned rally by President Donald Trump in the state, which health officials have warned could pose a ""severe health risk"". According to the Washington Post, the director of the local health district had asked the company that operates the airport where the rally is planned to adhere to the state's 250-person limit on gatherings. A further 6,874 UK coronavirus cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, according to thelatest government figures,external. There have also been 34 deaths, according to the statistics, but the government says this does not including Scotland due to a power outage at National Records of Scotland. In
an interview with the Guardian,external, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says household
visits must soon be banned for the capital's nine million residents. His remarks come after London councils said that London is now on England's coronavirus watchlist - which is expected to be confirmed by Public Health England later. Khan tells the the newspaper: ""It's obviously bad news that London is an area of concern. ""But the good news is that finally the government will pull their finger out and give us additional support."" He said he had lobbied the prime minister for tougher measures in London, saying: ""If you go too late, we will already be in a north-east, north-west, Birmingham-type situation. You've got to go early, particular in the absence of testing. ""One of the things that I said to the prime minister is: I think we should be following what's happening around the country and stopping social mixing of households , and I say that with a heavy heart."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the rise in cases was ""very worrying"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has expressed alarm over a âworryingâ rise of coronavirus infections in the Netherlands, warning of new measures to control the disease. Rutte issued the warning as the country saw another daily record of new coronavirus infections on Friday, tallying 2,777 over the past 24 hours. Cases have risen sharply since the beginning of September. ""The figures look downright terrible,â the PM told reporters at a news conference. âIn short, the situation is very worrisome and will force us to take extra measures.â He said the new measures will be announced next week. The coronavirus situation in The Hague, Rotterdam and Amsterdam was of particular concern, he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Shoppers will feel the impact of a no-deal Brexit at supermarket tills, the British Retail Consortium has warned. The BRC said tariffs would add Â£3.1bn a year to the cost of importing food and drink unless the UK and EU can strike a free trade agreement. ""If there is no deal before Christmas, the increase in tariffs will leave retailers with nowhere to go other than to raise the price of food,"" it said. The government said it was ""working hard"" to reach a deal. Andrew Opie, director of food at the BRC, said coronavirus was ""already making life hard for consumers"", particularly those on lower incomes. ""A no-deal Brexit will have a massive impact on their ability to afford essential goods,"" he added. The EU is the UK's largest trading partner and the source of 80% of its imported food, the BRC said. But if the UK is unable to reach a deal with the bloc, the average tariff on food it imports would be over 20%, the trade body warned. Those tariffs include a 48% levy on beef mince, 16% on cucumbers and 57% on cheddar cheese. Under a new tariff schedule, set to come into effect in January, 85% of food imports from the EU will be subject to a tariff of more than 5%, the BRC said. The longstanding post-Brexit promise is of free trade deals that will decrease taxes on imports - called tariffs - and lower prices for consumers. But should no trade deal be reached with the EU, from January, one of the most noticeable impacts will be the new UK Global Tariff applying to imports of food and drink from the EU. Understandably, supermarkets have worked out the cost of applying these new tariffs in this British Retail Consortium exercise on their own supply chain data - the total is Â£3.1bn next year, versus zero this year. That is worth about Â£112 per household. As an illustration, if the entire cost of the tariff were passed on to consumers a Â£3 pack of Irish beef mince could cost Â£4.08 and Spanish cucumbers could cost 47p instead of 43p. In practice, some - but not all - these cost increases would be passed on, and some lower tariffs on imports from other places could offset those rises. But concerns about tariffs on EU food and drink imports are one of the issues troubling retailers. The BRC also said increases in ""physical checks, paperwork, and other non-tariff barriers"" will further push up the cost for retailers. ""With coronavirus affecting the livelihoods of millions of people in the UK, many households can ill afford higher prices for their weekly food shop,"" it said. It claimed that the UK grocery sector is ""one of the most competitive in the world"", operating on tight margins. As a result, it said, any additional costs would be passed on to customers. ""UK consumers have benefitted from great value, quality, and choice of food thanks to our ability to trade tariff free with the EU,"" Mr Opie said. ""There is now the risk of a Â£3bn tax bill for the food we cannot source here in the UK."" A government spokeswoman said: ""Negotiations are ongoing and discussions will be continuing at the next formal round in Brussels next week."" ""The UK is a significant importer of food and other goods, and avoiding tariffs should be beneficial to both sides, particularly given our shared commitment to high regulatory standards.

Democratic Governor Ralph Northam - and his wife Pamela - tested positive The governor of the US state of Virginia has tested positive for coronavirus. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam and his wife Pamela were both tested on Thursday, after a member of staff at their residence was found to have Covid-19, a statement released on the governor's website said. The governor is currently asymptomatic, while the first lady has mild symptoms. Both will isolate for 10 days, the statement added.

"Royal accounts could suffer a potential Â£35m shortfall due to coronavirus. The impact of lockdown on visitor numbers to venues such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will lead to an estimated Â£15m loss of income over the next three years, the Keeper of the Privy Purse said. And a 10-year Â£369m budget to refurbish Buckingham Palace is expected to be Â£20m short, Sir Michael Stevens added. He said the royal household had ""no intention"" of asking for extra funding. Sir Michael said the royal household would try to manage the ""financial challenges"" of the pandemic ""through our own efforts and efficiencies"".

"Shoppers will feel the impact of a no-deal Brexit at supermarket tills, the British Retail Consortium has warned. The BRC said tariffs would add Â£3.1bn a year to the cost of importing food and drink unless the UK and EU can strike a free trade agreement. ""If there is no deal before Christmas, the increase in tariffs will leave retailers with nowhere to go other than to raise the price of food,"" it said. The government said it was ""working hard"" to reach a deal. Andrew Opie, director of food at the BRC, said coronavirus was ""already making life hard for consumers"", particularly those on lower incomes. ""A no-deal Brexit will have a massive impact on their ability to afford essential goods,"" he added. The EU is the UK's largest trading partner and the source of 80% of its imported food, the BRC said. But if the UK is unable to reach a deal with the bloc, the average tariff on food it imports would be over 20%, the trade body warned. Those tariffs include a 48% levy on beef mince, 16% on cucumbers and 57% on cheddar cheese. Under a new tariff schedule, set to come into effect in January, 85% of food imports from the EU will be subject to a tariff of more than 5%, the BRC said. The longstanding post-Brexit promise is of free trade deals that will decrease taxes on imports - called tariffs - and lower prices for consumers. But should no trade deal be reached with the EU, from January, one of the most noticeable impacts will be the new UK Global Tariff applying to imports of food and drink from the EU. Understandably, supermarkets have worked out the cost of applying these new tariffs in this British Retail Consortium exercise on their own supply chain data - the total is Â£3.1bn next year, versus zero this year. That is worth about Â£112 per household. As an illustration, if the entire cost of the tariff were passed on to consumers a Â£3 pack of Irish beef mince could cost Â£4.08 and Spanish cucumbers could cost 47p instead of 43p. In practice, some - but not all - these cost increases would be passed on, and some lower tariffs on imports from other places could offset those rises. But concerns about tariffs on EU food and drink imports are one of the issues troubling retailers. The BRC also said increases in ""physical checks, paperwork, and other non-tariff barriers"" will further push up the cost for retailers. ""With coronavirus affecting the livelihoods of millions of people in the UK, many households can ill afford higher prices for their weekly food shop,"" it said. It claimed that the UK grocery sector is ""one of the most competitive in the world"", operating on tight margins. As a result, it said, any additional costs would be passed on to customers. ""UK consumers have benefitted from great value, quality, and choice of food thanks to our ability to trade tariff free with the EU,"" Mr Opie said. ""There is now the risk of a Â£3bn tax bill for the food we cannot source here in the UK."" A government spokeswoman said: ""Negotiations are ongoing and discussions will be continuing at the next formal round in Brussels next week."" ""The UK is a significant importer of food and other goods, and avoiding tariffs should be beneficial to both sides, particularly given our shared commitment to high regulatory standards.

"Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu has been a close adviser to Pope Francis High-ranking Vatican official Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu has unexpectedly resigned but has revealed he was told to do so by Pope Francis. He said he was suspected of giving Church money to his brothers, and denied any wrongdoing. Cardinal Becciu was a close aide to the Pope and previously had a key job in the Vatican's Secretariat of State. He became involved in a controversial deal to invest in a luxury London building with Church funds. That investment has since been the subject of a financial investigation. Resignations at this level of the Vatican are extremely rare and the Holy See said little in its communique released late on Thursday. ""The Holy Father accepted the resignation from the office of Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and from the rights connected to the Cardinalate, presented by His Eminence Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu,"" a statement said. But the cardinal, 72, told Italian website Domani he was being forced out because he was suspected of giving Church money to his brothers. ""I didn't steal even one euro. I am not under investigation but if they send me to trial, I will defend myself,"" he was quoted as saying. Speaking later at a news conference, the cardinal said his removal had come ""like a bolt out of the blue"". He said the Pope ""was suffering"" when he delivered the news. ""It's all surreal. Up until yesterday... I felt I was a friend of the Pope, the faithful executor of the Pope. ""Then the Pope told me that he no longer had faith in me because he got a report from magistrates that I committed an act of misappropriation."" Cardinal Becciu insisted there had been ""a misunderstanding"", adding: ""I am ready to explain everything to the Pope. I have not done anything wrong."" ""I said to the Pope: why are you doing this to me, in front of the whole world?"" The anguished words of one of the Church's most senior cardinals - now fired and stripped of his right to choose the next Pope. Giovanni Angelo Becciu had served as Deputy Secretary of State - a role with unfettered access to Pope Francis - and was latterly head of the department that chooses future saints. But on Thursday evening, he was summoned for a reportedly tense meeting with his boss. Cardinal Becciu had managed a controversial â¬200m (Â£180m) purchase of a London property with Church funds, including alms money. Other reports allege he propped up a failing Roman hospital which employed his niece. The cardinal has insisted he did not steal one euro and has vowed to defend himself ""The Holy Father explained that I had given favours to my brothers and their businesses with Church moneyâ¦ but I am certain there are no crimes"", he told new Italian newspaper Domani. But his denial was not enough. It's been dubbed an ""earthquake at the Vatican"". The choreography of his dismissal may seem cloak-and-dagger - but it is a reminder yet again that the scandal and corruption that beset governments across the world also reach the highest echelons of the Holy See. Giovanni Angelo Becciu, who is Italian, spent the early years of his career in the Vatican's diplomatic service. Then, from 2011 to 2018, he had the powerful role of Substitute for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State, when he met the Pope on a daily basis. Giovanni Angelo Becciu became a cardinal in June 2018 It was Pope Francis who made him cardinal in 2018, when he took up a new role of running the department that looks after sainthoods and beatifications. ""It's a blow for me, my family, the people of my country. I've accepted out of a spirit of obedience and love of the Church and the Pope,"" Italian media quoted the cardinal as saying on Friday morning. It was during the cardinal's time as Substitute for General Affairs that he was linked to a luxury property deal in a wealthy area of London. The $200m (Â£155m) purchase of the apartment block in Sloane Avenue was bought out of Church money through offshore funds and companies. Five members of staff were suspended last year following a raid of the offices of the Secretariat last year. Vatican police officers seized documents and computers. Then, in June, Italian businessman Gianluigi Torzi was arrested by Vatican police on suspicion of extortion and embezzlement. Pope denounces media over leaks Vatican anger over 'gay link' to quakes Earlier this year, Cardinal Becciu defended the purchase. ""An investment was made on a building. It was good and opportune occasion, which many people envy us for today,""he said in February,external. He also denied that money collected for the poor, called Peter's Pence, had been used in the deal. The cardinal's sudden departure may not just be linked to the London deal. In his interview on Friday, the cardinal said the Pope confronted him over Church money he had given to co-operatives and businesses run by his brothers. A co-operative in Sardinia, run by his brother Tonino Becciu, provided help to migrants and the cardinal said all the money had been accounted for. Other funding was used to renovate the Holy See's building in Cuba. Italian reports also suggest the Pope was unhappy with the use of Peter's Pence funds for other investments. Last year, Italian weekly L'Espresso published a report from the Vatican's anti-corruption authority alleging more widespread speculative investments amounting to $725m. Cardinal Becciu will keep his title despite his resignation from the congregation. However, he will not be able to vote for the next Pope. The last cardinal to give up his right to vote for a new Pope was Scottish Cardinal Keith O'Brien who resigned in 2013 amid a sex scandal. He died five years later.

"The government funded the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme in August The UK government borrowed Â£35.9bn in August as tackling the economic fallout of pandemic took its toll on the public finances, official figures show. The figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£30.5bn more than it borrowed in August last year. The increase meant that the borrowing figure hit its highest amount for August since records began in 1993. Borrowing between April and August totalled Â£173.7bn - also a record. August's monthly borrowing figure was, however, less than economists had predicted at Â£38bn, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also revised down,externalits estimate for UK borrowing in July, by more than Â£11bn, to Â£15.4bn, demonstrating how difficult tracking the economy during the pandemic can be. It also said that total UK debt passed Â£2 trillion for the first time in history in August, rather than in July as previously thought. In August, debt hit Â£2.024tn, Â£249.5bn more than the same time in 2019. That figure now exceeds the size of the UK economy, the highest level of debt seen since the 1960s. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that rising borrowing figures were down to the government absorbing ""much of the cost of the Covid-19 crisis"". The government has been forced to cover a wide range coronavirus-related costs - from the furlough scheme and bailouts for rail firms to business rates holidays and VAT cuts for hospitality and tourism. It has also set aside Â£500m to cover the cost of the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme, where diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August. Where do governments borrow money? Uncertainty as industries miss out on job support Rishi Sunak's post-furlough plan: At-a-glance But ""the big picture is that fiscal support will fade over the autumn causing many more job losses to be realised"", Mr Wishart added. The latest figures from the ONS show that while billions have been pumped into propping up the economy, tax receipts have dropped sharply. The amount collected by central government in taxes dropped to Â£37.3bn in August, which is Â£7.5bn less than a year before. The amount of VAT, corporation tax and income tax collected fell ""considerably"", the ONS said. It was another month of heavy government borrowing - though many economists thought it would be even more. As always, the outlook will depend on specific spending and tax measures and the strength of the economy. The leading headline from the chancellor's announcement yesterday was the coming replacement of the furlough scheme with the less generous Job Support Scheme. That will curb spending compared with extending the furlough scheme, though it's almost certain to mean substantial job losses. Another of his measures - the extension of the VAT cut for hospitality and tourism - will reduce tax revenue. The resurgence in Covid cases and the renewed restrictions intended to contain the pandemic are likely to cast a shadow over the economic recovery. Some economists expect the economy to stagnate for the rest of the year.  To the extent that does happen, it will undermine tax revenue. The new figures came the day after Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a series of extensions to existing coronavirus programmes, including a replacement for the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of October. Under the new wage ""top-up"" scheme, if bosses bring back workers part-time, the government will help top up their wages to at least three-quarters of their full-time pay. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Bank, said that the government's borrowing figures may ""partly correct themselves"" next year as a number of the chancellor's measures expire. Mr Shaw pointed out though that in order to bring down debt, the chancellor ""will have difficult decisions to make on fiscal policy"". But ""with the focus currently on trying to maintain the recovery, this is not the time,"" he added. Looking ahead, the ONS said that the chancellor was likely to borrow about Â£370bn in the 2020 financial year.

"Mr Kim said the incident should never have happened North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has issued a rare personal apology for the killing of a South Korean official, Seoul says. Mr Kim reportedly told South Korean leader Moon Jae-in that the ""disgraceful affair"" should not have happened. South Korea has said the 47-year-old man was found by troops floating in the North's waters. He was then shot dead and his body was set alight, according to Seoul. It is not known what the man was doing there. The South Korean government has said he may have been trying to defect to the North but his family has denied this. The killing - the first of a South Korean citizen by North Korean forces for a decade - has caused outrage in the South. The border between the Koreas is tightly policed, and the North is thought to have a ""shoot-to-kill"" policy in place to prevent coronavirus from entering the country. Kim Yo-jong: North Korea's heir apparent? Kim Jong-un and the brutal North Korea rumour mill The apology came in the form of a letter sent to President Moon which acknowledged that the incident should not have happened, according to South Korea's presidential office, also known as the Blue House. The South Korean island of Yeonpyeong sits near the border with the North Mr Kim called it a ""disgraceful affair"" and said he felt ""very sorry"" for ""disappointing"" Mr Moon and the South Korean people, the Blue House said. It is the North's first official comment on the incident. The North also gave the South the results of its investigation - it said more than 10 shots were fired at the man, who had entered North Korean waters and then failed to reveal his identity and tried to flee, South Korea's director of national security Suh Hoon said. However the North insisted that it had not burned the man's body but rather the ""floating material"" that was carrying him. ""The troops could not locate the unidentified trespasser during a search after firing the shots, and burned the device under national emergency disease prevention measures,"" Mr Suh told a briefing, referring to the North Korean account. The presidential office in Seoul has also decided to release recent letters between the two leaders. In them Kim Jong-un said he understood ""more than anyone the kind of pressure and hardship"" required to overcome the coronavirus pandemic and damage from recent typhoons. It was the ""heartfelt truth"" that he shared the ""pain and suffering of the Southern people"", he said. This incident could have been a disaster for any hopes of rekindling talks between the South's President Moon and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. As it is many South Koreans will not forgive or forget easily. They are shocked and outraged at what appears to have been the brutal killing of an unarmed civilian in North Korean waters. It is yet another reminder of North Korea's often merciless regime. It's also worth noting that the North's account of the killing does not match the details given by officials in the South. However, this rare personal apology from Kim Jong-un may go some way to assuage Southern anger. If there had been no apology, Mr Kim's warm letter to Mr Moon would have been wasted. By at least attempting to smooth things over, Mr Kim may be signalling his willingness to keep talking. The father-of-two, who worked for the fisheries department, was on his patrol boat about 10km (6 miles) from the border with the North, near the island of Yeonpyeong, when he disappeared on Monday, the South Korean defence ministry said. He had left his shoes behind on the boat. South Korean media said he had recently divorced and had financial problems. A North Korean patrol boat found the man, who was wearing a life jacket, at sea at around 15:30 local time on Tuesday. They put gas masks on and questioned him from a distance before ""orders from [a] superior authority"" came in that the man be killed, South Korea said. He was shot dead in the water. South Korea says North Korean troops then burned the corpse at sea. President Moon Jae-in called the killing a ""shocking"" incident that could not be tolerated. He urged the North to take ""responsible"" measures over the attack. The country's National Security Council said the North could ""not justify shooting and burning the corpse of our unarmed citizen who showed no sign of resistance"". Officials said they had done a ""thorough analysis of diverse intelligence"", but it was not clear how exactly they had gathered the information. The military hotline between North and South was cut in June, and the inter-Korean liaison office, which was built to help both sides communicate,was destroyed by North Korea. But South Korean military is known to intercept the North's radio communications, AFP news agency reports. Mr Kim's apology comes at a time when relations between the North and South are at a low point and there is a stand-off between Pyongyang and Washington over the North's nuclear programme. South Korea has in the past demanded apologies from the North but these have rarely been forthcoming. The Northhas refused to apologise for the sinking of a South Korean warshipin 2010, in which 46 sailors died, and denies responsibility. It also refused to apologise for shelling a South Korean island the same year, killing two soldiers and two construction workers. The tiny South Korean island watching the horizon Why did North Korea destroy liaison office? Why was Korea divided? North Korea may be taking extra-tough measures to prevent the coronavirus from entering the country because it is thought to be preparing for a huge military parade on 10 October to mark the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party. Pyongyang closed its border with China in January to try to prevent the spread Covid-19. In July, North Korean state media said the country had raised its state of emergency to the maximum level. Last month, the commander of the US military's forces in South Korea, Robert Abrams, said the North had introduced a new ""buffer zone"" of one to two kilometres on the Chinese border, and that the country had special operation forces in place with orders to ""shoot-to-kill"" anyone coming across the border. In the past, North Korea has also returned people who have wandered into their territory. In 2017, state news agency KCNA said officials would repatriate a South Korean fishing boat which ""illegally"" crossed the border, in what was seen as a rare humanitarian move.

The plant's closure was not wholly unexpected by industry watchers, but the loss of so many highly-skilled jobs is a particular blow for the area. The latest figures from the Ford taskforce said most workers have undertaken retraining while 236 opted to retire or take severance and 362 have found new employment or started a business. Until Friday's closure, 999 staff had continued to work at the plant. A history of Ford in Bridgend End of Ford and Bridgend marriage 'hard to take' As well as the staff staying on for decommissioning, more than 50 will continue to work for Ford and be redeployed to other sites. The company has established a Â£1m community legacy fund, to which employee-nominated charities and community organisations can apply. It has also established a Â£2m research and development fund to be targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises and academic projects, to be administered by Welsh Government. Economy Minister Ken Skates said the government would do all it could to stimulate new investment in the area, with a particular focus on next generation technology. Since it opened in 1980, Ford has received Â£116m in taxpayer funding for the Bridgend site, aimed at supporting and creating jobs, and it has paid back Â£15.5m in Welsh Government grants since the closure was announced. In the past 10 years, it is estimated the plant has brought Â£3bn to the local economy. ""It's a bitter pill to swallow,"" says worker Jason Evans For workers, the challenge is not just finding employment, but also getting a job that pays as well. A father of two teenagers, Jason Evans, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, is facing ""deja vu"" as the factory closes its doors. He has worked on the production line there since he was made redundant from Bosch in Miskin in 2010, but he thinks the current Covid-19 crisis will make finding a new job more difficult. ""It's quite a long period to digest the news but this week the reality has hit,"" Mr Evans said. ""It's real and a bitter pill to swallow. ""Some who have been there 35 to 40 years will go off and hopefully enjoy their retirement but for the likes of me, who need to find employment, it's a difficult time. ""To stay in the industry, I'm never going to match the terms and conditions. It's a journey into the unknown."" Wales Ineos 4x4 vehicle plant 'suspended' in Bridgend Aston Martin launches first car made in St Athan factory Peter Hughes, the secretary for Unite Wales, said it was ""desperately sad"" to see the plant close. ""Ford Bridgend was able to hold its own against other Ford sites across the world throughout those four decades for one reason only - its world class workforce,"" he said. ""Nothing has changed in this respect in recent years. Every one of the workers who are finishing their time with Ford today retain their status as a world class manufacturing worker. What did and has changed is Ford's commitment to Wales and the UK. ""We will continue to support our members as they seek employment in new jobs and with new employers. They will always be part of the Unite family."" Bridgend College's Matt Williams said Ford workers were looking at a ""mixed bag"" of training options Matt Williams, the executive director for work-based learning at Bridgend College, has been working with Ford over the past year to offer retraining to employees. He said more than 150 courses had been booked by Ford employees for this academic year. He said there was a ""real mixed bag"" of options people were looking at, including construction and ""trade-type courses"", plus training in engineering, electrical, mechanical and programming. ""But equally [they're looking at] some sectors that are quite far removed really from the manufacturing sector, like health and social care for example or... things like tree-felling or chainsaw courses."" Ford employees have been retraining for a ""mixed bag"" of sectors, including construction The college is also building a newScience, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics Academy,external, aimed at boosting the area's skills in these subjects, which are seen as important for high-value jobs. While there issome optimism in the automotive sectorabout future developments, attracting future employers offering well-paid work is a collective challenge for the whole area. Since opening in 1980, the Bridgend plant has produced more than 22 million engines that have been shipped around the world. In a message to staff on the final day, plant manager Wallace Yearwood thanked workers past and present for the site's ""success and reputation"" and praised the ""Bridgend spirit"" during the past year. ""While we have faced challenges during the last 15 months, we met these challenges collectively and with a desire to find solutions and to do the right thing,"" he said. ""Covid-19 impacted all of us, affecting our families, the community and our plant operation. Our Bridgend spirit meant we could implement the company's protocols and restart production from 18 May. ""We can be proud of all the work we have done with our local communities over the years; from the numerous Global Month of Caring projects, to the many charities we have supported. ""Our last community action will result in us distributing Â£1m to local causes, with every penny donated going to a worthy project identified by Bridgend employees."" How did it come to this? That a Welsh Government ""anchor company"" - which had massive investment from the taxpayer over four decades - came to leave? The beginning of the end was in 2008 and Ford's ""one Ford plan"". As early as the '80's Ford had a policy of plants across the world making similar parts or cars. For Ford it could change production from one site to another. For the plants, it put them in direct competition with each other. In the early '90's, the management and unions at Bridgend worked closely together to fight off competition from Ford in Germany to win the massive investment to make Zetec engines. Many hundreds of thousands of those engines were made in Bridgend between 1992 and 2004. But the real challenge came in 2002 when Ford stopped assembling cars in the UK. After that, engines made in Bridgend that used many components from mainland Europe had to then travel to plants in Spain and Germany to be put into cars. That made it harder to compete with other Ford plants. The uncertainty of Brexit cannot have helped. Winning the investment in 2015 to make the Dragon engine was good news for jobs at Bridgend but even then the number of engines it was planned to produce was only one third of what the factory had been making and alarm bells about the plant's long-term future started ringing then. Then, a year later the investment and number of engines to be produced was halved to 125,000. In such a competitive world, how would the factory justify so many employees? Seasoned observers believed then that the company was planning to walk away and close the plant. It took more than four years to attract Ford to Bridgend originally and it appears its departure has been long-planned too.

"Murano Street Student Village is the largest residence at University of Glasgow A major outbreak of Covid-19 at Glasgow University has led to 172 students testing positive. The university said the actual number of infected students was ""likely to be higher"", and added that 600 people were self-isolating. Details emerged as Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he was ""very concerned"" about outbreaks at  several universities. They include Abertay in Dundee and the University of Aberdeen. The clusters in Glasgow are centred on two halls of residence in the city. The university said they involved the Murano Street and Cairncross residences, and were largely due to social activity at the start of Freshers Week, from 12-14 September. In a statement it said: ""The total number of reported cases since the start of term is 124 but the actual number is likely to be higher. ""Over 600 students are isolating across all residences.  We are not aware of any students who have had to receive hospital treatment."" The Glasgow outbreak is one of a number linked to student residences across Scotland The statement added that those students affected had access to food and other supplies. Advice on medical issues including mental health and wellbeing was also being made available. The Murano Street Student Village is the largest residence at University of Glasgow, with more than 1,100 student bedrooms. In total, about 2,500 spaces are available in seven residences for students at the city's universities. The university said any students found to be breaking the rules faced disciplinary action including termination of their accommodation contracts and suspension from the university. A mobile testing centre will be set up at Murano and student unions will be closed this weekend. The Glasgow outbreak is one of a number linked to student residences across Scotland. All 500 residents atParker House in Dundee have been asked to self-isolateuntil contact tracing is complete after three confirmed coronavirus cases at Abertay University. In Aberdeen, 72 residents at Hillhead student village are self-isolating after students tested positive. Aberdeen University has urged anyone who attended parties or other gatherings since Friday to come forward to aid contact tracing efforts, and promised that if they do so they will not be punished for breaching guidance. This video can not be played How should students be self-isolating? ""Stay in, stay apart, sleep alone, keep cleaning"" During Wednesday's daily coronavirus briefing, Prof Leitch described the Glasgow University outbreak as ""significant"" and issued a warning to students about attending house parties. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Thursday, he said: ""I am concerned, very concerned, about higher and further education, I always have been. ""Predictably, we have cases. Every country in the world that has brought universities back has got cases. ""We need to be very, very careful. Even though most of those cases will not get serious illness, some of them will and some of them will potentially spread it to the community."" Prof Leitch initially said students would be allowed to return to their family homes ""but they should think hard about that"". ""If you are not self-isolating and have no symptoms, you can go home for the holidays etc,"" he said. ""But we would ask you to think carefully about that. We don't want too much spread - particularly from high areas to low areas. ""So maybe not as often as you normally would, but it's not illegal."" However, he later tweeted to ""clarify"" that students and their families must adhere to the nationwide ban on household visits. Prof Leitch said: ""To clarify, they are a separate household. There are exceptions, eg caring responsibilities, but the law is clear: they can't meet indoors with another household - even mum and dad. Sorry."" UK health secretaryMatt Hancock has refused to rule out banning students from returning homeat Christmas. One student at Cairncross House told BBC Scotland she was asked to quarantine on Sunday - a week after arriving in the city. Under Scottish government guidelines, students in residences are assigned to ""households"" based on shared facilities such as kitchens. She said two people in her household of eight had tested positive for coronavirus. They are mainly reporting a loss of taste or smell, and a slight fever, she said. It appears to have spread through the residence in Freshers' Week, when students mixed with people outside their households. One of the clusters involves the Cairncross House accommodation ""I don't think people were being too wildly unsensible,"" the student said. ""People were mixing outside of their households because I mean it was Freshers Week, people weren't going to stay in their own kitchens and not do anything. ""But I don't think people were being too crazy. There haven't been massive parties."" She said they have been advised to wear masks when they leave their rooms to use shared kitchens, and to order supermarket deliveries. But she was able to continue her studies as all her classes are online. ""It's a bit strange,"" she said. ""It does get a bit hard to concentrate when you're sitting in your room from 9-5 and you can't go out for a walk to clear your head. ""At the same time, it's nice to have the work to occupy my time. But it's only day three, so it might get harder."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland? LOCKDOWN:Six months that changed our lives CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""It's not for me to... make pronouncements on what job is viable or not"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said it is ""impossible"" to predict how many jobs the government's new wage subsidy scheme will save. The scheme, set to replace furlough, will see the government top up the pay of people unable to work full time. It aims to stop mass job cuts after the government introduced new measures to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases. Mr Sunak said he hoped the plan would ""benefit large numbers"", but he could not say what job is ""viable or not"". Kuenssberg: No hiding now - for Sunak or businesses What is replacing furlough? Rishi Sunak's post-furlough plan: At-a-glance VAT cut to be extended for hospitality sector Will the chancellor's plan to save jobs work? Under the Job Support Scheme, if bosses bring back workers part time, the government will help top up their wages with employers to at least three-quarters of their full-time pay. It will begin on 1 November and last for six months. Under the scheme, the government will subsidise the pay of employees who are working fewer than their normal hours due to lower demand. Employers will pay for the hours actually worked. And then the government and the employer will between them cover two-thirds of the lost wages. But only staff who can work at least a third of their normal hours will be eligible for the scheme. The payment will be based on an employee's normal salary, with the government contribution capped at Â£697.92 per month. Mr Sunak described the scheme as a ""radical new policy"", designed ""to help protect as many jobs as possible [and] keep people in part-time work rather than laying them off"". However, he said it would only support ""viable jobs"" - as opposed to jobs that exist because the government is continuing to subsidise the wages. ""It's not for me to sit here and make pronouncements upon exactly what job is viable or not but what we do need to do is evolve our support now that we're through the acute phase of the crisis,"" Mr Sunak said at a press conference after the scheme was unveiled. ""We obviously can't sustain the same level of things that we were doing at the beginning of this crisis."" The BBC understands that the Treasury is estimating that anywhere between two and five million people could be covered by the new Jobs Support Scheme. However, the chancellor told a press conference that he would be ""lying"" if he tried to give precise numbers but he said that some forecasts for unemployment ""don't make for good reading"". Nearly three million workers - or 12% of the UK's workforce - are currently on partial or full furlough leave, according to official figures. The current furlough scheme ends on 31 October. The government's contribution to workers' pay will fall sharply compared with the furlough scheme. Under furlough, it initially paid 80% of a monthly wage up to Â£2,500 - under the new scheme this will drop to 22%. ""The primary goal of our economic policy remains unchanged - to support people's jobs - but the way we achieve that must evolve,"" Mr Sunak said. ""I cannot save every business, I cannot save every job."" The scheme will cost the government an estimated Â£300m a month. Companies who use it can also still claim the Job Retention Bonus, where the government pays Â£1,000 for every furloughed employee who comes back to work until at least the end of January. Mr Sunak said a similar scheme for the self-employed would be available. All small and medium-sized businesses will be eligible for the scheme but larger business will only qualify if their turnover has fallen during the crisis. It will run for six months starting in November and be open to employers across the UK even if they have not previously used the furlough scheme. Employees must be in ''viable jobs"" to benefit from the scheme. Those in industries currently closed - such as nightclubs - may lose out as there isn't any work. Gavin McQueen, the manager of Pryzm in Leeds, sits in the club, which has not reopened since the UK went into lockdown in March Business lobby group the CBI welcomed the government's plan. ""It is right to target help on jobs with a future, but can only be part-time while demand remains flat. This is how skills and jobs can be preserved to enable a fast recovery,"" said CBI director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. However, Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said that the new jobs scheme on its own ""will not encourage firms to cut hours rather than jobs because the one-third employer contribution means it is much cheaper for firms to employ one person full-time than two people part-time"". He warned that the Â£1,000 Job Retention Bonus firms would receive for retaining workers at the end of January, combined with the new scheme could create a new ""cliff-edge"" for job cuts. ""We've now got a big incentive for firms to retain workers part-time until you qualify for the bonus."" Labour, meanwhile, said it would support any measures to safeguard jobs but accused the government of acting too late. Tracey Sheppard is a cleaner at a leisure centre in Essex who has been on furlough since the end of March. She said she hoped the new Jobs Support Scheme will help her, but there are no guarantees. ""They're a very big company that I work for â¦ but I don't know whether they'd be able to afford to keep me onâ¦ I just don't know,"" she told the BBC's World At One. She said she feels ""frightened"" because her family only recently moved to the area and this is the only job she can fit in around childcare. ""I've just heard nothing [from my employer]. The last time I heard from them was the beginning of lockdown."" A cut in VAT for hospitality and tourism companies will also be extended until March. The cut from 20% to 5% VAT - which came into force on 15 July - had been due to expire on 12 January next year. However, the Food and Drink Federation said this and the new jobs plan did ""not go far enough"" in helping the industry which has been hit by the government's new restrictions to stop coronavirus cases from rising. Mr Sunak also announced that businesses that have borrowed money through the government's loan scheme would be given more time to repay the money. The chancellor said that small businesses who took out ""Bounce Back"" loans can use a new ""Pay as You Grow"" flexible repayment system. It means borrowings can be repaid over 10 years instead of the original six-year term. The longer repayment time also applied to small and medium-sized firms who borrowed under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme. Businesses will also have more time to apply for these loans, as well as the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the Future Fund. Application dates for the various schemes had been due to end in October and November. The new jobs support scheme is a fraction of what we have seen over the past few months, and is concentrated on those deemed to be in ""viable"" jobs. It cannot prevent a sharp rise in unemployment in the coming months in ""non-viable"" jobs. Indeed, the economic impact of this package of several billion pounds is likely to be far outweighed, even by this week's announcement that the UK faces a six-month ""new normal"" of social restrictions. The Treasury has extended the bridge of support it put in place in March to cover the next six months. But the new scheme requires everybody to chip in. That will be too much for many employers. We are about to find out just how many. Read more here Will this scheme benefit you? Do you have any questions about the scheme? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"The chancellor's statement is a radical attempt to provide a shot in the arm to the jobs market - at a very difficult time. But the new jobs support scheme is a fraction of what we have seen over the past few months, and is concentrated on those deemed to be in ""viable"" jobs. It cannot prevent a sharp rise in unemployment in the coming months in ""non-viable"" jobs. Indeed, the economic impact of this package of several billion pounds is likely to be far outweighed, even by this week's announcement that the UK faces a six-month ""new normal"" of social restrictions. The sight of Chancellor Rishi Sunak flanked by the Trade Unions Congress and the Confederation of British Industry bosses at Number 11 was meant to show the country that a non-ideological innovation to protect livelihoods was on the way. It is an echo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel locking the heads of the equivalent organisations in a hotel for two days in order to come up with the ""short-time work"" policy, upon which the new jobs support scheme is based. Rishi Sunak unveils emergency jobs scheme Rishi Sunak's post-furlough plan: At-a-glance VAT cut to be extended for hospitality sector It will be possible to claim the coronavirus job retention bonus for reemploying furloughed workers, too. It has been tailored for the UK's more flexible jobs market. The chancellor has kept a careful eye on schemes from all around the world. But the size of the scheme also reflects the phenomenal amount of borrowing that the government has done, and will continue to have to do, in terms of lost tax revenue as the recovery is subdued by ongoing restrictions. Funding conditions for government remain benign. But the Treasury is keeping an eye on how sensitive the public finances are now to even a small increase in market interest rates.
