"Mrs Davison was fatally injured after a large branch smashed into the car windscreen A man has recalled how his wife pleaded with him to save her life when she was impaled on a tree branch that had smashed through their car windscreen. Elaine Davison, 55, from Pontefract, was fatally injured in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, in November 2010. Edward Davison told an inquest the branch, which was about 4m (13ft) long, fell into the road in front of them during heavy gales. He said his wife told him: ""Don't let me die, will you?"" ""I said 'no, I won't'. That's one of the hardest things. ""It's the first time I've ever had to lie to her and I can't take it back,"" he said. More news from across Yorkshire Mrs Davison was injured as the tree hit their Vauxhall Zafira on the A642 Aberford Road on 11 November. A statement by Mr Davison was read out in court by Coroner David Hinchcliff which described the difficult driving conditions as the couple of 30 years returned from visiting their daughter in hospital. It recounted how Mrs Davison ""appeared nervous"" before there was a ""banging and crashing sound"" as the branch fell. Mr Davison said the windscreen collapsed inwards and he could see something ""wood-like"" pressing against his wife's stomach. He went into a ""blind panic"" as his wife struggled for breath and she held onto the branch and implored him to ""get it off"". Wakefield Coroner's Court heard he ""frantically"" broke off small branches to get to his wife before flagging down a passing ambulance. Attempts were made to resuscitate Mrs Davison as she was taken to hospital, where she was pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination found she died from injuries consistent with her abdominal wall being pierced. The inquest was adjourned until Tuesday.

"Theresa May has apologised to Tory MPs for the party's election performance, telling them ""I got us into this mess I'll get us out of it."" Addressing a meeting of backbenchers, the PM reportedly said she would serve as ""long as you want me to do"". One senior backbencher told the BBC that she had appeared ""contrite and genuine but not on her knees"". It comes amid confusion over whether the Queen's Speech will be delayed as talks continue to form a government. A senior minister has said he was ""optimistic"" that the Conservatives and Democratic Unionists will reach an agreement in the coming days to allow a proposed Tory minority government get its plans for the year ahead through the Commons, possibly as early as next Monday. But First Secretary of State Damian Green said he could not confirm the Queen's Speech will proceed as planned on 19 June. Labour said the government was ""in chaos"" and continued to be ""in denial"" about the message voters had sent about their opposition to an ""extreme Brexit"". PM survives first bout of battle for control Election fallout: May addresses MPs May stays in No 10: What you need to know Theresa May: The prisoner of No 10 Mrs May addressed a packed meeting of the 1922 Committee for 90 minutes after her failure to win the election outright prompted days of speculation about her future. According to reports of the meeting, she accepted personal responsibility for calling the snap election and for the result, which saw her party lose its overall majority and have to rely on the support of others. Mrs May, who earlier chaired a two-hour cabinet meeting, reportedly told the committee, a group of backbench MPs, that the DUP would not have a ""veto"" on the government's agenda, and there would be no watering down of equalities laws over which the two parties disagree. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM's ""colleagues were demanding contrition and sounds like they got it"". While calls for Mrs May to go had ""faded"", she said her authority was ""extremely fractured"" and had acknowledged she was not ""calling the shots"" any more. Reacting to the meeting, Tory MP Julian Knight said that the prime minister had been ""humble and steadfast and certain that we have to get on with the job of government and negotiating Brexit"". His colleague Sarah Wollaston tweeted: ""Conservative MPs all said they were standing with TM. As far as I'm concerned that hasn't changed."" One Conservative ex-minister told the BBC that Theresa May ""did brilliantly"", suggesting that ""the ""Maybot"" disappeared and we got a real leader back"". In the wake of Friday's setback, Conservative figures have said the party needs to learn the lessons of its failure to win an overall majority and change direction in some key areas. Gavin Barwell, who lost his seat but has since been appointed Mrs May's chief of staff, said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had ""tapped into"" public anger over Brexit and austerity, saying some voters were dismayed about the prospect of years of future public sector pay freezes. May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Immigration - the Brexit dividing line Did Gove really try to stop teaching climate change? He told the BBC's Panorama his party had to listen to Remain voters about their concerns. Meanwhile his colleague George Freeman said it was time for the government to ""drop a hard Brexit"" message and return to a ""message of hope"" he said Mrs May articulated when she first became prime minister. Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said the priority of Brexit talks should be the economy and free trade and that other parties should be involved in negotiations. After attending Monday's meeting of senior ministers and Tory officials, she said: ""We do have to make sure that we invite other people in now. This isn't just going to be a Tory Brexit, this is going to have to involve the whole country."" Passing the Queen's Speech - which is written by ministers and presents an outline of its planned legislation for the next Parliamentary session - will be the first major test of Theresa May's proposed minority government. If the government was defeated, it would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence. Tory-DUP deal 'a tremendous opportunity' Brexit offer 'could change' - Davidson Mr Green cited the ongoing negotiations with the DUP when he was asked if next Monday's speech had been delayed. ""I can't confirm anything yet until we know the final details of the agreement,"" he said. ""We know those talks are going well and also we know that, at this very important time, we want to produce a substantial Queen's Speech."" One of the reasons for the delay is also believed to be because the speech has to be written on goat's skin parchment, which takes a few days to dry - and the Tory negotiations with the DUP mean it cannot be ready in time. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was an ""ambiguity"" about both what would go in it - with several manifesto pledges expected to be watered down or dropped - but also the need for the Tories to ""nail down"" DUP support. The first formal meeting of UK and EU officials since the election has concluded without a date being officially set for the start of Brexit talks. The negotiations were due to start on 19 June but Brexit Secretary David Davis has indicated this timetable could slip by a few days amid events in Westminster. The prime minister is continuing to reshuffle her government at middle-ranking level after Sunday saw only modest changes in the cabinet. Nick Hurd has become policing minister while Dominic Raab joins the Ministry for Justice and Mel Stride becomes financial secretary to the Treasury. Mike Penning, Robert Halfon, Oliver Heald and David Jones have all left the government.

"This video can not be played Police commissioner Alison Hernandez spoke to BBC Radio Cornwall A police commissioner who said she would consider letting gun owners act during a terror attack has found herself at odds with her own force. During a radio phone-in, Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Alison Hernandez said she would ""really be interested"" in the idea. The force said armed civilians would risk being shot by officers. Thames Valley's PCC later said firing on terrorists would be ""reasonable"" if people were ""certain of the threat"". Speaking on a separate radio phone-in,  Anthony Stansfield said: ""I mean you wouldn't sit back and just watch somebody killing people if you could put a stop to it."" Deputy Chief Constable Paul Netherton from Devon and Cornwall Police said it was ""definitely an emphatic 'no'"" that people should be arming themselves against such a threat. The chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales Steve White said the idea was ""a recipe for disaster"" and that ""vigilantism"" had no place in ""the fight against terrorism"". Conservative PCC Ms Hernandez has since said her comments on Monday were ""misinterpreted"". More on the armed civilians row, and other Devon and Cornwall news Her comments were made as she responded to a caller who said she was an ""ex-registered firearms dealer"" and gun-owner living in Bude. She asked: ""If there should ever be a terrorist attack close to the town centre... what happens if people like I and others try to defend themselves using those guns?"" Dyfed-Powys has the highest rate of gun ownership in England and Wales, with a total of 9,126 per 100,000 people. Devon and Cornwall comes 10th overall out of the 43 police force areas with a total of just under 6,000 guns per 100,000 residents. London has the lowest rate of ownership per head of population with 789 guns per 100,000 people. Ms Hernandez replied: ""This could be some of our solution..."" before being interrupted by presenter Laurence Reed, challenging her on whether she was advocating vigilantes. She responded ""I'm just saying... let's officially have a look at that and see what would be the implications of it. ""We work with businesses to keep our communities safe. I'd really be interested in exploring that with the chief constable. ""If your community was coming under attack, people would do all sorts of things to try to save their community without even thinking."" Deputy Chief Constable Paul Netherton said tackling terrorists should be left to the police In a statement released on Tuesday, she said she wanted to meet the chief constable to provide a detailed reply for the phone-in caller. ""To be clear, I am not advocating the use of firearms or other weapons by members of the public in the event of a terrorist incident,"" she said. Ms Hernandez is now facing calls to resign. Chris Batters - a former police officer and a member of the Police and Crime Panel, which scrutinises the PCC - said her comments were ""outrageous"". ""At times I'm doubtful whether she is up to the job. In the light of comments such as this I sincerely think she should do [resign], yes."" Philippa Davey, who stood as Labour's parliamentary candidate for South West Devon, also called for Ms Hernandez to stand down. Shetweeted,externalthat the PCC had made the news ""for all the wrong reasons"". DCC Netherton said: ""A marauding gunman... is probably the most challenging situation the police service is facing and our response to that is by highly professional officers as well as firearms officers and special forces and we would not want the public to be involved in that situation, especially with firearms. ""As was seen in London, we responded immediately and we don't have time to find out if you're an innocent member of the public or a terrorist. ""If you're carrying a gun we will deal with you and deal with you immediately."" He urged anyone caught up in a terrorist attack instead to ""run, hide and inform us"".

"This video can not be played A 20,000 strong bee swarm swamped a car in Hull A swarm of up to 20,000 bees has taken over a car in Hull. Shirley Taylor said the bees took residence in her Nissan car parked outside her front door in Watt Street, on Sunday. Chairman of the Beverley Beekeepers' Association, Chris Coulson, has been trying to lure the swarm out of the vehicle since. He said it was not clear what had attracted the bees to the vehicle and it could take a while to clear them. Mrs Taylor said the bees had arrived on Sunday when she received a message from a neighbour warning her to be careful of her car when she got home. ""I just went indoors and closed all the windows and the neighbours did as well,"" she said. ""It has been a bit of a hair-raising experience. ""There were thousands all over the place and I have been stung and my daughter and granddaughter also got stung. ""It is like Nightmare on Watt Street."" Mrs Taylor said: ""I did ask 'why pick on my car?' but my husband, who is a bit of a joker, said it was because of all the Bee Gees CDs in the car."" Mr Coulson said bees usually swarm when their hives get too large and a colony breaks away to form a new one. However, he said he had never seen such a large swarm descend on a car before. ""These cars have all kind of recesses and the bees seem to have gone into every one they could find. ""We are trying to make them fly. In the box on top of the car we have young bees, some eggs and things like that and the bees in the car will hopefully try to cover those to make sure they don't die."" He said he hoped they could remove the bees and find them a ""more acceptable"" new home.

"Parliamentary democracy is one of the British values that English schools are now required, by statute, to promote during lessons - not debate, not discuss, promote. If some teachers interpret their new role as propagandists for this kingdom's existing system of governance, that would be a shame, because right now there are questions about how well our form of democracy is serving the UK. Far from providing the stability and legitimacy it promises, one could argue that our democratic system has served to expose and deepen social divides. Some would say it has even contrived to leave our country vulnerable at a critical moment in its history. Rather than seeking to close down critical challenge of our form of democracy, do we need a serious and urgent conversation about how we can improve matters? Theresa May: The prisoner of No 10 Election delivers the most diverse Parliament yet 'Safe' seats lost after almost 100 years Yes, turnout was the highest since 1997, and there are clear signs that young people may have participated in larger numbers than in previous elections. These must be encouraging signs for the democratic process. But almost a third of the electorate still didn't bother to exercise their democratic right. And for nine out of 10 of those that did last week, the victorious party in their constituency didn't change. In many seats, that has been the case for decades. Churchill: ""No-one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise"" The overall result may have been unexpected and even ""extraordinary"", but for the vast majority of voters, the local outcome could be construed as suggesting people were quite happy with the status quo. ""No-one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise,"" Winston Churchill told the House of Commons in 1947. ""Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government, except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."" Most people would probably agree with that, and David Cameron was surely right to argue that democracy is a keystone in the curtain wall that defines our nation's character, a feature of British life that must be defended. But a democracy's strength is not measured only in its ability to withstand external attack.  It must be loved and cherished by those within. Talk to people the length and breadth of the United Kingdom, and you will hear the argument that the system ignores ordinary people, that their voice is not being heard by the distant elites. Democracy, they say, is failing them. At a time in world history when power is shifting further away from the ordinary citizen to international institutions and global corporations, this sense of democratic deficit is felt even more keenly. National and local democratic structures need to be more responsive, but in Britain people feel they are increasingly remote. This snap election may have done little to restore people's faith in the democratic process. If people felt their voice was irrelevant before, will they think the system is any better now? Our two main political parties were founded and evolved to deal with the social and economic challenges of the industrial revolution. Conservative and Labour, left and right, capitalism and socialism - these ideological movements were a response to the economic and cultural challenges of power moving from the field to the factory. Guide to what's happening in UK politics right now General election 2017: Full UK results breakdown,external But power is moving again, from the national to the multinational. How citizens think we should respond to that shift is the new divide in our politics. It is less about left v right and more about nationalism v globalism. The 9.5% increase in the vote share for Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party and the 6% increase in Theresa May's Conservative support might be held up as evidence that the British electorate is once again becoming more ""tribal"" in left-right terms. But old-fashioned political tribalism is actually on the wane. If some voters feel frustration with the limitations of our first-past-the-post electoral system, they are striving to get their voice heard as best they can. On the cost of living, on trade, on public services, on climate change, on our future prosperity - we are living in  uncertain times. Smaller parties that face no realistic chance of power, however attractive, get squeezed out at such moments. Protest votes can seem like a luxury. Voters are striving to get their voice heard as best they can You will hear commentators suggesting that the result of this election sends a clear message to our political leaders. But it's hard to argue that the final electoral arithmetic gives effect to some silent national consensus on what Britain wants. A weakened government exclusively wooing one small party's MPs, politicians that 99.4% of the public didn't vote for - does this really reflect  the ""will of the people""? So what is the will of the people? Analysing what happened last Thursday reveals all kinds of contradictory and opaque views within the voting patterns. There are deep divides between young and old, town and country, north and south, rich and poor. There was no definable message from the electorate last Thursday. A British general election is a very blunt democratic tool. The nuanced opinions that the country and, indeed, every voter holds are impossible to explain from a simple ""X"" in a single box. And the diminution of local government in England, the weakening of the trade union movement, the impotence of political protest movements, the increasing centralisation of overarching authority to one house in Downing Street - these add to the sense that the ""demos"" (people) are increasingly excluded from the ""kratos"" (power). The defining feature of our democracy, this cornerstone of British values, is that citizens have a participatory role in political and civic life. The people have a voice. Some would argue that the debate we must have now is how to convince the populace that the United Kingdom does have a democracy that allows that voice to be listened to, understood and acted upon.

"Rescue workers searched the rubble in Vrisa for victims of the earthquake A strong earthquake has struck off the Aegean coast of western Turkey and the Greek island of Lesbos, with tremors felt in Istanbul and Athens. The epicentre of the 6.3 magnitude quake was 5km (3 miles) south of Plomari, a town on the coast of Lesbos, the US Geological Survey said. Several buildings were damaged but the village of Vrisa was worst hit with 10 people taken to hospital. Turkey and Greece sit on significant fault lines and earthquakes are common. Can you earthquake-proof a city? Can quakes be predicted? The initial quake struck at 15:28 (12:28 GMT) on Monday and was followed by two aftershocks minutes later. Details of damage and casualties in Vrisa took some time to emerge, but the mayor told Greek media the place looked like it had been ""flattened by bombs"". A woman was trapped in the rubble of her home reportedly with a fractured spine. None of the injuries were said to be life-threatening. So many buildings collapsed in Vrisa that the mayor said it looked like it had been flattened by bombs This video can not be played Several streets in Vrisa village were blocked by rubble from the quake Vrisa's 500 residents were set to spend the night in tents or nearby hotels, Kathimerini website said. The main road from the island's capital, Mytilene to Plomari was damaged by a landslide, public TV reported. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the safety of people on Lesbos and neighbouring Chios was paramount. No injuries were reported on Chios. Buildings also shook in the Turkish coastal city of Izmir. ""The trembling was really bad. Everything in my clinic started shaking wildly, we all ran outside with the patients,"" Didem Eris, a 50-year-old dentist told Reuters news agency. ""We are very used to earthquakes as people of Izmir but this one was different. I thought to myself that this time we were going to die."" Social media users who said they were in western Turkey reported a strong and sustained tremor, with aftershocks later felt across the Aegean region. ""We will be seeing the aftershocks of this in the coming hours, days and weeks,"" said Haluk Ozener, head of Turkey's Kandilli observatory in Istanbul. People stand in a street after being told to evacuate buildings in Izmir, western Turkey Turkey and Greece have experienced dozens of earthquakes in recent decades. At least 51 people were killed in a 6.0 magnitude earthquake in eastern Turkey in March 2010.

"New images released by police show bomber Salman Abedi on CCTV in Manchester The bomb attack in Manchester last month which killed 22 people was being planned since December, security officials in Libya have told the BBC. Salman Abedi was being watched in Libya more than a month before the attack. Officials in Tripoli have complained about poor security co-operation with the UK, which they say must be improved to prevent further attacks. Abedi spent a quiet month with his family in Tripoli before returning to Britain to carry out mass murder. Libyan officials have told the BBC's Orla Guerin that from the time of his arrival in the country he was under surveillance, along with his brother Hashem and father Ramadan. Hashem Abedi was under surveillance in Libya Images released by Greater Manchester Police show a barrel which was stored in Salman Abedi's car It is unclear if that information was shared with the UK, our correspondent says. Who was Salman Abedi? Who were the victims? Hashem Abedi and Ramadan Abedi are still being interrogated - daily - by Libya's Special Deterrence Force. Its spokesman Ahmed Ben Salem told the BBC the attack was being planned as far back as last December. He said the force had important information about Abedi's contacts in the UK and Libya. But security officials in Libya say they have closer co-operation with the CIA than with London. A general with the UN-backed government in Tripoli said they wanted better intelligence sharing - as quickly as possible - to avoid another Manchester. Abedi's brother Hashem has admitted while in detention that they both joined the group known as Islamic State (IS) in 2015, a Libyan security official said. It is not clear if the information was given freely or under duress. Libyan officials say Hashem Abedi bought parts for the bomb while in the UK. He left the UK on the same day as his brother. Police in the UK are appealing for anyone who saw Salman Abedi (pictured) with his white Nissan Micra Police in the UK meanwhile have said thatAbedi working alone in his flat was likely to have built the device that killed 22 people. Officers said there was now a ""deep understanding"" of the terrorist's movements in the weeks leading up to the attack at the Manchester Arena on 22 May. The head of counter-terrorism said it was ""less clear"" whether he solely obtained and stored all the materials or if others were ""complicit"". Early in the investigation, police said they could be looking for a ""network"" of people in connection with the attack, but most of those arrested have now been released.

"Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are both presidential advisers President Trump's daughter Ivanka has criticised ""the level of viciousness"" her father has been subjected to. She said that it went far beyond what she was expecting. In the interview withthe Fox and Friends morning TV show,external, she said that she had been left blindsided by the ferocity of some of the attacks levelled against the president. Her father is under intense scrutiny in the US, including over the Russia investigations and his business ties. Ms Trump said that she felt ""very vindicated"" byJames Comey's recent Senate testimony, in which the former FBI director spoke about the probe into alleged links between the Trump election campaign and Moscow. She said his evidence supported her father's insistence that he was not being personally investigated, and that Mr Comey had on at least one occasion supplied a leak to The New York Times. Who is the new first family? Who is America's first daughter? Ivanka Trump's book: The reviews are in... Ms Trump said that while she was ""not expecting the intensity of this experience"", she realised that the business of government ""isn't supposed to be easy"". Ms Trump's brother Eric (above) last week was scathing about the president's detractors ""My father and this administration intends to be transformative, and we want to do big, bold things,"" she said. ""With all the noise, with all the intensity of the media coverage... ultimately, we're really focused on why the American people elected Donald Trump as their president."" Last week Ms Trump's brother Eric told Fox News that he had ""never seen hatred like this"" and ""morals have flown out the window"". ""They're not even people,"" he said as he described his father's critics. Ms Trump, like her husband Jared Kushner, is a special adviser to the president. Fox News described her as ""a political novice like her dad"", who had ""glided past the more controversial interview topics like a seasoned vet"". The Washington Post,externaldescribed it as a ""largely friendly"" interview, and noted that Ms Trump avoided answering two big questions about Mr Comey's evidence and the work of her husband, ""masterfully pivoting from an unfavourable subject to a better one"". The New York Times,externalalso noted that she dodged questions as to whether Mr Kushner had quarrelled with other senior members of her father's team.

"Mr Trump's travel ban has led to protests A US appeals court has upheld a decision blocking President Donald Trump's revised ""travel ban"" on people from six mainly Muslim nations. Ruling on a case brought by the state of Hawaii, the appeal judges found that the executive order violated existing immigration legislation. It is a further legal setback for the president's efforts to get the ban he promised his supporters. Mr Trump criticised the San Francisco-based court's ruling. ""Well, as predicted, the 9th Circuit did it again - Ruled against the TRAVEL BAN at such a dangerous time in the history of our country,"" he tweeted. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he disagreed with the ruling. ""President Trump's executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe."" He added: ""Recent attacks confirm that the threat to our nation is immediate and real."" The dispute may end up being decided in the US Supreme Court. Mr Trump's owntweet,externalfrom 5 June was cited in the judges' ruling. An earlier version of the travel ban, issued by Mr Trump just days after taking office, sparked confusion at airports and protests. In the revised executive order, the 90-day ban was to apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also called for a 120-day ban on all refugees, but removed references to religious minorities. During his election campaign, Mr Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"". Reacting to the latest ruling, White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the executive order, saying: ""We need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence."" ""We continue to be confident that the president's executive order to protect this country is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the Supreme Court,"" Mr Spicer added. President Trump signed an executive order on 27 January, suddenly introducing a series of immigration measures, including a ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations Nationwide protests followed, before the order was halted seven days later by a federal judge in Seattle On 9 February appeal court judges upheld the Seattle ruling The presidentsigned a new executive order on 6 March, including many of the provisions of the first order but no longer including Iraq, lifting the indefinite ban on all Syrian refugees, and clarifying the situation for green card holders On 16 March federal judges in Hawaii and Marylandblocked the revised executive orderin separate rulings, just hours before it was due to come into force A federal appeals courtupheld the Maryland court's rulingon 26 May The White Housefiled two emergency applications with the US Supreme Courton 2 June to seek to overturn lower court rulings On 12 June appeal court judges upheld the Hawaii ruling The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals was reviewing a March ruling by a Hawaii-based federal judge that blocked parts of Mr Trump's order. In theirruling,external, the judges said that ""immigration, even for the president, is not a one-person show"". Mr Trump's travel bans have sparked protests and multiple court hearings They said Mr Trump had failed to show that the entry of people from the six countries mentioned in the ban, as well as the refugees, would be detrimental to US interests. Five questions about the revised executive order WATCH: Why did a US veteran give a stranger his Purple Heart? But the judges said the government was allowed to review the vetting process for people entering the US - something the earlier Hawaii ruling had blocked. Mr Trump has repeatedly said that the ban is necessary to protect Americans from terrorism. Significant recent attacks in the US were not committed by citizens of any other of the six countries named in the order. The legal ruling comes on the first anniversary of the Orlando nightclub shooting, in which a US citizen shot dead 49 people at a Florida nightclub. It was the worst mass shooting in US history. This ruling is bad news for the White House but it could have been worse. The appeal court in San Francisco did uphold the ban on the ban - but it declined to take a position on whether or not President Trump's executive order breached the US constitution. In fact the three appeal court judges scolded the federal district court in Hawaii, whose ruling they were considering, for failing to heed the judicial principle that ""courts should be extremely careful not to issue unnecessary constitutional rulings"". The lower court had concluded, among other things, that the president's executive order was driven by ""religious animus"" and was intended to discriminate about Muslims. That was improper, said the federal judges in California, because the order could actually be dismissed on a statutory rather than a constitutional basis. In particular, they argued, the order exceeded the scope of the president's ""broad authority to suspend the entry of aliens or classes of aliens"" because the administration had failed to prove that banning more than 180 million people from entry based on their national origin would not be detrimental to US interests. In other words, the appeal court concluded that the president was required by law to prove his case for the ban and failed to do so. His lawyers may now get another shot in front of the Supreme Court although it is not certain that the justices will actually decide to hear the case.

"Beyonce and JK Rowling are the only two women in the top 10 It's that time of year again - Forbes has released its list of the top 100 highest-paid entertainers and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs is top of the tree. His earnings of $130m (Â£102m) pushed him up from last year's 22nd spot. His success is down to his recent US tour, a marketing deal with a vodka company and selling one third of his Sean John clothing line. Beyonce and JK Rowling took second and third spot, but women comprise just 16% of the world's top-earning celebrities. Newcomers include Kylie Jenner, at number 59, who is the youngest list member at the age of 19. Her earnings come from her family's reality TV show - Keeping Up with the Kardashians - her namesake cosmetics company and clothing line, plus various endorsements. Half of the top 10 are made up of musicians, while two athletes - Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo and basketball star LeBron James - also make the cut. Here's a look at the top 10: Combs made an estimated $70m from selling a third of his clothing label Grammy award-winning rapper Combs used to be best known for best-selling albums such as No Way Out and Forever. But the entrepreneur's business interests have catapulted him into the big time, and he's jumped from number 22 in last year's list to nab this year's top spot. The star is currently pregnant with twins Queen Bey needs no introduction but she's made a big leap up the chart, from number 34 last year. That's largely due to profits from her Formation tour and her most recent album, the critically-acclaimed Lemonade. Her husband, Jay-Z, could only make number 55. Rowling has recently finished the script for the next Fantastic Beasts film JK Rowling returns to the top 100, no doubt boosted by the publication of the two-part play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and the film release of Potter spin-off, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The Canadian singer had a good night at the Billboard Awards last month The Canadian hip hop star has jumped from number 69 to number four, more than doubling his fortune through touring and endorsements with the likes of Nike, Sprite and Apple. Ronaldo has scored in three different Champion's League finals The Real Madrid footy star drops just one place on this year's list. On top of his soccer earnings, the current Fifa world player of the year also has a line of branded products including underwear and jeans, plus a lifetime deal with Nike. The Weeknd stepped out with girlfriend Selena Gomez at the Met Ball Another Canadian star, The Weeknd, has cracked the top 10 for the first time, having made it to number 30 last time round. His latest album, Starboy, had the third-largest debut sales week in the US of 2016. He recently collaborated with Lana Del Ray on duet, Lust for Life. Howard Stern has never shied away from controversy US ""shock jock"" and self-styled ""king of all media"" Howard Stern holds on to the seventh spot he occupied last year. The former America's Got Talent judge is currently part way through a five-year deal with Sirius XM Radio. Coldplay recently performed at the One Love Manchester concert Coldplay return to the list following the success of their worldwide Head Full of Dreams tour, which finished in Australia and New Zealand in December. That's good news for the charity sector, as the band donate 10% of their profits to good causes. Patterson has also enjoyed huge ebook sales Yes, it's another author on the list - Patterson has published more than 130 titles in his name and is believed to be the world's best-selling living author. Former US president Bill Clinton is currently writing a novel about the White House in collaboration with him. LeBron is a huge sporting star in the US Probably the US's best-known basketball star, the Cleveland Cavaliers player's $31m (Â£24.4m) salary in 2016-17 made him only the third NBA player to earn $30m in a season after Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. His endorsement list ain't bad either, including brands such as Nike, Coca-Cola and Beats by Dre. We spoke to Forbes associate editor, Natalie Robehmed, about her thoughts on this year's list. ""It surprises me year on year how few women end up on the list, especially musicians. Ten out of the 100 are female musicians but there are 27 male musicians on the list. ""I think it speaks to the under-representation of women in all industries."" Robehmed pointed to streaming as one of the main income generators. ""This year really shows streaming has become more important than ever. Dave Chapelle (number 43), Adam Sandler (number 35) and Chris Rock (number 30) have all benefited from Netflix deals."" And is there an argument that lists like this, in publicising such huge incomes, are a bit distasteful? Robehmed has a different take. ""With the gap between rich and poor widening, it's even more important to know what the rich are up to and to track them. The public have a right to know. ""Celebrities can go on to be politicians - think Ronald Reagan, Arnie Schwarzenegger and possibly Chris Rock - let's start taking them seriously.""

What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"".

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry. ""Potentially, some people expect, it may well show that not just this government but previous governments have simply not done enough to make sure this kind of housing is safe,"" she said.     The Grenfell Tower block disaster has again been dominating the news agenda. Here's a round-up of the latest developments on this and other political stories today: The Lib Dems have warned the Conservatives they ""cannot go from weak and wobbly to business as usual"" after the government announced formal Brexit negotiations will begin on Monday. Lib Dem MP Alistair
Carmichael said: If the government cannot even secure a deal with the DUP, how on earth can they get a deal with the EU? Theresa May must immediately create a cross-party joint cabinet committee to negotiate Brexit. It is the only way to unite the country and strengthen our bargaining power with the EU.â  BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams says his party will oppose any pact between the UK government and the DUP ""that undermines the Good Friday Agreement"". He said all parties in Northern Ireland ""need to be consulted on all of this"". ""A little side bargain to keep Theresa May in power - a temporary little arrangement - won't have any integrity and certainly isn't as important as the needs of the people who live in Ireland and particularly in the north of Ireland,"" he said. Simon Coveney is the new Irish minister for foreign affairs, with special responsibility for Brexit. Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The DUP Deputy Leader Nigel
Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The UK is due to leave by the end of March 2019. Labour MP Harriet Harman has been speaking to the BBC after the Westminster Hall session earlier. The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""  She also said it was up to opposition parties to make sure the government ""doesn't slip off the hook"" in terms of providing resources to make sure buildings are safe. BBC political editor tweets...

"Balloon syndrome is caused by gas collecting underneath the skin, often as the result of a traumatic event or infection A hedgehog that had ""blown up like a beach ball"" is said to be doing well after a vet ""popped"" him with a needle. The male hedgehog, which had inflated to twice its size, was found wandering around in circles by a member of the public in Toll Bar, Doncaster. The unnamed animal was diagnosed with the rare ""balloon syndrome"", caused by gas collecting under the skin. He was taken to a RSPCA centre in Cheshire where a needle was inserted to vent the trapped air. More news from across Yorkshire Bev Panto, head vet at the RSPCA's Stapeley Grange centre, said it was a very unusual syndrome. ""In my career I have seen three or four of these cases and they are very strange every time and quite shocking,"" she said. ""When you first see them they appear to be very big hedgehogs but when you pick them up they feel so light because they are mostly air."" The RSPCA's Stapeley Grange centre said the hedgehog was now ""doing well"" She said the condition only occurs in hedgehogs and was due to their ability to curl up, meaning they have a lot of space under the skin. In some circumstances air can get trapped under the skin due to an injury or trauma. ""They literally blow up like a balloon,"" she said. ""The first thing to do is to just pop them. To pop a needle in and drain all that air out."" Ms Panto said the hedgehog was eating well and staff were hopeful of a full recovery. ""It is certainly not out of the woods yet so it's fingers crossed,"" she added.

"The Oyston family vigorously deny the claims The family which own and run Blackpool FC have been accused at the High Court of treating the club as ""the family's personal cash machine"". Andrew Green QC, representing club president Valeri Belokon, said owner Owen and chairman Karl Oyston took millions of pounds from the club after Premier League promotion in 2010. Mr Belokon's company is pursuing a claim against the Oyston family for ""unfair prejudice"" against shareholders. The Oystons vigorously deny the claims. Blackpool FC won promotion to the Premier League in 2010 Mr Belokon's company, VB Football Assets, a minor shareholder in the club, was excluded from key decisions, information and any share of profits, claimed Mr Green. VB Football is also pursing a claim against Blackpool FC Ltd and Blackpool FC (Properties) Ltd, a company with family links formerly known as Segesta, for ""unfair prejudice"" against shareholders. Mr Green told Mr Justice Marcus Smith, sitting in London, that as a result of the Seasiders reaching the Premier League, the club received Â£106m ($134m), which included Â£48m for the 2010-11 season and Â£58m of ""parachute payments"" following Blackpool's relegation at the end of the season. Mr Green said the Oyston family's case was that at all times they had been transparent and open in relations to payments made out of the club, which he disputed. ""There was, in fact, the adoption of a deliberate strategy by the Oyston family to take cash out of Blackpool Football Club, and do so in a way VB Football Assets and its nominated directors could do nothing to stop that was the antithesis of transparency."" He added: ""Owen and Karl Oyston have treated Blackpool Football Club as the Oystons' personal cash machine."" Mr Belokon won a court case in February in a dispute with the Oystons The hearing is listed for five weeks.

"Morris initially told Mr Somers he was not the father before changing her story the following year A woman who faked a paternity test to fool an ex-partner into believing he was her baby's father has been jailed. Danielle Morris, from Seaforth, Merseyside, initially told Jamie Somers in May 2014 that he was not the father, but later changed her story. Mr Somers paid maintenance, had the baby stay with him on a weekly basis and tattooed her name on his arm before a test showed they were not related. The 29-year-old was jailed for one year for fraud at Liverpool Crown Court. The court heard Morris and Mr Somers, a singer and Michael Buble impersonator, had a brief relationship in November 2013 and, six months later, she told him she was pregnant but he was not the father. She contacted him again in 2015 to say a DNA test had shown the man she thought was the girl's father was not and implied that Mr Somers was. Mr Somers then paid for another DNA test but Morris faked a results document. The court was told he was delighted and had set aside a bedroom in his house for the baby, Darcy. Mr Somers only discovered the lie when he called the testing company for more details and was told they had not tested him. A subsequent test showed he was not the girl's father, news which he said ""devastated"" him. Offering mitigation, Morris's counsel said she had ""wanted a father figure"" for her daughter and had thought Mr Somers would give the girl ""a chance"" in life. Morris pleaded guilty to fraud. Speaking after sentencing, Mr Somers said there was ""no celebration on my behalf as a little girl, who was innocent and used as a pawn in Danielle Morris' game, is inevitably the victim here"". ""As long as live I will worry for the child and miss her immeasurably,"" he said.

"The man was struck by a tram at Manchester Victoria at about 19:45 BST on Sunday A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was ""pushed into a moving tram"" and died at Manchester's Victoria station. The man, believed to be in his 30s, was pushed, causing him to fall between the platform and tram, Greater Manchester Police said. A Metrolink driver reported a collision at about 19:45 BST on Sunday, Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) said. A 31-year-old woman is being questioned in police custody. The woman arrested was not the tram driver, police confirmed. Metrolink customer director Stephen Rhodes said he was ""absolutely devastated"" to hear someone had died. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the man died at the scene. There was disruption to services on the Bury line for several hours affecting those attending Parklife festival. Metrolink issued a walking map to help those travelling from the festival at Heaton Park return to the city centre. Parklife finished at 23:00 on Sunday. The three-mile walk should take about an hour. Some people questioned the advice on Twitter, suggesting telling young people to walk the distance in Wellington boots in the dark was ""unbelievable"". Others said they thought there would be safety in numbers. Metrolink suggested people walk back to the city centre Metrolink tweeted there was an ""ongoing medical emergency"" and advised passengers to avoid Manchester Victoria station. In a statement, Mr Rhodes, added: ""My immediate thoughts are with this person's family and friends. ""As this is now a police investigation it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment about what happened at this time."" He encouraged those who were able to walk to do so and said 100 buses were also in place, adding: ""I'd ask everyone to please bear with us and be patient."" Metrolink said ""a good service"" was in operation on all lines on Monday and trams were operating in and out of Victoria.

"Connie Yates posted the image along with the message ""a picture speaks a thousand words"" The mother of Charlie Gard has shared a photo of her son with his eyes open as she waits to find out if his life-support will be switched off. Connie Yates posted the image onFacebook,externalwith the message ""a picture speaks a thousand words"". Specialists in London say the 10-month old should be moved to palliative care but his parents want to take him to the US to undergo a trial treatment. The European Court of Human Rights is currently considering the case. Judges in Strasbourg, France, ruled that Charlie should receive treatment until Tuesday while they look at paperwork in the case. Ms Yates and her partner Chris Gard launched the final legal challenge at the European court after their appeal to the Supreme Court failed. Connie Yates and Chris Gard have raised more than Â£1.3m for treatment in the US Charlie has been in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October last year. He has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare disorder that affects the genetic building blocks that give energy to cells. Doctors say he cannot hear, move, cry or swallow and that his lungs only go up and down because he is on a machine that does it for him.

"Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. This video can not be played Election 2017: Highlights of TV election night coverage UK Prime Minister Theresa May called a general election, thinking she could increase her power ahead of Brexit talks. But it turned out she didn't do as well as hoped and her party no longer has a majority of members of parliament (MPs). Please enable Javascript to view our results map There are 650 MPs in the House of Commons - so any party getting more than 325 MPs has ""a majority"" because they are presumed to be able to win votes on all the things they want to do. Theresa May's Conservatives ended short of that total - getting 318 MPs (13 fewer than after the 2015 general election), Labour got 262 MPs (up 30), the Scottish National Party 35 (down 21), the Liberal Democrats got 12 (up 4) and the Democratic Unionists 10 (up 2). This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Let's get to work"" The Conservatives are still the biggest party in the House of Commons, and they have now agreed a deal with Northern Ireland party the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), to have its support in key votes. The Conservatives' 318 MPs and the 10 DUP MPs together make up more than half the MPs in the House of Commons. No. A coalition normally means different parties agreeing on a joint programme and ministers coming from both parties. The Conservatives and the DUP have agreed what is called a ""confidence and supply"" agreement. This is where the DUP agree to back the Conservatives in key votes - such as a Budget and a confidence motion - but are not tied into supporting them on other measures.Read the full Conservative-DUP agreement.,external As well as the obvious influence and prestige of being involved with the UK government, there will also be Â£1bn more spent on Northern Ireland over the next two years than had previously been planned. They have also got agreement on a range of policy priorities - such as keeping the guarantee to increase state pensions by at least 2.5% a year, to maintain defence spending and to maintain agriculture spending in Northern Ireland at the same level for the rest of the current Parliament (which theoretically takes us to June 2022).Read more: Where the money will be spent This video can not be played The DUP: Partners in government Basically, they are pro-union (UK, not Europe), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party is now the fifth largest in Parliament - its 36% share of the vote in Northern Ireland resulted in 10 MPs being returned to Westminster. It started as a one-man-band, with the Reverend Ian Paisley, a fundamentalist Protestant preacher, at its helm. He founded the party in 1971 in opposition to what he saw as the increasingly liberal approach of the Ulster Unionists - the party of the political establishment since the state was founded, in 1921. The DUP may be less overtly religious than it was in the days when the late Rev Paisley was in charge, but on social issues it is still deeply conservative. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. Ruth Davidson, the Conservative leader in Scotland, is gay and plans to marry her partner and had sought a guarantee from Mrs May that any deal would not affect gay rights. Many in Scotland and Wales are also concerned about special financial deals being struck for Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance Party have said that a deal between the Conservatives and the DUP at Westminster would be likely to make power-sharing at Stormont more difficult. The former Labour Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain said a deal would ""jeopardise the neutrality, the non-partisan stance, that a prime minister and a secretary of state must have in relation to Northern Ireland's politics"". The UK government says Westminster business should be distinguished from its role in relation to the devolved administration. Theresa May says she hopes that all the parties in Northern Ireland will ""come together and reach agreement to re-establish a power-sharing executive"" by the 29 June deadline. Theresa May justified calling a snap election on the basis that she wanted a larger majority of MPs, to strengthen her hand in negotiating the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. Brexit did not appear to have been the key issue in the election, however the fact that she has ended up with fewer MPs means there is now uncertainty over her strategy for the talks to come. Those arguing for a Brexit that maximises trading links - a policy Labour held - are feeling emboldened and claim the result showed voters rejecting Mrs May's vision for Brexit. The DUP, which has long been a Eurosceptic party, broadly shares Mrs May's Brexit strategy and has committed to back her in any votes on Brexit strategy.Read more: What result means for Brexit Former Chancellor George Osborne, a man sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister, has described her as a""dead woman walking"". She had to jettison her two closest advisers to appease critics in the Conservative Party and had to agree to a more collegiate form of cabinet government. She is weakened, but at the moment it seems that there is little appetite among Conservative MPs for either another general election - given Jeremy Corbyn's rise during the one just finished - or a leadership contest to replace Mrs May. There is also, at the moment, little sign of agreement on who could be parachuted in to replace her in a ""coronation"". Theresa May has got through the initial risk period, notably telling her backbench MPs ""I got us into this mess, I'll get us out of it"". The delayed Queen's Speech took place on Wednesday 21 June and the key vote on it is to take place on Thursday. The deal with the DUP means Mrs May is likely to win that vote - if she had lost it would be the equivalent of a vote of no confidence. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn ""ready any time"" for another election Although they did not get the most MPs, and got 40% of votes compared with 42.4% for the Conservatives, Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party and its supporters have been celebrating their election performance. The reason for this is the way their support surged during the campaign, from below 30% in many opinion polls to 40%. Written off beforehand by many inside and outside his party, Mr Corbyn took everything thrown at him and has emerged as a man now firmly in charge of his party and, unlike before the election, being seen by non-supporters as having a realistic chance of becoming prime minister. At the moment Theresa May and the Conservatives show no sign of wanting to risk incurring the wrath of voters by calling another election. Once bitten, twice shy and all that. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn is the candidate seen as on the rise, so why risk letting him build on the gains Labour made in this election? However you can't argue with the fundamentals, and the truth is that the Conservatives do not have a majority in Parliament, and Labour can't put together a coalition to secure a majority either. The aim appears to be to govern now for a full Parliament with DUP backing - but past precedent - 1974 when there were two elections in the year - would suggest that may be difficult to achieve.

"There has been a sharp drop in nurses registering to work in the UK since the EU referendum, figures suggest. Last July, 1,304 nurses from the EU joined the Nursing and Midwifery Council register, compared to 46 in April this year, a fall of 96%. The Health Foundation said the findings could not be more stark and said they should act as a ""wake-up call"". But the NMC said the introduction of English language testing for EU nurses is also likely to have played a role. It comes as the NHS is already struggling with nurse vacancies and, without this supply line, shortages could get worse. In May, research by the Royal College of Nursing found one in nine posts in England was vacant. The union said it meant the NHS was 40,000 nurses short of what was needed. The figures - obtained by the Health Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act - cover the numbers applying to go on the register so they do not necessarily mean they are employed by the NHS. But they give an indication of the supply line from the EU which provides a significant proportion of the workforce. Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation, said the drop since the Brexit vote could not be more ""stark"". ""Without EU nurses, it will be even harder for the NHS and other employers to find the staff they need to provide safe patient care. ""The findings should be a wake-up call to politicians and health service leaders."" The NMC has also drawn attention to the introduction of English language tests, which were brought in for EU nurses for the first time in January 2016 - they were already in use for non-EU nurses. It normally takes a few months from being tested to making it on to the register so officials believe this could have also played a role in the drop in numbers. A Department of Health spokeswoman said EU nurses played a ""valued"" role in the NHS and they would be a priority in Brexit negotiations. But shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government was making a mess of things. ""Theresa May's weak and unstable government has pushed NHS services to the brink, and it is patients who will pay the price. ""Our health service has always relied on the contribution of overseas workers, yet these staff are being forced out by this government's neglect and disregard. ""The Tories are overseeing an unforgivable drain of talent out of our country, because of their chaotic attitude to the Brexit negotiations."" And Lib Dem health spokesman Norman Lamb added: ""These figures are profoundly worrying and the possible implications for the NHS and patients cannot be underestimated."" Overall there are 650,000 nurses on the register. Just over 36,000 of these have been trained in the EU, 5.5% of the total. Another 67,000 come from outside the EU with the rest from the UK.

"Theresa May has reshuffled her cabinet following the resignations of International Development Secretary Priti Patel and Defence Minister Sir Michael Fallon. Here is a guide to who holds the key positions. Penny Mordaunt: New International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt replaced Priti Patel on 9 November, after Ms Patel resigned in the wake of disclosures that she had held a series of unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures. Ms Mordaunt was previously minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions. She was minister for the armed forces under David Cameron, and had been considered a contender to replace Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary. Penny Mordaunt, elected to parliament in 2010 as MP for Portsmouth North, is also known for her strong support of Brexit. Gavin Williamson was appointed defence secretary on 2 November Chief whip and key Theresa May ally Gavin Williamson replaced Sir Michael Fallon on 2 November,  after the former defence chief resigned amid allegations over his past conduct. The appointment is Mr Williamson's first cabinet post. The MP for South Staffordshire was elected to parliament in 2010, and was previously an aide to David Cameron. Theresa May remained prime minister despite losing her majority in the 8 June general election, which she had called seeking a mandate for Brexit. Mrs May became the UK's second female prime minister in 2016, after David Cameron resigned in the wake of the EU referendum result. She had previously been home secretary for six years. The Theresa May story Damian Green is effectively Theresa May's deputy. He was promoted to a new role the prime minister did not have in her first cabinet - that of first secretary of state. He also replaced Ben Gummer as minister for the Cabinet Office after Mr Gummer lost his seat in the election. Mr Green was formerly work and pensions secretary, and is a long-term friend and ally of Theresa May. The role - which was previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson - gives Mr Green seniority over other cabinet ministers. Philip Hammond remained chancellor of the exchequer after the June election. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. Mr Hammond, 61, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands steering Britain's economy through the post-Brexit period ahead. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"". Another familiar face kept his job at the Foreign Office after the election. Despite hints from some of the newspapers that Boris Johnson, 52, seeks the top job, he has categorically dismissed such claims. In the wake of June's shock election result, Mr Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades. ""I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."" Amber Rudd remained home secretary despite only narrowly holding her seat as MP for Hastings and Rye in June. During the election campaign, she stood in for the PM in the BBC's televised debate. Ms Rudd was previously energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year. The former investment banker, venture capitalist and financial journalist, aged 53, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". David Davis kept his job of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". The role was created in July 2016 to take the lead in negotiating the UK's exit from the EU. A veteran Eurosceptic, he had previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 68, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Liam Fox, 55, continues as the secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas. Mr Fox stood in the 2016 leadership race against Theresa May, but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs. Former Leader of the House of Commons David Lidington was appointed justice secretary in June 2017, replacing Liz Truss. He had been Europe Minister since 2010, but moved across to aid the smooth running of the Commons in 2016. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto. Baroness Evans of Bowes Park remained in post as the leader of the House of Lords. When appointed in 2016, it was her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme. Jeremy Hunt kept his job despite the problems within the NHS. He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and at the time described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". But in a tweet he admitted there were ""challenges ahead, but also huge opportunities to make our NHS even better"". In 2015 Mr Hunt was locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes. Justine Greening kept her roles as education secretary and minister for women and equalities. She is part ofthe most diverse Parliament yetas she openly defines herself as a lesbian. At London Pride in 2016, the 48-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"". Ms Greening replaced Nicky Morgan at education in 2016, leaving her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in 2011. She has been MP for Putney since 2005. Chris Grayling remains as transport secretary in Theresa May's cabinet. The former Leader of the House has been dealing with Southern Rail's disrupted services, the question of Heathrow's third runway and the high speed rail link, HS2. He also served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007. Karen Bradley kept her role as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014. She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010. Michael Gove made a comeback in June 2017, with the prime minister bringing him back into cabinet by appointing him environment secretary. In the 2016 reshuffle he was sacked as justice secretary after serving as David Cameron's education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit, he withdrew his support for Mr Johnson to be Conservative leader and prime minister following the referendum, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third. David Gauke became work and pensions secretary in June 2017. He was previously the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who attends cabinet but does not have a ministerial role. Mr Gauke has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. He is a qualified solicitor and worked for a leading City firm until he was elected. Sajid Javid retained his job as secretary of the department for communities and local government. He held this position in 2014 before being appointed to business secretary a year later. A former managing director of Deutsche Bank, Mr Javid has been MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire since 2010. He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM. James Brokenshire continues as the Northern Ireland Secretary. He previously worked with the PM at the Home Office, where he was immigration minister. From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter-terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network. Mr Brokenshire's responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure thedeportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada. Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remained in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales. The 46-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. David Mundell will continue as secretary of state for Scotland. He is one of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be in Parliament after the June 2017 snap election. Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015. In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet secretary. Patrick McLoughlin remains as the Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He left his role as transport secretary in 2016, but has been an MP since 1986. The former miner also served as chief whip after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet. Greg Clark kept his job as secretary of state of business, energy and industrial strategy following the election. The role, when it was created by Labour's Gordon Brown, was originally called the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Last year, it was merged into the new department and lost the ""climate change"" part of its name. Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority. Andrea Leadsom appointed Leader of the House of Commons (will also attend Cabinet meetings) Jeremy Wright remained in post as attorney general (will also attend Cabinet meetings) Liz Truss  appointed as Chief Secretary to the Treasury (will also attend Cabinet meetings) Brandon Lewis made the minister of state for immigration (will also attend Cabinet meetings) Queen's Speech faces delay amid DUP talks May and DUP deal: What you need to know Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance Politics Live At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"One of the most famous brands of champagne bears a woman's name, but for many years women played little role in the industry. Now that is changing. Juliet Rix met some of the new wave of female tastemakers. I am sitting in a contemporary stripped-wood conservatory looking out at a much more traditional view. Beyond a gentle slope, neatly striped with perfect vines, stands a fairytale French chateau, its decorative creamy faÃ§ade topped with turrets and spires. It was built by Widow Clicquot -Veuve Clicquotin French - a name more closely associated with famous champagne than with an actual woman. But she was very real. In 1805, when she was just 27, her winemaker husband died. And, against all 19th Century expectations - and considerable opposition - the young widow took over his winemaking business. Adapting and improving it, she spread its effervescent product across the globe, turning it into one of the most successfulmaisons de champagne. Madame Clicquot Ponsardin - better known as La Veuve Clicquot Clicquot was the first female champagne producer. A few more followed. All were widows, the only women French society of the time would allow to take such a public role. They did a remarkably good job. In fact the Champagne Widows were so successful that some champagne houses without a widow added Veuve to their labels nonetheless! But this was not exactly a female takeover. It was just a handful of women there, as it were, ""by accident"". Most champagne production remained firmly in the hands of men. Until now. Sitting with me at one of the conservatory's narrow, polished tree-trunk tables is Charlotte Le Gallais. Her great-great-grandfather - an Armenian diamond merchant - bought the turreted Clicquot chateau and thedomainesurrounding it, nearly a century ago. Five generations later, it is not the son, but the daughter, who is taking over the champagne-making. She is part of a new wave of women making significant inroads not only into selling but also growing and blending. Three generations - Charlotte Le Gallais with her father and young son There are now three organisations specifically for women working in the business and 60% of the students studying winemaking in the Champagne region are female. So does it make a difference if champagne is made by women? ""Of course!"" laughs Francoise Peretti, director of the UK Champagne Bureau, which promotes and educates about champagne: ""[They] are more intuitive and more attentive to aroma and taste - and maybe more curious, more daring"".  Other leading women in the industry agree. ""Women are more aware of the delicate flavours of champagne,"" says Sophie Signolle, president of the Commission of Women Winemakers of Champagne. ""Their nose and palate have more finesse, more subtlety."" One of the few female cellar-masters in a big champagne house, Floriane Eznack, says ""there is love"" between women and champagne. ""Champagne was first bought for the mistresses of the Kings of France - and even today, to seduce a woman, a man wouldn't buy red wine, he would buy champagne!"" she says. It must be said that Eznack is no bubbly girly type. Her first choice of career was fighter pilot. Only having failed to do that did she turn to making champagne. Floriane Eznack is one of the few female cellar-masters for a big champagne house Charlotte Le Gallais makes no claims to superiority over male champagne-makers, but as she shows me the shiny silver tanks that receive the juice pressed from her grapes, and carefully explains the details of the highly regulated production method, she does reveal that her favourite part of the process is the blending - the repeated mixing and tasting of wines from different grapes, soils and years to find just the right combination of flavours. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST The rise of women winemakers will certainly change champagne, says Eznack, though exactly how is yet to be seen. Blends created today will not be on the market for another four or five years and the number of women involved is still rising. Le Gallais points up at one of the towers of Clicquot's chateau. ""That was her room,"" she says. It's empty now. The Le Gallais family moved out of the chateau during World War Two and now occupy the 16th Century manor house across the vineyard that the Clicquots used for the servants. The manor house is unheated - hard on the people but perfect for the bottles of champagne laid in neat racks in the cellar. Back in the warm conservatory, I raise a sparkling glass of Le Gallais' golden bubbly to my lips and have to agree that this woman makes excellent champagne.

"Three days after Theresa May called the general election, I interviewed the chancellor about what we could expect from any new Tory government. On tax the signal was clear. Philip Hammond was no fan of the triple tax lock David Cameron promised voters before the 2015 election - no increase in income tax, national insurance contributions or VAT. He suggested the lock should be dropped, and it was. Towards the end of the interview I turned to immigration and, given the events of last Thursday, it is worth going back to the exchange. And understanding that Mr Hammond's backing for an immigration target of ""tens of thousands"" per year is at best luke-warm. I asked the chancellor: ""Immigration is a big issue for businesses - skilled and less-skilled immigration coming into the country. Do you agree that immigration in the UK should be brought down to the tens of thousands even though many businesses say that will damage economic growth?"" Mr Hammond replied: ""What businesses want to do is bring skilled migrants in, move skilled migrants around their global businesses to do the jobs that are open in the UK. ""No businesses are unable to bring skilled workers into the UK to work in their companies because we have run out of space on a visa cap. ""At the moment we cannot control migration from the European Union into the UK. That situation will end. ""We will regain control of our borders and we will use that control to manage the migration system in the interests of our economy and our society. "" Me: ""Do you think it should be brought down to the tens of thousands a year, immigration in the UK?"" Mr Hammond: ""We've got to get migration back to sustainable levels; we've got to focus on skilled migration. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that she believes that needs to be tens of thousands a year."" Me: ""Do you believe it?"" Mr Hammond: ""The Prime Minister has been very clear that is the target that we are going for - tens of thousands."" Mr Hammond is a careful man. And the fact that he refused to say directly that he supported the target is worthy of note. Those close to the chancellor have revealed his concern. Far from putting up barriers to immigration, many in the Treasury believe that Britain will be engaged in a ""global battle for immigrants"" to support the economy. Mr Hammond's position in government has strengthened Now, that is not to say that Mr Hammond is in favour of free movement of people from the EU. As he made clear to me, ""that situation will end"". And nothing has changed sufficiently enough since last Thursday to alter that. Which seems to me to rule out unfettered membership of the single market unless the European Union decides to reform one of the four principles of membership - open borders. And the chance of that appears vanishingly small. Simon Jack: Business senses chance to reassert itself Business confidence 'sunk' by election Election result 'may delay Brexit talks' What has changed is that Mr Hammond is much strengthened in government - as Theresa May has been weakened. Many in Number 10 were no fans of the Treasury and wanted to curtail its influence at the centre. That power relationship has shifted. And Mr Hammond's reluctance to back an immigration numbers target has become much more significant. ""Jobs and skills"" to support the economy will be a new mantra in the Brexit discussions - pushed by the chancellor. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBIwriting in this morning's Financial Times,external, talks about the need for ""access to the skills and labour companies need to grow"". My colleague Simon Jackreports this morningthat businesses feel their voice should now be heard more loudly. Michael Gove's reappearance in the Cabinet provides another ""pro-skills"" voice. Yes, Mr Gove is a firm Brexiter, but of the ""open-but-controlled borders"" variety. ""People who come here who have got skills that can contribute to our economy are welcome,"" he said during the referendum campaign. There is much talk that a ""soft"" Brexit may now be more likely given the perceived weakness of the Prime Minister. As far as ""soft"" means an economically closer relationship with the EU - and a more porous approach to immigration controls - that certainly appears to be the case as far as the chancellor is concerned.

"This tablet has an account in Sumerian cuneiform describing the receipt of oxen The Egyptians used to believe that literacy was divine, a gift from baboon-faced Thoth, the god of knowledge. Scholars no longer embrace that theory, but why ancient civilisations developed writing was a mystery for a long time. Was it for religious or artistic reasons? To communicate with distant armies? The mystery deepened in 1929, when a German archaeologist named Julius Jordan unearthed a vast library of clay tablets that were 5,000 years old. They were far older than the samples of writing already discovered in China, Egypt and Mesoamerica, and were written in an abstract script that became known as ""cuneiform"". The tablets came from Uruk, a Mesopotamian settlement on the banks of the Euphrates in what is now Iraq. The ruins of Uruk and other Mesopotamian cities were littered with mysterious little clay objects Uruk was small by today's standards - with only a few thousand inhabitants - but in its time was huge, one of the world's first true cities. ""He built the town wall of 'Uruk', city of sheepfolds,"" proclaims the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest works of literature. ""Look at its wall with its frieze like bronze! Gaze at its bastions, which none can equal!"" This great city had produced writing that no modern scholar could decipher. What did it say? 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Uruk posed another puzzle for archaeologists - although initially it seemed unrelated. The ruins of Uruk and other Mesopotamian cities were littered with little clay objects - conical, spherical and cylindrical. One archaeologist quipped they looked like suppositories. Julius Jordan was a little more perceptive. They were shaped, he wrote in his journal, ""like the commodities of daily life - jars, loaves, and animals"", although they were stylised and standardised. But what were they for? Nobody could work it out. Nobody, that is, until the French archaeologist Denise Schmandt-Besserat. In the 1970s, she catalogued similar pieces found across the region, from Turkey to Pakistan, some of which were 9,000 years old. Denise Schmandt-Besserat - pictured here in Muscat in 2012 - is widely credited with discovering the origins of writing Schmandt-Besserat believed the tokens had a simple purpose: correspondence counting. The tokens that were shaped like loaves could be used to count loaves. The ones shaped like jars could be used to count jars. Correspondence counting is easy: you don't need to know how to count, you just need to look at two quantities and verify that they are the same. The technique is older even than Uruk. The 20,000-year-old Ishango Bone - found near one of the sources of the Nile in the Democratic Republic of Congo - seems to use matched tally marks on the thigh bone of a baboon for correspondence counting. The 20,000-year-old Ishango Bone appears to show matched tally marks used for correspondence counting But the Uruk tokens took things further: they were used to keep track of counting lots of different quantities, and could be used both to add and to subtract. Remember, Uruk was a great city. There was a priesthood, there were craftsmen. Food was gathered from the surrounding countryside. An urban economy requires trading, and planning, and taxation too. Picture the world's first accountants, sitting at the door of the temple storehouse, using the little loaf tokens to count as the sacks of grain arrive and leave. Denise Schmandt-Besserat pointed out something else revolutionary. The abstract marks on the cuneiform tablets matched the tokens. Everyone else had missed the resemblance because the writing didn't seem to be a picture of anything. But Schmandt-Besserat realised what had happened. The tablets had been used to record the back-and-forth of the tokens, which themselves were recording the back-and-forth of the sheep, the grain, and the jars of honey. In fact, it may be that the first such tablets were impressions of the tokens themselves, pressing the hard clay baubles into the soft clay tablet. Then those ancient accountants realised it might be simpler to make the marks with a stylus. So cuneiform writing was a stylised picture of an impression of a token representing a commodity. No wonder nobody had made the connection before Schmandt-Besserat. And so she solved both problems at once. Those clay tablets, adorned with the world's first abstract writing? They weren't being used for poetry, or to send messages to far-off lands. They were used to create the world's first accounts. The world's first written contracts, too - since there is just a small leap between a record of what has been paid, and a record of a future obligation to pay. These bulla, discovered in Iraq, recorded agricultural transactions in the 8th Millennium BC The combination of the tokens and the clay cuneiform writing led to a brilliant verification device: a hollow clay ball called a bulla. On the outside of the bulla, the parties to a contract could write down the details of the obligation - including the resources that were to be paid. On the inside of the bulla would be the tokens representing the deal. The writing on the outside and the tokens inside the clay ball verified each other. We don't know who the parties to such agreements might have been - whether they were religious tithes to the temple, taxes, or private debts, is unclear. But such records were the purchase orders and the receipts that made life in a complex city society possible. This is a big deal. Most financial transactions are based on explicit written contracts. Insurance, a bank account, a government bond, a corporate share, a mortgage agreement - they're all written contracts - and the bullas of Mesopotamia are the very first archaeological evidence that written contracts existed. Uruk's accountants provided us with another innovation, too. What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? How the invention of paper changed the world The warrior monks who invented banking Tick tock: The importance of knowing the right time At first, the system for recording five sheep would simply require five separate sheep impressions. But that was cumbersome. A superior system involved using an abstract symbol for different numbers - five strokes for five, a circle for 10, two circles and three strokes for 23. The numbers were always used to refer to a quantity of something: there was no ""10"" - only ""10 sheep"". But the numerical system was powerful enough to express large quantities - hundreds, and thousands. One demand for war reparations, 4,400 years old, is for 4.5 trillion litres of barley grain, or 8.64 million ""guru"". It was an unpayable bill - 600 times the US's annual production of barley today. But it was an impressively big number. It was also the world's first written evidence of compound interest. In all it is quite a set of achievements. The citizens of Uruk faced a huge problem, a problem that is fundamental to any modern economy - how to deal with a web of obligations and long-range plans between people who did not know each other well, who might perhaps never even meet. Solving that problem meant producing a string of brilliant innovations: not only the first accounts and the first contracts, but the first mathematics and even the first writing. Writing wasn't a gift from the gods. It was a tool that was developed for a very clear reason: to run an economy.

"A woman travelling through Cairo airport may find her sanitary products confuse and alarm security staff, writes the BBC's Claire Read. Cairo airport's security screening starts at the door to the terminal buildings. Only passengers are allowed in. Even before check-in, they have to put their belongings through the large scanners, have their tickets and passports checked and walk through a scanner themselves. It was at this point that I was pulled aside for a patdown. A uniformed woman ran her hands down my body and legs and came back up to find a lump in my right-hand jeans pocket. It was small and bullet-shaped. The guard pointed and said, in Egyptian Arabic: ""What's that?"" ""Oh nothing"", I said. ""It's justâ¦"" Thinking it was a tissue, I pulled it outâ¦ then realised that to my horror, I was waving a tampon in her face. She raised her eyebrows, apparently oblivious to my embarrassment, then looked perplexed. ""What's that?"" She said again. Now I raised my eyebrows. ""Um,"" I started, unsure where to begin. ""It's for, you know, that timeâ¦"" Sanitary pads are much more common in Egyptian chemists than tampons I've questioned an Egyptian presidential candidate and government spokespeople in Egyptian Arabic but here I was stumped. ""It's for that time every month,"" I continued, to her ongoing frown and the slight shake of the head Egyptians give when they want you to explain. ""It's for the monthly period, the monthly bleeding,"" I said, resorting to modern standard Arabic. ""Oh the beeriod?"" She said, using the English word. ""How do you use it?"" Here my faint embarrassment turned to a full blush and I thanked the heavens I was travelling alone. I explained that it stops the flow of blood and she once again looked perplexed by how this small white object could do such a thing. From Our Own Correspondent has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Saturdays at 11:30 My suitcase, meanwhile, had emerged from the scanner and another guard, this one male, was waiting to question me about all the wires and microphones in there. I asked the female guard if she'd like to see the instructions from the box of tampons I had in my suitcase, and she looked askance, saying ""You've got more?! We'll have to put them through the scanner by themselves."" This encounter is in fact typical of many Egyptian women's reactions to being presented with a tampon, or the idea of one. I had previously had a similar exchange with a colleague caught short at the office who turned down my offer of a tampon after she understood what it was. I had shown her an instructional online video that made her eyes bulge. And when retelling this story to Egyptian friends and other foreigners living in Egypt, I heard plenty of similar tales of Egyptian security guards' bafflement and many questions from curious women. Misinformation abounds. Sex education is left mainly to parents and when puberty is covered at school it can be after some girls have already started their periods. Even the language reflects the extent to which this subject isa'ibas they call it in Egypt, loosely meaning ""shameful"". Women prefer to use English words and no true Egyptian colloquial expressions have developed, leaving only terms from modern standard Arabic or foreign languages. Tampons are not discussed as an option because of the fear that they take a girl's virginity, or rather, break the hymen. This even extends to advice from pharmacies. A friend told me she was once asked whether she was married before being shown the tampons. The national press too stirs the misunderstandings - for example, a recent article featured three mothers fearfully discussing the dangers of tampons. A woman's hymen can tear when playing sports, riding a bike or inserting a tampon But, as the British-Egyptian author and women's rights advocate Shereen El Feki points out, a huge number of issues are bound up in tampon use - control of the body, mobility and the fear surrounding pre-marital loss of virginity. She believes the extent of their use should be used as a measure of women's emancipation by the UN. Back at the security gate in Cairo airport, the male guard wanted to go through my radio kit piece by piece but the female guard had a more pressing matter for him. She thrust my box of tampons into his hands crying, ""Look at these things she's got! I think we should put them back through."" He rifled through them and nodded his approval. As the tampons were re-examined in the suitcase X-ray machine, the female guard pored over the instructions. She handed me back the box, which had now cleared security, and leaned in close. She asked conspiratorially, ""Can you get these in Egypt?"" I told her with delight that indeed you can, and suggested she keep the instructions. She did, and I wish I had given her some of the tampons. But I'm minded now always to keep a tampon in my pocket at airport security to bring more women into the fold.

"In the 1990s, Ciudad Juarez became infamous for the number of women killed there Rosa MarÃ­a Apodaca has spent the past six years looking for her eldest daughter. Patricia JazmÃ­n Ibarra was 18 when she left on the morning of 7 June 2011 to go to work at a mobile phone shop in the centre of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez. ""They stole her,"" says her mother, who has given up her job to look for Patricia JazmÃ­n. Ms Apodaca knows that many of the young girls who disappeared from Ciudad JuÃ¡rez were eventually found dead. The city on the Mexican-US border is located on a key route for drug smuggling and human trafficking. In the 1990s, Ciudad JuÃ¡rez became infamous for the staggering numbers of young women who disappeared from it, and between 2008 and 2011 the city held the dubious title of murder capital of the world. ""They never find them alive. They find only bones, this is how they give them back to their families,"" Ms Apodaca says of the many women who have gone missing. ""You never have the certainty that it is your own daughter."" It is people like Ms Apodaca that Dr Alejandro HernÃ¡ndez CÃ¡rdenas is trying to help. He works as a forensic doctor at the prosecutor's office and has developed a special technique to rehydrate corpses in order to help identify them. Dr Alejandro HernÃ¡ndez CÃ¡rdenas has invented a formula for the rehydration of bodies The technique is so innovative that last year the Mexican Institute for Industrial Property gave him a patent for his secret formula. Forensic experts have used glycerine injections to reconstitute fingers to get prints for over a century. But that technique does not work for entire bodies. If the bodies can be rehydrated enough to allow for fingerprinting, identification becomes easier DNA testing can help, but in order to identify bodies, samples from two direct family members are needed for comparison. With the rehydration process, the body can regain most of its original condition so families can identify it. ""I think I am doing this work because I was affected by the idea of these bodies going to mass graves or their families not being able to mourn properly,""  Dr HernÃ¡ndez says. The rehydration technique has also helped provide key leads in criminal investigations. When Dr HernÃ¡ndez rehydrated a corpse in the state of Queretaro, in central Mexico, he discovered unusual lesions on its skin, which later led to an arrest being made. Rehydration sometimes reveals tattoos or other unique characteristics The doctor was told that his help was key in bringing the murderer to justice. Dr HernÃ¡ndez, 59, says that he first thought of becoming a forensic expert when he was 18 and studying to be a dentist while also driving an ambulance to help provide for his young family. One night in 1977, he was called out to a train accident that had killed 35 people and had left most of the victims unrecognisable. ""When the forensic doctor arrived, he told us to check their teeth,"" Dr HernÃ¡ndez recalls. He helped out at the morgue for four or five days, while the victims' families were waiting for news outside. While the task may seem gruesome to some, it inspired in Dr HernÃ¡ndez a desire to help identify victims of crime. After becoming a dentist and eventually joining the forensic lab, he started experimenting with his rehydration technique. Dr HernÃ¡ndez has made it his mission to try and identify bodies which otherwise may end up in mass graves without a name He often has little to go on, such as a piece of desiccated skin He used pig skin and human fingers he kept in glass jars and checked on them daily. One day in 2004 he was inspecting seven jars. When he took out the finger from the fourth jar, it looked perfect. ""It was like a new finger. I couldn't believe it,"" he says. At first he thought it was too good to be true and suspected his colleagues of playing a trick on him. But when he confronted them, one told him: ""We don't mess with them, they smell too bad."" He had found the magic formula and four years later managed to rehydrate a full corpse. In recent years, Dr HernÃ¡ndez has been applying his technique more and more to migrants found dead in the border area. Read next:Suicide in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: Where life has little value Posters of missing people are a common sight in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez Ciudad JuÃ¡rez is one of the main crossing points to the US. More than 6,000 bodies have been recovered from along the border since the 1990s. The bodies are often found in mass graves and are often hard to identify because they have been mutilated or are mummified because of the harsh weather conditions. Because there is no investigation unit at the forensic lab where he works, Dr HernÃ¡ndez has been financing his research himself, paying for the chemicals and working on it in his spare time. He hopes that someone will take an interest in his research but ultimately wishes for less, rather than more, work. ""It's not that I am lazy, it's just that when I have a lot of work it means that a lot of people have died,"" he explains. ""I would prefer not to have found this formula - if it meant that those people had never died.""

"Annie Mac started out on student radio, before landing a job at Radio 1 as a broadcast assistant Monday night sees the return of Radio 1's tastemaker in chief, Annie Mac, to the airwaves. The Dublin-born DJ, who had taken six months' maternity leave,resumes her duties at 19:00 BSTwith a world premiere of the new Wolf Alice single, Yuk Foo. Her early evening timeslot marks the point where Radio 1 abandons its daytime playlist and focuses on new music. Over the years, it hosted early sessions by The Smiths and Oasis's live debut; while Mac's predecessor, Zane Lowe, was a cheerleader for acts like Kanye West and Ed Sheeran. Mac - whose real name is Annie MacManus - took over in 2015, after giving Disclosure, Rudimental and Duke Dumont their first ever radio plays on her Friday nightdance anthems show. Outside of her radio career, she's also an internationally successful club promoter and DJ, who will headline Glastonbury's John Peel Stage on Friday, 23 June. As she prepares for her comeback, the 38-year-old chatted about the songs she missed, her plans for the future and the ""weirdness"" of other people hosting her shows. ""I just can't wait to get back,"" she enthuses. ""I love my job. I feel so privileged."" As a music writer, I find it difficult to ""turn off"" from work when I'm away. Did you find yourself obsessing over music during maternity leave? Definitely at the start, and then my baby came 12 days early! So after that it was all about nappies and just getting through the day. When you have a new baby everything's a bit delirious for a while. Then, after a month or two, I started to get back into listening to music. You have this weird thing where you listen to something and you're like, ""Oh my God, I wish I could play that on the radio!' Is there one song you regret not being able to play? Yes. The Goldie single,I Adore You,external. Why that one? Because it's pure emotion. It's so evocative and so poignant. You can't listen to it without feeling something. To me, that's what radio is all about: Being able to project this most incredible art to people who are doing the most mundane things -  ironing or driving or texting. Were you able to listen to Mistajam [who deputised for Annie] without feeling a little jealous? At the start I didn't listen. It's always weird when someone else does your job. It's a strange situation. But in the last couple of months, I've listened to him loads and I've really, really enjoyed the show.  I think the show's in incredible shape. It's been really nice to have perspective on it and think, ""Right, what could I do differently when I come back?"". Did you watch The Replacement? [BBC thriller about a woman on maternity leave who becomes suspicious of the person covering for her] Yes! I did! And as I was watching it, I was thinking, ""I probably shouldn't be watching this!"" But luckily Mistajam and Danny [Howard, who covered Annie's Friday night dance show] are not psycho people who are trying to steal my child. So we're fine. Annie Mac: ""You have listeners that you know because you talk to them every week, and they talk to you"" Your partner is Toddla T, who also has a show on Radio 1. Do you try to educate the children about music, or is it wall-to-wall Peppa Pig? They do get to hear a lot of cool music but also I make playlists for them that I know that they'll like. They're not afraid of music, either. In the last couple of weeks, I've been going around to record labels and, at one meeting, the baby was just crawling on the ground as we listened to the new Jessie Ware single super-loud. They were like, ""does he mind [the volume]?' and I was like, ""Oh, he's fine, just let him be!"" What's on your baby playlist? Just random stuff we like to jump around to. The Jungle Book songs; a lot of Disney themes; Randy Newman's You've Got A Friend In Me from Toy Story; Tutti Frutti by Little Richard - because my son's got a toothpaste called Tutti Frutti. As well as five radio shows a week, you're about to hit festival season. Is that quite daunting? To be honest, it's terrifying, the thought of coming back to work. When you do a big gig there's an awful lot of preparation involved. It's not just picking out a couple of tunes. I make special edits of songs and  I'm working with a gospel choir who'll come on stage with me this summer. So there's a lot of creative work behind the scenes. What keeps me up at night is just not having enough time to do everything. Which I think is what every working woman has. I find I'm much more single-minded at work, because I have to be out the door for the school run most days. You have to be focused. You get better at streamlining and making sure you maximise every second of the time you've got. You're coming back with a big Wolf Alice exclusive - what else are you looking forward to? For me the most important thing, as well as having those big names - which we will have - is being a really fun, inclusive, exciting listen. Putting the music together in such a way that people just cannot turn off the radio. Did you miss the fans, then? I really missed them. You get used to having this constant dialogue with all these people who are your friends - or they are in my head, anyway. I got a lot of texts and tweets while I was away saying, ""We miss you so much"" and you realise you're part of their weekly routine. Your voice is part of what they do every day, and that's a lovely thing. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"The new environment secretary, Michael Gove, is having his green credentials challenged Did Michael Gove really try to stop schools in England from teaching about climate change in geography? His ministerial return, as secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, has prompted a wave of claims that Mr Gove tried to remove the teaching of climate change when he was in charge of the education department. ""This is a man who tried to stop young people in our schools learning about climate change, who tried to take it out of the geography curriculum,"" said Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party. On social media, these claims about climate change have been linked with pictures of Mr Gove's visit to the newly elected President Trump, as though their awkward thumbs up were evidence of some kind of global compact. But is there any substance to the claims? Anyone taking geography GCSEs or A-levels this summer will wonder what the row is about, because pupils will have been grilled - probably the wrong word - about climate change and global warming. And there are plenty of references to climate change in the national curriculum for younger years. But the row about ""climate change denial"" goes back to a controversial rewriting of the geography curriculum when Mr Gove was education secretary. In a draft version, climate change was conspicuous by its absence, prompting a wave of petitions and lobbying demands for its re-inclusion. And when the final version was produced, climate change had been reinstated. But instead of ending the argument, there was still a lingering fog of claims about political attempts to stifle the subject. And the Department for Education had to publish a statement denying that climate change had been removed. Smog in Beijing: Should schools teach the science without reference to climate change? But what really happened? People who were close to Mr Gove during this time say that the climate change allegations have taken on a life of their own, a Westminster version of an urban myth, without any foundation. They say it's a complete misreading of what happened - and that rather than downplaying the teaching of climate change, it was to be bolstered by moving it to science. And in the end, after a consultation, Mr Gove took the decision to keep teaching it as part of geography. Another source said that climate change ended up being taught in geography and in science, so it hadn't been cut - so it was a meaningless row. But there are also different versions of events. Another very senior figure, close to the curriculum reforms, said that shifting climate change into science might have been the ""formal"" argument. But they suggest that there was also an ""instinctive"" distrust of the topic, with lessons about climate change seen as having an underlying, politically driven agenda. This became a political ""tussle"", it's claimed. Another person involved in the rewriting of the geography curriculum remembers ministerial interventions and political horse-trading. They describe attempts not to ""stress the human causes"" of climate change as an attempt to placate the ""right wing of the Conservative party"". Mr Gove was described as wanting to make specific changes to the wording. It was World Environment Day last week: Rising sea levels in Indonesia This was the era of the coalition government - and it is claimed that the row was resolved behind the scenes after the intervention of the Department for Energy and Climate Change. It was also suggested that ""Nick Clegg was deployed"" - as the deputy prime minister was sometimes involved with such departmental disagreements. Although Mr Gove might have become the lightning rod in this row, it's worth noting that much of the controversial coverage about cutting climate change from geography was not about Mr Gove at all. Tim Oates, who chaired the panel reviewing the national curriculum, argued it should be about core scientific knowledge, rather than issues, such as climate change, that might stem from that. Such topics should be left to teachers to decide to teach rather than be prescribed, he said. This had prompted reports that climate change ""propaganda"" was going to be dropped. In a statement on Monday, Mr Oates said there had been ""a lot of knee-jerk reaction and misunderstanding in media reports at the time"". ""The debate the national curriculum panel had was not over whether children should understand climate science - I believe that they should. ""The debate was about what fundamental concepts they needed to learn at an early age in order to understand climate science."" ""I am not a 'climate change denier' and I never have been,"" said Mr Oates. There are other arguments underlying all this. Should ministers, political figures moving in and out of departments, really get involved in the detail of what pupils are taught? Or should this be the domain of subject specialists and education professionals? And the school climate has changed too. Academies do not have to follow the national curriculum - so for most secondary schools, such requirements no longer even apply. A spokesman for Mr Gove's new department, Defra, said: ""The secretary of state wanted to enhance climate change in the national curriculum when he was education secretary. It was never his intention to remove it.""

"Facebook has yet to comment on the death sentence A man accused of posting blasphemous content to Facebook has been sentenced to death by a court in Pakistan. Taimoor Raza was convicted after allegedly posting remarks about the Prophet Muhammad, his wives and companions within the site's comments. The public prosecutor involved said he believed it was the first time the death penalty had been awarded in a case related to social media. Human rights campaigners have expressed concern. Facebook itself has yet to comment on the case. The US firm previously announced in March that it was deploying a team to Pakistan to address the government's concerns about blasphemous content on its service, but added that it still wished to protect ""the privacy and rights"" of its members. Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has described blasphemy as being an ""unpardonable offence"". Raza's case was heard by an anti-terrorism court in Bahawalpur - about 309 miles (498km) from the capital Islamabad. His defence lawyer said the 30-year-old had become involved in an argument about Islam on the social network with someone who had turned out to be a counter-terrorism official. The public prosecutor said the accused had been arrested after playing hate speech and blasphemous material from his phone at a bus stop, following which his handset had been confiscated and analysed. Raza will be able to appeal against the death penalty at Lahore High Court and then, if required, in Pakistan's Supreme Court. The Express Tribune, a local newspaper,reported that the verdict,externalcame days after a college professor was refused bail in another case involving accusations of blasphemy on social media in Pakistan. Amnesty International recently published a report critical ofthe country's blasphemy laws,external. Its Pakistan campaigner, Nadia Rahman, has called for Raza's immediate release. ""Convicting and sentencing someone to death for allegedly posting blasphemous material online is a violation of international human rights law and sets a dangerous precedent,"" she told the BBC. ""No one should be hauled before an anti-terrorism court or any other court solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief online."" There were anti-Facebook protests in 2010 after a competition to draw the Prophet Muhammad The developments come seven years after a Pakistan court temporarily blocked local access to Facebook after the social network was used to promote a contest to draw images of Prophet Muhammad - an act considered to be offensive by many Muslims. This is a dramatic time for Pakistani social media. Once considered a platform where people could express themselves freely, it is now a place where people worry about the consequences of commenting. Instead of acting to restore confidence and safeguarding the masses' right to freedom of expression, the government has been busy making threats through TV and newspaper adverts. This is happening with a clear understanding about the gravity that accusations of blasphemy can have. There have been several incidents of vigilantes taking the law into their own hands after such claims. Human rights activists accuse the government of pushing through a controversial cyber-crimes law without addressing their concerns. In a country where fewer people have been convicted of blasphemy than have been killed after being accused of the offence, this ruling will not calm nerves. And increasingly people prefer to use chat apps and closed groups to post content so that their thoughts cannot be seen by the wider public. Lynched for blasphemy in Pakistan.

"Mr Trump's travel ban has led to protests A US appeals court has upheld a decision blocking President Donald Trump's revised ""travel ban"" on people from six mainly Muslim nations. Ruling on a case brought by the state of Hawaii, the appeal judges found that the executive order violated existing immigration legislation. It is a further legal setback for the president's efforts to get the ban he promised his supporters. Mr Trump criticised the San Francisco-based court's ruling. ""Well, as predicted, the 9th Circuit did it again - Ruled against the TRAVEL BAN at such a dangerous time in the history of our country,"" he tweeted. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he disagreed with the ruling. ""President Trump's executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe."" He added: ""Recent attacks confirm that the threat to our nation is immediate and real."" The dispute may end up being decided in the US Supreme Court. Mr Trump's owntweet,externalfrom 5 June was cited in the judges' ruling. An earlier version of the travel ban, issued by Mr Trump just days after taking office, sparked confusion at airports and protests. In the revised executive order, the 90-day ban was to apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also called for a 120-day ban on all refugees, but removed references to religious minorities. During his election campaign, Mr Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"". Reacting to the latest ruling, White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the executive order, saying: ""We need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence."" ""We continue to be confident that the president's executive order to protect this country is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the Supreme Court,"" Mr Spicer added. President Trump signed an executive order on 27 January, suddenly introducing a series of immigration measures, including a ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations Nationwide protests followed, before the order was halted seven days later by a federal judge in Seattle On 9 February appeal court judges upheld the Seattle ruling The presidentsigned a new executive order on 6 March, including many of the provisions of the first order but no longer including Iraq, lifting the indefinite ban on all Syrian refugees, and clarifying the situation for green card holders On 16 March federal judges in Hawaii and Marylandblocked the revised executive orderin separate rulings, just hours before it was due to come into force A federal appeals courtupheld the Maryland court's rulingon 26 May The White Housefiled two emergency applications with the US Supreme Courton 2 June to seek to overturn lower court rulings On 12 June appeal court judges upheld the Hawaii ruling The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals was reviewing a March ruling by a Hawaii-based federal judge that blocked parts of Mr Trump's order. In theirruling,external, the judges said that ""immigration, even for the president, is not a one-person show"". Mr Trump's travel bans have sparked protests and multiple court hearings They said Mr Trump had failed to show that the entry of people from the six countries mentioned in the ban, as well as the refugees, would be detrimental to US interests. Five questions about the revised executive order WATCH: Why did a US veteran give a stranger his Purple Heart? But the judges said the government was allowed to review the vetting process for people entering the US - something the earlier Hawaii ruling had blocked. Mr Trump has repeatedly said that the ban is necessary to protect Americans from terrorism. Significant recent attacks in the US were not committed by citizens of any other of the six countries named in the order. The legal ruling comes on the first anniversary of the Orlando nightclub shooting, in which a US citizen shot dead 49 people at a Florida nightclub. It was the worst mass shooting in US history. This ruling is bad news for the White House but it could have been worse. The appeal court in San Francisco did uphold the ban on the ban - but it declined to take a position on whether or not President Trump's executive order breached the US constitution. In fact the three appeal court judges scolded the federal district court in Hawaii, whose ruling they were considering, for failing to heed the judicial principle that ""courts should be extremely careful not to issue unnecessary constitutional rulings"". The lower court had concluded, among other things, that the president's executive order was driven by ""religious animus"" and was intended to discriminate about Muslims. That was improper, said the federal judges in California, because the order could actually be dismissed on a statutory rather than a constitutional basis. In particular, they argued, the order exceeded the scope of the president's ""broad authority to suspend the entry of aliens or classes of aliens"" because the administration had failed to prove that banning more than 180 million people from entry based on their national origin would not be detrimental to US interests. In other words, the appeal court concluded that the president was required by law to prove his case for the ban and failed to do so. His lawyers may now get another shot in front of the Supreme Court although it is not certain that the justices will actually decide to hear the case.

"The Queen's Speech will not be taking place, as planned, on 19 June Ministers say they do not know if the Queen's Speech can be delivered on time because of post-election talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party. The set-piece event is scheduled to take place on Monday 19 June. Earlier, sources said it would be delayed - but First Secretary of State Damian Green said he ""can't confirm anything yet"". Labour said the government was ""in chaos"". Mrs May is meeting her backbench MPs for the first time since losing the Tories' majority in Thursday's general election. BBC Election Live - rolling text and video updates A guide to what's happening Mark Mardell: May a 'prisoner' of No 10 The Queen's Speech is written by the government and presents an outline of its planned legislation for the next Parliamentary session. Mr Green cited the ongoing negotiations with the DUP when he was asked if next Monday's speech had been delayed. ""I can't confirm anything yet until we know the final details of the agreement,"" he said. ""We know those talks are going well and also we know that, at this very important time, we want to produce a substantial Queen's Speech."" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was an ""ambiguity"" about both what would go in it - with several manifesto pledges expected to be watered down or dropped - but also the need for the Tories to ""nail down"" DUP support. Theresa May has chaired her first meeting of cabinet colleagues since the election A defeat for its Queen's Speech would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the new minority government, he said. One of the reasons for the delay is also believed to be because the speech has to be written on goat's skin parchment, which takes a few days to dry - and the Tory negotiations with the DUP mean it cannot be ready in time. Although it is rare for a Queen's Speech to be delayed, when the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition government in 2010, it did not take place until 20 days after the general election while in 1992 nearly a month elapsed between polling day and the government announcing its new programme. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: ""This is an utter humiliation for Theresa May. It is time to stop trying to cling to power and time to admit enough is enough."" What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Why does the UK print its laws on goat-skin? Meanwhile, the backbench 1922 Committee is expected to raise concerns about the PM's leadership style, and press for more details on talks with the DUP. The committee is made up of all Conservative backbenchers - the name is taken from the year in which its original members were elected. Its primary function is to keep the leadership of the party informed of the mood among the rank and file, and if a Conservative leader or other senior figure loses its support they could be in a particularly vulnerable position. This video can not be played Mrs May will be meeting the committee a day after announcing her cabinet. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn ""ready any time"" for another election Mrs May's new cabinet also met for the first time after a reshuffle. Earlier Brexit Secretary David Davis predicted some parts of the Tory manifesto would have to be ""pruned"" following the election result. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davis said that while the Tory election campaign had been disappointing, Mrs May was a ""formidable prime minister"" and accused people speculating about her leadership of ""the absolute height of self-indulgence"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused Mrs May of ""squatting"" in No 10, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the country ""cannot go on with a period of great instability"". On Sunday evening the PM finalised her cabinet with a small reshuffle, with Michael Gove returning to a ministerial role as environment secretary. Mr Gove, who took on Mrs May for the party leadership after David Cameron quit, was sacked by the PM in her reshuffle in July last year.

Mr Green, who was work and pensions secretary, was promoted to become the first secretary of state - effectively Mrs May's second in command. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Widespread demands for Mrs May to go are not expected at Monday's 1922 Committee meeting. Instead, there will be demands for her to consult more, including meeting regularly with the 1922 executive, and to turn Downing Street from a bunker into an open house by broadening her range of staff. However, few MPs expect her position to be strong and stable for the next five years. One senior backbencher told me: ""It is inconceivable she will lead the party into the next election.

"Don't be fooled out of seeing the big picture. This is not politics as normal. The carefully constructed house of cards has been swept away. It is politics more chaotic, more brutal than any thriller. The Conservative Party has a reputation for ruthlessness - getting rid of even much loved leaders when they are no longer a tool to maintaining the party's rule. The defenestration of their idol Margaret Thatcher was a sign of that. But this is far more cruel, a breathtakingly savage lesson in the exercise of power. Mrs May has been broken on the electoral wheel but is forced to stand on splintered limbs, grimacing through the pain, for the sake of her party's chance to cling to office. She is like a medieval monarch, captured by her barons, shorn of the advisers she loved and trusted, allowed one old close friend to minister cold comfort. The government is stable as a two-legged stool, and she is sapped of strength, weakened by the demands of her colleagues. The new cabinet's first meeting today I have spoken to no Conservative who thinks she can last more than two years - many say six months, some a few days. What's worse, they openly admit they don't know how long she can cling on, or what would be the trigger that pulls the trap. I suspect she is still there out of agonising duty, not arrogant ambition. Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps Mrs May thinks if she can hold on for 18 months, change her style of government, do a good Brexit deal, she can win the next election whenever it comes. Weirder things have happened. But that's only true because so many weird things have happened recently. When it's rained fishes and then frogs, it's an unwise seer who tells you cats and dogs won't follow. But such self-belief and self-confident resolution would be almost superhuman in the face of such a savage surprise as the election result. BBC Election Live - rolling text and video updates A guide to what's happening After days of chatting to senior politicians, the best comment I heard was a question asked by a highly sophisticated operator and veteran of many cabinets: ""Who's her jailer?"" The answer is the senior members of the cabinet and the influential 1922 committee of backbenchers, all desperate to avoid an immediate election and wanting a Queen's Speech and the start to Brexit talks. No-one else wants the job quite yet. But on the other hand, no-one wanted the chaotic farce following David Cameron's exit that produced this situation. July 2016: David Cameron's departure from Downing Street People need time to draw breath - a few weeks, a few months, a few days. Many prime ministers begin as barely more than first among equals and end as dictators. Mrs May began her time in No 10  contemptuous of colleagues, ruling as an arrogant autocrat. Now, she is just the figurehead on the good ship Tory Resolution. Don't blame Lynton Crosby, Nick Timothy or Fiona Hill, or those, such as David Davis, who advised her to go for an election. It was eminently sensible, given the state of the polls and the Labour Party. The failure was her failure. She wasn't up to the campaign, did not live up to her role in the heroic narrative. There's a hugely important practical impact to this diminishment. Any minority government is hostage to the whim of MPs. There is a popular belief that the whips do their job by bullying and threatening exposure of sexual and financial peccadilloes. In fact, it is blandishments and bribes that do the job. Without a majority, any vote can turn into an auction, with the most truculent MPs bidding high in their own little causes, whether demanding more protection for hedgehogs or a new roundabout for the constituency. This is much magnified when the prime minister herself is so exposed. The most important impact is on Brexit. Theresa May called for a bigger mandate to get a better deal. It's worth reading her exact words again. Taken literally, she will now get a worse one. It is reported the chancellor told her, in a cold early defeat conversation, that he wants a ""business-first Brexit"". The Scottish leader Ruth Davidsontold her to ""prioritise the economy"",external. The former Conservative cabinet minister Stephen Dorrell is no longer in Parliament but has said there should be""day-by-day"" scrutiny to avoid a hard Brexit.,external Jeremy Corbyn sayshe wants a ""jobs first Brexit"",external. The DUPdon't agree that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"",external. There is talk of a cross-party alliance to press for a softer Brexit. On the whole, that's code for dropping immigration down the priority list. Intriguingly, Lord Heseltine has suggested a deal might be done with France and Germany on freedom of movement, although he didn't suggest what it might be. Lord Heseltine On the other side, the right-wing newspapers and determined hard-line leavers in the Conservative Party will be just as jealously protecting their Brexit from such compromise. When a US president comes to the end of their term, they are often described as a lame duck, with little authority, because their power and patronage have a clear cut-off point - better currying favour with the next fellow. The same was said of David Cameron when he announced he wouldn't serve a full term. It is only partially true in those cases. But when a prime minister is on probation, when the question is ""When?"" not ""If?"" it will be much harder for her to broker deals and stick to her guns. You could argue she has little to lose - but if she fails, the government might fall and an election looms. That's quite a bit of pressure. We have learned again and again that political will counts for more than the traditional pundit's logic. Mrs May could take comfort from St Paul's letter to the Corinthians, find her ""strength is made perfect in weakness"" and emerge anew a figure of substance. But, for now, she makes the proverbial limping wildfowl look strong and stable.

"The UK's law is on scrolls. In a tower After a reprieve, the UK is to continue printing and storing its laws on vellum, made from calf or goat-skin. But shouldn't these traditions give way to digital storage, asks Chris Stokel-Walker. Last week the House of Lords decided to end the printing of laws on vellum for cost reasons. But now the Cabinet Office is to provide the money from its own budget for the thousand-year-old tradition to continue. Vellum lasts a long time. Dig into the archives of the UK's parliament and pull out the oldest extant law and you'll find a very old document. It was first inscribed in 1497. Over time, ordinary paper can deteriorate rapidly, while vellum is said to retain its integrity for much longer. Original copies of the Magna Carta, signed more than 800 years ago on vellum, still exist. The Brudenell Magna Carta, document on vellum, dated 12 October 1297 The proposed change was a move to higher-quality archival paper. But are politicians missing the point? Sharon McMeekin, of the Digital Preservation Coalition, an advocacy and advice group for digital recordkeeping, thinks so. ""People have been bemoaning the loss of history by changing to archival paper,"" she explains. ""I think people are missing the point there. Truly representing the context and history in which these records were made require them to be kept in a digital format. It's more representative of the technologies and communication methods used today."" So why in the digital age do we keep physical records of documents at all? There's a simple answer, says Adrian Brown, the director of parliamentary archives, who oversees a collection including 8km-worth of physical records of parchment, paper and photographs in the 325ft tall Victoria Tower at the western edge of the Palace of Westminster. In the tower, scrolls of vellum are piled up in a vast repository, spooled in a range of different sizes, looking superficially much as they would have done hundreds of years ago. ""We simply respond to the way parliament chooses to create its records,"" Brown says. ""In this case those are still going to be physical - though the proportion that is digital will increase over time."" But there are other reasons, too. ""In many circles there's still a real discomfort around digital archiving, and a lack of belief that digital can survive into the future,"" explains Jenny Mitcham, digital archivist at the Borthwick Institute for Archives at the University of York. The whole concept of digital storage is a relatively new innovation, and the path by which it could survive through the years is not clear. ""We don't have the ability to look back and say we know for a fact in 200 years time we'll still have this stuff,"" reasons Mitcham. ""We can't prove that fact without a time machine."" Vellum is made from calf-skin. The word shares its derivation with the word ""veal"" from the old French ""velin"" (Collins Dictionary) or ""veelin"" (Petit Robert). Vellum is made by first soaking calf-skin in a lime wash, says calligrapher and illuminator Patricia Lovett. The lime causes the hair follicles to expand, making it easier to scrape fat and fur from the skin. This is done with a curved-bladed knife called a ""scudder"". The prepared skin is then washed and stretched onto a wooden frame, and scraped further with a lunar knife to raise the nap and create a more even thickness. Finally the skin is left to dry; the length of time depends on the ambient temperature, humidity and the individual qualities of the skin. Patricia Lovett, calligrapher,external Watch vellum being made on BBC 4'sIlluminations: The Private Lives of Medieval Kings There's an excellent example of how a digital archive can quickly run into problems. Between 1984-86 the BBC Domesday Project engaged more than a million people from around Britain. Children at more than 9,000 schools helped compile a statistical survey, personal thoughts and memories. The data was stored on special laserdiscs, then seen as a technology of the future. Nearly two decades later, there were virtually no extant disc players able to read the specially formatted discs. After a lot of work, the data was made readable, but the case for digital archiving had suffered a setback. ""Examples like that imply that digital is more fragile than physical,"" Mitcham laments. Mike Tibbetts, one of the two creators of the Domesday Project,wrote in 2008,externalthat ""the fault in all this lies not in the lack of vision or foresight by the technologists but that, at least in the UK, the national systems of data preservation and heritage archiving simply don't work reliably or consistently."" This is the issue, according to Jenny Mitcham. Just as preserving a physical archive requires careful consideration of temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure to prevent paper from turning brittle and breaking, so digital archives need to be tended to. ""There's certainly truth in the fact that if [a] digital [format] is neglected, it'll become obsolete,"" she says. ""But if it's brought into a digital archive, and that digital archive is well set up and knows what it's doing, migrating and actively managing files over time, the chances those files will be readable in the future are vastly improved."" Adrian Brown lists the difficulties in maintaining paper records - ""decay, chemical changes that happen in the physical items; you've got insects and animal damage; the effects of temperature and light and humidity and dust. Tearing, rubbing, those kinds of issues."" But with digital, there are different risks. ""One of the things about digital information is that it's not fundamentally human-readable,"" he explains. ""You need some kind of technology to turn it into something understandable. Technology as we know changes very rapidly; what you can find is your way of turning those 1s and 0s into meaningful information can be threatened if you don't take precautions."" Lee Mapley of William Cowley Parchment Works works on a sheet of vellum And, as anyone who has lost beloved holiday snaps to a hard drive failure knows, IT systems are far from infallible. ""With digital, the last thing you want to do is put it somewhere and leave it alone,"" Mitcham says. ""There are things you need to do over time to make sure everything's OK with it."" Documents are migrated from one file format to another as old versions of applications become outdated. It's also necessary to check information hasn't been lost in the transition. Backup copies are continuously made, and placed in different locations. Checksums, a process to make sure errors have not wormed their way into files, are run weekly. So archives are indeed moving from pieces of paper to bits and bytes. The British Library keep a physical copy of every book, magazine and newspaper printed in the United Kingdom as part of the principle of ""legal deposit"", a law which has existed since 1662. But since 2013, electronic records of websites, blogs, CDs and electronic journals have also come under the catchment of the legal deposit law. Advocates point out digital records have their advantages over paper documents. Metadata associated with electronic files can give an insight into the messy creation of a work, rather than a polished final document. It's sometimes possible to view how long someone spent typing up a record, and even to see what they changed between drafts. And just as with 500-year-old vellum, there's history in our hard drives, too. ""I get excited by digital archaeology,"" Mitcham admits. ""If you find a pile of 5Â¼ inch floppy disks, I get a buzz out of that. Being able to find out what's on those discs, look through old Wordstar files, and get an idea for how computing has moved on through time, that's fascinating.""

The committee is made up of all Conservative backbenchers - the name is taken from the year in which its original members were elected. Its primary function is to keep the leadership of the party informed of the mood among the rank and file, and if a Conservative leader or other senior figure loses its support they could be in a particularly vulnerable position. This video can not be played Mrs May will be meeting the committee a day after announcing her cabinet. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn ""ready any time"" for another election Mrs May's new cabinet also met for the first time after a reshuffle. Earlier Brexit Secretary David Davis predicted some parts of the Tory manifesto would have to be ""pruned"" following the election result. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davis said that while the Tory election campaign had been disappointing, Mrs May was a ""formidable prime minister"" and accused people speculating about her leadership of ""the absolute height of self-indulgence"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused Mrs May of ""squatting"" in No 10, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the country ""cannot go on with a period of great instability"". On Sunday evening the PM finalised her cabinet with a small reshuffle, with Michael Gove returning to a ministerial role as environment secretary. Mr Gove, who took on Mrs May for the party leadership after David Cameron quit, was sacked by the PM in her reshuffle in July last year. This video can not be played The Brexit secretary tells Today the government has made a contingency plan for ""no deal"" Brexit A number of high-profile members kept their posts in the reshuffle, with Philip Hammond staying at the Treasury, Boris Johnson remaining at the Foreign Office and Amber Rudd keeping the Home Office brief. But some changed jobs too, with Liz Truss being demoted from justice secretary to become chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Green, who was work and pensions secretary, was promoted to become the first secretary of state - effectively Mrs May's second in command. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Widespread demands for Mrs May to go are not expected at Monday's 1922 Committee meeting. Instead, there will be demands for her to consult more, including meeting regularly with the 1922 executive, and to turn Downing Street from a bunker into an open house by broadening her range of staff. However, few MPs expect her position to be strong and stable for the next five years. One senior backbencher told me: ""It is inconceivable she will lead the party into the next election. Her authority has been diminished unquestionably."" Another said: ""Party members have been too bruised by her."" ""She has bought herself some time"", said another senior backbencher, but added: ""How she behaves will determine how long she's there."" There is a feeling that the party is holding on to nurse for fear of something worse. Read more from Iain Watson here. After speculation in the Sunday newspapers that he was mounting a leadership challenge, Mr Johnson has called for Tory MPs to back Mrs May. Writing in Monday's Sun,external, the foreign secretary said those calling for the PM to step down should ""get a grip"", adding the electorate wanted the government to ""get on with the job"". Mr Johnson has denied plans to try to take over from Mrs May Mr Johnson admitted the prime minister's election campaign did not go well - ""to put it mildly"" - and that Tory messages ""got lost or misunderstood"". But he added: ""Theresa May led a campaign that inspired 13.7m people to vote Conservative, in the biggest total tally of Tory votes since the days of Margaret Thatcher. ""That is a stunning achievement, for which she deserves the support of her party. And she will certainly get it from me."" Who are the DUP? How will this minority government actually work? He also said the proposal of a deal with the DUP to keep her minority government in power was ""feasible"". ""The people of Britain have had a bellyful of promises and politicking,"" he wrote. ""Now is the time for delivery - and Theresa May is the right person to continue that vital work."" The return of Mr Gove to the front bench as environment secretary has been a shock to some, including the politician himself. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, he said he had been ""quite surprised"" to be asked to rejoin the cabinet. He added: ""Of course I knew that today was reshuffle day, but I genuinely didn't expect this role - although I am delighted to be part of the government, and delighted to be able to support Theresa."" Mr Gove is returning to cabinet after being fired by Mrs May last year However, the BBC's environment analyst Roger Harrabin said green campaigners were angry at Mr Gove's appointment, pointing to his time as education secretary, when he tried to remove climate change from the geography curriculum, and as chief whip, when he reportedly blocked the then environment secretary from important international talks. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: ""It is hard to think of many politicians as ill equipped for the role of environment secretary as Michael Gove."" But others have welcomed the new minister. One senior farming industry source said they were happy that a ""big hitter"" was taking the top job at the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra). ""Defra has long been a backwater, so at last it's not someone in charge who is being put out to grass,"" he said. Mr Gove promised to ""protect our precious environment"" in his new role.

"Yachting crew members James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin all died The father of one of four men who died when a yacht capsized in the Atlantic has described to a court the moment he learnt his son was lost at sea. James Male and crewmates Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin died when the Cheeki Rafiki capsized in May 2014. Graham Male described the discovery of the yacht and life raft as ""harrowing"". Yacht manager Douglas Innes, who is accused of failing to get the vessel checked, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. Mr Innes, 42, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, and his company, Stormforce Coaching, both deny failing to operate the yacht in a safe manner. Winchester Crown Court heard James Male had been an unpaid intern for Stormforce Coaching and had flown to Antigua to crew the yacht before sailing it back to Southampton. The overturned hull of the Cheeki Rafiki after it was discovered by a US Navy warship east of Cape Cod His father said Mr Innes telephoned to say the boat was in difficulty but appeared ""perfectly calm"" and said ""there was no panic on board"". When the yacht was found, Mr Male was sent a photograph of the upturned vessel with the life raft intact. He said: ""It was surreal, just seeing that life raft, I just couldn't believe it. I remember saying, I have seen enough. It was harrowing... ""I knew as soon as I saw that life raft in there."" Mr Male said he had concerns over Stormforce Coaching's equipment in the UK because his son used a ""multi-tool"" for work. He said he had paid for his son's flight to Antigua. Skipper Mr Bridge, 22, from Farnham, Surrey, Mr Male, 22, from Romsey, Hampshire, Mr Warren, 52, from Bridgwater, Somerset, and Mr Goslin, 56, from West Camel, Somerset, died after the yacht lost its keel 700 miles off Nova Scotia, Canada.

"Ruth Davidson has led the Scottish Conservatives to a hat-trick of electoral successes in just over a year Ruth Davidson has just led the Scottish Conservatives to their best result in a Westminster election since 1983, and has appeared among the bookies' favourites to succeed Theresa May as Tory leader. But who is she? The 38-year-old has only been a Conservative Party member since 2009, and an MSP and Scottish Tory leader since 2011 - but she has already turned the party's fortunes around almost entirely. Without her Scottish Tories gaining 12 seats north of the border on 8 June, Mrs May would not be forming a government right now. George Osborne called her the ""heroine"" of the election for the Conservatives. General election results - the fallout continues Find out who won in your constituency In a country where the party has been a toxic brand since the days of Margaret Thatcher, this is a truly remarkable turnaround. And the Westminster vote is just the latest in a speedy hat-trick of electoral successes for Ms Davidson. She has delivered huge improvements for her party in Scottish Parliament andlocal authority electionsin 2016 and 2017 respectively, leapfrogging Labour into second place in both polls. And now, with her star shining more brightly than ever, she appears intent on wielding influence at Westminster - over Brexit in particular. Ruth Davidson's Scottish Tory MPs could make the difference for the party at Westminster Born in Edinburgh and raised in the Borders and Fife, she studied at Edinburgh University before pursuing a career as a journalist. She worked at Kingdom FM in Fife, before moving to BBC Scotland in Glasgow in 2002. She was not particularly political in her youth, but once she did join the Conservative Party - in 2009, after leaving the BBC to study International Development at Glasgow University - her rise was a rapid one. She stood unsuccessfully in Glasgow North East twice in quick succession, ina by-election in 2009,externaland then in the 2010 general election. She worked for a time as an aide to then Scottish Tory leader Annabel Goldie. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Ms Davidson then ran in the Glasgow Kelvin constituency. She finished a distant fourth, but was elected to Holyrood via the regional top-up list system - having been promoted to the top of the list only after Malcolm Macaskillstood down. Ms Davidson is an energetic campaigner The new MSP was provided with an immediate opportunity for further advancement. After the election, which saw the Tories drop two seats as Alex Salmond's SNP surged to an unprecedented majority,Annabel Goldie resigned. Ms Davidson, then aged 32, was one of four candidates for the job. Her most prominent opponent was Murdo Fraser, an MSP and fan of federalism whoproposed splitting the Scottish group offfrom the UK party as a new fully autonomous party. He had the backing of a number of MSPs, as well as a pair of former Scottish secretaries in Malcolm Rifkind and Peter Duncan, while his federalism proposal was backed by Tory figures including Michael Gove, Norman Tebbit and Daniel Hannan. Ms Davidson, meanwhile, was endorsed by Scotland Office Minister (and later Scottish Secretary) David Mundell, as well as a handful of MSPs and peers. The election was run using the single transferrable vote system and saw Ms Davidson take 40% of first-preference votes to Mr Fraser's 36.9%. After a second round of counting, she wasdeclared the winner in November 2011. This video can not be played Ruth Davidson tells the BBC that she offers ""the generational change that our party has been looking for"" The 2014 Scottish independence referendum was where the Tory revival really began. Ms Davidson was part of the Better Together campaign during the poll, which finished with the No side winning by 55% to 45%. In the aftermath, as the SNP surged and Labour collapsed, she shaped her party firmly as the defenders of the Union, seeking to sweep up support from the 55%. There wasn't an immediate bounce - in the 2015 general election it was the SNP who dominated,winning 56 of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats. The Conservatives took one - but they were starting from a very low base, having won at best a single seat in each contest since 1992. Ms Davidson has a fondness for a wacky photocall Ruth Davidson is an energetic campaigner, up for most things, including a shot at playing the bagpipes But with the issue of the union continuing to play a major role in Scottish politics, Ms Davidson's strategy was to pay off in style in the 2016 Holyrood elections. Ahead of the poll, Ms Davidson announced she wasswitching constituency, from Glasgow to Edinburgh. A politician known as an energetic campaigner, she was often the subject of colourful photo opportunities - including standing astride a tank flying a union jack flag. For the 2016 campaign she rode a buffalo, played ice hockey, pulled countless pints and drove everything from a racing car to a crane to a snowmobile. Not only did she score an unexpectedvictory in Edinburgh Central, gaining the seat from the SNP, her Toriesleapfrogged Labour into second place. They captured 31 seats, more than doubling their previous total, with Labour dropping to 24. The SNP lost their overall majority, but remained by far the largest party. The binary issue of independence had turned Scottish politics into a two-horse race - and with the Tories dominating the pro-Union side of the debate, they largely squeezed Labour out of contention. Ruth Davidson was a leading voice in the Remain campaign across the UK This left Ms Davidson as the main sparring partner for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at weekly question sessions, giving her a new platform. While defence of the union and opposition to a second independence referendum remained at the core of the Scottish Tory approach, Ms Davidson broadened her attacks to focus on education in particular. With the SNP heading into its tenth year in government, the Tories were able to effectively campaign as an anti-establishment force in Scotland, despite also being in power at Westminster. Hot on the heels of the Holyrood election though was the EU referendum - and here, Ms Davidson found herself on the same side as Ms Sturgeon. The two women became leading voices in the Remain campaign, with Ms Davidson putting in a typically muscular performance whilerepeatedly clashing with Boris Johnsonin a TV debate days before the vote. This video can not be played EU Referendum: Davidson and Johnson close Great Debate The result was a disappointment to the Scottish Tory leader - but she adapted, positioning herself on the soft-Brexit wing of the ensuing debate, continuing toadvocate single market access. In the subsequent Conservative leadership contest, triggered by the resignation of David Cameron, some called for Ms Davidson to seek a move to Westminster. She ruled that out -""for now"",external- saying that she had a ""pretty bloody big job"" in Scotland, instead endorsing the candidacy of Theresa May. She has eye on a different prize - becoming First Minister of Scotland in 2021. Ms Davidson gets a weekly chance to grill Nicola Sturgeon as leader of the largest opposition party at Holyrood However, that is not to say she is taking no interest in Westminster politics. The morning after the election, as Mrs May drew criticism for barely mentioning the result as she grimaced for the cameras outside Downing Street, Ms Davidson was making a speech rallying the troops. She conceded that the party hadn't lived up to expectations UK-wide, was magnanimous towards her opponents and talked of building consensus. Significantly, she also laid out some policy ideas about an ""open Brexit"", prioritising protecting business. And as Mrs May discussed a deal with the DUP, Ms Davidson confirmed she had spoken to the prime ministerseeking assurancesthat any agreement wouldn't impact on LGBTI rights. There is a plurality of views on Brexit and other issues among the 13 Scottish Conservative MPs, but all are loyal to Ms Davidson. In a parliament of razor-thin margins, she now wields considerable influence over the future direction of the UK government. Ruth Davidson got engaged to Jen Wilson in 2016 - but they delayed their wedding to pay vet's bills after their dog was hit by a car Outside of politics, Ms Davidson was quickly marked out as not being a ""typical"" Tory - often being referred to instead as a ""kickboxing lesbian"". She lives in Edinburgh with her partner Jen Wilson and their cocker spaniel, also called Wilson, who was hit by a car in 2016, leading the coupleto postpone their wedding,externalto pay for his care. She has referred to LGBTI rights as one thing she cares about more than her party - the other being her country. She is also a member of the Church of Scotland. Ms Davidson has built herself a profile on national television, appearing as a panellist on programmes includingHave I Got News For YouandThe Great British Bakeoff: Extra Slice. She has a keen interest in sport - her father was a former Partick Thistle player - and supports Dunfermline Athletic. She was a member of the Territorial Army, before a back injury forced her to withdraw. She has appeared on Have I got News for You Having turned Tory fortunes around in Scotland on each of the electoral fronts - in the country's councils, at Holyrood and at Westminster - some are now asking what comes next for Ms Davidson. From here, things only get harder. When she came along, the party was more or less at rock bottom. Expectation levels were near zero. But now, established as the second force in Scottish politics, the pressure is greater. In future her troops will have to defend the seats they hold as well as fighting to make gains. The party still has a way to go to the next level, too - they may have climbed to the main opposition spot at Holyrood, but the SNP have more than double their number of seats. Bute House remains a distant prospect, for now. After all, if indyref2 really is ""dead"", as Ms Davidson posited on election night, what does it mean for a Tory revival founded centrally on that very issue? On the Unionist side, Labour are also looking buoyant, regaining seats lost to the SNP tide in Scotland and snapping at Mrs May's heels at Westminster. The Lib Dems have also made gains. But it's fair to say that for now at least, Ms Davidson has momentum on her side. She also relishes any kind of challenge. As she told activists ahead of the snap election: ""It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog.""

"There has been a sharp drop in nurses registering to work in the UK since the EU referendum, figures suggest. Last July, 1,304 nurses from the EU joined the Nursing and Midwifery Council register, compared to 46 in April this year, a fall of 96%. The Health Foundation said the findings could not be more stark and said they should act as a ""wake-up call"". But the NMC said the introduction of English language testing for EU nurses is also likely to have played a role. It comes as the NHS is already struggling with nurse vacancies and, without this supply line, shortages could get worse. In May, research by the Royal College of Nursing found one in nine posts in England was vacant. The union said it meant the NHS was 40,000 nurses short of what was needed. The figures - obtained by the Health Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act - cover the numbers applying to go on the register so they do not necessarily mean they are employed by the NHS. But they give an indication of the supply line from the EU which provides a significant proportion of the workforce. Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation, said the drop since the Brexit vote could not be more ""stark"". ""Without EU nurses, it will be even harder for the NHS and other employers to find the staff they need to provide safe patient care. ""The findings should be a wake-up call to politicians and health service leaders."" The NMC has also drawn attention to the introduction of English language tests, which were brought in for EU nurses for the first time in January 2016 - they were already in use for non-EU nurses. It normally takes a few months from being tested to making it on to the register so officials believe this could have also played a role in the drop in numbers. A Department of Health spokeswoman said EU nurses played a ""valued"" role in the NHS and they would be a priority in Brexit negotiations. But shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government was making a mess of things. ""Theresa May's weak and unstable government has pushed NHS services to the brink, and it is patients who will pay the price. ""Our health service has always relied on the contribution of overseas workers, yet these staff are being forced out by this government's neglect and disregard. ""The Tories are overseeing an unforgivable drain of talent out of our country, because of their chaotic attitude to the Brexit negotiations."" And Lib Dem health spokesman Norman Lamb added: ""These figures are profoundly worrying and the possible implications for the NHS and patients cannot be underestimated."" Overall there are 650,000 nurses on the register. Just over 36,000 of these have been trained in the EU, 5.5% of the total. Another 67,000 come from outside the EU with the rest from the UK.

"Stanley Gibbons, the 160-year-old rare stamp and collectables business, has put itself up for sale. The company has identified the Middle East and Asia as new markets for potential growth, but said expansion would require further investment. It said that it would therefore examine its options, which could include the sale of part or all of the business. The firm was set up by Edward Stanley Gibbons in 1856 and is the world's longest established rare stamp trader. It opened its first shop in 1891 on The Strand in London where it continues to trade from today. It also has overseas sites in Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also sells coins and antiques, but is best known for its rare stamps business. In April, it achieved a record for Indian stamps when a set of four featuring the portrait of Gandhi was sold for Â£500,000. The company said it had undergone a major restructuring recently and had cut costs by more than Â£10m. Commenting on exploring new global markets, Stanley Gibbons said: ""Unlocking this incremental long-term value is likely to require further investment and the directors believe that it is likely therefore that such value is best delivered either within a larger group or alongside a strategic investment."" On Friday, Stanley Gibbons said it had received an approach regarded as a possible offer by Disruptive Capital Finance. Disruptive is led by City financier Edi Truell, a former pensions adviser to Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London. On Monday, however, Disruptive said it was not making an offer for Stanley Gibbons. Disruptive said that on 31 May it had been informed by Stanley Gibbons ""that an email we had sent them was interpreted by them as an approach"" under the UK's Takeover rules. It added that it had been in discussions with Stanley Gibbons's management ""for some time"". Sfell 12.38% to 11.5p, after having jumped nearly 18% on Friday.

US talk show host Stephen Colbert also mocked Trump by suggesting his tenure as president ""could close early"". Dear Evan Hansen was named best musical at the New York ceremony. The show, about a teenager who fabricates a former friendship with a classmate who killed himself, also saw Pitch Perfect star Ben Platt named best actor in a musical. Bette Midler was named best leading actress in a musical Bette Midler received the female equivalent for her role in Hello, Dolly! and celebrated her second Tony win with a lengthy acceptance speech. ""Shut that crap off!"" the veteran comedienne snapped at one point when the orchestra tried to play her off the stage. Other awards went to Laurie Metcalf for her role in a newly written sequel to A Doll's House and to Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon for her supporting role in The Little Foxes. There was also an award for Briton Nigel Hook, who won best scenic design for the Broadway transfer of British production The Play That Goes Wrong.

He also appeared in character as House of Cards' Frank Underwood, with his on-screen wife Robin Wright beside him. But such comic flourishes went hand in hand with acceptance speeches that reflected America's politically charged climate. Spacey impersonated Bill Clinton during Sunday's ceremony Nixon's speech, in which she quoted directly from The Little Foxes playwright Lillian Hellman, was a case in point. ""Eighty years ago she wrote there are people who eat the earth and eat all the people on it, and other people who just stand around and watch them do it,"" she told the audience. ""My love, my gratitude and my undying respect go out to all the people in 2017 who are refusing to just stand and watch them do it."" Sunday's ceremony took placeshortly after newsthat Delta Air Lines and Bank of America had withdrawn financial support for a New York production of Julius Caesar. The contemporary staging of Shakespeare's play features an assassinated Caesar who resembles President Trump, a depiction Delta said had ""crossed the line on the standards of good taste"".

"The hole in the engine casing of the Airbus A330 was discovered shortly after take-off A China Eastern Airlines plane has had to turn back to Sydney airport after a technical failure which left a hole in an engine casing. Flight MU736 was heading from Sydney, Australia to Shanghai, but the pilot reported problems with the engine about one hour after taking off. Passengers, who had to spend the night in Sydney, told media they smelt something burning inside the aircraft. The Airbus A330 landed safely and there were no reports of injuries. Images circulating on social media,externalshowed a large hole in the engine casing. Several passengers said they had heard a loud sound coming from the left engine shortly after take-off. One passenger told Australia's Seven News network: ""All of a sudden we heard this noise... it kind of smelt like burning"". ""I was really scared. Our group was terrified."" This video can not be played Sydney passenger: 'All of a sudden the engine got really loud' One woman on the flight told news agency Reuters: ""The cabin crew went out and told us to fasten our seatbelts and tried to calm us down, but we were actually very panicked because we had no idea what was happening."" Passengers said the crew cleared the seats near the affected engine. China Eastern Airlines said in a statement to the media that the crew had ""observed the abnormal situation of the left engine and decided to return to Sydney airport immediately"". It added that all passengers would be placed on flights leaving on Monday.

Aviation expert Greg Waldron of consulting firm FlightGlobal told the BBC that it would be ""difficult to say at this early juncture what caused such extensive damage"" to the China Eastern plane. He said investigators would likely look at all possible factors and examine maintenance records of the aircraft and engine. ""They will also carefully assess whether a foreign object may have played a role in this,"" he said. The plane landed safely with no reports of injuries Last month, industry websites The Aviation Herald and Aero.de published pictures from social media appearing to show a similar hole in another aeroplane's engine casing. Mr Waldron added it would be ""too early"" to say whether the Sydney incident was linked to other cases, but it would be something investigators would consider.

"The Queen's Speech will not be taking place, as planned, on 19 June Ministers say they do not know if the Queen's Speech can be delivered on time because of post-election talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party. The set-piece event is scheduled to take place on Monday 19 June. Earlier, sources said it would be delayed - but First Secretary of State Damian Green said he ""can't confirm anything yet"". Labour said the government was ""in chaos"". Mrs May is meeting her backbench MPs for the first time since losing the Tories' majority in Thursday's general election. BBC Election Live - rolling text and video updates A guide to what's happening Mark Mardell: May a 'prisoner' of No 10 The Queen's Speech is written by the government and presents an outline of its planned legislation for the next Parliamentary session. Mr Green cited the ongoing negotiations with the DUP when he was asked if next Monday's speech had been delayed. ""I can't confirm anything yet until we know the final details of the agreement,"" he said. ""We know those talks are going well and also we know that, at this very important time, we want to produce a substantial Queen's Speech."" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was an ""ambiguity"" about both what would go in it - with several manifesto pledges expected to be watered down or dropped - but also the need for the Tories to ""nail down"" DUP support. Theresa May has chaired her first meeting of cabinet colleagues since the election A defeat for its Queen's Speech would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the new minority government, he said. One of the reasons for the delay is also believed to be because the speech has to be written on goat's skin parchment, which takes a few days to dry - and the Tory negotiations with the DUP mean it cannot be ready in time. Although it is rare for a Queen's Speech to be delayed, when the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition government in 2010, it did not take place until 20 days after the general election while in 1992 nearly a month elapsed between polling day and the government announcing its new programme. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: ""This is an utter humiliation for Theresa May. It is time to stop trying to cling to power and time to admit enough is enough."" What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Why does the UK print its laws on goat-skin? Meanwhile, the backbench 1922 Committee is expected to raise concerns about the PM's leadership style, and press for more details on talks with the DUP. The committee is made up of all Conservative backbenchers - the name is taken from the year in which its original members were elected. Its primary function is to keep the leadership of the party informed of the mood among the rank and file, and if a Conservative leader or other senior figure loses its support they could be in a particularly vulnerable position.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davis said that while the Tory election campaign had been disappointing, Mrs May was a ""formidable prime minister"" and accused people speculating about her leadership of ""the absolute height of self-indulgence"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused Mrs May of ""squatting"" in No 10, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the country ""cannot go on with a period of great instability"". On Sunday evening the PM finalised her cabinet with a small reshuffle, with Michael Gove returning to a ministerial role as environment secretary.

Mr Green, who was work and pensions secretary, was promoted to become the first secretary of state - effectively Mrs May's second in command. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Widespread demands for Mrs May to go are not expected at Monday's 1922 Committee meeting. Instead, there will be demands for her to consult more, including meeting regularly with the 1922 executive, and to turn Downing Street from a bunker into an open house by broadening her range of staff.

"The man was struck by a tram at Manchester Victoria at about 19:45 BST on Sunday A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was ""pushed into a moving tram"" and died at Manchester's Victoria station. The man, believed to be in his 30s, was pushed, causing him to fall between the platform and tram, Greater Manchester Police said. A Metrolink driver reported a collision at about 19:45 BST on Sunday, Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) said. A 31-year-old woman is being questioned in police custody. The woman arrested was not the tram driver, police confirmed. Metrolink customer director Stephen Rhodes said he was ""absolutely devastated"" to hear someone had died. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the man died at the scene. There was disruption to services on the Bury line for several hours affecting those attending Parklife festival. Metrolink issued a walking map to help those travelling from the festival at Heaton Park return to the city centre. Parklife finished at 23:00 on Sunday. The three-mile walk should take about an hour. Some people questioned the advice on Twitter, suggesting telling young people to walk the distance in Wellington boots in the dark was ""unbelievable"". Others said they thought there would be safety in numbers. Metrolink suggested people walk back to the city centre Metrolink tweeted there was an ""ongoing medical emergency"" and advised passengers to avoid Manchester Victoria station. In a statement, Mr Rhodes, added: ""My immediate thoughts are with this person's family and friends. ""As this is now a police investigation it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment about what happened at this time."" He encouraged those who were able to walk to do so and said 100 buses were also in place, adding: ""I'd ask everyone to please bear with us and be patient."" Metrolink said ""a good service"" was in operation on all lines on Monday and trams were operating in and out of Victoria.

"Melania and Barron Trump arrive after making their move to the capital Melania Trump and son Barron have moved into the White House - five months after her husband Donald took office. Mrs Trump and her son, 11, had stayed in New York to finish the school year. The decision was seen as unusual by some, as she was the first presidential spouse in recent years not to relocate to the capital immediately. Separately Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, said in a TV interview that her father had been ""subjected to a level of viciousness that I was not expecting"". In an interview withthe Fox and Friends morning TV show,external, she said that she had been left blindsided by the ferocity of some of the attacks levelled against the president.

A Fox News report said that Ms Trump -  who along with her husband Jared Kushner is a special adviser to the president - ""glided past the more controversial interview topics like a seasoned vet"". Melania Trump is the first presidential spouse in recent history to delay her arrival in Washington, following her husband's inauguration at the start of the year.

"This video can not be played ""Police are pulling people out at random"" - BBC reporter at the scene Hundreds of people have been detained at anti-corruption rallies in Moscow and St Petersburg. Riot police in central Moscow were picking protesters out of the crowd at random, a BBC correspondent at the demonstration has said. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny was detained at his home ahead of the protests, according to his wife. Thousands of supporters have heeded his call to take to the streets of Moscow and other Russian cities. OVD-Info, an independent NGO, told Russian media that 600 people had been detained at the Moscow protest. Police in Moscow say about 5,000 took part in the demonstration there, Interfax news agency reports. Russia's interior ministry says that about 3,500 people attended the protest in St Petersburg, and 500 were detained. Young people were detained at the protest in St Petersburg ""Alexei [Navalny] has been arrested in the entrance to our block of flats,"" Yuliya Navalnaya wrote on Twitter, ahead of the demonstration. Mr Navalny, who intends tostand for the Russian presidency next year, had been due to attend the unauthorised rally in central Moscow. Russia's vociferous opposition leader Why Navalny rattles the Kremlin This was a peculiar protest. At first it was hard to tell who was taking part. Tverskaya Street was full of families marking Russia Day with entertainers in historical costumes. Then thousands of protesters turned up. Huge numbers of riot police were right behind them. First they announced that the rally was illegal then the arrests began. We saw dozens of people plucked from the crowd - many of them young - and dragged roughly towards police buses. By calling people to an unauthorised rally, Alexei Navalny knew he was risking a confrontation. The police duly obliged. But people I spoke to said they knew the risk and still wanted their voices to be heard. Among other things, those voices chanted loudly: ""Putin, thief!"" and ""Russia will be free"". In a live broadcast by the Russian liberal TV channel, Dozhd, protesters in St Petersburg could be heard shouting ""shame"" as they were detained by police. Among those arrested was Maxim Reznik, the city's legislative assembly deputy. Prominent activist Daniil Ken said he was arrested as he left his home in St Petersburg. He urged people to join the rally at the city's Champ de Mars square. ""Go for me, please!"" he tweeted. He has since been released. Police had earlier detained several people at demonstrations in the cities of Vladivostok, Blagoveshchensk and Kazan. Mr Navalny called on Russians to take to the streets on Monday - Russia Day - to express their anger at alleged corruption at the highest levels. The anti-corruption campaigner uses YouTube, tweets and blogs to reach new audiences. A video posted in March accuses Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of accumulating a vast private fortune. Mr Medvedev denies the claims. The video, which includes the accusation that the PM has a duck house on one of his properties, has been viewed nearly 23 million times. In a call for people to join him on Monday, Mr Navalny wrote: ""I want changes. I want to live in a modern democratic state and I want our taxes to be converted into roads, schools and hospitals, not into yachts, palaces and vineyards."" Mr Navalny was earlier granted permission to hold a rally at Sakharova Avenue but changed the location - without permission -  on the eve of the demonstration to Tverskaya Street, near the Kremlin. The protest was called over government plans to demolish Soviet-era apartment blocks in the city. LISTEN: Moscow's controversial redevelopment plan This woman draped herself in the colours of the Russian flag Permission was granted for demonstrations in 169 locations across the country, some of which were broadcast live on theNavalny Live,externalYouTube channel. The protests coincided with a series of official events - including festivals, concerts and military enactments - taking place across the country to mark Russia Day, the national holiday dedicated to the 1990 declaration of sovereignty. Similarrallies led by Mr Navalny in Marchled to hundreds of arrests. Those protests were the largest since 2012, drawing thousands of people - including many teenagers - to rallies nationwide, angered by a report published by Mr Navalny that accused Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of corruption.

"Melania and Barron Trump arrive after making their move to the capital Melania Trump and son Barron have moved into the White House - five months after her husband Donald took office. Mrs Trump and her son, 11, had stayed in New York to finish the school year. The decision was seen as unusual by some, as she was the first presidential spouse in recent years not to relocate to the capital immediately. Separately Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, said in a TV interview that her father had been ""subjected to a level of viciousness that I was not expecting"". In an interview withthe Fox and Friends morning TV show,external, she said that she had been left blindsided by the ferocity of some of the attacks levelled against the president. This video can not be played Melania Trump posted on Instagram about the move to the White House Ms Trump said that she felt ""very vindicated"" by formerFBI Director James Comey's recent Senate testimonybecause it supported her father's contention that he was not being personally investigated for alleged links to Russia and that Mr Comey had on at least one occasion supplied a leak to The New York Times. A Fox News report said that Ms Trump -  who along with her husband Jared Kushner is a special adviser to the president - ""glided past the more controversial interview topics like a seasoned vet"". Melania Trump is the first presidential spouse in recent history to delay her arrival in Washington, following her husband's inauguration at the start of the year. Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner (pictured) are both presidential advisers Her predecessor, Michelle Obama, even moved to Washington early to get her daughters settled in their new school. Melania Trump's White House snub: Appalling or good parenting? Melania Trump: The unusual, traditional First Lady However, it seems the First Lady is delighted by the move, tweeting a picture looking out across the White House lawn, marking the occasion.

"New images released by police show bomber Salman Abedi on CCTV in Manchester Manchester bomber Salman Abedi was likely to have built the device that killed 22 people alone at his flat, police have said. Officers said there was now a ""deep understanding"" of Abedi's movements in the weeks leading up to the attack. The head of counter terrorism said it was ""less clear"" whether he had obtained and stored all the materials or if others were ""complicit"". All 22 people arrested over the attack have been released without charge. Det Ch Supt Russ Jackson said Greater Manchester Police now had details of Abedi's movements in the weeks leading up to the Manchester Arena bombing. These included how the chemicals to build the bomb were obtained and where he put the device together. What we know about Manchester bomber The victims of the Manchester attack Manchester police find 'significant' car Police said they had an understanding of Abedi's movements ""almost hour by hour"" in the days before he bombed Manchester Arena on 22 May. They said: Abedi, 22, bought a white Nissan Micra on 13 April - two days before leaving the UK for a month-long trip to Libya He used the car to store bomb parts and was captured on CCTV putting plastic barrels into the vehicle He returned to the UK on 18 May, with police saying he seemed ""intent on committing the attack within days"" CCTV footage shows him purchasing more items for the bomb, including nuts from a DIY store that were used for shrapnel, as well as the tin in which the explosive was believed to have been put in He was tracked going to and from flats in the Banff Road area of Rusholme, where the Micra was parked Detectives believe he was collecting pre-prepared bomb parts from the car for him to assemble - alone - at his flat But understanding ""whether others knew or were complicit in the storage of materials knowing what was being planned"" is ""crucial to our work"" Images released by Greater Manchester Police show a barrel which was stored in Salman Abedi's car Early in the investigation, GMP said it could be looking for a ""network"" of people in connection with the attack, but all of those arrested so far have now been released. Two were quickly de-arrested, but the other 20 were interviewed multiple times about their contact with Abedi. Det Ch Supt Jackson said they had uncovered ""a number of suspicious purchases"" of materials, which could be used to make bombs, as well as contact with the attacker. Some of those arrested gave accounts of ""innocent contact"" with Abedi and police were ""satisfied with these explanations"". He added: ""We said at the start we had to rapidly understand whether this was an attack committed by an isolated individual or a wider network. ""We have made enormous progress in this and are far more confident on who was not involved and who could still be involved."" Police are appealing for anyone who saw Salman Abedi (pictured) with his white Nissan Micra Officers are continuing to search a landfill site in Bury, Greater Manchester, for a blue suitcase that Abedi was seen using days before the attack - it is believed to contain items discarded after the bomb device was assembled. They said they had ""found evidence of explosive material at several locations"" after searching 29 premises that had links to Abedi. Police also want to talk to Abedi's younger brother, Hashem, who left the country on the same day as his brother and is being detained in Libya. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said the pace of the inquiry, which is one of GMP's largest investigations, was ""incredible and will continue in the coming weeks and months"". More than a thousand officers have been working on the investigation, which has seen the seizure of about 700 media devices, including phones, and more than 8,000 entries on the police's logging system. Police are continuing to search a landfill site in Bury Det Ch Supt Jackson appealed again for anyone who may have seen Abedi in the days before the attack to come forward - especially those who saw him with the car or putting materials into it. ""This is very much a live criminal investigation moving at considerable speed,"" he added. ""It is a terrorism investigation relating to 22 murders and multiple attempted murders. ""It will continue at its current pace as we work to understand the full extent of the involvement of anyone else.""

"Floral tributes surround Borough Market as businesses begin to open again Another man has been arrested in connection with the 3 June terror attack on London Bridge, bringing the total number of arrests to 21. The 19-year-old was held in Barking on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Police said six other suspects remain in custody and searches are ongoing. Eight people were killed when three men drove at pedestrians on the bridge and stabbed people in Borough Market. The man arrested on Sunday is being held at a police station in south London. The six men still in custody, all aged between 27 and 30, were also arrested in east London - four in Ilford, one in Newham and one in Barking. Thirteen people arrested as part of the investigation have been released without charge, while a 33-year-old man held in Ilford on 8 June has been bailed. Over the weekend,police released images of fake explosive beltsworn by the three attackers, named as Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba. Borough Market is hoping to re-open ""later this week"", managing director Darren Henaghan has said. Traders were officially given access to the market on Monday - for the first time since the terror attack - to allow them to start clearing up and prepare to resume business. On Saturday night, bars and restaurants across the capitaldonated money to a British Red Cross UK fundfor victims of terror attacks and their families, as Londoners were encouraged to show ""unity and resilience"" a week after the attack. The fund has raised more than Â£700,000 since it started on 4 June. And on Sunday, Southwark Cathedral - which had been cordoned off in the days after the attack -re-opened its doors for the first time.

"The surprise return to cabinet of Michael Gove as the new environment secretary features on a number of Monday's front pages. He is the star ofthe Daily Telegraph's,externalsplash, which sees his unexpected comeback as Theresa May's attempt to avoid a leadership challenge. The newspaper thinks the prime minister is addressing complaints that she is too autocratic and unwilling to work with her critics. It also expects Mr Gove to become a key adviser on Brexit and a powerful ally in getting any deal through the Commons. The Sun,externalsays he is the biggest winner in the ""post-election disaster shake-up"". The Times,externalinterprets the limited reshuffle as a signal that Mrs May will go for a so-called soft Brexit. The newspaper says she faces overwhelming pressure to go for looser controls on immigration, a rethink on leaving the customs union, and a more flexible approach to the European Court of Justice.

"The uncertainty caused by the general election has led business confidence to sink ""through the floor"", according to a lobby group. A snap poll of 700 members of the Institute of Directors found a ""dramatic drop"" in confidence following the hung parliament. Members saw no clear way to resolve the political impasse quickly, the IoD said. However, it found there was ""no desire"" for another election this year. Going to the polls again before Christmas would have a negative impact on the UK economy, which was already facing global headwinds, the IoD said. The loss of the Conservatives' majority in the Commons has led Theresa May to seek the support of MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to govern. Simon Jack: Business senses a chance to reassert itself Calls mount for rethink of Brexit stance Most MPs 'do not back hard Brexit' The resulting political uncertainty could have disastrous consequences for the UK economy, said Stephen Martin, IoD director-general. ""The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the [general election] campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government,"" he said. The main priority for the new government should be striking a new trade deal with the European Union, according to the IoD. The 700 members who responded to its survey wanted a rapid agreement with the European Union on transitional arrangements for Brexit, along with clarity on the status of EU workers in the UK. A separate survey,externalof more than 50 medium sized businesses and trade associations by the Harvard Kennedy School of Business found that ""almost all"" expressed a preference for remaining in the single market and customs union. The report, by former shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Peter Sands, previously the boss of investment bank Standard Chartered, found that all companies questioned were concerned about potentially rising costs from tariffs and customs controls while many were worried about the UK leaving the EU without a deal at all. Mr Sands told the BBC: ""When it comes down to it most would prefer to be in the single market - that makes it easier for them to do business, and if they can't get that they want a free trade agreement or something as close to the single market as possible."" Andy Silvester, the IoD's head of campaigns, told the BBC he now expected to see more flexibility and pragmatism around the Brexit negotiations. The IoD survey echoed comments by Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI, who said the UK needed to quickly agree transitional arrangements and guarantee EU citizens' rights before focusing Brexit talks on future trading relationships. ""To succeed, the UK needs to build the best partnership seen anywhere in the world between its business and the new government, not just on Brexit but on other issues fundamental to the foundations of our economy,"" he said. Meanwhile, companies have been urged to better prepare for a fall in migrant labour following Brexit. A survey of 500 business leaders by the Resolution Foundation found that almost one in five expected no change to freedom of movement for EU nationals to the UK, while nearly a third believed that the system would be maintained for those with a job offer. The foundation warned that lower migration, along with a higher minimum wage and a tightening jobs market, could mean the end of cheap labour for many UK firms.

"The pound has resumed its downward slide as investors continue to react to the political uncertainty following last week's shock UK election result. Sterling had stabilised in early trade, but by late afternoon had dropped 0.66% against the dollar to $1.2659 and fell 0.73% against the euro to 1.1299 euros. On the stock market, theFTSE 100index closed down 0.21% at 7511.87. On Friday, the pound suffered its biggest one-day drop in about eight months following the election. The uncertainty caused by the election result has led business confidenceto sink ""through the floor"", according to one lobby group. A snap poll of 700 members of the Institute of Directors found a ""dramatic drop"" in confidence following the hung parliament. Business senses chance to reassert itself What does the UK vote mean for Brexit? Who are the DUP? Global currency markets are trying to work out how the election will affect the UK's exit from the European Union. Negotiations with Brussels are due to begin next week, with the outcome expected to have a significant impact on the economies of both the UK and the EU. Mrs May has been pushing for a so-called hard Brexit - where the UK leaves the EU single market and the customs union - instead of a softer Brexit, where the UK would maintain those links. A report from rating agency Moody's released on Monday said the inconclusive election result could affect the UK's credit rating. Moody's said the election would ""complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative"". However, it added that the government might now ""consider 'softer' Brexit options, which could be credit positive"". Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said the future direction of the pound was ""still very much up in the air"". ""The prospect of a hard split with the EU has been kryptonite for the pound, so a potential rethink on the UK government's Brexit stance could limit [the pound's] downside, at least for now. ""However, not even the rising odds of a soft Brexit have been enough to spark positive momentum for the pound."" Technology shares came under pressure in London on Monday, with software company Micro Focus down by 3.8% and accounting platform provider Sage Group 1.8% lower. Overall, the European technology sector saw its biggest share declines since the Brexit vote a year ago. The trend in Europe seemed to be taking its lead from Wall Street.

The mystery deepened in 1929, when a German archaeologist named Julius Jordan unearthed a vast library of clay tablets that were 5,000 years old. They were far older than the samples of writing already discovered in China, Egypt and Mesoamerica, and were written in an abstract script that became known as ""cuneiform"". The tablets came from Uruk, a Mesopotamian settlement on the banks of the Euphrates in what is now Iraq. The ruins of Uruk and other Mesopotamian cities were littered with mysterious little clay objects Uruk was small by today's standards - with only a few thousand inhabitants - but in its time was huge, one of the world's first true cities. ""He built the town wall of 'Uruk', city of sheepfolds,"" proclaims the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest works of literature. ""Look at its wall with its frieze like bronze! Gaze at its bastions, which none can equal!"" This great city had produced writing that no modern scholar could decipher.

The ruins of Uruk and other Mesopotamian cities were littered with little clay objects - conical, spherical and cylindrical. One archaeologist quipped they looked like suppositories. Julius Jordan was a little more perceptive. They were shaped, he wrote in his journal, ""like the commodities of daily life - jars, loaves, and animals"", although they were stylised and standardised. But what were they for? Nobody could work it out. Nobody, that is, until the French archaeologist Denise Schmandt-Besserat. In the 1970s, she catalogued similar pieces found across the region, from Turkey to Pakistan, some of which were 9,000 years old. Denise Schmandt-Besserat - pictured here in Muscat in 2012 - is widely credited with discovering the origins of writing Schmandt-Besserat believed the tokens had a simple purpose: correspondence counting. The tokens that were shaped like loaves could be used to count loaves. The ones shaped like jars could be used to count jars. Correspondence counting is easy: you don't need to know how to count, you just need to look at two quantities and verify that they are the same. The technique is older even than Uruk. The 20,000-year-old Ishango Bone - found near one of the sources of the Nile in the Democratic Republic of Congo - seems to use matched tally marks on the thigh bone of a baboon for correspondence counting. The 20,000-year-old Ishango Bone appears to show matched tally marks used for correspondence counting But the Uruk tokens took things further: they were used to keep track of counting lots of different quantities, and could be used both to add and to subtract. Remember, Uruk was a great city. There was a priesthood, there were craftsmen. Food was gathered from the surrounding countryside. An urban economy requires trading, and planning, and taxation too. Picture the world's first accountants, sitting at the door of the temple storehouse, using the little loaf tokens to count as the sacks of grain arrive and leave. Denise Schmandt-Besserat pointed out something else revolutionary. The abstract marks on the cuneiform tablets matched the tokens. Everyone else had missed the resemblance because the writing didn't seem to be a picture of anything. But Schmandt-Besserat realised what had happened. The tablets had been used to record the back-and-forth of the tokens, which themselves were recording the back-and-forth of the sheep, the grain, and the jars of honey. In fact, it may be that the first such tablets were impressions of the tokens themselves, pressing the hard clay baubles into the soft clay tablet. Then those ancient accountants realised it might be simpler to make the marks with a stylus. So cuneiform writing was a stylised picture of an impression of a token representing a commodity. No wonder nobody had made the connection before Schmandt-Besserat. And so she solved both problems at once. Those clay tablets, adorned with the world's first abstract writing? They weren't being used for poetry, or to send messages to far-off lands. They were used to create the world's first accounts. The world's first written contracts, too - since there is just a small leap between a record of what has been paid, and a record of a future obligation to pay. These bulla, discovered in Iraq, recorded agricultural transactions in the 8th Millennium BC The combination of the tokens and the clay cuneiform writing led to a brilliant verification device: a hollow clay ball called a bulla. On the outside of the bulla, the parties to a contract could write down the details of the obligation - including the resources that were to be paid. On the inside of the bulla would be the tokens representing the deal. The writing on the outside and the tokens inside the clay ball verified each other. We don't know who the parties to such agreements might have been - whether they were religious tithes to the temple, taxes, or private debts, is unclear. But such records were the purchase orders and the receipts that made life in a complex city society possible. This is a big deal. Most financial transactions are based on explicit written contracts. Insurance, a bank account, a government bond, a corporate share, a mortgage agreement - they're all written contracts - and the bullas of Mesopotamia are the very first archaeological evidence that written contracts existed. Uruk's accountants provided us with another innovation, too. What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? How the invention of paper changed the world The warrior monks who invented banking Tick tock: The importance of knowing the right time At first, the system for recording five sheep would simply require five separate sheep impressions. But that was cumbersome. A superior system involved using an abstract symbol for different numbers - five strokes for five, a circle for 10, two circles and three strokes for 23. The numbers were always used to refer to a quantity of something: there was no ""10"" - only ""10 sheep"". But the numerical system was powerful enough to express large quantities - hundreds, and thousands. One demand for war reparations, 4,400 years old, is for 4.5 trillion litres of barley grain, or 8.64 million ""guru"". It was an unpayable bill - 600 times the US's annual production of barley today. But it was an impressively big number. It was also the world's first written evidence of compound interest. In all it is quite a set of achievements. The citizens of Uruk faced a huge problem, a problem that is fundamental to any modern economy - how to deal with a web of obligations and long-range plans between people who did not know each other well, who might perhaps never even meet. Solving that problem meant producing a string of brilliant innovations: not only the first accounts and the first contracts, but the first mathematics and even the first writing. Writing wasn't a gift from the gods. It was a tool that was developed for a very clear reason: to run an economy.
