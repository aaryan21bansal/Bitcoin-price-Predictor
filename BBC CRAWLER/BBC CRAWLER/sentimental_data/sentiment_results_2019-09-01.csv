"Adverts in national newspapers on Monday told the public to 'prepare' for Britain's exit from the EU An information campaign urging the public to ""get ready for Brexit"" has been launched by the government. The campaign began on Sunday with the launch of a website,gov.uk/brexit,external. Billboards and social media adverts will appear in the coming days and TV adverts will air later this month. Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal plans, said the adverts encourage ""shared responsibility"" for preparing to leave the EU on 31 October. It has been reported that the campaign could cost as much as Â£100m as ministers seek to inform people what they might need to do, if anything, ahead of the deadline. Meanwhile,it has emerged the EU is considering classifying no deal as a ""major disaster"",like an earthquake, in order to free up funds for countries affected. MPs 'will propose legislation' to stop no deal Will we see an early election? And other questions Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? Benedict Pringle, author of thepoliticaladvertising.co.uk,externalblog, said that, if true, the Â£100m budget would be roughly double what the National Lottery spends on advertising each year. ""So if you think about how often you see a lottery advert and double it, that's how much we could be seeing the campaign over the next two months,"" he told the BBC. ""At football grounds, in advert breaks for Coronation Street and The Great British Bake Off, this is where you'll get the biggest reach with the public."" This video can not be played Michael Gove: 'Everyone will have the food they need' An image showing one of the campaign's billboards was issued by the Cabinet Office ahead of their rollout this week. Leaflets, online seminars, and information stands at events will also be used. British citizens who are intending to travel to Europe and businesses which export to the EU are among the specific groups targeted by the campaign. The campaign encourages people and businesses to visit the government website to answer questions and receive advice on preparing for Brexit. The campaign includes an online questionnaire, which ends with advice specific to individuals' circumstances According to the campaign, some sections of society ""do not need to take any action"" to prepare for Brexit. People on that list are British citizens who both live and work in the UK, do not run a business and do not plan to travel abroad ""after 31 October 2019"". #GetReadyForBrexit was the fourth highest UK trend on Twitter on Monday morning. While some users welcomed the government's drive, the majority of tweets mocked either the campaign or Brexit itself. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Announcing the launch, Mr Gove said ensuring the UK left the EU in an orderly manner was ""not only a matter of national importance, but a shared responsibility"". Mr Gove was earlier criticised by a retail trade association for claiming there would be no shortages of fresh food in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The British Retail Consortium said Mr Gove's assertion on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that ""there will be no shortages of fresh food"" was ""categorically untrue"".

"Johanna Konta is into the US Open quarter-finals for the first time US Open 2019 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:26 Aug - 8 Sep Coverage:Live text and BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra commentary on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app. Clickherefor Live Guide. Johanna Konta reached the US Open quarter-finals for the first time by edging an unpredictable match against Czech third seed Karolina Pliskova. Konta, 28, fought back from a set and 3-1 down to win 6-7 (1-7) 6-3 7-5. She will faceElina Svitolinain the last eight after the Ukrainian fifth seed beat Madison Keys 7-5 6-4. ""I've been in the fourth round twice before so reaching the quarter-finals is a massive achievement for me,"" said the British number one. ""The key was to keep going, with Karolina you know there will be massive portions of the match where I don't feel effective. ""It is about staying out there and trusting the fundamental things. It was a great match and I'm so happy."" The 16th seed missed chances in the first set before composing herself to punish an out-of-sorts Pliskova at Flushing Meadows. The Czech won 77% of points on her first serve and served 16 aces but those statistics were undermined by nine double faults and a second serve which earned her just seven points. Konta has been hitting clean groundstrokes all tournament and continued to trust her ability against the similarly powerful Pliskova, landing 45 winners which outnumbered her unforced errors and proved to be a key differential. Konta, who is the first British woman to reach the quarter-finals in New York since Jo Durie in 1983, has now made the last eight at all four Grand Slams. She reached the French Open semi-finals and Wimbledon quarter-finals earlier this year. On emulating Durie, Konta said: ""I'm really pleased with that and, more specifically, this season to make it three quarter-finals in successive Grand Slams is a tremendous achievement. ""I will enjoy this but I have to keep looking forward and try to go one, two or three steps further."" Konta will now face 24-year-old Svitolina, who enjoyed a routine win over 10th seed and 2017 finalist Keys in the first night session match on Arthur Ashe Stadium. ""It is going to be another great battle,"" said Svitolina, who boasts a 3-0 winning record against Konta. Federer cruises into US Open quarter-finals by thrashing Goffin Second seed Barty knocked out by Wang Medvedev the Russian troll in New York Murray and Skupski into last eight Konta, supported again by actor Tom Hiddleston in her player box, started strongly against an opponent who had won six of their seven previous tour-level meetings. She broke to love in the first game and continued to create more opportunities as the tall Czech struggled to land first serves, enabling Konta to dismantle Pliskova's second serve on her way to setting up nine points for a double break in the opening set. Pliskova rallied to save all of them and it looked likely to prove costly for Konta when her service game - which she had only dropped twice in her previous three matches - suddenly disintegrated. Konta failed to land a first serve as she tried to see out the opener at 5-4, paying the price as the Czech rediscovered her biggest weapon to instead take the advantage. Pliskova looked completely in control as she broke in the first game of the second set and won nine out of 10 points with Konta's game starting to become ragged. Actor Tom Hiddleston has watched two of Johanna Konta's matches at Flushing Meadows, having met her on the street in New York But, after the pair traded two more successive breaks, momentum shifted back to Konta, who won five games in a row to take an engrossing match into a decider. Konta had won 16 of her 19 three-set matches this year and looked set to improve that tally when a poor service game from Pliskova, which featured three unforced errors and a double fault, left the Briton serving for the match. However, as when she served for the first set, nerves seemed to take hold and Pliskova threatened to level by bringing up break point. Konta, though, composed herself again with a brave forehand winner down the line. After missing a first match point, she reset again to win at the second opportunity when 27-year-old Pliskova - still searching for a maiden Grand Slam title herself - hit long to go down in two hours and 20 minutes. ""It was important not to panic or be worried,"" Konta said about fighting back from a set and a break down. ""I was doing a lot of good things out there and I kept into perspective I was playing the number three player in the world. ""I was pleased with what I was doing in that first set, even though I wasn't able to come through, and I definitely felt there was a lot for me to build on. ""I trust in my ability to create more opportunities and I managed to do that."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Flushing Meadows Johanna Konta won that match the hard way. Many would have subsided after losing a first set they had dominated - especially after being broken twice in a row at the start of the second. But Konta has an extraordinary third-set record this year, and seems to relish mixing it with the elite. She has won her past four matches against top 10 players in Grand Slams - against Sloane Stephens twice, Petra Kvitova and now Karolina Pliskova. The serve is the bedrock of her game, but she also hit bravely and freely from the baseline when the match was up for grabs. To have reached the last eight of all four Grand Slams is a mighty achievement, and she is only the 14th active player to have done so.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""We will see what the legislation says when it is put forward"" Tory minister Michael Gove has refused to say whether the government would abide by legislation designed to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC MPs would introduce a bill seeking to do that when Parliament returns this week. But asked if the government would abide by this if it succeeded, Mr Gove said: ""Let's see what the legislation says."" Sir Keir described Mr Gove's comments as ""breathtaking"". Cabinet minister Mr Gove also said ""some"" food prices ""may go up"" and ""other prices will come down"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, the EU's lead Brexit negotiatorhas rejected Boris Johnson's demandsfor the controversial Irish backstop to be scrapped. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. The prime minister says he is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline, which has prompted a number of opposition MPs to unite to try and block a possible no deal. Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? Will we see an early election? And other questions Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop 'Get ready for Brexit' campaign launches Sir Keir told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""The legislation is intended to ensure we don't leave without a deal, that will require an extension. ""The length of the extension is secondary, frankly. We have simply got to stop us leaving without a deal."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that plans to block a no-deal Brexit will be published on Tuesday. He said the ""ultimate goal this week"" was to ""ensure Parliament can have a final say"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer: ""The purpose of the legislation... is to prevent us leaving without a deal"" But when asked if the government would abide by legislation preventing a no-deal Brexit, Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Let's see what the legislation says. ""You're asking me about a pig in a poke. ""And I will wait to see what legislation the opposition may try to bring forward."" Sir Keir responded on Twitter, saying Mr Gove's response was ""breathtaking"", adding: ""No government is above the law."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Any new law has to pass through all stages of both Houses of Parliament. This would usually take weeks, but it could be done in as little as three days this week. However, the bill could be challenged by the government and fall at any stage. It could fail to achieve enough support from either MPs or peers in votes held in the Houses. Tuesday:MPs return to the Commons after their summer recess. Opposition MPs are expected to put forward legislation to stop no deal under ""SO24"" or Standing Order 24 - the rule that allows MPs to ask for a debate on a ""specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration"". This would be the bill's first reading - its formal introduction to the House. Wednesday:In theory, the bill would then be debated and could potentially pass through all further stages in the Commons. However, the bill must pass through a series of votes and receive backing from more than half of MPs in order to pass on to the next stage. Boris Johnson's first PMQs as prime minister also takes place. Thursday:If MPs passed the bill, it could then reach the House of Lords by Thursday, but consideration of the bill could spill into Monday. It will be debated and voted on. The House is not due to sit on Friday. Monday, 9 September:If the bill passes these hurdles it could gain Royal Assent, which formally makes it law. This could be a tight timetable as there are as few as four sitting days before Parliament is suspended. This is due to happen between Monday, 9 September, and Thursday, 12 September, underplans announced by the prime minister. Boris Johnson says he asked for the suspension in order to hold a Queen's Speech - which sets out a list of laws the government hopes to get approved by Parliament - on 14 October. Another hurdle for any bill could come in the House of Lords. Although opponents to no deal have a large majority, peers wanting to block a piece of legislation could talk and talk until there is no time left. However, opposition parties and those who are against a no-deal Brexit are split on their aims. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said her party's aim this week was to achieve an extension to Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - and then a further referendum. ""We stand by our Stop Brexit stance but we do that via a People's Vote and that's step one,"" she told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday. Although Sir Keir suggested an Article 50 extension will be needed under the legislation plan, Labour has been clear that it wants a general election. And while former justice secretary David Gauke wants to avoid no deal, he has said he ""doesn't want to do anything to facilitate a Jeremy Corbyn government"". ""Indeed, one of my worries about a no-deal Brexit is it will create the chaos in which Jeremy Corbyn could win a general election,"" the Conservative Party MP told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday. However, Mr Gauke said he is minded to put the national interest first if he were forced to choose between disobeying the party whip in a vote to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Referring to reports that Tories who oppose a no-deal option could lose the party whip - which means they would effectively be expelled from the party - he said: ""Sometimes there is a point where you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest. ""And the national interest has to come first. But I hope it doesn't come to that."" Mr Gauke said he will meet the prime minister on Monday to hear what his plan is to deliver a Brexit deal. Pressed on whether there would be shortages of fresh food in a no-deal Brexit scenario, Mr Gove said: ""Everyone will have the food they need."" He added: ""No, there will be no shortages of fresh food."" When asked if food prices would increase, Mr Gove replied: ""I think that there are a number of economic factors in play. ""Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down."" This video can not be played Michael Gove: 'Everyone will have the food they need' He said that freedom of movement will end ""as we understand it"", but added that the EU Settlement Scheme was ""working well"". But trade association the BRC (British Retail Consortium) said Mr Gove's claims on potential fresh food shortages were ""categorically untrue"". ""The retail industry has been crystal clear in its communications with government over the past 36 months that the availability of fresh foods will be impacted as a result of checks and delays at the border,"" a statement said. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium directorAodhÃ¡n Connolly also said Mr Gove's claim was not true. Meanwhile, the government's ""Get Ready for Brexit"" campaign and portal has been launched on its website. Individuals or businesses can answer questions on it on topics including whether they propose to travel to the EU or export to Europe, and it then returns results which suggest how to start preparing for Brexit.

"Nearly Â£15m has been spent on collecting medical waste in Scotland since the collapse of Healthcare Environmental Services, figures show. The Lanarkshire-based company went to the wall last December after becoming embroiled in awaste stockpiling scandal. Contingency measures were put in place to remove waste from every hospital, GP surgery, dental practice and pharmacy. But NHS figures released to BBC Scotland show these costs have soared. Between December last year and July this year, a total of Â£14.8m was spent on contingency waste measures by NHS National Services Scotland. By contrast the deal with the firm taking over the waste collection contract for the next ten years, Spanish-owned Tradebe Healthcare, will be worth Â£10m a year. Tradebe was meant to take over the contract in April butdelays over planning permissionsmean the firm is now not expected to be fully operational until October. The Scottish government said the higher costs for the contingency measures come as a result of the additional measures required to be put in place at short notice following the collapse of HES. But Monica Lennon MSP, Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman, said: ""By the health secretary'sown admission, the NHS in Scotland was put at risk by the clinical waste scandal and it is continuing to cost taxpayers millions of pounds. ""No one has taken responsibility for the crisis and despite no lessons being learned the Scottish government have handed a new contract to another private firm. ""NHS services are struggling to cope and patients can't afford for money to be wasted like this."" Waste was pictured piling up at health centres in Coatbridge, Kilsyth and Cumbernauld in January but has since been collected After HES collapsed, the Scottish government provided Â£1.4m towards initial contingency planning and a string of temporary contractors took over the HES work to ensure clinical waste continued to be disposed of safely. The Scottish government has insisted the contingency measures are working well but there have been reports of a backlog of waste at some NHS sites. In Inverness,four porters at Raigmore Hospital were injuredcarrying out work involving clinical waste, and photographs showingbags of clinical waste piled at three health centresin North Lanarkshire were posted on social media in January. Some hospital waste from Scotland is to besent to Wales for disposalunder the new collection deal with Tradebe. About 150 workers in Scotland lost their jobs when HES collapsed, the majority of whom worked at the firm's headquarters in Shotts A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""National Services Scotland continues to work closely with NHS health boards, contractors, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Scottish government to deliver robust contingency plans to ensure NHS Scotland services to the public are maintained and patient services are not impacted. ""The current arrangements ensure clinical waste is appropriately stored, collected and disposed of in line with industry regulations. ""As we have said before, the cost of contingency - and ultimately maintaining NHS services - comes at a higher cost due to the additional measures required to be put in place at short notice following withdrawal of services by HES. ""We will know the final net cost of contingency at the end of current arrangements, when costs can be set against the unpaid contracted costs which would have been due to HES if they had not arbitrarily withdrawn from the contract.""

"The US has imposed fresh tariffs on $112bn (Â£92bn) of Chinese imports such as shoes, nappies and food. The new tariffs are a sharp escalation in the bruising trade war, and could cost households $800 a year. The move is the first phase of US President Donald Trump's latest plan to place 15% duties on $300bn of Chinese imports by the end of the year. In response, Beijing began to introduce measures targeting $75bn worth of US goods. The measures included a 5% tariff on US crude oil, the first time fuel has been hit in the trade battle between the world's two largest economies. What was initially a dispute over China's allegedly unfair trade practices is increasingly seen as a geopolitical power struggle. A quick guide to the US-China war The US-China trade row in charts So far, Washington has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods to pressure Beijing into changing its policies on intellectual property, industrial subsidies, market access, and the forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms. Beijing has consistently denied that it engages in unfair trade practices, and has retaliated with tariffs on a wide range of US products. Katie Prescott, BBC Business Reporter It's the American consumer who will bear the brunt of these fresh tariffs, unlike previous rounds which have hit the manufacturing sector hardest. Nappies, dishwashers, shoes, clothes, food - looking throughthe 122-page list of eligible products,external, it's hard to find something that's not on there. Many retailers say they have little choice but to pass on the cost to shoppers. The president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, Rick Helfenbein, describes the tariffs as like ""punishing your daughter for something your son did. It makes no sense"". The next round of tariffs on more clothes and big-ticket items like laptops and iPhones are due in December. Mr Trump says this will help to protect spending during the Christmas season. By the end of the year, they'll be in place on almost all goods that the US buys every year from China. And that could add up to $800 to the average household's annual spend, according to Katheryn Russ from the University of California. Businesses are finding it increasingly hard to navigate the uncertainty of the long-running trade dispute. Analysts say that in view of the latest escalation, the prospect of a resolution looks grim. ""It's difficult at this stage to see how there can be a deal or at least a good deal,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC. ""Since talks broke down back in May, the position of both sides has hardened and there have been other complications, namely the Huawei ban and Hong Kong protests, which have made it even more difficult to bridge the gap."" The US government put Huawei on a trade blacklist in May, while Mr Trumphas tied protests in Hong Kong to a possible trade deal with China. If fully imposed, Mr Trump's programme would mean that nearly all Chinese imports - worth about $550bn - would be subject to punitive tariffs. Mr Trump has repeatedly argued that China pays for tariffs, but many US companies have rebutted that claim. More than 200 footwear firms - including Nike and Converse - said the new duties would add to existing tariffs of up to 67% on some shoes, driving up costs for consumers by $4bn each year. Who really pays in a tariff war? 'We're all paying for this' They said the incoming tariffs on footwear would ""also mean these massive tax increases hit tens of millions of Americans when they purchase shoes during the holiday season"". The American Chamber of Commerce in China also voiced concerns after theUS said it was going ahead with new tariffs. ""Our members have long been clear that tariffs are paid by consumers and harm business,""it said in a statement,external. ""We urge... that both sides work towards a sustainable agreement as soon as possible that resolves the fundamental, structural issues foreign businesses have long faced in China."" Mr Trump has said that trade teams from the US and China are continuing to talk and will meet in September, but further details have not been publicly confirmed. From 15 December, the second phase of 15% tariffs will be rolled out on the remainder of Chinese good not previously affected. This includes technology like phones which Mr Trump has sought to protect until now. On the same date, China will roll out tariffs on around 3,000 more US products. The Trump administration plans, in addition, to raise the rates on existing duties from 25% to 30% on 1 October. Mr Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics said this rate could increase further still. ""The tariff rate could go all the way up to 45%,"" he said. ""Those are the goods that do the most damage to China and the least collateral damage to the US."" For the US and Chinese economies, analysts say the pressure created by tariffs is also building. ""The full-blown trade war, together with China's retaliation in kind, could reduce potential US GDP growth in the short run by almost 1%,"" said Gary Hufbauer of the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""The impact on China would be larger, as much as 5%."" Until 20 September, the US trade department will collect public comments on the planned tariff increases to 30%.

"This video can not be played ""We need help"": Video shows missing roofs and flooded roads The most powerful storm to hit the Bahamas since records began has torn off roofs and caused severe flooding. The slow-moving, category five Dorian - the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane on record - is now packing sustained winds of up to 165mph (270km/h) and may cause a storm surge of up to 23ft (7m). There is no official word on casualties but the Red Cross fears some 13,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. The hurricane is moving slowly west, with the eastern US coast at risk. The US states of Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that at 10:00 GMT,external, Dorian was moving very slowly through Grand Bahama, having made landfall earlier on the Abaco islands, which are just to the east. Both chains are in the north of the Bahamas archipelago. Grand Bahama, with a population of about 50,000, is only 100km (60 miles) east of West Palm Beach in Florida. Residents share images of devastation How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Are you in the affected region? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Dorian is travelling west at just over 1mph (2km/h). The NHC said the hurricane would ""continue to pound Grand Bahama Island"" through much of the day and evening on Monday. There was little information overnight from the affected Bahamas islands amid power cuts and limited internet access. However, video and tweets posted by Latrae Rahming, a former aide to ex-PM Perry Christie, showed severe damage on the Abaco Islands, home to about 17,000 people, where landfall was first made with sustained winds close to 185mph. Cars have been flipped over and roofs torn off. Mr Rahming told the BBC it was as though a tornado had swept through Marsh Harbour on the Abacos, with a surge as high as a two-storey building bringing intense flooding. He said he feared for one shanty town area that houses about 1,500 people. One video as the storm hit the Abacos carried a desperate plea for help: Allow Twitter content?

High winds and torrential rainfall have also struck Grand Bahama.The Tribune website reports that Grand Bahama International Airport,externalis said to be under water. Kristoff Ayala-Strachan, a blogger in Freeport on Grand Bahama, told the BBC he had stacked up on supplies and shuttered the windows, and was expecting the storm to last at least two days. The 24 year old said this was his eighth major hurricane. This video can not be played Matt Taylor presents an update on Hurricane Dorian Joy Jibrilu, director general of the Ministry of Tourism and Aviation, said on Sunday afternoon: ""It's devastating. There has been huge damage to property and infrastructure. Luckily, no loss of life reported."" However,Eyewitness News later carried an interview with a grandmother,externalwho said her eight-year-old grandson had drowned on the Abaco Islands. The government has opened 14 shelters and namesdozens of churches, schools and other buildings,externalon its official lists of emergency shelters. But as sites become full, there is concern that people will be forced to take refuge in other places that aren't listed to receive food and water from the government. The country is one of those most regularly hit by hurricanes, and homes are required to be reinforced to withstand the winds of a category four storm. An image from social media of Marsh Harbour in the Abaco Islands Prime Minister Hubert Minnis did announce an evacuation order for parts of Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands. All tourists were asked to leave. But officials expressed dismay that some people had chosen to stay. Mr Minnis said: ""I can only say to them, that I hope this is not the last time they will hear my voice and may God be with them."" The visibly upset prime minister said in a news conference on Sunday: ""This is probably the most sad and worst day of my life. We're facing a hurricane... that we've never seen in the history of the Bahamas."" Although Dorian is currently heading westwards, it is forecast to make a gradual turn north or north-west, taking it along the eastern US seaboard, making its landfall point, if any, uncertain. The NHC said that Dorian's slow weakening would continue, but it would remain ""a powerful hurricane during the next couple of days"" and would ""move dangerously close to the Florida east coast"" on Monday night through to Wednesday evening. President Donald Trump cancelled a planned trip to Poland last week and has met emergency management officials. He told reporters on Sunday that the storm ""looks monstrous"" and the US east coast would ""be ultimately impacted and some of it very, very severely"". Dorian has grown larger in size, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 45 miles (75km) from the storm's centre. President Trump has issued a federal state of emergency for Florida, and the state's governor, Ron DeSantis, has activated 2,000 National Guard troops, with another 2,000 on standby. Mr DeSantis warned people not to be complacent following the change in the storm's predicted path.  ""This storm at this magnitude could really cause massive destruction,"" he said.

Miami has ordered the removal of electric rental scooters from the streets to avoid them becoming projectiles. South Carolina on Sunday issued a mandatory evacuation of the entire coast, effective of noon on Monday and affecting 830,000 people. Georgia then followed suit. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes. Although 2018 was the third year in a row of above-average storms in the Atlantic season, years can vary widely. However, many do believe climate change is affecting the severity of the storms. This is for two main reasons. Firstly, an increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump. Then there is the issue of rising sea levels. They are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms. The warming world is also making storms more sluggish. Over the past seven decades tropical events have slowed, for example going 20-30% less quickly over land in North America. Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

"Michel Barnier said the backstop offered the ""maximum amount of flexibility"" that could be given to a non-member state The EU's lead Brexit negotiator has rejected Boris Johnson's demands for the Irish backstop to be scrapped. Michel Barnier said the backstop - intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - was the ""maximum flexibility"" the EU could offer. Mr Johnson has previously told the EU the arrangement must be ditched if a no-deal Brexit was to be avoided. Meanwhile, the PM has told rebel Tories they face a ""fundamental choice"" of siding with him or Jeremy Corbyn. His comments come as some MPs who oppose a no-deal Brexit - including Conservatives - are planning to take action in Parliament next week. Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. Former justice secretary David Gauke, who voted three times for the Withdrawal Agreement in the House of Commons, will meet the prime minister on Monday to ask about the practicalities of securing a deal. ""I want to hear from him as to what is his plan to deliver a deal, when are we putting forward proposals to deal with this backstop issue - which is the one issue he has identified as the problem within the Withdrawal Agreement,"" he said during an interview on Sky News' Sophy Ridge show. ""I want to hear how he's going to address that, and I want to hear how he plans to deliver the legislation if we get a deal by 31 October - because at the moment, frankly, I can't see how he's got time to do that."" The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated between Brussels and former prime minister Theresa May, which has been rejected by Parliament three times. If implemented, it would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit. Mr Johnson has said there has been some movement from the EU, as he attempts to broker a new deal and remove the arrangement, which he has described as ""undemocratic"". However,writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Barnier said: ""On the EU side, we had intense discussions with EU member states on the need to guarantee the integrity of the EU's single market, while keeping that border fully open. ""In this sense, the backstop is the maximum amount of flexibility that the EU can offer to a non-member state."" Mr Barnier also said he was ""not optimistic"" about avoiding a no-deal Brexit, but ""we should all continue to work with determination"". He added: ""The EU is ready to explore all avenues that the UK government may present and that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement."" The EU could not stop the UK from leaving without a deal, he said, but he ""would fail to understand the logic of that choice"" because ""we would still need to solve the same problems after 31 October"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mr Johnson says he wants to leave the EU on 31 October with a deal, but it is ""do or die"" and he is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline. That position has prompted a number of opposition MPs to come together to try to block a possible no deal. MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit are expected to try and seize control of the Parliamentary agenda this week to push through legislation that would force the PM to seek a Brexit extension beyond 31 October. But Mr Johnson has warned Tory MPs who are considering lining up with opposition groups that they risk plunging the country into chaos. In an interview with the Sunday Times, he said:,external""I just say to everybody in the country, including everyone in Parliament, the fundamental choice is this: Are you going to side with Jeremy Corbyn and those who want to cancel the referendum? ""Are you going to side with those who want to scrub the democratic verdict of the people - and plunge this country into chaos. ""Or are you going to side with those of us who want to get on, deliver the mandate of the people and focus with absolute, laser-like precision on the domestic agenda?"" Please upgrade your browser His comments come afterthe Sun reported,externalthat No 10 would stop any Tory MP who votes to block a no-deal Brexit from standing for the party in a general election. The report prompted former chancellor Philip Hammond to say it would be ""staggeringly hypocritical"" for the government to sack Conservative MPs who rebel over its Brexit plans, as eight current cabinet members had themselves defied the party whip this year by voting against Theresa May's Brexit deal. Speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge show, International Development Secretary Alok Sharma said that Mr Johnson must be given time to secure a new deal. ""We want any future agreement not to have the backstopâ¦ The reality is that the previous Withdrawal Agreement, which contained the backstop, did not pass on three occasions. It didn't pass then, it won't pass again,"" he said. ""In fact, having the backstop also potentially makes us rule-takers from the EU forever. That is not what we want. We want that out, we want a deal, but we will be leaving on 31 October - no ifs, no buts."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the same programme that a cross-party group that includes MPs and legal experts is looking at introducing a legislative measure next week to stop a no-deal Brexit without parliamentary approval. ""The technique of that will be published on Tuesday, and I'm hoping that we'll have a debate in which we can bring the House together,"" he said. ""The ultimate goal, very straightforwardly, this week, is to ensure that Parliament can have a final say... we cannot have a prime minister overriding Parliament - not just on this issue, on any issue."" What is prorogation? On Saturday,demonstrations were held across the UKin response to Mr Johnson's plans to suspend Parliament in the run-up to Brexit. The prime minister,who announced the move on Wednesday, said it would enable the government to bring forwards new legislation. But the decision prompted an angry backlash from some politicians and opponents of a no-deal Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Mr Johnson of a ""smash and grab on our democracy"" in order to force through no deal by leaving MPs too little time to pass laws in Parliament aimed at preventing such an outcome. But Chancellor Sajid Javid defended the decision, adding: ""It's right because we are focusing on the people's priorities."" If the prorogation happens as expected, Parliament will be closed for 23 working days. MPs have to approve recess dates, but they cannot block prorogation.

And what is the backstop? The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. Former justice secretary David Gauke, who voted three times for the Withdrawal Agreement in the House of Commons, will meet the prime minister on Monday to ask about the practicalities of securing a deal. ""I want to hear from him as to what is his plan to deliver a deal, when are we putting forward proposals to deal with this backstop issue - which is the one issue he has identified as the problem within the Withdrawal Agreement,"" he said during an interview on Sky News' Sophy Ridge show. ""I want to hear how he's going to address that, and I want to hear how he plans to deliver the legislation if we get a deal by 31 October - because at the moment, frankly, I can't see how he's got time to do that."" The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated between Brussels and former prime minister Theresa May, which has been rejected by Parliament three times. If implemented, it would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit. Mr Johnson has said there has been some movement from the EU, as he attempts to broker a new deal and remove the arrangement, which he has described as ""undemocratic"". However,writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Barnier said: ""On the EU side, we had intense discussions with EU member states on the need to guarantee the integrity of the EU's single market, while keeping that border fully open. ""In this sense, the backstop is the maximum amount of flexibility that the EU can offer to a non-member state."" Mr Barnier also said he was ""not optimistic"" about avoiding a no-deal Brexit, but ""we should all continue to work with determination"". He added: ""The EU is ready to explore all avenues that the UK government may present and that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement."" The EU could not stop the UK from leaving without a deal, he said, but he ""would fail to understand the logic of that choice"" because ""we would still need to solve the same problems after 31 October"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mr Johnson says he wants to leave the EU on 31 October with a deal, but it is ""do or die"" and he is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline. That position has prompted a number of opposition MPs to come together to try to block a possible no deal. MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit are expected to try and seize control of the Parliamentary agenda this week to push through legislation that would force the PM to seek a Brexit extension beyond 31 October. But Mr Johnson has warned Tory MPs who are considering lining up with opposition groups that they risk plunging the country into chaos. In an interview with the Sunday Times, he said:,external""I just say to everybody in the country, including everyone in Parliament, the fundamental choice is this: Are you going to side with Jeremy Corbyn and those who want to cancel the referendum? ""Are you going to side with those who want to scrub the democratic verdict of the people - and plunge this country into chaos. ""Or are you going to side with those of us who want to get on, deliver the mandate of the people and focus with absolute, laser-like precision on the domestic agenda?"" Please upgrade your browser His comments come afterthe Sun reported,externalthat No 10 would stop any Tory MP who votes to block a no-deal Brexit from standing for the party in a general election. The report prompted former chancellor Philip Hammond to say it would be ""staggeringly hypocritical"" for the government to sack Conservative MPs who rebel over its Brexit plans, as eight current cabinet members had themselves defied the party whip this year by voting against Theresa May's Brexit deal. Speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge show, International Development Secretary Alok Sharma said that Mr Johnson must be given time to secure a new deal. ""We want any future agreement not to have the backstopâ¦ The reality is that the previous Withdrawal Agreement, which contained the backstop, did not pass on three occasions. It didn't pass then, it won't pass again,"" he said. ""In fact, having the backstop also potentially makes us rule-takers from the EU forever. That is not what we want. We want that out, we want a deal, but we will be leaving on 31 October - no ifs, no buts."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the same programme that a cross-party group that includes MPs and legal experts is looking at introducing a legislative measure next week to stop a no-deal Brexit without parliamentary approval. ""The technique of that will be published on Tuesday, and I'm hoping that we'll have a debate in which we can bring the House together,"" he said. ""The ultimate goal, very straightforwardly, this week, is to ensure that Parliament can have a final say... we cannot have a prime minister overriding Parliament - not just on this issue, on any issue."" What is prorogation? On Saturday,demonstrations were held across the UKin response to Mr Johnson's plans to suspend Parliament in the run-up to Brexit. The prime minister,who announced the move on Wednesday, said it would enable the government to bring forwards new legislation. But the decision prompted an angry backlash from some politicians and opponents of a no-deal Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Mr Johnson of a ""smash and grab on our democracy"" in order to force through no deal by leaving MPs too little time to pass laws in Parliament aimed at preventing such an outcome. But Chancellor Sajid Javid defended the decision, adding: ""It's right because we are focusing on the people's priorities."" If the prorogation happens as expected, Parliament will be closed for 23 working days. MPs have to approve recess dates, but they cannot block prorogation.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""We will see what the legislation says when it is put forward"" Tory minister Michael Gove has refused to say whether the government would abide by legislation designed to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC MPs would introduce a bill seeking to do that when Parliament returns this week. But asked if the government would abide by this if it succeeded, Mr Gove said: ""Let's see what the legislation says."" Sir Keir described Mr Gove's comments as ""breathtaking"". Cabinet minister Mr Gove also said ""some"" food prices ""may go up"" and ""other prices will come down"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, the EU's lead Brexit negotiatorhas rejected Boris Johnson's demandsfor the controversial Irish backstop to be scrapped. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. The prime minister says he is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline, which has prompted a number of opposition MPs to unite to try and block a possible no deal. Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? Will we see an early election? And other questions Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop 'Get ready for Brexit' campaign launches Sir Keir told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""The legislation is intended to ensure we don't leave without a deal, that will require an extension. ""The length of the extension is secondary, frankly. We have simply got to stop us leaving without a deal."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that plans to block a no-deal Brexit will be published on Tuesday. He said the ""ultimate goal this week"" was to ""ensure Parliament can have a final say"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer: ""The purpose of the legislation... is to prevent us leaving without a deal"" But when asked if the government would abide by legislation preventing a no-deal Brexit, Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Let's see what the legislation says. ""You're asking me about a pig in a poke. ""And I will wait to see what legislation the opposition may try to bring forward.""

Any new law has to pass through all stages of both Houses of Parliament. This would usually take weeks, but it could be done in as little as three days this week. However, the bill could be challenged by the government and fall at any stage. It could fail to achieve enough support from either MPs or peers in votes held in the Houses. Tuesday:MPs return to the Commons after their summer recess. Opposition MPs are expected to put forward legislation to stop no deal under ""SO24"" or Standing Order 24 - the rule that allows MPs to ask for a debate on a ""specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration"". This would be the bill's first reading - its formal introduction to the House. Wednesday:In theory, the bill would then be debated and could potentially pass through all further stages in the Commons. However, the bill must pass through a series of votes and receive backing from more than half of MPs in order to pass on to the next stage. Boris Johnson's first PMQs as prime minister also takes place. Thursday:If MPs passed the bill, it could then reach the House of Lords by Thursday, but consideration of the bill could spill into Monday. It will be debated and voted on. The House is not due to sit on Friday. Monday, 9 September:If the bill passes these hurdles it could gain Royal Assent, which formally makes it law. This could be a tight timetable as there are as few as four sitting days before Parliament is suspended. This is due to happen between Monday, 9 September, and Thursday, 12 September, underplans announced by the prime minister. Boris Johnson says he asked for the suspension in order to hold a Queen's Speech - which sets out a list of laws the government hopes to get approved by Parliament - on 14 October. Another hurdle for any bill could come in the House of Lords. Although opponents to no deal have a large majority, peers wanting to block a piece of legislation could talk and talk until there is no time left. However, opposition parties and those who are against a no-deal Brexit are split on their aims. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said her party's aim this week was to achieve an extension to Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - and then a further referendum. ""We stand by our Stop Brexit stance but we do that via a People's Vote and that's step one,"" she told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday. Although Sir Keir suggested an Article 50 extension will be needed under the legislation plan, Labour has been clear that it wants a general election. And while former justice secretary David Gauke wants to avoid no deal, he has said he ""doesn't want to do anything to facilitate a Jeremy Corbyn government"". ""Indeed, one of my worries about a no-deal Brexit is it will create the chaos in which Jeremy Corbyn could win a general election,"" the Conservative Party MP told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday. However, Mr Gauke said he is minded to put the national interest first if he were forced to choose between disobeying the party whip in a vote to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Referring to reports that Tories who oppose a no-deal option could lose the party whip - which means they would effectively be expelled from the party - he said: ""Sometimes there is a point where you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest. ""And the national interest has to come first. But I hope it doesn't come to that."" Mr Gauke said he will meet the prime minister on Monday to hear what his plan is to deliver a Brexit deal. Pressed on whether there would be shortages of fresh food in a no-deal Brexit scenario, Mr Gove said: ""Everyone will have the food they need."" He added: ""No, there will be no shortages of fresh food."" When asked if food prices would increase, Mr Gove replied: ""I think that there are a number of economic factors in play. ""Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down."" This video can not be played Michael Gove: 'Everyone will have the food they need' He said that freedom of movement will end ""as we understand it"", but added that the EU Settlement Scheme was ""working well"". But trade association the BRC (British Retail Consortium) said Mr Gove's claims on potential fresh food shortages were ""categorically untrue"". ""The retail industry has been crystal clear in its communications with government over the past 36 months that the availability of fresh foods will be impacted as a result of checks and delays at the border,"" a statement said. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium directorAodhÃ¡n Connolly also said Mr Gove's claim was not true. Meanwhile, the government's ""Get Ready for Brexit"" campaign and portal has been launched on its website. Individuals or businesses can answer questions on it on topics including whether they propose to travel to the EU or export to Europe, and it then returns results which suggest how to start preparing for Brexit.

"Lomachenko was taken the distance for only the fifth time as a professional Vasyl Lomachenko produced a battling display to beat Britain's Luke Campbell on points and add the WBC lightweight title to his WBA and WBO belts. Lomachenko, 31, regarded as one of the best pound-for-pound boxers, was made to work hard for the thrilling win. Campbell, also 31, was aiming to become a world champion for the first time but was floored in the 11th as the Ukrainian's class proved decisive. Lomachenko got the verdict 119-108, 119-108, 118-108 at London's O2 Arena. Campbell v Lomachenko reaction & analysis Costello & Bunce podcast: Frampton, Hearn, Lomachenko post-fight reaction Edwards title fight declared no contest after late punch Latest boxing results & schedule Campbell, an Olympic gold medallist in 2012, suffered the third loss of his 23-fight professional career but deserves huge praise for the way he fought back to hear the final bell. ""He is so good, he adapts to any plans,"" said Campbell. ""Tonight was not the jackpot but my time will come."" The Hull man was in trouble at the end of the fifth when he was caught by a crushing left hook and then a barrage of body and head shots, but was saved by the bell. Campbell took more punishment in the sixth, but had success of his own later in that round and the next in a captivating contest. He was floored in the 11th after a barrage of body shots and then a jab. But he got up to finish the fight, although two of the three judges only gave him a round, with the other judge giving him two. Campbell was later taken to hospital but promoter Eddie Hearn said it was only a precautionary measure. Lomachenko's powerful work to the body repeatedly caused Campbell problems A sold-out crowd at the O2 Arena witnessed another fantastic, dominant performance from Lomachenko, a three-weight world champion. This latest victory - in only his 15th fight as a professional - means he now holds three of the main four belts in the lightweight division - Ghana's Richard Commey, the IBF champion, is the man standing between him and being undisputed champion. Lomachenko has also held world titles at featherweight and super-featherweight after an incredible amateur career that saw him win 396 out of 397 bouts and also win Olympic gold medals in Beijing in 2008 and in London four years later. Now, less than five miles from where he won that second gold medal and in his first professional fight in Europe, Lomachenko dazzled from the off. Before the fight, Hearn said it was an ""honour"" to get the Ukrainian to fight in the UK - and he did not disappoint. The right jab proved a constant menace and the left was dangerous, twice rocking Campbell's head back as early as the third round. He also provided some brutal body shots, leaving Campbell wincing in pain in the fourth. Lomachenko told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""He has big amateur experience, he's a smart fighter, a technical fighter and you saw his reach so of course it was hard for me. ""He gave me a good experience and a good fight. I want a unification fight for the four belts."" In the build-up to this fight, legendary promoter Bob Arum said Lomachenko was the greatest technical fighter in boxing since Muhammad Ali and afterwards also compared him to other greats including Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Floyd Mayweather, Oscar de la Hoya and Manny Pacquiao. So to go the distance shows what a gutsy effort it was from Campbell. This was his second world title shot after he lost on a controversial split decision against Jorge Linares in the US in September 2017. On that occasion, Campbell, whose father died two weeks before the fight, was knocked down in the second but fought back, and later insisted he won the fight by a two-round margin. But against Lomachenko it never looked likely that Campbell, a 10-1 underdog, would get the victory, as the Ukrainian was too good, despite the Briton being two inches taller and having a five-inch reach advantage. Lomachenko was fighting a British opponent for only the second time, after knocking out former world champion Anthony Crolla in the fourth round in the US earlier this year. Campbell managed to go the distance, but a shock win was not to happen. Lomachenko wants to become undisputed world champion Former world champion Carl Frampton:""I never expected that. It was down to Luke Campbell who showed such skill alongside grit and determination. His stock has risen dramatically tonight even though he is the loser. I think Lomachenko underplayed how hard that was. I think it's the toughest fight he has had as a professional."" BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello:""Three of the four versions of the title now rest with Vasyl Lomachenko. But people who haven't seen it won't realise how hard he has had to work for it."" BBC Radio 5 Live boxing expert Steve Bunce:""We came for sorcery and were given a display of old-fashioned grit, determination and heart and desire. Such bravery, such guts. The points mean nothing.

"The US has imposed fresh tariffs on $112bn (Â£92bn) of Chinese imports such as shoes, nappies and food. The new tariffs are a sharp escalation in the bruising trade war, and could cost households $800 a year. The move is the first phase of US President Donald Trump's latest plan to place 15% duties on $300bn of Chinese imports by the end of the year. In response, Beijing began to introduce measures targeting $75bn worth of US goods. The measures included a 5% tariff on US crude oil, the first time fuel has been hit in the trade battle between the world's two largest economies. What was initially a dispute over China's allegedly unfair trade practices is increasingly seen as a geopolitical power struggle. A quick guide to the US-China war The US-China trade row in charts So far, Washington has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods to pressure Beijing into changing its policies on intellectual property, industrial subsidies, market access, and the forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms. Beijing has consistently denied that it engages in unfair trade practices, and has retaliated with tariffs on a wide range of US products. Katie Prescott, BBC Business Reporter It's the American consumer who will bear the brunt of these fresh tariffs, unlike previous rounds which have hit the manufacturing sector hardest. Nappies, dishwashers, shoes, clothes, food - looking throughthe 122-page list of eligible products,external, it's hard to find something that's not on there. Many retailers say they have little choice but to pass on the cost to shoppers. The president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, Rick Helfenbein, describes the tariffs as like ""punishing your daughter for something your son did. It makes no sense"". The next round of tariffs on more clothes and big-ticket items like laptops and iPhones are due in December. Mr Trump says this will help to protect spending during the Christmas season. By the end of the year, they'll be in place on almost all goods that the US buys every year from China. And that could add up to $800 to the average household's annual spend, according to Katheryn Russ from the University of California. Businesses are finding it increasingly hard to navigate the uncertainty of the long-running trade dispute. Analysts say that in view of the latest escalation, the prospect of a resolution looks grim. ""It's difficult at this stage to see how there can be a deal or at least a good deal,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC. ""Since talks broke down back in May, the position of both sides has hardened and there have been other complications, namely the Huawei ban and Hong Kong protests, which have made it even more difficult to bridge the gap."" The US government put Huawei on a trade blacklist in May, while Mr Trumphas tied protests in Hong Kong to a possible trade deal with China. If fully imposed, Mr Trump's programme would mean that nearly all Chinese imports - worth about $550bn - would be subject to punitive tariffs. Mr Trump has repeatedly argued that China pays for tariffs, but many US companies have rebutted that claim. More than 200 footwear firms - including Nike and Converse - said the new duties would add to existing tariffs of up to 67% on some shoes, driving up costs for consumers by $4bn each year. Who really pays in a tariff war? 'We're all paying for this' They said the incoming tariffs on footwear would ""also mean these massive tax increases hit tens of millions of Americans when they purchase shoes during the holiday season"". The American Chamber of Commerce in China also voiced concerns after theUS said it was going ahead with new tariffs. ""Our members have long been clear that tariffs are paid by consumers and harm business,""it said in a statement,external. ""We urge... that both sides work towards a sustainable agreement as soon as possible that resolves the fundamental, structural issues foreign businesses have long faced in China."" Mr Trump has said that trade teams from the US and China are continuing to talk and will meet in September, but further details have not been publicly confirmed. From 15 December, the second phase of 15% tariffs will be rolled out on the remainder of Chinese good not previously affected. This includes technology like phones which Mr Trump has sought to protect until now. On the same date, China will roll out tariffs on around 3,000 more US products. The Trump administration plans, in addition, to raise the rates on existing duties from 25% to 30% on 1 October. Mr Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics said this rate could increase further still. ""The tariff rate could go all the way up to 45%,"" he said. ""Those are the goods that do the most damage to China and the least collateral damage to the US."" For the US and Chinese economies, analysts say the pressure created by tariffs is also building. ""The full-blown trade war, together with China's retaliation in kind, could reduce potential US GDP growth in the short run by almost 1%,"" said Gary Hufbauer of the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""The impact on China would be larger, as much as 5%."" Until 20 September, the US trade department will collect public comments on the planned tariff increases to 30%.
