"When the Sousse terrorist attack took place in June 2015 the Tunisian authorities had almost no effective counter-terrorism capability. Still coping with the aftermath of the Arab Spring revolt, they had little to no idea who was posting extremist material online, who they were in contact with, nor even who was professing a desire to carry out violent jihad. Tunisia's shared border with Libya, already by then a haven for extremist Islamist militants, was as porous as a sieve. A lot has changed since then. Although Britain initially upset Tunisia by changing its travel advice to warn against all but essential travel to the country, hurting the tourist industry by effectively advising British tourists not to go there, it has put enormous efforts into helping Tunisia improve its security. Under a scheme run jointly by the Foreign Office and the Home Office, a team of police officers has been deployed from National Counter Terrorism Police headquarters, including specialists in the protection of airports, hotels and resorts and other tourist locations. Together with a team from France, the British experts have been focussing on aviation security, visiting seven Tunisian airports that have all had direct flight connections to the UK, looking at ways to improve security, notably passenger and cargo screening. Alongside the French, Britain's policemen have also been ""training the trainers"", helping Tunisia to set up its own cadre of trainers, teaching them current best practice on how to react to bomb threats or a marauding firearms attack similar to those suffered by Tunisia in 2015. An overseas training film on how to respond to a terrorist attack is now being distributed, similar to the one issued by the police here entitled ""Run, Hide, Tell"". A Whitehall official told the BBC that the aim was to improve the way people respond to an attack, including not just the police and military but hoteliers and other staff at resorts. Since the Sousse attack Tunisia has built a 125-mile border wall with Libya, known as a ""berm"", to try to prevent jihadists crossing over from so-called Islamic State and other training camps. The US and Germany have been the lead advisers here but the UK has provided CCTV equipment and training. British cyber analysts have also been advising the Tunisian authorities on how to find and take down extremist content online. Britain's efforts are part of a G7-plus international initiative to help improve Tunisia's security. It involves all the G7 nations as well as Spain, Belgium, EU, Switzerland and Turkey. In December 2016 Tunisia's minister of the interior came to London and signed a comprehensive memorandum of understanding with Home Secretary Amber Rudd on counter terrorism and counter extremism. Foreign Office Minister, Tobias Elwood, said today: ""It is in the West's interests to help Tunisia boost its security and we have stood by our friend."" Diplomats point out there has not been a significant terrorist attack in Tunisia in over a year. Yet no one is being complacent. It was not until 2013 that the Tunisian authorities even acknowledged they had a security problem, and despite a massive improvement in their capability there remain concerns about porous borders and infiltration by extremists coming from Algeria and southern Libya. There is also the question of returning IS fighters from Syria and Iraq, an area Britain is advising on. Tunisia has one of the highest per capita ratios of fighters going off to join IS. As with Britain, many will now be looking to come home.

"There is a quiet revolution happening in the NHS in England.  It's under the radar and has been little commented on till now. Details of the potentially radical changes will emerge at the end of March. There is, apparently, no need for new legislation. In effect, the controversial health reforms of 2012 will be bypassed in some parts of England. Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, will unveil his thinking in late March but he has given some clues to MPs on the Public Accounts Committee. His aim in some areas is to abolish a fundamental feature of the structure of the NHS in England - what's known as the purchaser/provider split. Health reforms by the Conservative government in the early 1990s created a divide between ""purchasers"", which have evolved into the current Clinical Commissioning Groups, and ""providers"", which are the hospitals and other trusts. Purchasers control budgets allocated by NHS England and commission care on behalf of their local patients. Providers deliver that care in return for a fee known as the tariff. The theory was that the split would deliver value for money with purchasers shopping around for care provision. But critics now say that there are tensions which impede an efficient use of resources. Simon Stevens has signalled the end of the purchaser-provider split Hospitals, so they argue, are incentivised to get as many patients through their doors as they can to generate income. This pulls against moves to treat more people outside hospitals. Mr Stevens wants to see local health economies run as single entities with no purchaser/provider split. The pioneers will be the most successful Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs). These plans have been put together in 44 areas of England involving health and social care chiefs trying to work out the best use of their joint resources in the face of rising patient demand. Half a dozen, or possibly more STPs, which have already started evolving into management bodies, will be unveiled as the first of this new breed of health organisations, which will both set local health priorities and manage local services. Joined-up care will be the mantra. Crucially they will be given so called ""capitation"" budgets. This will be a set sum per person in that area, regardless of whether they need care or not. This model is used in parts of other countries, including Valencia in Spain. To use another piece of jargon, there are ""accountable care organisations"". A key feature is the built-in incentive to keep people out of hospitals. If managers are receiving the same amount of money each year for every local resident whatever their state of health, so the theory goes, they will be more inclined to treat people away from hospitals where possible. The Clinical Commissioning Groups, a key part of the structure set up by the then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2012, will, in effect, be sidelined in these new local care models. Decision-making power on health spending, covering hospital and community care, will be concentrated in single organisations. The leadership of NHS England, it seems, is confident these changes can be implemented within the existing legal parameters. No big bang new legislation will be required. So the health service in parts of England will look very different from how the NHS works in others. The idea is that the fastest ships in the convoy will lead the way and other areas can catch up when appropriate. Ministers, I am told, are ready to go along with this process as long as it can be shown to work effectively. There are no ideological hang-ups in government, it seems, and pragmatic moves to make health and social care work better are the priority in Whitehall. What we don't know is how MPs will react when it becomes clear that such important changes are happening without full parliamentary debate. Some on the left of the health debate believe that accountable care organisations are a Trojan horse for privatisation. They argue that the process will lead to further fragmentation of the NHS. There has already been opposition to the STP process, seen by some as a cover for cuts. It may all sound rather technical and interesting only to policy wonks. But this is potentially the biggest change of its kind in a quarter of a century.  Watch this space at the end of March.

"This video can not be played A look inside Wrexham's new super-prison The ""poster child"" of Britain's super prisons is opening in Wrexham. But how will HMP Berwyn compare to other jails? It cost Â£250m to build and has a capacity of 2,106 prisoners - 500 more than the biggest current prison in England and Wales was built to hold. And HMP Berwyn in Wrexham is welcoming its first inmates on Tuesday. The prison service has come under increasing pressure in recent years due to overcrowding, with 6,000 assaults on staff and 105 suicides up to June 2016. Inside Britain's new super-prison The UK government has pledged to spend Â£1.3bn on new prisons, and after the riots in HMP Birmingham last year, Justice Secretary Liz Truss said the new Welsh prison ""will help to reduce overcrowding across the estate"". HMP Berwyn is the government's first publicly-run super-prison - holding more than 2,000 inmates. Nine more new prisonsare expected to open by 2020. Andrew Neilsen, from the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""Berwyn has become a bit of a poster child for super-prisons. It is the first public sector prison to be opened in England and Wales since the 1990s, and they want to show it can work. ""Russell Trent, the governor, is seen as a high-flying trouble-shooter. He has turned around failing institutions in the past. He has been tasked with setting up an institution and getting it off on the right foot."" But just how much difference will HMP Berwyn make, and does it herald a new era for prisons in England and Wales? When the building of HMP Berwyn was started it was set to provide 500 more places than the current biggest prison in England and Wales - privately run HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire. Privately-run Oakwood, managed by security company G4S, had 1,600 places when it opened in 2012. However, due to overcrowding in prisons across the UK, Oakwood further increased its capacity last year by converting some single cells into rooms which could hold two inmates and can now hold up to 2,096 prisoners. The vast majority of prisoners in England an Wales are housed in what the Ministry of Justice define as a ""good, decent standard of accommodation"" - known as ""certified normal accommodation"" or CNA. An additional 6,512 prisoners are currently incarcerated over that number. While the 2,106 new prison places provided by HMP Berwyn will help address this, they will not all be instantly available as HMP Berwyn will not function at capacity for some time. The new super prison is anticipated to be the cheapest to run per prisoner in England and Wales. It is expected to run at Â£14,000 per head per year, including overheads. The second cheapest prison will be the second biggest - HMP Oakwood - at Â£19,505 per head. America's LA County jail isalmost 10 times bigger than HMP Berwyn,externalwith around 17,000 inmates, although it is not strictly comparable as it is made up of a collection of facilities spread over a wide area. The United States does have the highest incarceration rates in the world with figures for 2014 showing 690 prisoners for every 100,000 people, compared to 146 in England and Wales. England and Wales had the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe,according to Eurostat figures,externalfor 2014. The prison population in the UK hasalmost doubledsince 1993 over a period when the overall population of England and Wales has grown by about 17%.

"This video can not be played Meet Allen Pembroke, the British holidaymaker who went back to the beach Allen Pembroke has had the same nightmare 50 times. So far. It is late morning on 26 June 2015. He is on the beach in the Tunisian resort of Port El Kantaoui near Sousse. The Islamist gunman Seifeddine Rezgui is in the midst of his shooting rampage targeting British and other European holidaymakers at the Imperial hotel. Many are already dead. Mr Pembroke is trying to comfort a badly-injured British woman, when suddenly he realises Rezgui has returned to the beach and is standing behind them, about to open fire. Somehow he manages to grab the high-powered assault rifle and turn it so it is pointing into the air. It is then that Mr Pembroke wakes up in a sweat after lashing out. Sometimes he throws punches in his sleep. Almost two years after the attack, which he and his wife witnessed close-up, they are still struggling to overcome the trauma, despite destroying all photographs, documents and other memorabilia from the trip. Who were the British victims? What exactly happened on the day? Thirty of the 38 people killed by a gunman on a Tunisian beach were British ""It's had a massive impact,"" says Mr Pembroke, 62, who works as a service manager at a car company in London. ""It's never going to go, and unfortunately since that day there've been several other terrorist incidents. ""With each incident, it's recall, we re-live the day. ""Even the start of the inquest... it just re-opens the wound."" While many caught up in the attack ran for their lives when the shooting began, Mr Pembroke did something very different. After hearing the first shots on the beach, he and his wife ran to their room a few metres away in a hotel next to the Imperial. ""While I am dragging her to the room, I could hear rapid gunfire, screaming, and bullets flying overhead,"" he said. ""I took her to the room and said, 'Stay there, please don't open the door, stay away from the window and lie on the floor.'"" Mr Pembroke then ran straight back to the beach towards the sound of the gunfire. ""I just wanted to helpâ¦ I couldn't just secure myself in the room. I would have felt cowardly because I'd seen people go down, there was screaming. ""I thought, I've got some basic first aid skills, so let me see what I can do."" Cheryl Mellor lost a hand in the attack Among the sun loungers close to the water's edge, he found people lying in pools of blood with injuries so horrific he did not want the details to be repeated. He also found Cheryl Mellor, still alive after being shot in the leg and arm, drifting in and out of consciousness. ""I asked her if she was English and she replied that she was. So I said, 'My name is Allen and I will do what I can to help.'"" Her hand had been blown off by the impact of a high velocity round from Rezgui's Kalashnikov rifle. Mr Pembroke grabbed a scarf and tied it around her arm as a makeshift tourniquet and then used a towel to stem the bleeding from her leg. But the most difficult task was yet to come. Mrs Mellor wanted to know what had happened to her husband, Stephen, who was lying nearby with severe wounds to his chest. Mr Pembroke checked his pulse but there was nothing. ""Do you really want to know?"" Mr Pembroke asked. ""Yes,"" she replied. She passed out when he told her that her husband was dead. Later he offered to carry her to safety but she insisted on staying next to her husband, saying she would play dead if the gunman returned to the beach. He did, but she survived. Mr Pembroke spent 20 minutes on the beach comforting Mrs Mellor and checking to see if any other holidaymakers who had been shot were still alive. He says he was alone and no one else was helping. ""I saw no military or medical staff and it's only in recent reports that I found out that the police waited, they fainted, they hid. ""That's unforgivable, they need to be accountable for that."" By the end of the attack 38 people, including 30 Britons, were killed. Rezgui was later shot dead by police. Although still haunted by what he saw on that day, Mr Pembroke has tried to resume a normal life. But he has taken on another job as well. He is now a trained community first responder for the voluntary organisation, St John Ambulance. He also remains in regular contact with Mrs Mellor, so they can help support each other. ""It gives me some peace,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Watch: Why 5G could be ready to deploy by 2020 The hot topic at Mobile World Congress this year is not a new phone -apart from the Nokia 3310, they all look the same. Nor is it a new technology like virtual reality - compared with last year, there seem to be fewer VR headsets around. No, the biggest thing in Barcelona is something invisible that doesn't yet exist, 5G. The hype about the potential of the next generation of mobile networks has reached new heights, with every major company exhibiting here eager to explain how it will be at the cutting edge of the coming 5G revolution. Mobile World Congress offers industry insiders a chance to see new technology and strike deals Governments too have decided it is now technologically correct (can I coin the term TC?) to rave about the importance to the economy of being 5G-ready. On the UK stand, the Trade Minister, Greg Hands, told me funds would continue to pour into 5G research post-Brexit. Over at the Intel stand, they had gone as far as to build a prototype 5G network to give us a feel of what this new connected paradise would be like. There was an autonomous car, a connected home, and a smart lamppost all talking to the network at breakneck speed. Visitors were invited to don a Microsoft HoloLens headset for an augmented reality display of seas of data flowing round the stand and up into the sky. Microsoft is betting that computer users will want to see graphics superimposed over real-world views It was easy to forget there was still no agreement on exactly what constitutes 5G, and most countries still had to work out what spectrum would be needed and how they would allocate it. More important, perhaps, there is no sense that consumers know anything about it or have any sense that they want it - in fact my sense is that most would prefer to see a bit more of the 4G vision realised before the next revolution comes along. Giant drone works in rain and winds Wikipedia goes data-free in Iraq Google's UK launch plan for Home speaker Sony launches super-slow-mo phone Nokia 3310 mobile phone resurrected Samsung unveils tablets but no phones LG G6 phone is made for split-screen apps But Intel's Aicha Evans did a good job explaining why we should be excited about the promise of 5G. She told me: ""Think about what was life like without smartphones - start there,"" and then explained that just as that revolution had connected people, so this next one would allow everything else to get connected, enabling all sorts of advances in the way we live. Intel says 5G will deliver faster data speeds Now, Intel is a hardware company that stands to benefit as the telecoms industry has to retool for 5G, but I came away from the exhibit almost convinced. But then I ran into two 5G sceptics. The first was a senior executive at one of the world's biggest mobile operators, who took a very cynical view of his industry's current state. ""Who's going to pay for it?"" he asked me, adding operators were already seeing their margins squeezed, as they battled with nimble newcomers such as WhatsApp, and had little appetite to pour money into 5G without seeing much of a return. Cars, robots and other electronics could all benefit from access to 5G data The second was a chief technologist at a major networking equipment company - one that could stand to benefit from the 5G rollout. But he described the hype around the technology as  ""irrational exuberance"" - the same term used by an economist warning in the late 1990s about the dot-com bubble. He believed that current advances in 4G - what's known as Gigabit LTE, which enables much faster data rates over existing networks - offered a more practical and affordable solution. Samsung also discussed its 5G plans at its MWC press conference Nevertheless, he said, there was such a head of steam behind 5G that it was likely to happen, just as the dot-com bubble had led to vast and unaffordable investments in fibre networks. But the result was likely to be another radical reshaping of the telecoms industry, So the 5G revolution is coming. But who will benefit and who will end up going bust as a result of it is far from clear.

"The motor industry is anticipating the era of connected, driverless vehicles An almighty row has broken out over who should have access to all the data new cars generate. Manufacturers want to have control of it all, but independent repair shops, fleet operators, insurance companies and anyone else who could benefit from this data, argue that this would be blatantly anti-competitive. Policy wonks in the European Union are currently wrestling with the issue. So why should you care? Because it could mean that your car servicing costs become more expensive and you may have to pay more for other services that rely on such data, from independent repair centres to ""pay-as-you-drive"" insurance companies. Modern cars are effectively computers on wheels, full of sensors measuring everything from the wear and tear on your brake pads to your fuel efficiency. They are capable of communicating wirelessly with manufacturers, traffic management systems, and other vehicles in real time. So your car's manufacturer probably knows where you've been, how fast you drove, and how soon you're likely to need a service. And it wants to turn this knowledge in to money. Hyundai vice chairman Euisun Chung talks about connected cars in Las Vegas Say your car's onboard sensors detect that a certain part is about to fail. The manufacturer will have wireless access to that data and could then alert you and even book a service for you automatically. That sounds convenient and useful, right? But what if the repair centre is owned by the car manufacturer? You might not be getting the best price for the new parts and servicing. And what if their authorised repair centre is a lot further away than your local garage? ""While the manufacturer is monitoring the car, it has the power to recommend its own spare parts. This is a privileged position and would distort the market,"" says Neil Pattemore, technical director at FIGIEFA, the European association representing car parts retailers and repair shops. ""We exist to offer consumers choice - it's about freedom of where you want to get your car repaired."" The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) is arguing that car makers should be allowed to send all this ""in-vehicle"" data to their own cloud platforms and control who has access to it and under what terms. Allowing ""direct third-party access to vehicular electronic systems would jeopardise safety, (cyber)security and vehicle integrity"", it argues. Some car makers already allow phone apps to synchronise with in-car systems Manufacturers say they're worried about hackers taking control of a car's electronic systems, as has beenshown to bepossible onseveral occasions. They also fear that allowing third parties to peer in to their cars' ""brains"" would jeopardise ""trade secrets, know-how or information covered by intellectual property rights"". But a growing number of industry bodies think this has more to do with manufacturers trying to control a potentially lucrative business. ""In the connected era, every vehicle will have its own in-built telematics device and the functionality of a smartphone,"" says Gerry Keaney, chief executive of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA). ""The data this generates opens up a whole new range of opportunities to develop driver-based infotainment or navigation services. ""It also promises to revolutionise the ways vehicles are maintained and managed, enabling vehicle owners to share them between multiple users, fix them before they break down or streamline the repair and servicing process. ""There are huge amounts of money to be made or saved here, but only if you have access to the vehicle data,"" he says. In future, cars will warn us long before they break down At the moment all cars have to have an onboard diagnostic (OBD) port. This allows mechanics to plug in a cable and access the data stored in the car's computer or electronic control unit (ECU). Under European law every manufacturer has to fit one, primarily so testers can gain access to emissions data and check that the vehicles comply with pollution regulations. But, obviously, mechanics can only access the OBD when the vehicle is stationary. So unless they can access this diagnostics data wirelessly, they say they will be at a competitive disadvantage. The ACEA says manufacturers would be prepared to share this kind of data with third parties through their own cloud servers or via ""neutral"" servers operated by other companies. But Mr Keaney says his members and vehicle owners would then have to go ""cap in hand"" to the manufacturers to access it, and would probably have to pay for it. ""Independent service providers will suffer and there will be less choice for consumers and vehicle owners,"" he says. Would losing control of car data harm independent repair shops? The UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) acknowledges that ""overly restrictive access [to car data] may stifle innovation and competition, and restrict consumer choice"". ""SMMT is currently working with all parties involved to ensure a better understanding of the issues involved, while a common solution is currently being discussed at a European level,"" says Tamzen Isacsson, director of communications and international. The aftercare industry wants equal access to wireless in-vehicle data and believes the technology is already here that could provide it securely. Public cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure run programs called hypervisors that create virtual machines on computer servers. These virtual machines enable many different clients to store their data safely and separately on one computer, thereby saving computing resources. It's the technology that has enabled cloud computing to take off in the way that it has. ""Cars could also run hypervisors that allow virtual environments and enable third parties to access car data in a safe and secure way,"" says FIGIEFA's Mr Pattemore. Several other industry bodies - Cecra, FiA, ADPA, Leaseurope and others - agree, saying that an ""in-vehicle interoperable, standardised, secure and open-access platform"" would be preferable to preserve a competitive market. This may be a complex issue, but it could directly affect the pound in your pocket. Expect to hear far more about this in the months to come.

"Theresa May watched the opening stages of the Brexit debate in the Lords It's not that peers are trying to block Brexit. They have been adamant, time and again, that's not their game. But tomorrow they are voting on a change they are trying to make to the government's Article 50 law (the legal process that will start Brexit), by pushing the government to give guarantees about the future of the three million or so people from other countries in the EU who live here. Time and again Theresa May has said that she wants them to have ""reciprocal rights"" - to be allowed to stay and live as they wish - as long as Brits abroad get the same entitlements. And time and again, she has said she wants to settle the issue early in the Brexit negotiations, and is hopeful of doing so. Ministers have stopped short of giving a firm guarantee though. That's what peers want, and a Labour amendment tomorrow with support from peers from all parties will push for exactly that. And it seems there is enough support in the House of Lords to back the plan. That means defeat for the government, and embarrassment for Theresa May. This afternoon, the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, haswritten to all membersof the House of Lords in an effort to reassure. In the letter, she says that ""nothing will change for any EU citizen, whether already resident in the UK or moving from the EU, without Parliament's approval"". The letter is not that different to what was sent to MPs previously to try to ease their minds, as the Article 50 legislation made its way through the House of Commons. It does though appear to kill off the idea that Theresa May will arbitrarily set a cut off date for EU immigration without having to get MPs or peers onside first. But it is unlikely to spare the government's blushes tomorrow. Without a further more dramatic concession, they are set to lose. That will set in train the first 'ping' of the potential 'ping pong' -  the Parliamentary process where the Lords reject something in the red chamber, sending it back down the corridors to the green benches - daring, imploring perhaps, backbenchers to join with them and push back at the government. There is no sign at the moment that ministers want to budge on this issue. There's frustration that they have so far not been able to resolve it with their EU counterparts. One cabinet minister told me it's ""the Germans standing in the way"". They are refusing to discuss anything at all until the formal process is underway. A senior EU source though suggested this could have been dealt with already if Number 10 had played it differently. They argued, if Theresa May had tried to resolve the issue first with European Council president Donald Tusk on behalf of the whole of the EU, there could have been an early deal. But by going to Germany first, seeming to try to deal country by country, it would never have been possible for Frau Merkel to agree. The source suggested this was an example of how Number 10 is yet to understand fully how much the dynamics of the EU dictate that the other 27 will try to stick together. Better handling of that could, perhaps, have avoided tomorrow's likely defeat. Yet a predictable loss in the Lords may in one way be no bad thing for the government at this early stage of the whole process. The Lords aren't going to block Brexit, but they do want to make their voices heard. And a source suggested that tomorrow's defeat ""is not that bad for either side"". Once the legislation makes it back to the Commons, if there are only a handful of Tory backbenchers who pile in on this issue, the government may well be able to ride it out. But that is a big if. Ministers are well aware that tomorrow's defeat may well be the first of many. For a long time there have been warnings that Brexit is going to get pretty bumpy for the government in Parliament. It's true that Theresa May has had to give a few concessions here and there to avoid defeat but tomorrow, for the first time, the government is likely to be beaten over Brexit. Not by MPs, but by the House of Lords. Sources tell me they don't just expect ministers to be beaten, but for the opposition to ""win handsomely"".

"Liverpool's Pier Head hosted the opening stage of the Tour of Britain in 2014 Liverpool has offered to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games after hosts Durban admitted it might not be able to afford it. South Africa's sports minister Fikile Mbalula said the government had been forced to have a rethink due tofinancial restraints. Liverpool,which is bidding to host the 2026 games, has now offered to step in if Durban cannot host. The Commonwealth Games Federation will make the final decision over Durban. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson has written to Sports Minister Tracey Crouch to express the city's interest after Commonwealth Games officials hinted another host might be needed. Mayor Joe Anderson with gymnasts holding 2026 placards A Liverpool City Council spokesperson said: ""Liverpool is interested in hosting the games in 2022. ""We had heard rumours that Durban might be unable to deliver the Commonwealth Games in 2022 and have already indicated to the government that we are very willing to host them instead."" Durban was awarded the Games in 2015 after being the only city to make a confirmed bid. But the South African government has been unable to come to agreement with the Commonwealth Games Federation over paying for the tournament. Mr Mbalula said: ""It does not look like we will find each other. ""We have given it our best shot, but we cannot live beyond our means.""

"Nicki Owen and her daughter Hundreds of women have been affected by a rare, under-diagnosed condition that causes heart attacks in otherwise young, healthy people. Here, two of them discuss their experiences. Nicki Owen gave birth two weeks after suffering a heart attack. She began having severe chest pains while she was 29 weeks into her second pregnancy. ""I'd been in and out of hospital during my pregnancy,"" the 37-year-old music teacher from Hull told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""But I knew this was something bad."" After ringing 999, she underwent an electrocardiogram (ECG) test, which showed something was abnormal with her heart. However, even then, the paramedics said she was not having a heart attack, telling her she was simply having a panic attack. ""They didn't rush me in and when I eventually got to hospital I was forced to play an impossible waiting game,"" she said. ""They told me it couldn't be my heart because of my age and that I was pretty healthy. When the pain became unbearable the nurses gave me a paracetamol as they were convinced there wasn't anything seriously wrong."" In fact, Nicki had suffered a Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD), a rare and often undiagnosed condition, which mainly affects women - frequently during or soon after pregnancy. It occurs when there is a sudden tear in one of the coronary arteries, blocking the flow of blood to the heart. One of Nicki's arteries was found to be 95% blocked. She was kept in hospital while the doctors decided what to do with her and her baby. However, two weeks later, 31 weeks into her pregnancy, her daughter Erin was born. After the birth, Nicki started suffering further chest pains and was rushed to another hospital for treatment, leaving her newborn daughter behind. Two years on, she remains reliant on eight pills a day and avoids any strenuous exercise. ""When you look at me I am young and slim and I don't look like a typical heart attack patient,"" she says. However, she is one of an unknown number of people - overwhelmingly young, healthy women - who have suffered heart attacks. Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is an under-diagnosed heart condition It affects mainly women, occasionally during or soon after pregnancy Menopause, extreme stress and exercise have also been associated with it During an attack, a sudden tear or a bruise develops in one of the coronary arteries blocking the blood follow It can cause death, heart failure, cardiac arrest and require heart bypass surgery Source:Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit,external Kate Alderton suffered her heart attack at the age of 30, the day after taking part in a 10km run. A physically fit and keen runner who was averaging about 20 miles on the road every week, she began having intense chest pains while eating breakfast. The paramedics initially thought she too was having a panic attack. However, she had also suffered a SCAD. Kate Alderton suffered her heart attack at the age of 30 ""No one was able to tell me whether I would recover and whether I would see my children's next birthdays,"" the mother-of-two said. ""It was the most frightening experience of my life and I was shell-shocked by it all."" She was eventually seen by an expert cardiologist. ""I am extremely lucky to have seen a doctor who knew about the condition, as it is not very well known at all. ""As I was so young, fit and also a dietician - so careful with what I eat - no-one would have known that I had actually experienced this."" Kate has now recovered and is back running. However, she has been advised against having any more children. Health experts still do not know why SCADs happen, or if they are preventable. Dr David Adlam, from the Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, says they are different to a common heart attack and are therefore much harder to diagnose. Coronary heart disease - the leading cause of heart attacks - is caused by coronary arteries becoming clogged with cholesterol. However, a SCAD is caused by a sudden tear to an artery. Dr Adlam says it is hard to know how many people a year die from SCAD, as it is almost impossible to diagnose after death. However, he said research suggested nine in 10 cases involved women, while about 10% of cases affected women who were either pregnant or had recently given birth. Dr Adlam said there were about 450 recovering patients attached to his hospital, including about 400 from the UK. He said SCADs usually affected ""young, fit people with no history of heart disease"", meaning symptoms were often dismissed as anxiety, panic attacks, indigestion and other conditions. ""It's important that a diagnosis of SCAD is not delayed, which is why we want to get people talking about the condition. The sooner a diagnosis is made, the better the outcome is likely to be,"" he added. Meanwhile, Nicki says it is time more health professionals knew the symptoms of SCAD. ""There is a survivors' group I am a member of and the profile of us all is that we are young and slim,"" she says. ""I think they need to look past the initial appearance of these women because they need to realise there is something seriously wrong.""

"Durban won the bid to host the Games in 2015 Durban may be unable to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games because of financial constraints, South Africa's sports minister has said. ""We gave it our best shot but we can't go beyond. If the country says we don't have this money, we can't,"" Reuters quoted Fikile Mbalula as saying. He said a final decision would be made by the Commonwealth Games Federation. Durban was awarded the Games in 2015 after being the only city to make a confirmed bid. In December, South African officials had said the country was ""fully committed"" to hosting the event. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories The government had estimated the Games could generate up to 20 billion rand ($1.5 bn; Â£1.2bn) in economic benefit. But Mr Mbalula said the government had been forced to reconsider. ""I don't want to raise your expectations and say everything looks good, it doesn't because we don't agree on the fundamentals and that is the operational budget,"" he told a media briefing. The Commonwealth Games Federation said it was in the final stages of reviewing a submission by Durban and it would make a recommendation as soon as the evaluation was complete. The possible withdrawal of Durban has sparked interest in the British city of Liverpool. A spokesperson for the city council said: ""Liverpool is interested in hosting the games in 2022. We had heard rumours that Durban might be unable to deliver the Commonwealth Games in 2022 and have already indicated to the government that we are very willing to host them instead."" The Games were first staged in 1930 and are held every four years. They feature athletes from more than 50 countries, mostly former British colonies.

"The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has been warning left-wing members of Labour that there is a ""soft coup"" aimed at weakening then toppling Jeremy Corbyn. Writing for Labour Briefing he said: ""It's planned, co-ordinated and fully resourced. It is being perpetrated by an alliance between elements in the Labour Party and the Murdoch media empire, both intent on destroying Jeremy Corbyn and all that he stands for. ""The coup is not being waged up front in public but strictly behind the scenes."" But soon after publication, his spokesman pointed out that the article had been written - although not published - before the party's defeat in the Copeland by-election, adding that the shadow chancellor was now calling for ""unity."" Don't give up Corbyn urges Labour The churn in Corbyn's shadow cabinet Analysis: Three problems for Labour And shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner told the BBC that Mr McDonnell's comments were prompted by ""frustration"" at what was seen as an unhelpful contribution from the former party leader Tony Blair on Europe - ahead of by-elections in two Brexit-backing areas. So is there really a coup being plotted against Mr Corbyn? Well, yes - but not in the conventional sense. Last year, more than eight out of ten Labour MPs voted for a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn, but still failed to oust him when the increasingly left-wing membership simply re-elected him, and with a bigger mandate than before. His opponents won't be taking that road again, because it is still likely to be a dead end. Instead, a slower diversionary route is being seen by some as the way forward. One of Mr Corbyn's staunchest backers has been Len McCluskey, the leader of Britain's biggest union, Unite. His former flatmate Tom Watson - Labour's deputy leader - failed to persuade Mr McCluskey in turn to persuade Mr Corbyn to agree a leaving date from the party leadership last summer. But Mr McCluskey is up for re-election at the end of April and is being challenged by West Midlands organiser Gerard Coyne, who is politically to his right. One of Mr Corbyn's staunchest backers has been Unite's Len McCluskey Mr Coyne's initial pitch was that the union was too focused on Westminster politics under Mr McCluskey and not enough on members' interests. But following the Copeland defeat, he has more explicitly attacked Mr McCluskey and Mr Corbyn - accusing the former of wasting members' money propping up the latter and calling for loans made to Mr Corbyn's re-election campaign to be repaid rather than written off. The implication is that a Coyne-led union wouldn't be funding a Corbyn-led Labour Party and that a new general secretary of Unite would apply pressure on the Labour leader to stand down. West Brom v Liverpool for union top job However, some of Mr Corbyn's critics at Westminster believe the Coyne campaign so far has had too subtle a message to gain prominent media coverage and should be more explicit about wanting to see the Labour leader deposed. So far, these Corbyn critics aren't confident that Mr Coyne will succeed in his bid to become the next general secretary of Unite. And - frankly - even if he does, he might be constrained by a more left-wing union executive if he were to try to pull the plug on the current party leadership. So the real battle is being waged largely beneath the radar at the party's grassroots. And it is Mr Corbyn's supporters who are being accused of trying to mount a coup. Mr Corbyn's opponents say the real coup is the one being plotted by those close to the leadership. They argue that those on the left of the party want to change Labour irrevocably and ensure it can't return to its Blairite past. While polling suggests that Mr Corbyn isn't a popular leader, the argument goes that the left can't afford to ditch him unless an equally left-wing leader could be guaranteed to succeed him. So the ""coup"" that Mr Corbyn's critics would point to is this: an attempt to change Labour's leadership rules to enable a left-wing successor to get on the ballot. Currently a candidate for the leadership requires the support of 15% of MPs and MEPs before the wider, left-wing membership gets a chance to vote for them. Mr Corbyn only succeeded in getting on to the ballot in 2015 because some of those to his right ""lent"" support to ""broaden the debate"" following the party's unexpectedly bad election result. That simply wouldn't happen again. A potential change to the Labour leadership ballot rules has been dubbed the ""McDonnell amendment"" by Mr Corbyn's critics So at this year's annual party conference in September it is almost certain delegates will be given the option to reduce that threshold from 15% to just 5% - a much smaller hurdle for a left-wing candidate to overcome. That would mean a leadership candidate would need the backing of just 13 elected politicians instead of 37 before being able to put themselves forward to the wider membership. This has been dubbed the ""McDonnell amendment"" by Mr Corbyn's critics. They say this rule change could see the party leadership ""transfer"" to the shadow chancellor, who failed to get on to the leadership ballot in 2007 when Tony Blair stood down, because he gained too few nominations from his fellow politicians. But he has denied any leadership ambitions and, in truth, it could be younger left-wing shadow cabinet members such as Rebecca Long-Bailey or Angela Rayner who would benefit from a lower threshold. Another potential beneficiary could be Clive Lewis, who resigned from the shadow cabinet over the leadership's backing for triggering Article 50 - breaking with those around Mr Corbyn in the process - but potentially endearing himself to the largely pro-Remain membership. He has denied already registering internet domain names for a leadership bid. But internal groups such as Labour First and Progress - put over-simply, Brownites and Blairites - are working closely together to try to prevent any of the above from succeeding. Their view is that if Mr Corbyn was simply replaced by someone with similar politics, Labour would have missed an opportunity to appeal to a wider electorate who believe the party is now too left-wing. So they are battling against the proposed leadership rule changes. The only way to stop the changes is to get more anti-Corbyn delegates to Labour's conference this autumn than those who support the leadership. That means getting more of the leadership's critics along to the local constituency meetings that choose the delegates. Mr Corbyn only succeeded in getting on to the ballot in 2015 because some of those to his right ""lent"" support to broaden the debate It's estimated that perhaps about 55% of last year's conference delegates were not Corbyn supporters and his critics believe they can succeed in delivering a similar, if not slightly better, number this year. Labour First recruited a full time organiser last month to assist in this project. With a large influx of left wing members following Labour's 2015 defeat, the assumption was that many local Labour parties would move to the left. But that has not been happening on quite the scale that was imagined, with some of the more recent members being happier to vote electronically in leadership elections for Mr Corbyn than attending what can often be tedious meetings to nominate conference delegates. And Mr Corbyn's opponents say that in recent internal elections - even in parts of London that would be assumed to be pro-Corbyn - those supportive of the leadership have been defeated. If this year's conference were to reject a change to the leadership rules, the issue can't be raised again for three years - in other words, until after the next election. That is likely to mean that Mr Corbyn would be urged by his inner circle to stay on until 2020 (assuming no early election) because a left-wing legacy couldn't be guaranteed. At the weekend Mr Corbyn made it clear that was indeed his intention to contest the next general election - but the working assumption by some others in leadership positions is that he would ideally want to stand aside in 2018 if a suitable successor were to emerge. To give him that option,  Momentum - the group set up to support him and to turn Labour into more of a social movement than a conventional political party - will have to work hard to defeat his opponents at the grassroots. This won't be as glamorous as the two summers of leadership rallies that have gone before, but might be far more important in determining the future direction of the main party of opposition.

"This video can not be played A look inside Wrexham's new super-prison The ""poster child"" of Britain's super prisons is opening in Wrexham. But how will HMP Berwyn compare to other jails? It cost Â£250m to build and has a capacity of 2,106 prisoners - 500 more than the biggest current prison in England and Wales was built to hold. And HMP Berwyn in Wrexham is welcoming its first inmates on Tuesday. The prison service has come under increasing pressure in recent years due to overcrowding, with 6,000 assaults on staff and 105 suicides up to June 2016. Inside Britain's new super-prison The UK government has pledged to spend Â£1.3bn on new prisons, and after the riots in HMP Birmingham last year, Justice Secretary Liz Truss said the new Welsh prison ""will help to reduce overcrowding across the estate"". HMP Berwyn is the government's first publicly-run super-prison - holding more than 2,000 inmates. Nine more new prisonsare expected to open by 2020. Andrew Neilsen, from the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""Berwyn has become a bit of a poster child for super-prisons. It is the first public sector prison to be opened in England and Wales since the 1990s, and they want to show it can work. ""Russell Trent, the governor, is seen as a high-flying trouble-shooter. He has turned around failing institutions in the past. He has been tasked with setting up an institution and getting it off on the right foot."" But just how much difference will HMP Berwyn make, and does it herald a new era for prisons in England and Wales? When the building of HMP Berwyn was started it was set to provide 500 more places than the current biggest prison in England and Wales - privately run HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire. Privately-run Oakwood, managed by security company G4S, had 1,600 places when it opened in 2012. However, due to overcrowding in prisons across the UK, Oakwood further increased its capacity last year by converting some single cells into rooms which could hold two inmates and can now hold up to 2,096 prisoners. The vast majority of prisoners in England an Wales are housed in what the Ministry of Justice define as a ""good, decent standard of accommodation"" - known as ""certified normal accommodation"" or CNA. An additional 6,512 prisoners are currently incarcerated over that number. While the 2,106 new prison places provided by HMP Berwyn will help address this, they will not all be instantly available as HMP Berwyn will not function at capacity for some time. The new super prison is anticipated to be the cheapest to run per prisoner in England and Wales. It is expected to run at Â£14,000 per head per year, including overheads. The second cheapest prison will be the second biggest - HMP Oakwood - at Â£19,505 per head. America's LA County jail isalmost 10 times bigger than HMP Berwyn,externalwith around 17,000 inmates, although it is not strictly comparable as it is made up of a collection of facilities spread over a wide area. The United States does have the highest incarceration rates in the world with figures for 2014 showing 690 prisoners for every 100,000 people, compared to 146 in England and Wales. England and Wales had the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe,according to Eurostat figures,externalfor 2014. The prison population in the UK hasalmost doubledsince 1993 over a period when the overall population of England and Wales has grown by about 17%.

"The motor industry is anticipating the era of connected, driverless vehicles An almighty row has broken out over who should have access to all the data new cars generate. Manufacturers want to have control of it all, but independent repair shops, fleet operators, insurance companies and anyone else who could benefit from this data, argue that this would be blatantly anti-competitive. Policy wonks in the European Union are currently wrestling with the issue. So why should you care? Because it could mean that your car servicing costs become more expensive and you may have to pay more for other services that rely on such data, from independent repair centres to ""pay-as-you-drive"" insurance companies. Modern cars are effectively computers on wheels, full of sensors measuring everything from the wear and tear on your brake pads to your fuel efficiency. They are capable of communicating wirelessly with manufacturers, traffic management systems, and other vehicles in real time. So your car's manufacturer probably knows where you've been, how fast you drove, and how soon you're likely to need a service. And it wants to turn this knowledge in to money. Hyundai vice chairman Euisun Chung talks about connected cars in Las Vegas Say your car's onboard sensors detect that a certain part is about to fail. The manufacturer will have wireless access to that data and could then alert you and even book a service for you automatically. That sounds convenient and useful, right? But what if the repair centre is owned by the car manufacturer? You might not be getting the best price for the new parts and servicing. And what if their authorised repair centre is a lot further away than your local garage? ""While the manufacturer is monitoring the car, it has the power to recommend its own spare parts. This is a privileged position and would distort the market,"" says Neil Pattemore, technical director at FIGIEFA, the European association representing car parts retailers and repair shops. ""We exist to offer consumers choice - it's about freedom of where you want to get your car repaired."" The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) is arguing that car makers should be allowed to send all this ""in-vehicle"" data to their own cloud platforms and control who has access to it and under what terms. Allowing ""direct third-party access to vehicular electronic systems would jeopardise safety, (cyber)security and vehicle integrity"", it argues. Some car makers already allow phone apps to synchronise with in-car systems Manufacturers say they're worried about hackers taking control of a car's electronic systems, as has beenshown to bepossible onseveral occasions. They also fear that allowing third parties to peer in to their cars' ""brains"" would jeopardise ""trade secrets, know-how or information covered by intellectual property rights"". But a growing number of industry bodies think this has more to do with manufacturers trying to control a potentially lucrative business. ""In the connected era, every vehicle will have its own in-built telematics device and the functionality of a smartphone,"" says Gerry Keaney, chief executive of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA). ""The data this generates opens up a whole new range of opportunities to develop driver-based infotainment or navigation services. ""It also promises to revolutionise the ways vehicles are maintained and managed, enabling vehicle owners to share them between multiple users, fix them before they break down or streamline the repair and servicing process. ""There are huge amounts of money to be made or saved here, but only if you have access to the vehicle data,"" he says. In future, cars will warn us long before they break down At the moment all cars have to have an onboard diagnostic (OBD) port. This allows mechanics to plug in a cable and access the data stored in the car's computer or electronic control unit (ECU). Under European law every manufacturer has to fit one, primarily so testers can gain access to emissions data and check that the vehicles comply with pollution regulations. But, obviously, mechanics can only access the OBD when the vehicle is stationary. So unless they can access this diagnostics data wirelessly, they say they will be at a competitive disadvantage. The ACEA says manufacturers would be prepared to share this kind of data with third parties through their own cloud servers or via ""neutral"" servers operated by other companies. But Mr Keaney says his members and vehicle owners would then have to go ""cap in hand"" to the manufacturers to access it, and would probably have to pay for it. ""Independent service providers will suffer and there will be less choice for consumers and vehicle owners,"" he says. Would losing control of car data harm independent repair shops? The UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) acknowledges that ""overly restrictive access [to car data] may stifle innovation and competition, and restrict consumer choice"". ""SMMT is currently working with all parties involved to ensure a better understanding of the issues involved, while a common solution is currently being discussed at a European level,"" says Tamzen Isacsson, director of communications and international. The aftercare industry wants equal access to wireless in-vehicle data and believes the technology is already here that could provide it securely. Public cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure run programs called hypervisors that create virtual machines on computer servers. These virtual machines enable many different clients to store their data safely and separately on one computer, thereby saving computing resources. It's the technology that has enabled cloud computing to take off in the way that it has. ""Cars could also run hypervisors that allow virtual environments and enable third parties to access car data in a safe and secure way,"" says FIGIEFA's Mr Pattemore. Several other industry bodies - Cecra, FiA, ADPA, Leaseurope and others - agree, saying that an ""in-vehicle interoperable, standardised, secure and open-access platform"" would be preferable to preserve a competitive market. This may be a complex issue, but it could directly affect the pound in your pocket. Expect to hear far more about this in the months to come.

"This video can not be played A look inside Wrexham's new super-prison The ""poster child"" of Britain's super prisons is opening in Wrexham. But how will HMP Berwyn compare to other jails? It cost Â£250m to build and has a capacity of 2,106 prisoners - 500 more than the biggest current prison in England and Wales was built to hold. And HMP Berwyn in Wrexham is welcoming its first inmates on Tuesday. The prison service has come under increasing pressure in recent years due to overcrowding, with 6,000 assaults on staff and 105 suicides up to June 2016. Inside Britain's new super-prison The UK government has pledged to spend Â£1.3bn on new prisons, and after the riots in HMP Birmingham last year, Justice Secretary Liz Truss said the new Welsh prison ""will help to reduce overcrowding across the estate"". HMP Berwyn is the government's first publicly-run super-prison - holding more than 2,000 inmates. Nine more new prisonsare expected to open by 2020. Andrew Neilsen, from the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""Berwyn has become a bit of a poster child for super-prisons. It is the first public sector prison to be opened in England and Wales since the 1990s, and they want to show it can work. ""Russell Trent, the governor, is seen as a high-flying trouble-shooter. He has turned around failing institutions in the past. He has been tasked with setting up an institution and getting it off on the right foot."" But just how much difference will HMP Berwyn make, and does it herald a new era for prisons in England and Wales? When the building of HMP Berwyn was started it was set to provide 500 more places than the current biggest prison in England and Wales - privately run HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire. Privately-run Oakwood, managed by security company G4S, had 1,600 places when it opened in 2012. However, due to overcrowding in prisons across the UK, Oakwood further increased its capacity last year by converting some single cells into rooms which could hold two inmates and can now hold up to 2,096 prisoners. The vast majority of prisoners in England an Wales are housed in what the Ministry of Justice define as a ""good, decent standard of accommodation"" - known as ""certified normal accommodation"" or CNA. An additional 6,512 prisoners are currently incarcerated over that number. While the 2,106 new prison places provided by HMP Berwyn will help address this, they will not all be instantly available as HMP Berwyn will not function at capacity for some time. The new super prison is anticipated to be the cheapest to run per prisoner in England and Wales. It is expected to run at Â£14,000 per head per year, including overheads. The second cheapest prison will be the second biggest - HMP Oakwood - at Â£19,505 per head. America's LA County jail isalmost 10 times bigger than HMP Berwyn,externalwith around 17,000 inmates, although it is not strictly comparable as it is made up of a collection of facilities spread over a wide area. The United States does have the highest incarceration rates in the world with figures for 2014 showing 690 prisoners for every 100,000 people, compared to 146 in England and Wales. England and Wales had the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe,according to Eurostat figures,externalfor 2014.

"This video can not be played Have we lost faith in experts? If so, what are the implications? Ian Katz reports In the last days before the referendum, Newsnight's Policy Editor Chris Cook interviewed a retired woman called Joan in a Bognor Regis cafe. In what felt like one of the most revealing exchanges of the campaign, Chris listed Bank of England governor Mark Carney's seemingly ample qualifications to make predictions about how Brexit would affect the economy. ""Yes,"" she replied, ""but does he know what it's like to go round Sainbury's?,external"" It was a moment that seemed to support Michael Gove's claim that ""people in this country have had enough of experts"". So did the vote itself - a rejection, among other things of overwhelming expert opinion that Brexit was a bad idea. And in the months since, the expert bashers have been able to claim a measure of vindication: few of the dire consequences predicted by most economists have materialised. This video can not be played ""Does he know what it's like to go round Sainbury's?"" asked Joan in Bognor Regis But what is the truth about our relationship with ""experts""? In the context of Trump's America, where every fact has become contestable, and once revered authorities are dismissed as partisan and untrustworthy, it's a question that suddenly seems rather important. Was Gove really right that we have ceased to believe that people with years of accumulated specialist knowledge and qualifications are worth listening to? And if so does our newfound scepticism apply to particular kinds of expert, or to all of them? You don't need letters after your own name to appreciate the potential implications: in a world where experts cannot command public trust, how can they convince us that action must be taken on climate change? Or that vaccinations are safe? Or that a particular foreign state poses a threat to us? Michael Gove now claims that he was really talking about economists when he made hisinfamous comment in an interview with Sky's Faisal Islam,external. He says Islam interrupted him before he could clarify. Having got it wrong over Britain entering the euro, the 2008 crash, and the immediate impacts of a Brexit vote, he says economics is now ""a profession in crisis"". Michael Gove and Boris Johnson were key figures in the Vote Leave campaign Certainly economic forecasting has always been a rather hit or miss business. JK Galbraith said its only function was""to make astrology look respectable"",external. Many economists now admit they got the short term impacts of a Brexit vote wrong. Essentially they misjudged how consumers would behave amid the uncertainty created by a vote to leave: they thought we'd tighten our belts and save; instead we went on a borrowing and spending binge. Attack on experts 'undermines science' What does post-truth mean for a philosopher? Don't trust experts? Bank of England urges you to think again But most also point out that it's far too early to judge the accuracy of their forecasts. Britain hasn't even left the EU yet; it will take years to judge whether their predictions of reduced growth were right. As one senior economist put it to me: ""Gove is right that economics is a profession in crisis but it has nothing to do with Brexit predictions. The real crisis is our failure to explain the collapse in productivity."" Perhaps the bigger question is whether the scepticism Gove says he meant to direct at economists has now spread to other forms of expert. This video can not be played Experts ""are being derided and pushed back"" argues Sir Paul Nurse Sir Paul Nurse, the Nobel prize-winning geneticist and director of London's new cathedral to science, the Francis Crick Institute, fears it has. ""Unfortunately Mr Gove's remarks spilled over into all sorts of other areas where experts have an enormous contribution to make to the proper running of society,"" he told me. ""The fact that experts have been derided in this way does have an effect in undermining science and scientific evidence. Gove himself acknowledges his remark may have had unintended consequences. ""I'm sure that there are people who've latched onto that wordâ¦ who think that I may have legitimised it, and it may be that there are some people out there who think that that I'm giving them licence to operate in that way. Who knows?"" This video can not be played Michael Gove says his remarks on experts were taken out of context But for some, like the science writer Matt Ridley, greater public scepticism about all kinds of expert can only be a good thing. Far from the assault on Enlightenment values that some fear, the backlash against experts, he says, is quite the reverse. ""One has to remember that the Enlightenment did consist of challenging the experts, particularly challenging priests and saying you don't have all the answers, People can work out the answers for themselves. There's no reason we can't use rationalism to arrive at solutions to problems, and to the extent that we're challenging a priesthood today and saying, 'No hang on you might be wrong.' That's healthy."" 'Post-truth' declared word of the year Trump and Truth But it begs the question: where does the challenging stop? Can ordinary people without scientific training really be expected to make up their own minds up about whether vaccines, for instance, are safe? Ridley concedes that we can't all wade through the scientific literature: ""We have to rely on other people to do that for us."" And who are those other people? ""People who've done more work in looking into the evidence."" In other words, people who sound quite a lot like experts. In fact the hard evidence that Britain has fallen out of love with experts is thin on the ground. There is no shortage of data pointing to falling levels of trust in institutions - thelatest Edelman Trust Barometer,external, an annual survey of trust across 28 countries, found the steepest drop in trust of government, business, media and NGOs in its 17 year history. But asked in an Institute for Government poll (if we still pay any attention to those) whether politicians making difficult decisions should consult experts, more than 80% of both Remain and Leave voters said they should. Many facts were contested during the EU referendum campaign And during the referendum campaign, a poll by Ipsos MORI found that academics came in just behind friends and family when people were asked whose views they would trust about Brexit. As the philosopher Onora O'Neill put it: ""Some of the British public may be sick of experts, but I don't think most of them are. You don't take your shoes to the garage to be mended and you don't go to have your appendix out in your local chemist."" In truth, it seems there is not so much a crisis of trust in experts, as a profound scepticism about their - or anyone else's - ability to predict the future. Most economists, like meteorologists, take care to attach probabilities to their predictions, and to spell out the assumptions behind them. But in the heat of a campaign like the referendum, those nuances are often stripped away by politicians, or the media, or both. And it is the seeming certainty and precision of some of these predictions that seems to breed public suspicion. As Bertrand Russell put it: ""The whole problem of the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts."" Ian Katz is editor ofBBC Newsnight.

"This video can not be played What speaking in Indian sign language looks like India is soon to publish its first sign language dictionary. BBC Hindi's Divya Arya meets the people behind a unique initiative. Apart from a few clicks on computer keyboards and the routine shuffling of paper, it is very quiet at this office in the capital, Delhi. A group of 15 people here are working on the massive task of compiling more than 7,000 signs that deal with words used in academic, medical, legal, technical and routine conversations by deaf people in India. The group is a mix of speech and hearing impaired, deaf and non-disabled people. However they all communicate with each other in sign language. Charity helps deaf Indians into work Will Paralympics change attitudes to India's disabled? Ira Singhal: When disability doesn't matter Sign language has evolved in India over the last 100 years, but the government has only now decided to codify it in the form of a dictionary. Once completed, it will translate Indian sign language into English and Hindi, and will be available in print and online editions. There is a lack of awareness about sign language in India Andesha Mangala, assistant professor at the government-funded Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC), said it was important to compile the dictionary. ""Indian sign language is very scientific and has its own grammar, but lack of awareness has meant that many deaf people are not even aware of institutions where they can learn it and equip themselves for public communication,"" she said. According to the latest census, India has five million deaf and hearing impaired people. But the country only has about 700 schools which teach sign language. And unlike English or Hindi, it is not written. Sign language has evolved in India in the past century So, while it works for inter-personal communication, the wider lack of knowledge of sign language means that deaf people have to become proficient in languages they have never heard or spoken. Islam Ul Haq, a master trainer in sign language, has been deaf from birth and does not speak. ""When we don't hear or speak a language, we don't understand its grammar and syntax. For us communicating ideas is enough,"" he told the BBC through an interpreter. For example, to say ""this food is good"", the signs required are only for ""food"" and ""good"", but if this were to be communicated in spoken or written English, one would need to know that ""food"" is a noun and ""good"" is an adjective, not to mention the role of ""this"" and ""is"" in a sentence. The dictionary aims to help in developing this ""bilingualism"" and grammar. British and American sign language dictionaries are an important reference point for the dictionary, but signs used by deaf people in India are very different because of their cultural, geographical and historical context. Simple signs that are used to denote common terms such as ""marriage"" or ""tea"" are not the same world over. While the action for ""wearing a ring"" denotes ""marriage"" in the US, in India it is depicted by the ""holding of hands"". ""Tea"" is shown through the action of ""dipping a tea bag in a cup"" in the US, but in India, you would actually mime the action of drinking tea from a cup and saucer. Islam Ul Haq is helping in the compilation of the dictionary Every sign in the Indian dictionary will be accompanied with a photo illustration and information about the usage of the corresponding English and Hindi word. ISLRTC experts also had to work hard to take into account, the regional variations of sign language in India. Not only can one word can be gestured by different signs in different regions, one gesture can mean completely different things in two places. ""If you make the ""crossing arms with clenched fists"" sign, in some parts of southern India, it denotes 'marriage' whereas in some northern regions it signifies 'jail',"" said Mr Haq. So the standardisation of signs is an extremely important part of the dictionary-making exercise. The dictionary has pictures and illustrations The government wants sign language to be taught in every school Avnish Kumar Awasthi, a senior bureaucrat at the Ministry of Social Welfare, said the dictionary was the government's first step towards creating awareness about India's sign language. ""Lack of knowledge of sign language in our country has meant that deaf people drop out of the education system rapidly, and despite quotas in government jobs, they are unable to benefit from them,"" he said. Mr Awasthi also wants to make sign language training compulsory for teachers to ensure that deaf students can study alongside other children in regular schools. Mr Haq's face lights up at the possibility. ""When I travelled to Sweden, the cashier at McDonalds used sign language to take my order. That level of communication would be a dream come true here in India.""

"This video can not be played Meet Allen Pembroke, the British holidaymaker who went back to the beach Allen Pembroke has had the same nightmare 50 times. So far. It is late morning on 26 June 2015. He is on the beach in the Tunisian resort of Port El Kantaoui near Sousse. The Islamist gunman Seifeddine Rezgui is in the midst of his shooting rampage targeting British and other European holidaymakers at the Imperial hotel. Many are already dead. Mr Pembroke is trying to comfort a badly-injured British woman, when suddenly he realises Rezgui has returned to the beach and is standing behind them, about to open fire. Somehow he manages to grab the high-powered assault rifle and turn it so it is pointing into the air. It is then that Mr Pembroke wakes up in a sweat after lashing out. Sometimes he throws punches in his sleep. Almost two years after the attack, which he and his wife witnessed close-up, they are still struggling to overcome the trauma, despite destroying all photographs, documents and other memorabilia from the trip. Who were the British victims? What exactly happened on the day? Thirty of the 38 people killed by a gunman on a Tunisian beach were British ""It's had a massive impact,"" says Mr Pembroke, 62, who works as a service manager at a car company in London. ""It's never going to go, and unfortunately since that day there've been several other terrorist incidents. ""With each incident, it's recall, we re-live the day. ""Even the start of the inquest... it just re-opens the wound."" While many caught up in the attack ran for their lives when the shooting began, Mr Pembroke did something very different. After hearing the first shots on the beach, he and his wife ran to their room a few metres away in a hotel next to the Imperial. ""While I am dragging her to the room, I could hear rapid gunfire, screaming, and bullets flying overhead,"" he said. ""I took her to the room and said, 'Stay there, please don't open the door, stay away from the window and lie on the floor.'"" Mr Pembroke then ran straight back to the beach towards the sound of the gunfire. ""I just wanted to helpâ¦ I couldn't just secure myself in the room. I would have felt cowardly because I'd seen people go down, there was screaming. ""I thought, I've got some basic first aid skills, so let me see what I can do."" Cheryl Mellor lost a hand in the attack Among the sun loungers close to the water's edge, he found people lying in pools of blood with injuries so horrific he did not want the details to be repeated. He also found Cheryl Mellor, still alive after being shot in the leg and arm, drifting in and out of consciousness. ""I asked her if she was English and she replied that she was. So I said, 'My name is Allen and I will do what I can to help.'"" Her hand had been blown off by the impact of a high velocity round from Rezgui's Kalashnikov rifle. Mr Pembroke grabbed a scarf and tied it around her arm as a makeshift tourniquet and then used a towel to stem the bleeding from her leg. But the most difficult task was yet to come. Mrs Mellor wanted to know what had happened to her husband, Stephen, who was lying nearby with severe wounds to his chest. Mr Pembroke checked his pulse but there was nothing. ""Do you really want to know?"" Mr Pembroke asked. ""Yes,"" she replied. She passed out when he told her that her husband was dead. Later he offered to carry her to safety but she insisted on staying next to her husband, saying she would play dead if the gunman returned to the beach. He did, but she survived. Mr Pembroke spent 20 minutes on the beach comforting Mrs Mellor and checking to see if any other holidaymakers who had been shot were still alive. He says he was alone and no one else was helping. ""I saw no military or medical staff and it's only in recent reports that I found out that the police waited, they fainted, they hid. ""That's unforgivable, they need to be accountable for that."" By the end of the attack 38 people, including 30 Britons, were killed. Rezgui was later shot dead by police. Although still haunted by what he saw on that day, Mr Pembroke has tried to resume a normal life. But he has taken on another job as well. He is now a trained community first responder for the voluntary organisation, St John Ambulance. He also remains in regular contact with Mrs Mellor, so they can help support each other. ""It gives me some peace,"" he added.

"Moonlight editor Joi McMillon looked on, with award presenter Warren Beatty in the foreground It looked like it was going to be the least exciting Oscars ever. In the end, it turned out to be the craziest. When La La Land's name was read out as the winner of the prize for best picture, that seemed to confirm this year's Oscars as being even more predictable and unmemorable than usual. But two minutes 22 seconds later, all hell broke loose. This video can not be played The moment La La Land's producers realised Moonlight had won best picture Later, in the Oscars press room, I asked the official Academy Awards historian, who knows everything there is to know about the Oscars and is on hand to answer journalists' questions, if anything like this had ever happened before. Her eyes glanced down, a sheepish look came over her face, and she replied: ""Not that I know of."" This just does not happen. This is the Oscars. And this is best picture - the final and most prestigious prize of the night. But it has happened - they announced the wrong winner, and 2017 now has an indelible place in Oscars history. The mistake was revealed while La La Land producer Marc Platt was giving his acceptance speech Wrong film named best picture at Oscars How did the Oscars mix-up happen? The complete list of winners Expert's eye on Oscars fashion Oscars 2017: Full coverage Until that point, the biggest upset was Hacksaw Ridge beating La La Land to the award for best film editing. That's how exciting it was. But La La Land was hot favourite to win best picture, so no-one was surprised when its name was read out. Its producers were midway through their well-polished acceptance speeches when hell began to break loose. Perhaps it was worth the mistake to hear La La producer Jordan Horowitz's line, delivered during that heady two minutes 22 seconds: ""There's a lot of love in this room, and let's use it to create and champion bold and diverse work - work that inspires us towards joy, towards hope and towards empathy."" He could have been referring to Moonlight. And when he was told of the mix-up shortly afterwards, his quick and uncomplaining concession to Moonlight was admirable. La La Land's Jordan Horowitz embraced Moonlight's Barry Jenkins ""I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from Moonlight,"" he said before embracing that film's incredulous crew and relinquishing the golden statuette. Every time the TV cameras cut away to a celebrity in the audience, each was wearing the same look - astonishment and disbelief. Unbelievable. La La Land's leading lady Emma Stone was also gracious after defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory - although winning best actress probably softened the blow. In the press room, she seemed unperturbed by the turn of events. ""God I love Moonlight so much,"" she said. ""I'm so excited for Moonlight. Of course it was an amazing thing to hear La La Land, and I would love to win best picture. ""But we are so excited for Moonlight. I think it is one of the best films of all time."" Moonlight's Mahershala Ali and La La Land's Emma Stone: No hard feelings Let's hope, in that case, that Moonlight isn't just remembered as that film that won in that year the Oscars messed up and spoiled La La Land's party. It is a worthy winner, and deserves to be remembered as a beautiful, tender, touching, clever, bold work of art. And let's hope, for that matter, that this fiasco is not forever attached to the memory of La La Land. It would have been a worthy winner too - it is an audacious, magical, transporting cinematic achievement. And the fact that the directors of both films are in their 30s, and have been recognised as major new talents during this awards season, bodes well for future Oscar years. Perhaps there will be a rematch. The commotion also overshadowed the rest of the night's winners, who may have been largely predictable but were no less deserving. This video can not be played 'It's like witnessing a fire!' Viola Davis and Mahershala Ali were hugely popular best supporting actress and actor victors respectively, and delivered powerful personal speeches. The closest acting race was for best actor - where Casey Affleck triumphed over Denzel Washington, meaning history wasn't made by giving three of the four acting trophies to black stars. However, two African-American winners is a welcome result after two years of #OscarsSoWhite. As well as diversity, the other issue that was supposed to dominate the show was politics. This was meant to be the year when Hollywood railed against Donald Trump. And there were references to the current political turmoil. Presenting one award, Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal said: ""I'm against any sort of wall that wants to separate us."" Moonlight's Barry Jenkins indirectly referred to the president, telling those who feel underrepresented: ""For the next four years, we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you."" And ceremony host Jimmy Kimmel touched on the topic throughout the night - in a flippant way. The main political statement came when Iranian director Asghar Farhadi won best foreign language film - but was not there to collect the award because he stayed away in protest at Mr Trump's attempted travel ban. Instead, he sent a message saying: ""Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear. A deceitful justification for aggression and war."" The four acting winners completely steered clear of overtly political statements. Casey Affleck: ""I didn't say anything [political] because my head was completely blank"" ""Man, I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say,"" best actor winner Casey Affleck said from the podium. Which is funny because he did have something bigger and more meaningful to say when he won an Independent Spirit Award just a day earlier. At that ceremony, he said: ""The policies of this administration are abhorrent and they will not last. They're really un-American."" So did the actors and actresses chicken out of talking about politics at the Oscars? Or did they realise that preaching would have done little to change minds and would have just alienated half of the country? Affleck told the BBC backstage: ""Personally, I didn't say anything because my head was completely blank, [because of] the shock of winning the award and the terror of having a microphone in front of you and all of those faces staring at you."" So it won't be remembered as the political Oscars after all. But at least it will be remembered. ""Is that the craziest Oscar moment of all time?"" Emma Stone said of the best picture debacle. Pause.
