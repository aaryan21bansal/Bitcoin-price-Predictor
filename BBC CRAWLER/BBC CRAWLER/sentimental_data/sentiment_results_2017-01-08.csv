"Mike Dean has been a Premier League referee for 16 years Mike Dean remains one of the Premier League's best referees despite an ""indifferent"" festive period, says former official Mark Halsey. Dean has received criticism for some of his recent performances and the number of red cards he has shown - five in 15 matches this season. Ex-Premier League referee Halsey thinks Dean can come across as ""arrogant"". He also believes only a handful of referees are ""trusted"" for the league's most important games. Dean, who has been a Premier League referee for 16 years, controversially sent off West Ham's Sofiane Feghouli during the Hammers' defeat by Manchester United on 2 January, while the red card was laterrescindedby the Football Association. That dismissal was the official's 26th since the start of the 2013-14 season - the highest number by any current Premier League referee in that period. ""If you look back over the December period, he has had an indifferent period,"" Halsey, 55, told BBC Radio 5 live. ""I have disagreed with some of his decision-making, especially the sendings-off. ""It is not an easy job to do. He is one of the most experienced and is a very good referee - one of the best of the bunch we have got. ""He does come across as a little bit arrogant. I would like to see that taken out of his game and perhaps he would get a lot more respect from the paying public and the media. ""But that is not the way he is off the pitch - if truth be told, the players like him."" Listen to more from Halsey on BBC Radio 5 live Halsey, who retired in 2013, says the standard of officiating has ""got steadily worse"" since Keith Hackett retired as general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) in 2010. ""Mark Clattenburg is by far our best referee, then there is Martin Atkinson, Michael Oliver, Andre Marriner, Anthony Taylor and Mike Dean. The top games, the big derbies, can only be refereed by four or five referees. The PGMOL do not trust the others to take control of those games,"" he said. Halsey also criticised the new way referees are assessed. There is now an ""evaluation system"" that can take up to 10 days to issue feedback rather than an assessor at the ground. He added: ""It could be 10 days before you get closure on a game on a Saturday. You can go into your next game without any closure on a previous game. ""Look at the top referees, they are confused. There is no leadership or direction coming from within."" Clattenburg, 41, has said he wouldconsiderofficiating in the Chinese Super League. He refereed the finals of the FA Cup, the Champions League and the European Championship in 2016. Asked if he would be surprised if Clattenburg went to China, Halsey added: ""No I wouldn't. There is no love lost between Clattenburg, the FA, and PGMOL. ""There is a lot to sort out. It needs a massive overhaul. We have got excellent referees not being coached correctly - people involved in referring who have never been involved in referring at that level.""

"Sir Ivan Rogers resigned from his position last week The Sunday Times leads with a claim that Britain's former ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers,held secret talks with David Cameron,externalbefore Christmas to warn that Theresa May was failing to plan for the risk of a ""disorderly"" Brexit. Sir Ivan resigned last week, accusing ministers of ""muddled thinking"". A source tells the paper Sir Ivan fears a hard Brexit ""will lead to mutually assured destruction between Britain and the rest of the EU"" and that the UK will ""crash out"" with nothing. The paper adds that news of his meeting with Mrs May's predecessor will fuel ""the fears of her allies that senior officials were in private contact with leading Remain supporters"". In The Observer a Canadian officialwarns that Britain risks a ""catastrophic"" Brexit,externalbecause the government is so dismissive of the concerns of trade experts. John Langrish helped to negotiate a trade deal between the EU and Canada - a process which took more than a decade - and believes a British agreement could take just as long because of the complexities involved. He writes that ""undoing nearly 45 years of integration and shared law will not be pleasant"" and cannot be done in a ""mutually beneficial"" way in the two-year time frame. The Sunday Express says the man named as Donald Trump'snew ambassador to the EU supported Brexit,externaland believes Britain will be ""moved to the head of the queue"" when it comes to negotiating a new trade deal with America. Professor Ted Malloch, a friend of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage who lives in the UK, tells the paper the leverage Mr Trump can provide could offer an alternative to hard or soft Brexit. ""7,000 Hospital Beds Are Lost Under Tories"" declaresthe Sunday Mirror,external, as it cites official figures showing the number of acute beds that have closed since 2010. It says government plans to save Â£20bn over the next five years will mean even more hospital places will disappear. Chris Moulton, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, tells the Sunday People hospitals ""are at rock bottom"" and can't afford to cut back any more. NHS England responds that lengths of stay have fallen significantly, with many patients being discharged the same day. After Saturday's warning by the Red Cross about the state of the health service,the Observer,externalaccuses the government of a ""woeful"" response to the looming funding crisis. It advises Theresa May that a failure to address the issue in her speech on Monday ""will speak volumes about where her true priorities lie"". Forthe Mail on Sunday,external, it is a ""scandal"" that is unacceptable in ""a country as rich as ours"".  It suggests it can be readily tackled, by diverting the money set aside for foreign aid. Education leaders are said bythe Sunday Telegraph,externalto be concerned about government plans to place student feedback at the heart of a new ranking system for universities. Academics warn the measures could lead to institutions giving in to student demands, however unreasonable they may be. One professor, Lady Woolf, describes the new approach as a ""direct threat to academic standards"". The Department for Education insists it is critical to ensuring young people can access high-quality teaching. With the headline ""Jail Tinmates"", the Sunday Mirror reveals that tinnedtuna has been placed on the list of prison contraband,external. Prison inspectors have found that inmates are getting friends to smuggle in the canned goods because of the poor quality of food in jail. It says Muslim prisoners are having to supplement their diet because of a failure to prepare halal foods separately.

"Can CES delight the ear as well as the eye? CES is a visual feast of lights, colour, people, costumes - and of course endless gadgets. There are plenty of striking pictures from the show floor. But are any of the exhibitors interested in delighting your ears? Rather like the city of Las Vegas itself, it has its own distinctive beat. There's the hubbub of chatter. The hiss of vending cart coffee machines. The thumping bass and discord of various sound systems vying for attention. The amplified echo of a hundred demonstrations. The ringtones and message alerts from thousands of mobile phones. And also - this being a tech fair - the whizzes and ticks and buzzes and bings of robots and drones. In a nutshell: it's extremely loud. Robots make quite a racket - just what you'd expect at a football match After hours of stalking the vast halls of CES besieged by visuals, I decided to try and find beguiling sounds instead. Things did not get off to a good start. The first robot I encountered - a service machine designed to guide people around museums - responded to my greeting by asking me whether I was ""fickle after kissing"". Its mortified owner told me it was confused. It wasn't the only one. Next, I asked one of the show guides where I could find some interesting noises, and was promptly escorted to a section of the show floor dedicated to in-car speakers. I had to explain that as much as I admire Lady Gaga, the strains of her hit Bad Romance blasting out of the back of a Jeep rammed floor-to-ceiling with sub woofers wasn't what I had in mind either. It was in a start-up zone called Eureka Park that I struck audio gold. Some gadgets, like the cuddly Talkies, can't wait to speak up I was drawn in by the sound of crickets - very incongruous in a giant exhibition hall with no natural light, let alone greenery. It was coming from an air purifier called Clair with a built-in Bluetooth speaker nestling at a tiny stand towards the back. ""When people sleep they need fresh air and also this kind of sound can help people sleep better,"" said a spokesman who introduced himself as Bono from South Korea. ""So, we put them both together."" Thank you, Bono. It's the sort of stuff that's perfect for radio, in fact. After that, I captured the warm American male tones of a virtual assistant designed for cars and the staccato gunfire of a man who was evidently immersed in a VR game of mortal combat that only he could see. Next came machine-like marching sounds from a team of forearm-sized Aelos robots playing miniature football, and a delegate attempting to play Let It Be by The Beatles on a Magic Instruments digital guitar. It's supposed to be easy to learn. Perhaps he tried the wrong tune. The Emys robot has a natural sounding voice - and looks like a cross between ET and a Ninja Turtle I bonded with natural-voiced Emys, a Kickstarter-funded desktop robot that looked like a cross between ET and a Ninja Turtle. It has been designed to teach young children foreign languages (did you know that castle in Spanish is castillo?). I also hugged a gurgling Talkie - a cuddly little monster with wi-fi that you can use to exchange voice messages with your children. Olly, a robot that claims to adapt to the personality of its owner, told me about feeling both happy and sad in a mournfully child-like voice. ""By the end of the day I'll be dead,"" complained an uncomfortable promotions girl, fidgeting in a pair of towering stilettos. ""And if I'm not - just kill me."" Meanwhile, a little bat-shaped speaker chimed like a casino slot machine, as it tried to re-establish a connection with the smartphone it was supposed to be streaming music from. What's the sound of CES? It's all of those things. All at the same time. All day long. And it's music to my ears.

"This video can not be played A 250ft-long rotor blade forming a major new art installation is lifted into position. A 250ft-long (75m) rotor blade forming a new art installation has been lifted into position in Hull. ""The Blade"" is the first in a series of temporary commissions marking Hull's year as UK City of Culture. The 28-tonne structure will remain on display in Queen Victoria Square until 18 March. The artwork was transported from the Siemens factory on Alexandra Dock, where it was made, through the city overnight in a complex operation. More than 50 items of street furniture had to be removed to allow it to reach the square. It arrived on Sunday morning and large crowds gathered to watch it slowly lifted into its final position by late-afternoon. Large numbers of people gathered to watch the blade being lifted into place It runs across the whole length of the square, rising to 16ft (5m) at one end allowing traffic to pass beneath it Project director Richard Bickers said it had been a demanding effort. ""Blade is not only a dramatic artistic installation, but in terms of its transportation and exhibition, a significant engineering feat. ""A major challenge we encountered was manoeuvring the structure through Hull's narrow city centre streets."" The artwork has been designed by Nayan Kulkarni who said he was impressed by the smooth operation to install it. ""They did a study, they did a drawing, they planned the route meticulously. ""The drawings looked difficult, the movements through the city were graceful, I mean it looked effortless."" The huge structure was made by workers at Siemens' new Alexandra Dock factory It was transported from the factory to the city centre overnight More than 50 items of street furniture, including traffic lights and lamp posts, had to be temporarily removed B75 rotor blades - which would normally form the top of a wind turbine - are the world's largest handmade fibreglass components to be cast as a single object, organisers said. Martin Green, CEO and director Hull 2017, said: ""It's a structure we would normally expect out at sea and in a way it might remind you of a giant sea creature, which seems appropriate with Hull's maritime history. ""It's a magnificent start to our Look Up programme, which will see artists creating site specific work throughout 2017 for locations around the city.""

"The baby female otter was ""lifeless and unresponsive"" when she was found at the side of the road An ""almost lifeless"" baby otter was rescued from the side of a busy main road after being initially mistaken for a discarded ""old mail sack"". Cyclist Robert Spooner spotted her in the dim light near Peterborough. ""I couldn't just leave it there,"" he said, so he carried the otter to his mother's house, who looked after it until rescue centre volunteers arrived. They said the otter had made a ""great recovery"" but would not have survived in the wild without his help. Mr Spooner said it took him a ""few seconds"" to realise what he had come across at the side of the road a few days before Christmas. The otter responded well to treatment and was able to go for a swim at the rescue centre A passing motorist did not have time to help, but a pedestrian offered to push his bicycle while he scooped up the otter and carried it to his mother's house. ""She was a little surprised when I arrived with it,"" he said. She called Fenland Animal Rescue and kept the otter hydrated, and warm in a box. The otter was ""lifeless and unresponsive"" when it was first found, but ""soon responded and recovered well"", Joshua Flanagan, from rescue organisation, said. He then had to find a new home for the creature. Otters are social creatures and ideally should be with others of a similar age ""Otter pups are entirely dependent on their mothers for the first year of their lives. ""Coupled with them being a social species, it is best that they are recovering in an environment with other otters of a similar age,"" he said. After contacting sanctuaries across the country they eventually found a new home for the otter - more than 500 miles (800km) away on the Isle of Skye. The International Otter Survival Fund has agreed to take her in. The otter pup is being transferred to a centre where there are otters of a similar age But transferring her there has not been simple for the volunteers. So far they have managed to get her to a ""half-way house"" near Manchester. She will then be driven to the Scottish border where she will be handed over to a member of the otter charity for the final leg to the Isle of Skye. ""When she is of age and independent, she will be released back into the wild in a suitable area,"" Mr Flanagan added.

"The Barada river runs through the heart of Damascus The flashpoint for Syria's war, six years old this March, has in recent days taken the form of an elemental struggle over water. The drinking water supply to some 5 million residents in the Syrian capital, Damascus, was cut on 23 December by the Damascus Water Authority, who say rebels have contaminated it with diesel. Rebels deny this, saying bombing by the government has damaged the infrastructure. The historic water source of Ain al-Fijeh lies in the valley of Wadi Barada, 18km (11 miles) north-west of the capital, where a cluster of 10 villages has been under rebel control since 2012. Local people joined the revolution early on in protest against government neglect, corruption and land grabs made legal under new state land measures, where whole hillsides were requisitioned for sports clubs and luxury hotels. Both sides have blamed the other for damaging the water supply Water provision to Damascus has been drastically reduced On 22 December the Assad government, using barrel bombs dropped from helicopters and supported on the ground by Lebanese Shia militia fighters of Hezbollah, began a campaign to take control of the strategic valley and springs. The timing was significant, just days before the announcement of the countrywide ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey on 29 December. The Barada Gorge was cut through the Anti-Lebanon Mountains eons ago by the Barada river, which still runs through the centre of Damascus. Today the river is just a shadow of its former self, diminished for most of the year by drought and pollution to a dirty trickle by the time it reaches the city centre. But in earlier times it was the source of the city's legendary fertility, and the reason for its location in an oasis of gardens and orchards known as the Ghouta. A Roman aqueduct system still exists alongside the river The river was and still is fed by the meltwaters of Mount Hermon, Syria's highest peak. Mentioned no less than 15 times in the Bible, it retains its snow-capped summit till early June. The amount of snowfall in winter is a direct indication of how much water Damascus will have throughout the year. The Barada river, known in ancient times as Abana, was supplemented through seven further rivers whose course was diverted by means of elaborate channels constructed as far back as the Roman era. Guided by aqueducts into the centre of Damascus, the city was fed by a complex network of waterways and channels that allowed water to flow in and out of every house. Sophisticated Ottoman water distribution points throughout the city also allocated water in agreed quantities to the public bathhouses, mosque ablution areas and public drinking fountains. Even today most houses have a special drinking tap in their kitchen directly connected to the spring. In high summer families would come to Wadi Barada on Fridays and holidays, often renting a riverside platform for the day. Rigged up as tent awnings open only onto the river side, they formed an idyllic private arbour where families could relax, enjoying the coolness of the fast-flowing river. Little iron ladders were fixed onto the platforms, so that children could climb down and swim. A swimming platform and ladder used by picnicing families along the river In the 16th Century it was along the banks of the Barada river on the outskirts of Damascus that the first coffee houses grew up. Pilgrims would assemble, waiting for the annual Hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca to set off in one huge joint caravan, protected in numbers from raiding desert tribesmen. Many engravings from the 19th Century show scenes of coffee houses on the banks of the brimming Barada. Near the village of Souq Wadi Barada, huge gaping holes in the cliff above can be still be accessed. They are part of the original Roman water system: elaborate tunnels cut into the rock, conducting the meltwaters into the aqueducts of Damascus. On sections of the old Roman road between Baalbek and Damascus, inscriptions in Greek, the official language, and in Latin, the language of the soldiers, can still be seen, describing how the road was rebuilt higher up to avoid destruction by flooding. Latin inscriptions can be seen at the side of the road above Wadi Barada For Hezbollah too the battle is a geographical one. They regard this area as their backyard, connected to their Baalbek stronghold in Lebanon. The Syrian government claims there are fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra) present in Wadi Barada, to justify its ongoing campaign. Local residents insist there are only Free Syrian Army moderates. Since both UN monitors and Russian officials have been denied access to the area by Hezbollah checkpoints, the truth remains hidden - as so often in Syria - behind the fog of war, or in this case, beneath the waters of the Barada.

"""Are you crazy? I'm not touching you there."" That was the response when Brazilian Janea Padilha asked a beautician to remove most of her pubic hair in the late 1970s. But that was then and Janea, who went home and did it herself, so inventing the Brazilian wax, is one of the J Sisters. Their salon in New York now turns over millions of dollars a year catering to the grooming demands of the rich and famous. ""It's an inspirational story of self-made women who came from nothing, illegal immigrants who made it in America,"" says Laura Malin, author of a forthcoming book about the sisters. The women who invented the Brazilian wax In 1977, Dutch woman Johanna van Haarlem finally tracked down the son, Erwin, she had abandoned as a baby 33 years earlier. She immediately travelled to London to meet him. What followed was a scarcely believable story of deception and heartbreak, ending in Erwin van Haarlem's unmasking in court as an imposter and Soviet spy. More than two decades after his release from prison, the man newspapers called the ""spy with no name"" was living in Prague, where Jeff Maysh went to hear his story. The spy with no name ""It was on the second day of our trek that I realised it was missing,"" says Eloise Dicker. ""We had packed up the tents and loaded the horses. I reached up to the horse's mane to pull myself up and saw that my wrist was bare. 'My mum's bracelet! It's gone,' I thought, and immediately burst into tears. That bracelet was a physical part of my mother who is no longer physically in the world. It became part of me, and now was gone."" Some weeks later, having returned to Europe from Kyrgyzstan and made peace with the loss, Eloise received a Facebook message that changed everything. Losing the most precious thing I own, 7,000km from home ""Ever since guns entered the country, Japan has always had strict gun laws,"" says Iain Overton, author of Gun Baby Gun. ""They are the first nation to impose gun laws in the whole world and I think it laid down a bedrock saying that guns really don't play a part in civilian society."" Tough regulations extend to the police, who rarely use firearms - so how do they deal with incidents of violence and what is the effect of strict gun laws on crime in Japan? Island of safety After an hour's bus journey through forest from the town of Mae Sot, Mae La appears suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere. In the morning mist, thousands of bamboo huts cling to steep limestone crags. It is the largest of nine refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, and home to almost 40,000 people. Many families have been there for decades, but instances of suicide in women before and after childbirth appeared worryingly high. Researcher Gracia Fellmeth went there to find out why young women have been killing themselves. Losing hope in Mae La ""Magazine stories come and go,"" says National Geographic photographer Joel Sartore. ""But I had not seen the plight of endangered species getting better so I thought about what I could do to actually make a difference."" The answer he decided on was to make professional studio-style portraits of species close to extinction. He has now photographed more than 6,000 species in 40 countries and the results, preserved in the National Geographic Photo Ark, are amazing.

"Drone pilot Lt Col Matt Martin says his role is ""surreal"" In the past, soldiers went off to war and left their families behind. But drone pilots commute to work - and to war - each day. Vin Ray was given rare access to the only US Air Force base devoted entirely to flying drones, where he discovered the pilots' strange double life. If you're a drone pilot, there's a strong possibility you live in Las Vegas. And your commute to work is against the traffic. We were told to drive northwest out of the city on US Route 95. The road stretches out through the barren, inhospitable scrub of the Nevada desert. Pay attention, we were told, because the signpost is small. In fact, it's very small. But we eventually arrived at our destination: Creech US Air Force Base, a small, flat, city in the desert. And the only air base devoted to flying drones. Inside the base, comparisons with science fiction are hard to avoid. A drone looks like a conflation of a giant insect and a light aircraft. It's unmanned. Standing by a runway, we watch a drone land and pass right in front of us. The camera underneath its chin, swivels quickly sideways and looks right at us - someone, somewhere on the base, is watching us. I'm escorted through a non-descript door in the side of what looks like a beige metal shipping container. It's cramped inside. At the far end there's a pilot seated on the left, who flies the drone and fires the missiles. The sensor operator sits on the right - they operate the camera and fix the laser on the target for the missile to hit. They're focused on a bank of screens, switches and buttons. This is today's kind of cockpit. But it doesn't feel like a battleground. For a start, there's a sensory deficiency. From my experience on the ground, you can taste war - you can smell it and you can certainly hear it. In here there's a just a mute video. But that's not the only difference. Traditionally, soldiers in a war zone are based together. They have each others' camaraderie, and they're separated from their families. But it's not the same if you're commuting to work every day. Obviously, the drive itself is simple. But the psychological journey is altogether different. Imagine. Between six in the evening and six in the morning you might collect your kids from school, pick up some groceries on the way home and help make dinner. But between 6am and 6pm you have a licence to kill.

He's a hugely experienced former drone pilot. He exudes a quiet strength and a ready charm. But he talks about his schizophrenic existence, his inability to have a normal life and the strain it took on his family. ""It's a surreal enterprise,"" he says. ""You only have the drive to work and then you're flying. So for me, I would take that drive to switch gears. I would step into my cockpit and be totally immersed in flying the drone. Then a few hours later I would step out and be back in Las Vegas, in a totally different time zone, different time of day."" Here's what the base commander Col Case Cunningham told me: ""When they walk through the gate, they're in a war. Although physically they are at home, mentally they're at war. So in effect we're asking them to redeploy every single day, to go back home and be parents and be loved ones - and then come back to war again"". Such are the new frontiers of the modern battlefield. These drone pilots can sit in Nevada and watch a potential target 8,000 miles (12,000km) away for months on end, building up what they call ""patterns of life"" - building what's been called a ""remote intimacy"" with their prey - all in the knowledge that, one day, they may kill them. A conventional fighter pilot will fire missiles and then head back to base. But drone pilots are required to circle for some hours afterwards, to assess the damage. The picture they're looking at is extraordinarily clear - and the damage is often in the form of body parts. Small wonder that Creech now employs a psychologist for drone pilots suffering stress. Drones are globalising the battlefield, blurring the boundaries between war and home. As we get ready to leave the base, the moon rises over the mountains and darkness falls quickly. There's a long traffic jam as some of the 3,500 air staff wait at the gates to leave the base - a snake of red tail lights heading back to Vegas and the warmth of their families. And when they get home? Well, friction can stem from one simple question: ""How was your day?""

"The Nokia 6 is the first Android smartphone to bear the brand under a deal with HMD Global The first in a series of Nokia-branded Android phones is to be released exclusively in China. The devicewill be marketed in partnership,externalwith the local internet retail giant JD.com. The team behind the Nokia 6 phone said the handset's ""premium design"" would appeal to the local market. The announcement coincided with the final day of the CES tech show in Las Vegas, where other new mobile phones and gadgets have been launched. Nokia no longer manufactures phones that carry its name but has instead licensed its brand to another Finnish company, HMD Global. Until now, the only phones that had been released under the deal had been more basic ""feature phone"" models. HMD Global may wait to unveil details of Android smartphones for other markets until next month in Barcelona The Android device had been highly anticipated and marks Nokia's return to the smartphone market after a series of Windows Phone models. Nokia also briefly sold Android-based handsets - known as Nokia X - in 2014. Microsoft used Nokia's brand for a short time after buying the company's mobile devices the same year, but later referred to the devices solely by their Lumia name. Nokia once dominated the mobile phone market but struggled after the launch of the iPhone a decade ago, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system. HMD Global had previously indicated it would release several Nokia-branded Android phones in 2017. It is expected to provide details of at least some of the other launches at another trade show - Barcelona's Mobile World Congress - in February. ""The decision by HMD to launch its first Android smartphone into China is a reflection of the desire to meet the real world needs of consumers in different markets around the world,""the firm said in a statement,external. ""With over 552 million smartphone users in China in 2016, a figure that is predicted to grow to more than 593 million users by 2017, it is a strategically important market where premium design and quality is highly valued by consumers."" HMD Gobal sells feature phones, including the Nokia 150, in other parts of the world The Nokia 6 phone runs Android 7.0 - the latest version, also known as Nougat - and features: a 5.5in 1080p ""full high definition"" screen a 16 megapixel rear camera four gigabyte of RAM memory and 64GB of storage two amplifiers supported by Dolby Atmos audio processing, which HMD says creates audio that ""seems to flow all around users"" The specifications are mid-range, and so is the price: 1,699 yuan ($245; Â£200). That makes it slightly more expensive than Huawei's Honor 6X but cheaper than Xiaomi's Mi 5s. ""Nokia remains one of the most recognised mobile phone brands on the planet,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight technology consultancy. ""HMD Global will be hoping it can capitalise on this as it seeks to relaunch Nokia devices in 2017. ""It will be hoping the brand will help it stand out in the incredibly crowded Android smartphone market, which is characterised by cut-throat competition and a sea of design sameness. "" Brandon Ackroyd, Head of Customer Insight atTiger Mobiles,externalbelieves that Nokia will launch the Nokia 6 globally if the device has a successful launch in Asia. ""If the Nokia 6 performs well in China then it's highly likely we will see a new international variant of the handset sometime in 2017. We'll be keeping our eyes on the certification websites in the coming months looking for a variant with more connectivity options like GSM, LTE, and CDMA that will make the device compatible with networks worldwide.""

"A barnacle removal bill is an unlikely inspiration to set up a joint bank account. Yet, for two keen sailors, opening an account together was the most efficient way to organise the costs of running their boat. Fees for maintenance, mooring, and fuel all needed to be paid, so the yacht-owning duo stepped into their local bank branch on the south coast of England and signed up. The manager that day was Eric Leenders, now the managing director of retail banking at the British Bankers' Association. ""Typically joint accounts are used by couples for pooled income and expenditure, the trigger is often when they move in together and start paying the bills,"" he says. ""But, on occasions, they are used to share funding for a particular project."" It is the mundane reality of keeping heads above water financially - rather than keeping a vessel shipshape - that prompts most people to open a joint bank account. Any couple or group of people can open an account together, generally a regular current account with some added terms and conditions. Yet, experts stress there are benefits and pitfalls to sharing a bank account with anyone - even within an intimate relationship. Today, couples are living together and marrying later in life. Having increasingly led independent financial lives, the relevance of joint accounts may be questioned. While the vast majority of banks and building societies offer them, they do not collect and share any data so we can only speculate that the popularity of these accounts is fading. Fiona Cullinan, a 48-year-old digital editor, says she never had a joint bank account, even during more than two years of marriage - until last month. ""This is probably a legacy of not wanting to argue about money and also being independent, as once bills and standing orders are set up, it is hard to shift everything over - or so I thought,"" she says. ""In September I lost one of my jobs and so a joint account started to make more sense to help with cash flow. It was really simple and took about 30 minutes at the bank to set up. ""Now that everything doesn't go out from my account, it is a lot less stressful. A secondary bonus is that the burden feels more shared as my husband is now more involved in household finances - he set up a household budget spreadsheet to check things are on track each month. I now feel we are more of a team."" Applying for a joint account is much the same as opening a current account individually. Applicants often tick a box to make the account a joint version, then fill in their individual section of the form and provide the normal proof of address and identity. Many banks allow customers to add a second name to an existing account, following the normal checks. Convenience is generally the main benefit, with the account used to pay household bills, although wages are often still paid into an individual's own current account. ""Two people with two accounts often become two people with three accounts,"" says Eric Leenders, of the BBA. There is no limit on the number of people who can sign up, but primarily they are used by couples who are married, in civil partnerships or who live together, or by friends who share a home. Banks says that couples separated by work postings are also among those who are keen. Mr Leenders says that reward or packaged current accounts can lend themselves to joint opening owing to household benefits, such as insurance, that may be included. He stressed that anyone signing up should read the terms and conditions to check the extent of this cover. The Money Advice Service, a government-funded, independent organisation, points out there are limitations for anyone who needs longer term access to someone else's finances. ""If, for example, you have an elderly relative who is having trouble keeping on top of their money - a joint account is not your best bet,"" it says. Couples' finances have been used in comedy turns such as the Joint Account TV series The key decision when setting up the account is whether one individual can withdraw money, sign cheques and make payments or whether both, or all, need to sign. This is made official under what is known as the mandate. This should also cover the rules over who must give permission for changes in the terms of the account or close it. Whatever the decision, all parties usually get a payment card and a cheque book, if it is available with the account. Digitally, each person will have their own log-in details, with their own password, so this needs to be set up individually. In reality, this means each remembering another password, although mobile banking now uses encrypted password saving and fingerprint logins. Joint accounts allow people to share the rewards and convenience, but they also share the risk. Opening a joint account means a couple will be co-scored by credit reference agencies, so if one has a poor credit history it can affect the other. Getting out of debt also falls to both, or all, of those signed up - as a group and individually. Typically, each account holder is responsible for paying back all the money owed, so one could become liable for repaying the other person's debt. A bank might take money from that person's sole account to cover the overdraft in the joint account - but only if both accounts are with the same bank. ""Banks are not in the business of making good customers bad customers,"" says Mr Leenders, pointing out that banks' lending code requires them to treat customers sympathetically. He stresses that people should inform their bank about a relationship breakdown, or any sign of transactions that have not been agreed, to freeze the account - otherwise it can be difficult to retrieve this money. Cases that have gone to the financial ombudsman include: A woman who wanted her name removed from a joint account while Barclays Bank was attempting to recover an outstanding debt. Although the other person confirmed the debt was his responsibility, the ombudsman said the bank acted fairly. ""The terms and conditions of the joint account make both account holders responsible, individually and together, for the arrears on the account,"" the ombudsman said. A woman complained that Metro Bank allowed her ex-partner to withdraw money from their joint account, despite a stipulation when the account was opened that both should be present when a withdrawal is made. The bank said this was only a request that it would try to accommodate. The ombudsman decided it was a specific instruction and told the bank to return half the money to the complainant and pay Â£150 in compensation. At its worst, extravagant spending by one partner from the joint account, or sole control of a joint account can be a sign offinancial abuse. Spending jointly earned money, taking out loans in a partner's name, demanding payment for utility bills from their own savings, or scrutinising every penny that a partner spends are all signs of such bullying, charities and the TUC say. Worse, it can be the forerunner of even more serious emotional, or physical, abuse. Women are often the victims, but men - particularly those with disabilities - can also be vulnerable. Under the Serious Crime Act - implemented in 2015 - coercive and controlling behaviour between partners, which could include financial abuse, became illegal for the first time.

"As the 70th anniversary of the Black Dahlia murder approaches the public fascination with Elizabeth Short and her grisly unsolved death hasn't dimmed. James Bartlett takes a look at how Los Angeles remembers the famous murder. This article contains graphic descriptions. Few people noticed the dark-haired woman when she was dropped off at the swanky Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, but when her torso was found nearly a week later, Elizabeth Short became a household name. On the morning of 15 January 1947, Betty Bersinger was walking with her young daughter along a barely developed street in the planned neighbourhood of Leimert Park when she saw what she thought was two halves of a tailor's mannequin. It wasn't. Short had been cut in two, neatly at the waist, and drained of blood. She had been mutilated, her intestines removed, and her mouth slashed from ear to ear - a gruesome cut known as a Glasgow Smile. Her body had then been washed clean before being dumped in an empty field. An ensuing media frenzy followed, thanks  to the ""brutal, misogynistic and ritual nature"" of the killing, says Glynn Martin, former Los Angeles police sergeant and historian.  More than 50 suspects were interviewed, both male and female - some of whom confessed to the crime. But the murder was never solved, only adding to the crime's mystique. There was also the connection to the glamour of the area. ""She lived in Hollywood, had aspirations to be an actress,"" Martin says. The murder became ""a sad cliche - the ultimate warning tale"". ""A starry-eyed young girl comes to Hollywood, and things go very bad for her,"" he says. Then, of course, there was the memorable nickname, a twist on the previous year's Veronica Lake-Alan Ladd film The Blue Dahlia, and reference to Short's striking dark hair. In the decades since, the Black Dahlia case has inspired university theses, art projects and the name of a death metal band, as well as references in video games and television shows. In 2006, it even got the major motion picture treatment, an adaptation of James Ellroy's best-selling novel inspired by the case. Ellroy himself says he doesn't have any hope the culprit will be found. ""It's never going to be solved because it was not meant to be solved,"" he says. Kim Cooper and her husband Richard Schave run Esotouric's literary, crime and culture bus tours of Los Angeles, and Cooper says that many people who come on their Black Dahlia tour ""have their heads full of misinformation"". ""While we debunk the many theories about possible killers, we try to focus on the story of Elizabeth Short as a person."" But even the tour operators can be surprised, like when an older man joined one of their true crime tours, claiming a connection to the Black Dahlia. ""He told us that he had been a paper boy at the time, and had rushed to be one of the first at the crime scene. It was the first naked woman he ever saw,"" Cooper says. ""I think it affected the rest of his life."" Like the 19th Century killings by Jack the Ripper in London, Short's murder continues to bring forth new theories. Most recently, Steve Hodel, a former homicide detective, claimed his physician father George was the killer, and also responsible for other notable murders. A cadaver dog searched Hodel's former home in 2013 and seemingly ""alerted"" for human remains - though, of course, Short's body had long been found. During my research for Gourmet Ghosts, a series of true crime books, I found that many talkative Los Angeles bartenders claim their joint was actually the last place Short was seen alive, not the Biltmore. Some theorised her murder was the result of a date turned violent, or that the perennially-broke Short left to hitchhike home, a common practice at the time, and got into the wrong car. ""I was regularly asked about the Black Dahlia on the reference desk,"" says Christina Rice, senior librarian of the photo collection at the Los Angeles Public Library. One woman came in looking for maps from 1947 because ""she was going to use her psychic abilities to solve the murder"". The only copy of the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner's microfiche for the second half of January was stolen years ago, Rice says, adding Short was just one of many women brutally killed in the post-war years in California. The Biltmore, where you can buy a Black Dahlia cocktail As soon as the corpse was discovered, the Los Angeles Herald-Express and the sensationalist Los Angeles Examiner made full use of the cosy relationship that all newspapers had with the Los Angeles police department. At the time it was common to see suicide notes and bloodstained bodies - albeit sometimes airbrushed or altered, like Short's naked body, onto which photo editors superimposed a blanket - on the front page. Suicide photographs even added arrows showing how victims had taken their final fall. The Examiner also added complete fabrications to the Black Dahlia story, exchanging in their reporting the suit Short had been seen wearing for a tight skirt and blouse and implying sexual misadventures. The newspaper also deceived Short's mother about her daughter's death, using a ruse about ""Beth"" winning a beauty contest, then flying her to Los Angeles before telling her the real news - ensuring the scoop of a mother responding to the tragedy. Officially the case remains open, and today, the Biltmore Hotel serves a Black Dahlia cocktail of vodka, Chambord black raspberry liqueur and Kahlua. The drink, perhaps appropriately, tastes bitter.
