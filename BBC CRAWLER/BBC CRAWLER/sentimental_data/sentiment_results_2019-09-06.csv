"Nimisha Raja regrets stockpiling supplies earlier this year Many small firms can identify with Nimisha Raja's view of Brexit: ""We have absolutely no idea what's going on."" Ms Raja, founder and boss of Nim's Fruit Crisps, stockpiled supplies last year in the run-up to the original Brexit date in March. But she told the BBC she had no plans to do the same ahead of 31 October. Ms Raja is not alone. New research by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) shows 41% of UK firms have done no risk assessment on the impact of Brexit. The BCC survey canvassed the views of more than 1,500 business leaders. ""Last time we stockpiled, it came to absolutely nothing. We were lucky enough to get a deal with the NHS and we were able to use the products that we had stockpiled,"" said Ms Raja, whose factory is based in Kent. ""But this time around, it just feels like we want to do what [people at] Westminster seem to be doing, which is just folding their arms and waiting for the deadline."" The plan to force companies to be no-deal ready No-deal Brexit plan threatens UK fuel plants Brexit: All you need to know The BCC said: ""Business has consistently called on government to avoid a messy and disorderly exit. ""But in light of the political turmoil and relentless uncertainty, clearer and more consistent information is needed to help them prepare. ""With just weeks until a potential no-deal exit, there is still a large proportion of firms that aren't in a position to prepare for the impact."" A spokesman for the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said supporting businesses to ""get ready for Brexit on 31 October, and take advantage of the opportunities of leaving the EU"" was the department's top priority. The BEIS had announced Â£108m in funding support, he added. Currently efforts are continuing in Parliament to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. A bill designed to secure a three-month extension to the process could receive royal assent next week. All VAT-registered firms in the UK need an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number to continue to trade with customers and suppliers in the EU once the UK has left the EU. Firms without an EORI number will not be allowed to trade with EU member states after Brexit. Earlier this month, the government said it wouldstart automatically enrolling UK firmsin a customs system as it speeds up its preparations for a no-deal Brexit, a move the BCC campaigned for. How will Nim's Fruit Crisps cope with the Brexit crunch? But BCC director-general Dr Adam Marshall said businesses needed more information. ""There are many areas where there simply isn't enough clear and actionable information for businesses to mitigate some of the impacts of an unwanted no-deal exit."" Ms Raja said she was not at all clear about what preparations were needed to export her firm's products after the Brexit deadline. She said:  ""We are dealing with fresh produce, just-in-time products, and the worrying thing is that if suddenly on 31 October there are border controls, produce that we have coming in will be held up, which will mean production in our factories will stall."" Ms Raja said that despite everything, she was hopeful about future prospects. She added: ""I'm still optimistic about Made In Britain carrying as much weight as it always has done. ""Whether we're able to continue to export the way we have been doing and import the way we have been doing, I don't know.""

"Richard Selley and his wife Elaine travelled to Switzerland earlier this week A former teacher from Scotland who campaigned for the legalisation of euthanasia has died at a Swiss clinic. Richard Selley, 65, was suffering from motor neurone disease (MND). He had campaigned for a change in the law in a blog and a book on the issue. He had travelled from his home at Glenalmond near Perth to the clinic in Zurich earlier this week. ""Knowing that I will die very soon is a surreal experience, but it is my choice,"" he said. Mr Selley's wife Elaine wrote online: ""I am writing this post from my hotel room in Zurich. Richard died very peacefully at lunchtime today. His brother Peter and I were at his side. ""At Dignitas, in a clinically clean room, well appointed but devoid of any personal touches, we could feel all the love that has been shared with us over the years. ""The end was dignified and calm, exactly as Richard wanted. He had taken control of his own destiny."" Mr Selley, who had to talk-type to communicate, had spoken about being a ""prisoner"" in his own body and he has been campaigning for a change in the law. This video can not be played Richard Selley spoke to the BBC about his decision to end his life In July hewrote an open letter to MSPs,externalcalling for reform. He said in a video recorded before his journey to Switzerland: ""Having to be able to fly means that I am choosing to die earlier than I would prefer. ""If an assisted death was possible in Scotland, I would be able to die at a time of my choosing, at home."" He added: ""I hope that members of the Scottish parliament support an assisted dying bill in the future. ""I think the momentum for a change in the law is growing."" 'Why can't I die with dignity at home?' 'Change the law to spare me a painful death' What is assisted suicide and euthanasia? The campaign group Dignity in Dying published a report this week recommending that assisted dying is legalised in Scotland ""to give terminally ill, mentally competent adults a further option of escaping or avoiding a period of unbearable suffering at the end of lives"". It claimed that, even with high levels of palliative care, hundreds of patients still had no relief from pain at the end of life. The campaign's director Ally Thomson said: ""Our thoughts are with Elaine and her family. Richard and Elaine showed immense bravery and dignity in sharing their story and speaking out about the injustice they both suffered under Scotland's outdated, broken law in their final weeks together."" She added: ""As Richard pointed out in his final message, he received outstanding palliative care. But it was simply not enough to guarantee him the swift, peaceful and dignified death he wanted. ""Richard is not alone - this week we published research which finds that even with universal access to the best hospice care, 11 Scots a week would still die with absolutely no relief of their pain. ""Surely those people whose suffering is beyond the reach of palliative care deserve another option?"" Previousattempts to introduce new legislation have failed to get through the Scottish Parliament. Opponents of euthanasia argue that changing the law risks exposing people to abuse, coercion and exploitation. Dr Stuart Weir, national director at Christian charity CARE for Scotland, said the Dignity in Dying report failed to address those risks. He said: ""We believe this report muddies the waters by suggesting palliative care and assisted suicide are two sides of the same coin. ""The truth is that legalising assisted suicide goes right against the ethos of palliative care and in fact would undermine it."" He said there was a debate to be had about the provision of palliative care across Scotland, but that was ""a separate conversation to whether we should legalise something as dangerous as assisted suicide, with all the consequences of doing so"". Hundreds face 'unbearable pain' at end of life 'Why can't I die with dignity at home?' 'Change the law to spare me a painful death' What is assisted dying and how could the law change?

"This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Seven South American countries have agreed measures to protect the Amazon river basin, amid global concern over massive fires in the world's largest tropical forest. Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru and Suriname signed a pact, setting up a disaster response network and satellite monitoring. At a summit in Colombia, they also agreed to work on reforestation. More than 80,000 fires have broken out in the Amazon rainforest this year. Amazon fires: How bad have they got? Ten of your questions answered Are forest fires as bad as they seem? ""This meeting will live on as a co-ordination mechanism for the presidents that share this treasure - the Amazon,"" said Colombian Presiden IvÃ¡n Duque, who hosted the summit in the city of Leticia. Meanwhile, Peruvian President MartÃ­n Vizcarra said: ""Goodwill alone is not enough anymore."" The seven nations also agreed to put more efforts into education and increase the role of indigenous communities. Burning trees in the Brazilian Amazon The countries were represented in Leticia by presidents, vice-presidents and ministers. Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro took part by videolink because he was preparing for surgery. The Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming, and 60% of it is located in Brazil. The number of fires between January and August 2019 is double that of the same period last year, according to the country's National Institute for Space Research (Inpe). President Bolsonaro has drawn intense domestic and international criticism for failing to protect the region. This video can not be played President Bolsonaro responds to criticism about his previous comments on the Amazon fire Environmentalists say his policies have led to an increase in fires this year and that he has encouraged cattle farmers to clear vast swathes of the rainforest since his election last October. Bolivia has also seen fires rage across the forest near its borders with Brazil and Paraguay. Meanwhile, Brazil's leading meat export industry group and agricultural businesses have joined an environmental campaign calling for an end to deforestation in public lands in the Amazon and demanding government action. Several international retailers have said they are suspending purchases of Brazilian leather because of the links between cattle ranching and the fires devastating parts of the Amazon rainforest.

"A storm surge caused severe flooding in Ocracoke Hundreds of people may be trapped on a North Carolina island amid rising floodwater after Hurricane Dorian made landfall, the state governor has warned. The storm struck the islands popular with holidaymakers days after causing at least 30 deaths in the Bahamas. Roy Cooper warned of storm surges on the island of Ocracoke, where 800 people were said to have stayed behind. In the Bahamas, officials say hundreds, possibly thousands, are still missing. The official death toll is expected to increase to a ""staggering"" level, the country's government says. Officials are sending morticians and 200 body bags to the Abaco Islands, the worst-hit part of the archipelago. In pictures: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Path of destruction 'Hurricane's storm surge swallowed my son, 5' Have you been affected by Hurricane Dorian? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external ""The public needs to prepare for unimaginable information about the death toll and the human suffering,"" Health Minister Duane Sands told local radio. This video can not be played On board a UK ship offering aid and rescue to the Bahamas The storm made landfall at Cape Hatteras at 09:00 local time (13:00 GMT), with winds of 90mph (150 km/h), but by 11:00 local time its eye had moved about 50 miles to the north-east. However it lashed the Outer Banks islands with hurricane force winds as far as 45 miles away from the eye and with tropical storm winds up to 200 miles away, the National Hurricane Center said. Mr Cooper said there was ""significant concern"" for those reportedly trapped on Ocracoke and urged them to get to high ground. Rescue teams were ready to deploy as soon as the area became accessible, he said. Local weather officials posted video of a storm surge causing severe flooding in Ocracoke. Allow Twitter content?

Now downgraded to a category 1 hurricane, Dorian is moving north-east at about 17mph. It is expected to make landfall again on Saturday in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds are still expected in Virginia and other north-eastern states. This video can not be played Dorian continues to hit the Carolinas Three storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida and another in North Carolina. All four people died while preparing their homes and shelters for the storm. It has also caused severe flooding and widespread power failures in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. In the Carolinas, more than 900,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes, but it was unclear how many had complied. Forecasters said 10 inches (25 cm) of rain had fallen between the coasts of Charleston in South Carolina and Wilmington 170 miles away in North Carolina. Dorian hit the Bahamas as a category five hurricane with winds reaching 185mph (298km/h). It matched the highest ever recorded at landfall, and stayed over affected areas for two days. In its wake, at least 70,000 Bahamians needed immediate humanitarian relief. Great Abaco has been rendered virtually uninhabitable The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - were severely damaged or destroyed. Parts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain, leaving vast areas of it flooded. The Island of Great Abaco is virtually uninhabitable, with bodies piled up, no water, power or food, and militias formed to prevent looting, local media report. By Matt Morrison in Abaco Everyone who experienced the storm here on Abaco has a story to tell. Whether it is one of dramatic survival, or the loss of a loved one, every life has been affected. 'It was like being in a tornado for hours on end,' one Marsh Harbour resident told me. 'Everything is gone'. Driving down the streets one sees destruction in every direction. Homes and businesses have nearly all been levelled. Those that are left standing have broken windows and caved in walls. There is an eerie silence, as the few residents around survey the damage. About 5.5 miles off shore, Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary has stationed an aid ship, the Mounts Bay. The 179-meter vessel had been in the area as the storm approached, and the scene onboard is one of urgency and focus. Aid is being loaded onto floating platforms to make the two-hour journey to shore. The crew are on day three, and will continue here until they move on to the next disaster area. Aerial images over the Abacos showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels. This video can not be played Survivors of the hurricane say there is utter devastation The only international airport in Grand Bahama was also devastated. As a result, it could not be used for evacuations or aid deliveries. Dorian: Who is helping the survivors? Flood waters have reportedly rendered the Grand Bahamas' main hospital unusable, according to the Associated Press news agency. The Bahamas' government has signed an emergency declaration giving tax exemptions to medicine, building supplies and other goods that can be used for relief efforts. International aid operations have been primarily focused on Grand Bahama and the Abacos, which were hit worst. Search-and-rescue teams have been combing the worst-hit communities looking for any trace of survivors and bodies.  As of Friday, the US Coast Guard said it had rescued 205 residents. Meanwhile, efforts to deliver aid are being ramped up. Planes and helicopters have been flying in emergency supplies to help the estimated 76,000 people in need of food and shelter. The UK has committed $1.84m (Â£1.5m) to fund aid being delivered by the Royal Navy vessel RFA Mounts Bay and help coordinate the wider aid effort. Eight tonnes (8,000kg) of ready-to-eat meals, storage units, generators and other emergency suppliers are to be flown in from Panama, the UN World Food Programme said. A $5.4m (Â£4.3m) budget has been allocated to the UN agency for a three-month emergency operation in the Bahamas. According to the NHC, a ""hurricane season"" runs in the Atlantic Ocean between 1 June and 30 November. The term denotes a period when most of the year's tropical cyclones take place in the Atlantic, though it typically peaks in the late summer. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms This video can not be played Hurricanes and climate change Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

She told the BBC: ""When I saw she posted my picture and said she was proud of me, all I did was cry. She is such a strong person and that meant a lot. I had that picture but I had never posted it before because I was really insecure about my body. When Demi posted hers I felt really inspired by her courage and decided to post mine too."" Cellulite is a condition where the skin has a dimpled and lumpy appearance. It affects 90% of all women at some point in their lives yet is often airbrushed from pictures or not shown at all.

"Richard Selley and his wife Elaine travelled to Switzerland earlier this week A former teacher from Scotland who campaigned for the legalisation of euthanasia has died at a Swiss clinic. Richard Selley, 65, was suffering from motor neurone disease (MND). He had campaigned for a change in the law in a blog and a book on the issue. He had travelled from his home at Glenalmond near Perth to the clinic in Zurich earlier this week. ""Knowing that I will die very soon is a surreal experience, but it is my choice,"" he said. Mr Selley's wife Elaine wrote online: ""I am writing this post from my hotel room in Zurich. Richard died very peacefully at lunchtime today. His brother Peter and I were at his side. ""At Dignitas, in a clinically clean room, well appointed but devoid of any personal touches, we could feel all the love that has been shared with us over the years. ""The end was dignified and calm, exactly as Richard wanted. He had taken control of his own destiny."" Mr Selley, who had to talk-type to communicate, had spoken about being a ""prisoner"" in his own body and he has been campaigning for a change in the law. This video can not be played Richard Selley spoke to the BBC about his decision to end his life In July hewrote an open letter to MSPs,externalcalling for reform. He said in a video recorded before his journey to Switzerland: ""Having to be able to fly means that I am choosing to die earlier than I would prefer. ""If an assisted death was possible in Scotland, I would be able to die at a time of my choosing, at home."" He added: ""I hope that members of the Scottish parliament support an assisted dying bill in the future. ""I think the momentum for a change in the law is growing."" 'Why can't I die with dignity at home?' 'Change the law to spare me a painful death' What is assisted suicide and euthanasia? The campaign group Dignity in Dying published a report this week recommending that assisted dying is legalised in Scotland ""to give terminally ill, mentally competent adults a further option of escaping or avoiding a period of unbearable suffering at the end of lives"". It claimed that, even with high levels of palliative care, hundreds of patients still had no relief from pain at the end of life. The campaign's director Ally Thomson said: ""Our thoughts are with Elaine and her family. Richard and Elaine showed immense bravery and dignity in sharing their story and speaking out about the injustice they both suffered under Scotland's outdated, broken law in their final weeks together."" She added: ""As Richard pointed out in his final message, he received outstanding palliative care. But it was simply not enough to guarantee him the swift, peaceful and dignified death he wanted. ""Richard is not alone - this week we published research which finds that even with universal access to the best hospice care, 11 Scots a week would still die with absolutely no relief of their pain. ""Surely those people whose suffering is beyond the reach of palliative care deserve another option?"" Previousattempts to introduce new legislation have failed to get through the Scottish Parliament. Opponents of euthanasia argue that changing the law risks exposing people to abuse, coercion and exploitation. Dr Stuart Weir, national director at Christian charity CARE for Scotland, said the Dignity in Dying report failed to address those risks. He said: ""We believe this report muddies the waters by suggesting palliative care and assisted suicide are two sides of the same coin. ""The truth is that legalising assisted suicide goes right against the ethos of palliative care and in fact would undermine it."" He said there was a debate to be had about the provision of palliative care across Scotland, but that was ""a separate conversation to whether we should legalise something as dangerous as assisted suicide, with all the consequences of doing so"".

"This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Seven South American countries have agreed measures to protect the Amazon river basin, amid global concern over massive fires in the world's largest tropical forest. Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru and Suriname signed a pact, setting up a disaster response network and satellite monitoring. At a summit in Colombia, they also agreed to work on reforestation. More than 80,000 fires have broken out in the Amazon rainforest this year. Amazon fires: How bad have they got? Ten of your questions answered Are forest fires as bad as they seem? ""This meeting will live on as a co-ordination mechanism for the presidents that share this treasure - the Amazon,"" said Colombian Presiden IvÃ¡n Duque, who hosted the summit in the city of Leticia. Meanwhile, Peruvian President MartÃ­n Vizcarra said: ""Goodwill alone is not enough anymore."" The seven nations also agreed to put more efforts into education and increase the role of indigenous communities. Burning trees in the Brazilian Amazon The countries were represented in Leticia by presidents, vice-presidents and ministers. Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro took part by videolink because he was preparing for surgery. The Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming, and 60% of it is located in Brazil. The number of fires between January and August 2019 is double that of the same period last year, according to the country's National Institute for Space Research (Inpe). President Bolsonaro has drawn intense domestic and international criticism for failing to protect the region. This video can not be played President Bolsonaro responds to criticism about his previous comments on the Amazon fire Environmentalists say his policies have led to an increase in fires this year and that he has encouraged cattle farmers to clear vast swathes of the rainforest since his election last October. Bolivia has also seen fires rage across the forest near its borders with Brazil and Paraguay. Meanwhile, Brazil's leading meat export industry group and agricultural businesses have joined an environmental campaign calling for an end to deforestation in public lands in the Amazon and demanding government action. Several international retailers have said they are suspending purchases of Brazilian leather because of the links between cattle ranching and the fires devastating parts of the Amazon rainforest.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he believed voters want the country to ""get on"" with Brexit Boris Johnson has claimed his political opponents ""don't trust the people"" as they vowed to again block his demand for a snap general election. Opposition parties have said they will vote against or abstain in Monday's vote on whether to hold a poll. Mr Johnson said the public was tired of ""dither and delay"" over Brexit, and want us to ""get this thing done"". And he vowed to ""go to Brussels and get a deal"" that would allow the UK to leave the EU on 31 October. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru held talks on Friday on their strategy over the timing of a general election after joining forces earlier this week to block the PM's plan to hold an early vote All four parties have said they will again not support the PM's call for an election in the Commons on Monday. Opposition parties to reject PM election move John Curtice: Why Nicola Sturgeon wants an election They are concerned that Mr Johnson would not stick to his pledge to have the election on 15 October, and would instead wait until after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October - potentially without a deal. Speaking on a visit to Aberdeenshire, the prime minister told journalists that it was ""curious"" the opposition had refused his offer of an election. A bull bumped into a plain clothes police officer while being walked by the PM at a farm in Banchory, near Aberdeen Mr Johnson added: ""They don't trust the people, they don't want an election - perhaps it is because they don't think that they will win. ""Fine. I'll go to Brussels, I'll get a deal and we'll make sure we come out on 31 October"". He insisted a deal would be agreed by 17 or 18 October - the dates of an EU Council summit - and would allow the UK to ""start a new partnership with our European friends"". The PM said the public was tired of ""endless, pointless delays"" to Brexit, and ""want us to get on and do it"", and that ""never in history has the opposition party been given the chance for election and turned it down."" Mr Johnson has previously said he would rather be ""dead in a ditch"" than ask for another extension to Brexit - but he said resigning as PM if the country does not leave the EU by that date was ""not a hypothesis I want to contemplate"". He also said he could see ""no reason"" to agree to a second Scottish independence referendum. In other developments on Friday: There was some good news for Mr Johnson when the High Court in Londonrejected a legal challenge by campaigner Gina Miller, who wanted his plan to suspend Parliament ruled illegal The court immediately said Ms Miller could appeal. A decision in the appeal against a similar ruling in the Court of Session in Edinburgh earlier this weekis expected to be delivered next Wednesday. But the panel of three Court of Session judges refused to grant an interim interdict which would have prevented Parliament being prorogued before they deliver their verdict. A bill aimed at ensuring the UK cannot leave the EU without an exit deal has completed its passage through the House of Lords. Mr Johnson visited a fish market in Peterhead as he kicked off his trip to Scotland Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the possibility of having an election was ""extremely attractive"" but the ""immediate crisis"" of preventing a no-deal Brexit had to be dealt with first. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says she would ""relish"" a general election, and predicted that the SNP would ""beat the Tories"" in Scotland on a ticket of offering the country a chance to ""choose our own future"". Court releases PM's Parliament shutdown memos Could an early election still happen? MPs set for fresh early election vote on Monday But she told BBC Scotland that her priority was stopping a no-deal Brexit, and that a November general election was now looking more likely than October. And she said holding a general election before the end of October could allow Mr Johnson to ""cut and run"". The prime minister's trip to Scotland will include a visit to the Queen's Balmoral estate. He is expected to cut short his visit to the monarch's summer residence - a traditional prime ministerial trip each summer - because of the Brexit crisis. Rather than the usual weekend-long visit, Mr Johnson and girlfriend Carrie Symonds are likely to return to London on Saturday. A politically bruising week for the prime minister has seen Mr Johnson lose his Commons majority, the expulsion of 21 of his own MPs for rebelling and his younger brother resign from government, alongside defeats in the Commons over Brexit. Nicola Sturgeon does not believe a general election in October is in the public interest Mr Johnson used his visit to Scotland to announce Â£51.4m of funding for Scottish farmers over the next two years, in addition to aÂ£160m package unveiled earlier this weekas part of the Spending Review. The move is aimed at settling a long-running row over the distribution of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy payments across the UK, and meets the recommendations of the newly-published Bew Review. The funding was announced as the UK government confirmed it would work to ensure cash for farmers was fairly allocated across the whole of the UK, and that the industry would be ready for a ""prosperous future"" outside the EU. This video can not be played So who actually wants an election? NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick described the move as being the ""largest funding uplift for the sector in recent memory"". But the SNP said Mr Johnson was like a ""thief returning to the scene of a crime"", while Labour said the prime minister was ""no friend"" of Scottish agriculture. The prime minister started his visit to Scotland at Peterhead Fish Market and joined in with a bidding war over a box of cod - which he ended up buying for Â£185. Asked whether Mr Johnson had paid a good price, fish market chief executive Simon Brebner said: ""If you're selling, it's a great price. If you're buying, maybe it's a little high.""

"A storm surge caused severe flooding in Ocracoke Hundreds of people may be trapped on a North Carolina island amid rising floodwater after Hurricane Dorian made landfall, the state governor has warned. The storm struck the islands popular with holidaymakers days after causing at least 30 deaths in the Bahamas. Roy Cooper warned of storm surges on the island of Ocracoke, where 800 people were said to have stayed behind. In the Bahamas, officials say hundreds, possibly thousands, are still missing. The official death toll is expected to increase to a ""staggering"" level, the country's government says. Officials are sending morticians and 200 body bags to the Abaco Islands, the worst-hit part of the archipelago. In pictures: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Path of destruction 'Hurricane's storm surge swallowed my son, 5' Have you been affected by Hurricane Dorian? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external ""The public needs to prepare for unimaginable information about the death toll and the human suffering,"" Health Minister Duane Sands told local radio. This video can not be played On board a UK ship offering aid and rescue to the Bahamas The storm made landfall at Cape Hatteras at 09:00 local time (13:00 GMT), with winds of 90mph (150 km/h), but by 11:00 local time its eye had moved about 50 miles to the north-east. However it lashed the Outer Banks islands with hurricane force winds as far as 45 miles away from the eye and with tropical storm winds up to 200 miles away, the National Hurricane Center said. Mr Cooper said there was ""significant concern"" for those reportedly trapped on Ocracoke and urged them to get to high ground. Rescue teams were ready to deploy as soon as the area became accessible, he said. Local weather officials posted video of a storm surge causing severe flooding in Ocracoke. Allow Twitter content?

Now downgraded to a category 1 hurricane, Dorian is moving north-east at about 17mph. It is expected to make landfall again on Saturday in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds are still expected in Virginia and other north-eastern states. This video can not be played Dorian continues to hit the Carolinas Three storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida and another in North Carolina. All four people died while preparing their homes and shelters for the storm. It has also caused severe flooding and widespread power failures in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. In the Carolinas, more than 900,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes, but it was unclear how many had complied. Forecasters said 10 inches (25 cm) of rain had fallen between the coasts of Charleston in South Carolina and Wilmington 170 miles away in North Carolina. Dorian hit the Bahamas as a category five hurricane with winds reaching 185mph (298km/h). It matched the highest ever recorded at landfall, and stayed over affected areas for two days. In its wake, at least 70,000 Bahamians needed immediate humanitarian relief. Great Abaco has been rendered virtually uninhabitable The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - were severely damaged or destroyed. Parts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain, leaving vast areas of it flooded. The Island of Great Abaco is virtually uninhabitable, with bodies piled up, no water, power or food, and militias formed to prevent looting, local media report. By Matt Morrison in Abaco Everyone who experienced the storm here on Abaco has a story to tell. Whether it is one of dramatic survival, or the loss of a loved one, every life has been affected. 'It was like being in a tornado for hours on end,' one Marsh Harbour resident told me. 'Everything is gone'. Driving down the streets one sees destruction in every direction. Homes and businesses have nearly all been levelled. Those that are left standing have broken windows and caved in walls. There is an eerie silence, as the few residents around survey the damage. About 5.5 miles off shore, Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary has stationed an aid ship, the Mounts Bay. The 179-meter vessel had been in the area as the storm approached, and the scene onboard is one of urgency and focus. Aid is being loaded onto floating platforms to make the two-hour journey to shore. The crew are on day three, and will continue here until they move on to the next disaster area. Aerial images over the Abacos showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels. This video can not be played Survivors of the hurricane say there is utter devastation The only international airport in Grand Bahama was also devastated. As a result, it could not be used for evacuations or aid deliveries. Dorian: Who is helping the survivors? Flood waters have reportedly rendered the Grand Bahamas' main hospital unusable, according to the Associated Press news agency. The Bahamas' government has signed an emergency declaration giving tax exemptions to medicine, building supplies and other goods that can be used for relief efforts. International aid operations have been primarily focused on Grand Bahama and the Abacos, which were hit worst. Search-and-rescue teams have been combing the worst-hit communities looking for any trace of survivors and bodies.  As of Friday, the US Coast Guard said it had rescued 205 residents. Meanwhile, efforts to deliver aid are being ramped up. Planes and helicopters have been flying in emergency supplies to help the estimated 76,000 people in need of food and shelter. The UK has committed $1.84m (Â£1.5m) to fund aid being delivered by the Royal Navy vessel RFA Mounts Bay and help coordinate the wider aid effort. Eight tonnes (8,000kg) of ready-to-eat meals, storage units, generators and other emergency suppliers are to be flown in from Panama, the UN World Food Programme said. A $5.4m (Â£4.3m) budget has been allocated to the UN agency for a three-month emergency operation in the Bahamas. According to the NHC, a ""hurricane season"" runs in the Atlantic Ocean between 1 June and 30 November. The term denotes a period when most of the year's tropical cyclones take place in the Atlantic, though it typically peaks in the late summer. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms This video can not be played Hurricanes and climate change Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

She told the BBC: ""When I saw she posted my picture and said she was proud of me, all I did was cry. She is such a strong person and that meant a lot. I had that picture but I had never posted it before because I was really insecure about my body. When Demi posted hers I felt really inspired by her courage and decided to post mine too.""

"Reiss, Ralston and Ricky (l-r) Gabriel were jailed after DNA linked to them was found on a pistol intended for a violent criminal Identical triplets have been jailed after DNA linked them to a plot to supply an ""extremely dangerous criminal"" with an Uzi sub-machine gun. DNA found on a handgun linked it to either Reiss, Ralston or Ricky Gabriel but it was impossible for police to prove which brother it belonged to. However, an investigation revealed all three were involved. The 28-year-olds, from Edmonton in north London, were sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court. Forensic examinations of a handgun found DNA linked Reiss, Ralston an Ricky Gabriel. Ricky and Ralston Gabriel, who are both semi-professional footballers, were found guilty of conspiracy to possess firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life in July and each jailed for 14 years. Reiss Gabriel was found guilty of the same charge and also admitted possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life after being caught with a handgun in July last year, and two counts of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply. He was jailed for 18 years. Armed police found an Uzi sub-machine gun with a silencer and ammunition and a loaded pistol on courier Hamza Ahmed Armed police found an Uzi sub-machine gun with a silencer and ammunition and a loaded pistol on courier Hamza Ahmed, 21, after stopping a taxi in Tottenham, north London, on 10 April 2017. The DNA recovered from the pistol was not attributable to just one of the triplets, as they shared almost identical DNA. Detectives carried out an extensive investigation to find out which of the brothers was involved in handling the firearms - but mobile phone and surveillance evidence revealed it was all three, the court heard. Aron Thomas was given a life sentence for two counts of conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life. The brothers were the final three of eight individuals charged over a plot to supply weapons. Prosecutor Kerry Broome said: ""An Uzi sub-machine gun is clearly an extraordinarily serious firearm. It is not capable of any lawful use. It has the capability to cause maximum indiscriminate harm. ""The pistol was loaded. They were both ready for immediate use."" The firearms were meant for Aron Thomas, 32, who was caught with another loaded revolver and ammunition when he was held on 26 April 2017. At the time, he was on licence, having been released from an 11-year prison sentence for opening fire at random towards a crowded street near Wood Green Tube station in 2010. Thomas, from Holloway, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years last year after he was found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life. Hamza Ahmed, Elyace Hamchaoui and Joshua Miller were also jailed over the plot Ahmed, from Archway, north London, was jailed for 16 years for one count of conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life in relation to the first incident. Middleman Elyace Hamchaoui, 23, from Arnos Grove, north London, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for the same charge. Joshua Miller, 27, of no fixed address, was jailed for 17 years for conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life in relation to the second incident.

"Peter Hartley was jailed for 16 months A sex offender who concealed a spy camera in the ladies' toilets at Pinewood Studios has been jailed. Maintenance worker Peter Hartley, 50, planted a tiny motion-triggered camera behind a grille in the toilets at the studios in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. The camera was spotted in June by a woman working at Pinewood, where the new James Bond film is being shot, Aylesbury Crown Court heard. Hartley, of Uxbridge, west London, was jailed for 16 months. The latest Bond film is being filmed at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire He will be on the sex offenders register for 10 years. Hartley, who was working as a maintenance man, was caught after the worker noticed light reflecting from the lens similar ""to light reflecting off the face of a watch"" and used a screwdriver to take off the grille. Prosecutor Daniel Wright told the court the device was marketed as a ""spy camera"" and Hartley had used a piece of tape to cover its LED light to try to stop it being detected. Hartley, who has a history of similar offences dating back to 2008, contacted his public protection officer at the Met Police later that morning to tell him he had reoffended. He has previous convictions for placing cameras in a council building in Coventry in 2009 and for placing one in the changing rooms of a leisure centre in 2016. Hartley has a total of three convictions for eight offences. He later pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism at Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court. In a victim impact statement, the young woman who found the camera said she had needed mental health treatment and had suffered from acute anxiety. Jailing Hartley, Judge Francis Sheridan said the victim's life ""has been devastated by a dirty-minded individual who preys on women"".

"University admissions service Ucas has been accused of promoting ""inappropriate"", high-interest private loans to students. An email sent by Ucas Media included an advert for Future Finance, which offers student loans with interest rates of between 8% and 23.7% - higher than those of government-funded loans. Consumer campaigner Martin Lewis said Ucas had ""breached an ethical line"". Ucas said it always advised government loans as the best option for students. The Labour Party's deputy leader Tom Watsontweeted,externalthat it was ""indefensible"" for Ucas to promote ""sky-high loans"", adding it should ""drop these adverts straight away"". Olga Dolchenko, CEO of Future Finance, said it was a ""highly valued source of funding"" for students who needed extra financial assistance and it always advised customers to seek a government-funded loan first. Ucas is an independent charity that operates the application process for UK universities. The advert for Future Finance was sent on 22 August by Ucas Media - the organisation's commercial arm - to subscribers who had opted in to receiving marketing emails. Martin Lewis, who founded MoneySavingExpert.com, has written to Ucas, the universities minister and Universities UK calling for Ucas to stop sending emails with adverts for commercial loans, arguing it had ""failed in its duty of care"" to existing and prospective students. He said the loans were ""inappropriate for the huge majority of recipients"", with higher interest rates than government-funded loans, which are provided by the Student Loans Company, a non-profit, government-owned organisation. ""Ucas has privileged, monopoly access to this young and impressionable audience,""he wrote in his letter,external. ""It is also seen as an institutional authority and therefore adverts contained in your email are effectively being legitimised by inclusion, and some may even mistake it for a direct recommendation."" He said the loans offered by Future Finance were ""an entirely different beast"" to government-funded loans, which currently have a maximum interest rate of 5.4%, are only repaid once graduates earn a certain amount and are wiped after 30 years. Students must start paying off Future Finance loans while they are still at university. A spokesperson for Universities UK said government-backed student loans were ""the best available option"" as, unlike a conventional debt, the amount repaid depends on how much the graduate is earning, and outstanding repayments do not impact on future lenders' decisions. Would the proposed student finance changes help poorer students? Rich students save by paying fees up front In a statement, Ucas said students had to actively opt-in to receive marketing material from outside companies and it ""carefully considers which companies to work with"". It added that Ucas was compliant with all relevant Charity Commission guidance. Ms Dolchenko said Future Finance offered ""fully transparent and flexible loans"" and ""never encourages students to borrow more than they can afford"". ""Our terms are competitive when compared with other forms of private finance, but also need to reflect the risk we take on by lending to young people with little or no credit history,"" she added.

Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare at the National Union of Students, said increasing numbers of students were resorting to using ""high-cost lenders"" as government-funded student maintenance loans often failed to cover living costs. A Department for Education spokesperson said government-funded loans were available to eligible students regardless of their financial background, and no commercial loans offered the same level of borrower protection. ""We have increased cash-in-hand living costs support for undergraduate students from the lowest income households by 2.8% for the current academic year - 2019/20 - and have announced a further 2.9% increase for 2020/21 - to record levels,"" the spokesperson added.

"British Airways and its pilots have been urged by Number 10 to ""sort out"" the dispute which will see pilots walk out next week in a row over pay. ""The unions and BA need to get round the table and sort this out. The public would expect nothing less,"" it said. BA pilots are due to strike on Monday and Tuesday over a pay offer pilots' union Balpa says is too low. The vast majority of flights are expected to be cancelled on those two days, causing knock-on disruption. BA would not say how many flights had been affected, but reports suggested it was around 1,600 flights. ""Nobody should have their travel plans disrupted or their holidays ruined,"" Number 10 said. The airline says it has emailed customers travelling on flights that are affected but the flight's status can still be checkedon the website,external. The airline and the union did not provide an update on the status of their dispute on Friday. The two-day strike, set for next week, follows failed negotiations between the union and the airline over a pay offer of 11.5% over three years. Unite and GMB, representing cabin crew and engineers, have accepted the offer. However, pilots have argued that the pay award should be higher, following recent years of low pay increases and BA's recent strong financial performance. BA has said it was open to ""constructive talks"", but said Balpa was not acting in good faith. The union has said it would call off the strike if BA would discuss a new proposal outlined in a letter on Thursday to the airline. Ryanair pilots vote for further strikes Passengers angry at BA 'silence' amid strike chaos The union's general secretary Brian Strutton said his members were still ""very angry"" with BA, but were also willing to be flexible. ""They also want to leave no stone unturned in trying to find a resolution to their dispute,"" he said. In response, BA had said: ""We do not believe the union is acting in good faith by making an 11th-hour inflated proposal which would cost an additional Â£50m."" The airline said Balpa should return to the talks without pre-conditions. The union was acting ""cynically"" by waiting until a late stage when the airline had already made arrangements to manage the industrial action, BA added. ""Our customers need the certainty that Balpa will call off the strikes for good, not just for two days next week,"" the airline said. A further day of strike action is scheduled for 27 September.

"This video can not be played Survivors of the hurricane say there is utter devastation The death toll from Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas will be ""staggering"", the country's government has warned as aid efforts are being stepped up. The official death toll stands at 30, but is expected to rise further. Officials are sending morticians and 200 body bags to the Abaco Islands, the worst-hit part of the archipelago. Dorian - which devastated the northern Bahamas from Sunday to Tuesday - has now made landfall in the US state of North Carolina, but is weakening. Officials say hundreds, possibly thousands, are still missing in the Abacos and Grand Bahama. In pictures: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Path of destruction 'Hurricane's storm surge swallowed my son, 5' Have you been affected by Hurricane Dorian? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external On Thursday Health Minister Duane Sands warned of a ""staggering"" final count. ""The public needs to prepare for unimaginable information about the death toll and the human suffering,"" he told local radio. Dr Ian Norton, who manages the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s emergency medical teams, also told reporters that he was also ""really worried"" about the potential death toll. Great Abaco has been rendered virtually uninhabitable Dorian hit the Bahamas as a category five hurricane with winds reaching 185mph (297km/h). It matched the highest ever recorded at landfall, and stayed over affected areas for two days. The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - were severely damaged or destroyed. Parts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain, leaving vast areas of it flooded. The Island of Great Abaco is virtually uninhabitable, with bodies piled up, no water, power or food, and militias formed to prevent looting, local media report. This video can not be played Residents in the Bahamas say ""it's total devastation"" Aerial images over the Abacos showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels. The only international airport in Grand Bahama was also devastated. As a result, it could not be used for evacuations or aid deliveries. The WHO said flooding had rendered Grand Bahama's main hospital unusable, and a field hospital would need to be set up in its place. Several patients have been airlifted from Marsh Harbour Medical Centre in the Abacos, according to the Associated Press news agency, but the site is still being run as a shelter. Matt Morrison, BBC News, Bahamas Everyone who experienced the storm here on Abaco has a story to tell. Whether it is one of dramatic survival, or the loss of a loved one, every life has been affected. 'It was like being in a tornado for hours on end,' one Marsh Harbour resident told me. 'Everything is gone'. Driving down the streets one sees destruction in every direction. Homes and businesses have nearly all been levelled. Those that are left standing have broken windows and caved in walls. There is an eerie silence, as the few residents around survey the damage. About 5.5 miles off shore, Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary has stationed an aid ship, the Mounts Bay. The 179-meter vessel had been in the area as the storm approached, and the scene onboard is one of urgency and focus. Aid is being loaded onto floating platforms to make the two-hour journey to shore. The crew are on day three, and will continue here until they move on to the next disaster area. The Bahamas' government has signed an emergency declaration giving tax exemptions to medicine, building supplies and other goods that can be used for relief efforts. International aid operations have been primarily focused on Grand Bahama and the Abacos, which were hit worst. Search-and-rescue teams have been combing the worst-hit communities looking for any trace of survivors and bodies.  As of Friday, the US Coast Guard said it had rescued 205 residents. Meanwhile, efforts to deliver aid are being ramped up. Planes and helicopters have been flying in emergency supplies to help the estimated 76,000 people in need of food and shelter. Eight tonnes (8,000kg) of ready-to-eat meals, storage units, generators and other emergency suppliers are to be flown in from Panama, the UN World Food Programme said. A $5.4m (Â£4.3m) budget has been allocated to the UN agency for a three-month emergency operation in the Bahamas. However, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said damage to roads and other infrastructure was hampering relief efforts. Now downgraded to a category 1 hurricane, Dorian has made landfall in the US. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that at 09:00 local time (13:00 GMT) Dorian hit Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with 90mph (145km/h) winds. The storm has already caused severe flooding and widespread power failures in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian causes floods and tornadoes in South Carolina In the Carolinas, more than 900,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes, but it was unclear how many had complied. Forecasters said 10 inches (25 cm) of rain has fallen between the coasts of Charleston, South Carolina and Wilmington, North Carolina 170 miles away. Dorian is expected to push north and out into the Atlantic, but will make landfall again on Saturday in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds are still expected in Virginia and other north-eastern states. Three storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida and another in North Carolina. All four died whilst preparing their homes and shelters for the storm. According to the NHC, a ""hurricane season"" runs in the Atlantic Ocean between 1 June and 30 November. The term denotes a period when most of the year's tropical cyclones take place in the Atlantic, though it typically peaks in the late summer. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms This video can not be played Hurricanes and climate change Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds.

"A London gender identity clinic has mistakenly exposed details of close to 2,000 people on its email list. The Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic sent patients an email about an art competition, with hundreds of others CC-ed in. The clinic later tried to recall the message but the error had already been noticed. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, which is responsible for the clinic, is investigating. Two separate emails were sent, with about 900 people CC-ed on each. One patient at the clinic, Jessie, told the BBC she was angry about what had happened. ""It could out someone, especially as this place treats people who are transgender,"" she said. A spokesman for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We are currently investigating a data security incident. ""This incident involved an email from our patient and public involvement team regarding an art project. ""Unfortunately, due to an error, the email addresses of some of those we are inviting to participate were not hidden and therefore visible to all. ""We can confirm we are reporting this breach to the Information Commissioner's Office as well as treating it as a serious incident within the Trust."" A spokeswoman for the ICO said: ""Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust has made us aware of an incident and we will assess the information provided."" In 2016, an NHS Trust was fined Â£180,000 after a sexual health centre mistakenly leaked the details of nearly 800 patients who had attended HIV clinics. In that case, the 56 Dean Street clinic had sent a group email without using the BCC function, which obscures other recipients in the mailing list. The incident took place before the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which can see organisations fined up to â¬20 million (Â£18m) or 4% of their annual global turnover.

Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler will have to stand up too. The first target tomorrow will be the follow-on. England need 98 runs to avoid it. Then it is just a matter of batting on and on and on to try and keep the Ashes alive. We'll be back tomorrow from 10:30 BST to see what happens. Scroll down for reaction and highlights or head over to ourreportfor full details of the day. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special Nathan Lyon didn't bowl well today. He's not had any effect since Edgbaston's second innings and then he dropped that ball last week that should have won Australia the Ashes. He has probably had a worse week then Tim Paine because he had the opportunity to run out Leach. It's not easy to cope with that. Lyon will have a say in this match, but the mental side of playing at this level, the Ashes is the biggest series of them all and over the last week or so I'm sure Lyon would have had sleepless nights about dropping that ball. I have a funny feeling that over the course of the next few days, he'll have another moment. This is Australia's game to lose. But you can never count this Aussie attack out. Pat Cummins turned the pressure up and Josh Hazlewood grabbed the wickets. He took three late in the day, Jason Roy followed Burns and Root back to the pavilion. From a half-decent position, England's hopes are looking bleak once again. After the early wicket Rory Burns and Joe Root dug in really well. They saw off some excellent bowling for more than 50 overs. They shared a partnership of 141 and for a while England fans were enjoying themselves. It feels an awful long time ago when Craig Overton fell in the second over of the day. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special England have to bat beyond lunch, bat into the afternoon session and if they can get to 350, they're taking overs out of the game that they'll have to bat on Sunday. It will be the great escape. They say it's grim up north - it needs to be grim up north for England to get out of this one. #bbccricket Angus Robb:Look at the two batting line-ups, 1-11 England are holding their own in the series but we need a big centurion per innings for our flair players to play around. You can't help thinking that Root and Burns needed to be that centurion for this innings to be competitive. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special That Pat Cummins' spell was probably the best spell of the series and the fact is, Rory Burns survived that spell. That should give him a huge amount of confidence. Every single person that adores Test cricket would admire what Cummins produced for his team today. Pat Cummins bowled 10 overs on the spin in that last session. He was consistently brilliant. Root and Burns could not get the ball away and the Aussie fast bowler could have easily added to his wicket from Thursday. Somehow he didn't take any. This was as close as he came.

Terry, Oxford Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special Rory Burns speaks very honestly but he has a bit of an authority about it. They say he's a good leader at Surrey and he speaks very much like a captain. I admire players that work it out for themselves.

""I found a way to get through today and that's probably the method of my batting - try and find a way to get through and develop stuff on the quiet. It's about partnerships, now.

Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special Test cricket is hard. It's tough. They're up against a high-class bowling unit. To get runs against this attack you need to be strong in your mind, have a strong technique and have ultimate belief in yourself. Don't forget if England lose this game then the Ashes will be gone. They have serious work to do tomorrow now. They have two days to go to fight it out. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root is having to fight and dig in for his team. He'd love to go out and play flamboyantly but I think in the back of a lot of their minds is, hang on, our batting line-up is a bit fragile. If he had Bairstow and Buttler in fine form, he might go out and play a bit more extravagantly, but in this team at the minute, I don't think he can. Australia bowler Pat Cummins:""The ball started to zip around and I felt in the game. It was not to be for me. It makes me happy when Josh comes on and takes wickets at the other end straight away. He did say I owe you one for that. ""The one good thing with it being 15 degrees is you can keep on bowling. ""We are pretty happy being 300 ahead. It was a tough day of Test cricket.

"Riot police, a helicopter and dog units were deployed at the Govan parade Police Scotland has said it will have a ""significant"" presence at two Irish republican marches through Glasgow on Saturday. Glasgow City Council has agreed to allow the processionsto go ahead a week after a march through Govan was marred by sectarian violence. Council bosses had previously threatened to take action against marches to protect the public. Police said security for Saturday's events had been ""extensively planned"". Legal moves to tackle sectarian disorder Sturgeon condemns 'sectarian' disorder in Glasgow Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: ""Without going into specific numbers, I can confirm that we will have a significant deployment of conventional and specialist resources across the city. ""Police Scotland has to balance the right of people who wish to take part in the processions, under the conditions agreed by Glasgow City Council, and those who wish to protest peacefully and lawfully."" This video can not be played Roads were blocked as a result of the demonstrations He added: ""I am appealing that those taking part should do so in a peaceful and lawful manner, which will allow us to facilitate the rights of all in terms of freedom of expression. ""I want to re-emphasise that anyone intent on becoming involved in any kind of anti-social or criminal behaviour will be dealt with promptly."" Riot police, a helicopter and dog units were called in last Friday evening when an Irish Unity march in Govan was met by hundreds of ""disruptive"" counter demonstrators. Roads were blocked in what police described as ""significant disorder"". Nicola Sturgeon condemned the scenes as ""utterly unacceptable"". The Scottish government's justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, has now said he is ""open-minded"" about increasing council powers to restrict marches. But he insisted introducing a blanket ban on loyalist and republican parades would be impossible as the European Convention on Human Rights ""simply wouldn't allow it"". Mr Yousaf said: ""If there is something we can do legislatively to give more powers to councils to restrict these marches, I am open-minded."" The first of Saturday's marches, led by the Cairde na hEireann group, will assemble at 14:00 and march from Millroad Street in the city's east end, along the Gallowgate and finish at Clyde Street. Meanwhile, Friends of IRPWA will begin their procession at 15:00 from Blythswood Square, head down to the Broomielaw, on to Trongate and finish at Barrowlands Park.

"This video can not be played Joe and Isabel Baxter have lived in their house in Deans South for 53 years There were once 240 inhabited houses on Livingston's Deans South housing estate in West Lothian. Now there are only nine. The houses were condemned 15 years ago, and while most people have left, a handful of families still live among the derelict buildings. They claim the council has not offered them enough money to leave. Now they are hopeful a developer will enable them to move on, but the council said it was not a complete solution. Isabel and Joe Baxter have lived in their house in Deans South for 53 years. Their immaculate home stands out among the derelict, boarded up buildings which surround it. These council houses were condemned 15 years ago, and most people moved. However the Baxters, who had bought their home, stayed. The council tenants were re-housed, and Mrs Baxter said that was what they wanted - a house for a house. Only nine of the original houses in South Deans are still occupied. Mrs Baxter said West Lothian Council has never offered them enough money for theirs. She said: ""They're expecting us to just to go and take what they want to give us. ""They're not even giving us the valuation of the house. ""Our house was valued at Â£110,000 about 15 years ago. ""But they want to give us Â£41,000. It's not on. "" Most of the 240 homes at Deans South are uninhabited Only nine of the original houses in South Deans are still occupied. Joe Baxter said it can be a depressing place to live. He said: ""It's desperate because we've lost all our good neighbours. ""There's nobody left here at all and the condition of the place is not the best. ""It's just a worry now. We don't want to move now because 15 years have passed since this started."" Now a developer, Springfield, has offered the residents a new house in return for theirs, with the idea that eventually the firm will be able to develop the area. Most homeowners have accepted. However, because Springfield has not secured a deal with all the householders, West Lothian Council said it was not a complete solution, because redevelopment cannot start until all the residents have left. The local authority is still trying to buy the remaining houses, including the possibility of compulsory purchase orders. Lawrence Fitzpatrick, West Lothian Council leader, said it could not offer any more money to homeowners. He said: ""I have to look from the council and the council taxpayers' point of view. ""The government valuer has placed this value on their houses. ""That's what they're worth. We cannot offer any more or we would be in serious audit problems. ""I feel very much for these people in the sense they're caught up in circumstances. We're caught by the law."" Kerry MacIntosh is the last one left on her block Kerry MacIntosh is the last one left on her block. She said being surrounded by empty, boarded-up houses makes her home cold and damp. She has rejected all of the councils offers to move over the years, but wants to sell to Springfield. She urged the council to back the Springfield offer, and to drop its effort to buy the houses. ""I want them to accept the solution from Springfield. ""There's no more the council can do. It's my house and it's for my children as well. This is our home. ""I've just not given in. I'm fighting for justice. The council's trying to take my home away from me and I want a new house for that."" Ms MacIntosh is not looking forward to another winter in her house, because she said living there has taken its toll on her health.

"Sir Philip Green's Topshop retailing empire plunged to a loss last year, blaming a ""dramatically"" changed retail landscape and increased competition. The business, which also includes Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins,has since agreed a rescue deal with its creditorsthat triggered 48 store closures. The results for the year to 1 September 2018 show a loss of Â£169.2m compared with a Â£49.4m profit a year earlier. It also warned it may need fresh funds. The rescue deal, agreed in June, involved the landlords to the chains of stores backing a number of company voluntary arrangements (CVA), allowing the business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. In an update provided in the latest results, the directors say are they ""confident that we will deliver on our plan, improve the way we work and win the hearts and minds of more and more of our customers"". The results are for Taveta Investments, the holding company of the Arcadia group of businesses owned by Sir Philip's wife Tina. The company said a 4.5% fall in its turnover was caused by ""the ongoing challenging global market conditions for retailers"". If exceptional items and other one-off costs are stripped out the company made an operating profit of Â£78.1m, down from Â£124.1m a year earlier. Taveta said profits were knocked because it was not able to close stores at the same pace that sales fell. ""After coming through a challenging year, we are now very clear on our strategic direction,"" it added. Philip Green: Topshop empire 'didn't come close to collapse' Green secures rescue deal for Topshop empire High Street: Five ways UK shopping has changed In a trading update in the latest results, the directors say that after closing its US stores and the Outfit Kids business, the group is expected to remain in its current form with a ""portfolio of diverse, market-leading brands"". Tina Green, owner of Arcadia with her husband, Arcadia chairman Sir Philip Green The results highlight the importance of refinancing a Â£310m loan on the flagship Topshop store on London's Oxford Street, which is currently due to be repaid in December. If that does not happen, the company said ""the lenders would be able to enforce their security on its property in order to recover their debt"". The directors express confidence that the loan can be refinanced. They say the store remains an attractive site, with Nike taking an additional floor in the building, while space previously used by Miss Selfridge has been leased to retailer Vans. However, they also say that the risk around the refinancing of the Oxford Street store and the ""on-going difficult financial conditions in a volatile retail sector"" could force the business to seek fresh financing. On a pre-tax basis, Taveta's loss is Â£177m compared with profits of Â£53.5m a year earlier. Results for Arcadia, filed separately, show a pre-tax loss of Â£93m compared with Â£164m in the previous year. In June, Sir Philip acknowledged to the BBCthat the retail landscape had changed and that he had been slow to react. ""The market place has changed forever - people want a different kind of service.

"The memo suggested a poll that ""shows up the inequity of the existing border"" A top-secret memo written by an Army general during the Troubles refers to Britain needing to find a way to ""gradually escape"" from its commitment to Northern Ireland. It was discovered by the BBC NI's Spotlight programme during the making of a major new series on the conflict. It was written by Sir Michael Carver, who was providing advice to government in 1972 as the Army's chief of staff. The decades-long violence cost about 3,700 lives. Lord Carver was the Army's chief of staff in 1972 The former chief of staff, later Lord Carver, wrote: ""If I am right, and we want a lasting solution, it must lie in finding a way in which HM Government can gradually escape from the commitment to the border."" He suggested a ""plebiscite"", or poll, organised ""in such a way that it shows up the inequity of the existing border"". Rare film footage shows Martin McGuinness (right) present as a car bomb is assembled The programme makers have also obtained rare film footage showing Martin McGuinness, the former IRA commander, in the presence of people assembling a car bomb. Identifiable by its licence plate, the vehicle was used in an attack on Shipquay Street in the centre of Londonderry in 1972. The car was used in a bomb explosion in Derry city centre In other footage, the former Sinn FÃ©in deputy first minister of Northern Ireland is seen showing children weapons and ammunition. Part one of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History covers 1966 to 1972 and also explores the rise of Ian Paisley, who went on become DUP leader and first minister. What were the Troubles? A former senior army officer, David Hancock, told the programme Mr Paisley ""financed"" a UVF bombing in Kilkeel in 1969. Targeting infrastructure, the blast was blamed on the IRA, but was part of a loyalist campaign designed to destabilise the Stormont government of Terence O'Neill. Ian Paisley pictured speaking during a protest rally Mr Hancock said police had shown him ""evidence"" that Mr Paisley ""had supplied the money which financed the explosion"". Mr Paisley's son Ian, the DUP MP for North Antrim, said the allegations were ""complete and total poppycock"" and criticised the BBC for not approaching the Paisley family with them. Ian Paisley told the Nolan programme on BBC Radio Ulster there was ""absolutely no truth whatsoever in what I can only describe as a filthy story designed to try and impugn the reputation of a dead man"". A BBC Spokesperson said: ""The BBC has complete confidence in the editorial integrity of the programme. ""As no allegations were made against the wider Paisley family it was not necessary to offer them a right to reply."" The series comprises seven programmes and contains interviews with around 100 people as well as archive never shown before. The editor of Spotlight, Jeremy Adams, said the series had uncovered ""new findings"" on the Troubles. ""The past has shaped our present and it's vitally important that truths continue to be told."" The first episode of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Four on Tuesday, 10 September at 20:30 BST.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he believed voters want the country to ""get on"" with Brexit Boris Johnson has claimed his political opponents ""don't trust the people"" as they vowed to again block his demand for a snap general election. Opposition parties have said they will vote against or abstain in Monday's vote on whether to hold a poll. Mr Johnson said the public was tired of ""dither and delay"" over Brexit, and want us to ""get this thing done"". And he vowed to ""go to Brussels and get a deal"" that would allow the UK to leave the EU on 31 October. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru held talks on Friday on their strategy over the timing of a general election after joining forces earlier this week to block the PM's plan to hold an early vote All four parties have said they will again not support the PM's call for an election in the Commons on Monday. Opposition parties to reject PM election move John Curtice: Why Nicola Sturgeon wants an election They are concerned that Mr Johnson would not stick to his pledge to have the election on 15 October, and would instead wait until after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October - potentially without a deal. Speaking on a visit to Aberdeenshire, the prime minister told journalists that it was ""curious"" the opposition had refused his offer of an election. A bull bumped into a plain clothes police officer while being walked by the PM at a farm in Banchory, near Aberdeen Mr Johnson added: ""They don't trust the people, they don't want an election - perhaps it is because they don't think that they will win. ""Fine. I'll go to Brussels, I'll get a deal and we'll make sure we come out on 31 October"". He insisted a deal would be agreed by 17 or 18 October - the dates of an EU Council summit - and would allow the UK to ""start a new partnership with our European friends"". The PM said the public was tired of ""endless, pointless delays"" to Brexit, and ""want us to get on and do it"", and that ""never in history has the opposition party been given the chance for election and turned it down."" Mr Johnson has previously said he would rather be ""dead in a ditch"" than ask for another extension to Brexit - but he said resigning as PM if the country does not leave the EU by that date was ""not a hypothesis I want to contemplate"". He also said he could see ""no reason"" to agree to a second Scottish independence referendum. In other developments on Friday: There was some good news for Mr Johnson when the High Court in Londonrejected a legal challenge by campaigner Gina Miller, who wanted his plan to suspend Parliament ruled illegal The court immediately said Ms Miller could appeal. A decision in the appeal against a similar ruling in the Court of Session in Edinburgh earlier this weekis expected to be delivered next Wednesday. But the panel of three Court of Session judges refused to grant an interim interdict which would have prevented Parliament being prorogued before they deliver their verdict. A bill aimed at ensuring the UK cannot leave the EU without an exit deal has completed its passage through the House of Lords. Mr Johnson visited a fish market in Peterhead as he kicked off his trip to Scotland Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the possibility of having an election was ""extremely attractive"" but the ""immediate crisis"" of preventing a no-deal Brexit had to be dealt with first. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says she would ""relish"" a general election, and predicted that the SNP would ""beat the Tories"" in Scotland on a ticket of offering the country a chance to ""choose our own future"". Court releases PM's Parliament shutdown memos Could an early election still happen? MPs set for fresh early election vote on Monday But she told BBC Scotland that her priority was stopping a no-deal Brexit, and that a November general election was now looking more likely than October. And she said holding a general election before the end of October could allow Mr Johnson to ""cut and run"". The prime minister's trip to Scotland will include a visit to the Queen's Balmoral estate. He is expected to cut short his visit to the monarch's summer residence - a traditional prime ministerial trip each summer - because of the Brexit crisis. Rather than the usual weekend-long visit, Mr Johnson and girlfriend Carrie Symonds are likely to return to London on Saturday. A politically bruising week for the prime minister has seen Mr Johnson lose his Commons majority, the expulsion of 21 of his own MPs for rebelling and his younger brother resign from government, alongside defeats in the Commons over Brexit. Nicola Sturgeon does not believe a general election in October is in the public interest Mr Johnson used his visit to Scotland to announce Â£51.4m of funding for Scottish farmers over the next two years, in addition to aÂ£160m package unveiled earlier this weekas part of the Spending Review. The move is aimed at settling a long-running row over the distribution of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy payments across the UK, and meets the recommendations of the newly-published Bew Review. The funding was announced as the UK government confirmed it would work to ensure cash for farmers was fairly allocated across the whole of the UK, and that the industry would be ready for a ""prosperous future"" outside the EU. This video can not be played So who actually wants an election? NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick described the move as being the ""largest funding uplift for the sector in recent memory"". But the SNP said Mr Johnson was like a ""thief returning to the scene of a crime"", while Labour said the prime minister was ""no friend"" of Scottish agriculture. The prime minister started his visit to Scotland at Peterhead Fish Market and joined in with a bidding war over a box of cod - which he ended up buying for Â£185. Asked whether Mr Johnson had paid a good price, fish market chief executive Simon Brebner said: ""If you're selling, it's a great price. If you're buying, maybe it's a little high.""

"A London gender identity clinic has mistakenly exposed details of close to 2,000 people on its email list. The Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic sent patients an email about an art competition, with hundreds of others CC-ed in. The clinic later tried to recall the message but the error had already been noticed. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, which is responsible for the clinic, is investigating. Two separate emails were sent, with about 900 people CC-ed on each. One patient at the clinic, Jessie, told the BBC she was angry about what had happened. ""It could out someone, especially as this place treats people who are transgender,"" she said. A spokesman for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We are currently investigating a data security incident. ""This incident involved an email from our patient and public involvement team regarding an art project. ""Unfortunately, due to an error, the email addresses of some of those we are inviting to participate were not hidden and therefore visible to all. ""We can confirm we are reporting this breach to the Information Commissioner's Office as well as treating it as a serious incident within the Trust."" A spokeswoman for the ICO said: ""Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust has made us aware of an incident and we will assess the information provided."" In 2016, an NHS Trust was fined Â£180,000 after a sexual health centre mistakenly leaked the details of nearly 800 patients who had attended HIV clinics. In that case, the 56 Dean Street clinic had sent a group email without using the BCC function, which obscures other recipients in the mailing list. The incident took place before the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which can see organisations fined up to â¬20 million (Â£18m) or 4% of their annual global turnover.

"University admissions service Ucas has been accused of promoting ""inappropriate"", high-interest private loans to students. An email sent by Ucas Media included an advert for Future Finance, which offers student loans with interest rates of between 8% and 23.7% - higher than those of government-funded loans. Consumer campaigner Martin Lewis said Ucas had ""breached an ethical line"". Ucas said it always advised government loans as the best option for students. The Labour Party's deputy leader Tom Watsontweeted,externalthat it was ""indefensible"" for Ucas to promote ""sky-high loans"", adding it should ""drop these adverts straight away"". Olga Dolchenko, CEO of Future Finance, said it was a ""highly valued source of funding"" for students who needed extra financial assistance and it always advised customers to seek a government-funded loan first. Ucas is an independent charity that operates the application process for UK universities. The advert for Future Finance was sent on 22 August by Ucas Media - the organisation's commercial arm - to subscribers who had opted in to receiving marketing emails. Martin Lewis, who founded MoneySavingExpert.com, has written to Ucas, the universities minister and Universities UK calling for Ucas to stop sending emails with adverts for commercial loans, arguing it had ""failed in its duty of care"" to existing and prospective students. He said the loans were ""inappropriate for the huge majority of recipients"", with higher interest rates than government-funded loans, which are provided by the Student Loans Company, a non-profit, government-owned organisation. ""Ucas has privileged, monopoly access to this young and impressionable audience,""he wrote in his letter,external. ""It is also seen as an institutional authority and therefore adverts contained in your email are effectively being legitimised by inclusion, and some may even mistake it for a direct recommendation."" He said the loans offered by Future Finance were ""an entirely different beast"" to government-funded loans, which currently have a maximum interest rate of 5.4%, are only repaid once graduates earn a certain amount and are wiped after 30 years. Students must start paying off Future Finance loans while they are still at university. A spokesperson for Universities UK said government-backed student loans were ""the best available option"" as, unlike a conventional debt, the amount repaid depends on how much the graduate is earning, and outstanding repayments do not impact on future lenders' decisions. Would the proposed student finance changes help poorer students? Rich students save by paying fees up front In a statement, Ucas said students had to actively opt-in to receive marketing material from outside companies and it ""carefully considers which companies to work with"". It added that Ucas was compliant with all relevant Charity Commission guidance. Ms Dolchenko said Future Finance offered ""fully transparent and flexible loans"" and ""never encourages students to borrow more than they can afford"". ""Our terms are competitive when compared with other forms of private finance, but also need to reflect the risk we take on by lending to young people with little or no credit history,"" she added.

Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare at the National Union of Students, said increasing numbers of students were resorting to using ""high-cost lenders"" as government-funded student maintenance loans often failed to cover living costs. A Department for Education spokesperson said government-funded loans were available to eligible students regardless of their financial background, and no commercial loans offered the same level of borrower protection. ""We have increased cash-in-hand living costs support for undergraduate students from the lowest income households by 2.8% for the current academic year - 2019/20 - and have announced a further 2.9% increase for 2020/21 - to record levels,"" the spokesperson added.

"Sir Philip Green's Topshop retailing empire plunged to a loss last year, blaming a ""dramatically"" changed retail landscape and increased competition. The business, which also includes Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins,has since agreed a rescue deal with its creditorsthat triggered 48 store closures. The results for the year to 1 September 2018 show a loss of Â£169.2m compared with a Â£49.4m profit a year earlier. It also warned it may need fresh funds. The rescue deal, agreed in June, involved the landlords to the chains of stores backing a number of company voluntary arrangements (CVA), allowing the business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. In an update provided in the latest results, the directors say are they ""confident that we will deliver on our plan, improve the way we work and win the hearts and minds of more and more of our customers"". The results are for Taveta Investments, the holding company of the Arcadia group of businesses owned by Sir Philip's wife Tina. The company said a 4.5% fall in its turnover was caused by ""the ongoing challenging global market conditions for retailers"". If exceptional items and other one-off costs are stripped out the company made an operating profit of Â£78.1m, down from Â£124.1m a year earlier. Taveta said profits were knocked because it was not able to close stores at the same pace that sales fell. ""After coming through a challenging year, we are now very clear on our strategic direction,"" it added. Philip Green: Topshop empire 'didn't come close to collapse' Green secures rescue deal for Topshop empire High Street: Five ways UK shopping has changed In a trading update in the latest results, the directors say that after closing its US stores and the Outfit Kids business, the group is expected to remain in its current form with a ""portfolio of diverse, market-leading brands"". Tina Green, owner of Arcadia with her husband, Arcadia chairman Sir Philip Green The results highlight the importance of refinancing a Â£310m loan on the flagship Topshop store on London's Oxford Street, which is currently due to be repaid in December. If that does not happen, the company said ""the lenders would be able to enforce their security on its property in order to recover their debt"". The directors express confidence that the loan can be refinanced. They say the store remains an attractive site, with Nike taking an additional floor in the building, while space previously used by Miss Selfridge has been leased to retailer Vans. However, they also say that the risk around the refinancing of the Oxford Street store and the ""on-going difficult financial conditions in a volatile retail sector"" could force the business to seek fresh financing. On a pre-tax basis, Taveta's loss is Â£177m compared with profits of Â£53.5m a year earlier. Results for Arcadia, filed separately, show a pre-tax loss of Â£93m compared with Â£164m in the previous year. In June, Sir Philip acknowledged to the BBCthat the retail landscape had changed and that he had been slow to react. ""The market place has changed forever - people want a different kind of service. Should we have seen that three or four years ago - maybe. But now we need to get on with the job,"" he told the BBC in June. The business has not been alone in finding the going tough on the High Street.

"Robert Gabriel Mugabe was a man who divided global public opinion like few others. To some, he was an evil dictator who should have ended his days in jail for crimes against humanity. Zimbabwe's ex-president Robert Mugabe dies at 95 To others, he was a revolutionary hero, who fought racial oppression and stood up to Western imperialism and neo-colonialism. On his own terms, he was an undoubted success. First, he delivered independence for Zimbabwe after decades of white-minority rule. He then remained in power for 37 years - outlasting his greatest enemies and rivals such as Tony Blair, George W Bush, Joshua Nkomo, Morgan Tsvangirai and Nelson Mandela. After 2000, he started wearing brightly coloured shirts and caps for election rallies And he destroyed the economic power of Zimbabwe's white community, which was based on their hold over the country's most fertile land. However, his compatriots - except for a small, well-connected elite - paid the price, with the destruction of what had once been one of Africa's most diversified economies. In the end, this came back to haunt him. The outpouring of joy on the streets of Harare which greeted his forced resignation in November 2017 echoed the jubilation in the same city 37 years earlier when it was announced he was the new leader of independent Zimbabwe. Zimbabweans celebrating Robert Mugabe's resignation Although he was allowed to see out his days in peace in his Harare mansion, it was not the end he wanted, having famously boasted: ""Only God, who appointed me, will remove me."" Many Zimbabweans trace the reversal of his - and their - fortunes to his 1996 wedding to his secretary Grace Marufu, 41 years his junior, following the death of his widely respected first wife, Sally, in 1992. ""He changed the moment Sally died, when he married a young gold-digger,"" according to Wilf Mbanga, editor of The Zimbabwean newspaper, who used to be close personal friends with Mr Mugabe. This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation That sentiment was common long before anyone dreamed she might one day harbour presidential ambitions, which were the trigger for his close allies in the military and the ruling Zanu-PF party to oust Mr Mugabe from power. While he was sometimes portrayed as a madman, this was far from the truth. He was extremely intelligent and those who underestimated him usually discovered this to their cost. Stephen Chan, a professor at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, noted Mr Mugabe had repeatedly embarrassed the West with his ""adroit diplomacy"". ""Cricket civilises people and creates good gentlemen. I want everyone to play cricket in Zimbabwe; I want ours to be a nation of gentlemen"" -  undated ""Let the MDC and its leadership be warned that those who play with fire will not only be burnt, but consumed by that fire"" - 2003 election rally ""We are not hungry... Why foist this food upon us? We don't want to be choked. We have enough"" - interview with Sky TV in 2004, amid widespread food shortages ""Don't drink at all, don't smoke, you must exercise and eat vegetables and fruit"" - interview on his 88th birthday in 2012 ""[Nelson] Mandela [South Africa's first black president] has gone a bit too far in doing good to the non-black communities, really in some cases at the expense of [blacks]... That's being too saintly, too good, too much of a saint"" - 2013 state TV interview As a former political rival of Mr Mugabe, who went on to serve as his home affairs minister, Dumiso Dabengwa witnessed the different sides of Zimbabwe's founding father. ""Under normal circumstances, he would be very charming but when he got angry, he was something else - if you crossed him, he could certainly be ruthless,"" he told the BBC before his death in May 2019. Mr Dabengwa said the president would often let him win an argument over policy during the decade they worked together, or they would agree to compromise - not the behaviour of a dictator. But something, he added, changed after 2000 and Mr Mugabe resorted to threats to ensure he got his way. ""He held compromising material over several of his colleagues and they knew they would face criminal charges if they opposed him."" This is not a picture recognised by Chen Chimutengwende, who worked alongside Mr Mugabe in both the Zanu-PF party and government for 30 years. ""In all the time I have worked with him, I have never seen him be vindictive or ill-treat anyone,"" he said. Wilf Mbanga (c) used to be good friends with Robert Mugabe (l) ""He went from trying to convince you with his arguments to a man who would send his thugs to beat you up if you disagreed with him"" Watch: Wilf Mbanga on his friend Robert Mugabe Mr Chimutengwende felt Zimbabwe's leader had been unfairly demonised in the Western media because of his policy of seizing land from white farmers whom he suspects of having influential supporters, especially in the UK, where many trace their roots. The year 2000 marked a watershed both in the history of Zimbabwe and the career of Mr Mugabe. Until then, he was generally feted for reaching out towards the white community following independence, while Zimbabwe's economy was still faring pretty well. After coming to power in 1980, Mr Mugabe greatly expanded education and healthcare for black Zimbabweans and the country enjoyed living standards far higher than its neighbours. In 1995, a World Bank report praised Zimbabwe's rapid progress in the fields of health and literacy. Run by a former teacher, the country had the highest literacy rates in Africa. Money was poured into schools in the 1980s but resources were later squeezed In her book, Dinner With Mugabe, Heidi Hollande said Mr Mugabe used to personally coach illiterate State House workers to help them pass exams. Mr Mbanga recalls listening to the songs of US country singer Jim Reeves together. ""He could be very affectionate, he was an intellectual. He liked explaining things, like a teacher,"" said Mr Mbanga, but then saw a huge change in his former friend. ""He went from trying to convince you with his arguments to a man who would send his thugs to beat you up if you disagreed with him."" In fact, the warning signs were already there - the massacre of thousands of ethnic Ndebeles seen as supporters of Mr Mugabe's rival, Joshua Nkomo, in the 1980s and the start of the economic decline - but these were usually overlooked. Sally Mugabe was said to have been a ""moderating influence"" on her husband Some Zimbabweans say things started going wrong when he married his young secretary, Grace, in 1996. ""Some say he had us all fooled, I am convinced he himself changed,"" Mr Mbanga said. The journalist says that in his early years as president, Mr Mugabe genuinely believed in trying to improve the lives of his people, and introduced a ""leadership code"" which barred ministers from owning too much property. ""Look at him today, he is fabulously wealthy. He is not the person I knew,"" Mr Mbanga said in May 2014. In February 2000, the government lost a referendum on a draft constitution. With parliamentary elections looming four months later and a newly formed opposition party with close links to the ""No"" campaign posing a serious threat, Mr Mugabe unleashed his personal militia. White farmers were attacked, along with their black workers The land invasions turned much of Zimbabwe into no-go areas for the opposition Some were genuine veterans of the 1970s war of independence but others were far younger. TV footage of white farmers queuing up to make donations to the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) meant Mr Mugabe was able to portray the opposition as stooges of the white community, and by extension the UK. The invasion of white-owned farms achieved several goals for Mr Mugabe and his allies: Punish the white community for their ""betrayal"" Remove a source of funding from the opposition Allow the ""war veterans"" to intimidate the many thousands of black farmworkers, largely seen as opposition supporters Ensure that the opposition could not campaign in rural areas Re-energise his supporters, some of whom had been losing faith in his ability to redistribute land - one of the grievances behind the 1970s war of independence Attract new supporters with the promise of land handouts. There was certainly a strong moral argument that land reform was needed in Zimbabwe but the way it was carried out was undoubtedly with political motivations uppermost. Despite the widespread violence, intimidation and electoral fraud, the MDC gained almost as many elected seats as Zanu-PF in 2000. Had it not been for the intimidation in rural areas, Zanu-PF may well have lost its majority. Lovemore Madhuku, one of the leaders of the ""No"" campaign in 2000, described Mr Mugabe as an ""an excellent political calculator"", who adapted his tactics to the situation. ""There are moments when he chooses to be ruthless, others when he chooses to be magnanimousâ¦ He considers what is best - for him - in every situation and reacts accordingly,"" Mr Madhuku told the BBC. This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation He said Mr Mugabe might not have realised the damage the seizure of white-owned land would do to Zimbabwe's economy but in any case, he would not have cared, as long as he remained president. Mr Chan agreed that, ""in terms of Mr Mugabe's value-set, the ownership of the land is more important than the smooth running of the economy"". And the economy continued to decline until 2008. Zimbabwe's shops ran out of basic goods After 28 years of Mr Mugabe's rule, the resourceful, largely self-sufficient country lay in ruins. The inflation rate had reached an unfathomable 231 million per cent and young Zimbabweans were voting with their feet, fleeing the country he had fought to liberate. And yet, from this low point, he once more managed to outmanoeuvre his rivals and remain in power for another nine years. The key to understanding Robert Mugabe is the fight against white-minority rule. In the Rhodesia where he grew up, power was reserved for some 270,000 white people at the expense of about six millions Africans. A host of other laws discriminated against the black majority, largely subsistence farmers. Many black farmers were pushed into marginal areas of the country during the colonial era They were forced to leave their ancestral land and pushed into the country's peripheral regions, with dry soil and low rainfall, while the most fertile areas were reserved for white farmers. Reclaiming the land was one of the main drivers behind the 1970s war which brought Mr Mugabe to power. The son of a carpenter who abandoned his family, as a child Mr Mugabe was said to have been a loner, who spent much of his time reading. Ms Hollande wrote that after his elder brother died of poisoning when Mr Mugabe was just 10, his mother became depressed and the young Mugabe would do everything he could for her, to the extent he was teased as a ""mummy's boy"" at school. He eventually qualified as a teacher and in 1958 went to work in Ghana, which had just become the first African country south of the Sahara to end colonial rule. Encouraged by his Ghanaian wife, Sally, and the pan-Africanist speeches of Ghana's leader Kwame Nkrumah, Mr Mugabe became determined to achieve the same back home. On his return in 1960, he started to campaign for an end to discrimination and was jailed for a decade after being convicted of sedition. While in prison, his supporters wrested control of Zanu, the biggest party fighting white rule, and installed him as leader. On his release, he was supposed to remain in the country but with the help of a white nun, he was smuggled over the border into Mozambique and the Zanu guerrilla camps. After Mr Mugabe won the 1980 elections which led to independence, he pursued a policy of reconciliation with the white community despite the bitterness built up during the war. In a national address after becoming prime minister, he declared: ""If you were my enemy, you are now my friend. If you hated me, you cannot avoid the love that binds me to you and you to me."" ""He was a very nice guy. At that stage, he was not too sure of himself. There were very strong people in Zanu who were not afraid to oppose him. He would never take a decision on his own"" - Dumiso Dabengwa ""He did everything he could to improve the lives of his people. He wanted education for all. He wanted health for all. He introduced a leadership code limiting Zanu-PF cadres to 50 acres of land"" - Wilf Mbanga ""I worked very harmoniously with him and discussed issues. He would let me have my way or we would reach a compromise"" - Dumiso Dabengwa ""After 2000, he started flexing his muscles. He brought in people who he could influence. Several people were compromised - he held something over them"" - Dumiso Dabengwa. ""He has become fabulously wealthy. He is not the person I knew. He changed the moment Sally died [in 1992], when he married a young gold-digger [Grace Mugabe]"" - Wilf Mbanga He allowed Ian Smith, the Rhodesian prime minister who had once declared that black people would not rule the country for 1,000 years and who reportedly personally refused to let Mr Mugabe leave prison for the funeral of his then only son, to remain both an MP and on his farm. At this point, according to Mr Madhuku, Mr Mugabe's hold on power was relatively weak, so he realised he had to reach out to his former enemies. Former home affairs minister Mr Dabengwa said Mr Mugabe was even less self-confident earlier on in his political career. ""When I first met him in the 1960s, he was not sure of himself, of his position in Zanu,"" Mr Dabengwa recalled. ""There were very strong people in Zanu who were not afraid to oppose him. He would never take a decision on his own but would always check with them first."" But slowly, he consolidated control - first over the party which led the war against white-minority rule and later the country as a whole  - until the point where his was the only voice that counted. ""He loves power, it's in his DNA,"" said Mr Madhuku. Throughout his time as president, his closest allies were always those with whom he had endured the hardships of life during the guerrilla war of independence. When they felt their grip on power, and its trappings, were threatened, they reverted wholeheartedly to the conflict mentality. ""We are in a war to defend our rights and the interests of our people. The British have decided to take us on through the MDC,"" he told a 2002 election rally. Fredrick Shaba was one of many MDC officials attacked around the country in elections after 2000 This meant opposition supporters were denounced as traitors - a label which could mean an immediate death sentence. Mr Chimutengwende argued that the scale of the violence was exaggerated and in any case sought to distance it from Mr Mugabe: ""It is not the leader who throws a stone, or asks his followers to throw a stone."" But Mr Dabengwa, the minister in charge of the police in 2000, said Mr Mugabe's Zanu party had been using such methods since the 1980 election. He said that fighters from Zanu's armed wing had been sent out into rural areas to ensure villagers voted the ""right"" way, partly through all-night indoctrination sessions, known as ""pungwes"". ""People were told there were magic binoculars which could tell which way they voted and there were no-go areas for other parties,"" said Mr Dabengwa, whose Zapu party came a distant second in 1980. ""But the British declared those elections free and fair and so Zanu learnt that that was how to win an election."" Although he won those elections in 1980, and formed a coalition government with Zapu, the underlying tensions burst into open violence just two years later. Zapu leader Joshua Nkomo was accused of plotting a coup and the army's North Korea-trained Fifth Brigade was sent to his home region of Matabeleland. After the Gukurahundi killings, Mr Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo agreed to share power More than 20,000 people were killed in Operation Gukurahundi, which means ""the early rain which washes away the chaff"". At the time, South African double-agent Kevin Woods was making daily reports in person to then Prime Minister Mugabe for the internal security force, the Central Intelligence Organisation. ""He obviously wanted to know exactly what Fifth Brigade was doing,"" he wrote in his autobiography. In the end, a subdued Mr Nkomo once more agreed to share power with his enemy in order to end the violence in his home region - a forerunner of what later happened to the MDC. 21 February 1924:Born 1964:Jailed after being convicted of sedition 1973:Becomes Zanu leader 1980:Becomes prime minister of Zimbabwe 1987:Becomes president under new constitution agreed under deal to end Matabeleland massacres 1992:Wife Sally dies 1996:Marries Grace Marufu 2000:Loses referendum, land invasions begin 2002:Wins presidential election amid widespread violence and fraud allegations 2005:Launches Operation Murambatsvina (Drive Out Rubbish), which forces 700,000 urban residents from their homes - seen as punishment for opposition supporters 2008:Comes second in election, violence leads his opponent Morgan Tsvangirai to withdraw from run-off 2009:Forms coalition government 2013:Resoundingly re-elected, Tsvangirai returns to opposition 2017:Forced to resign after army seizes power 6 September 2019:Dies in Singapore, which he visits for hospital treatment Before he was finally ousted, his political low point was in 2008, when MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai beat him in a presidential election, although not by enough for outright victory, according to the official results. There were numerous reports Mr Mugabe was on the verge of resigning, although Mr Madhuku said he did not believe them, as the president subsequently demonstrated his determination to remain in power. Again, a setback led to a sustained campaign of violence against his ""enemies"". The army and Zanu-PF militias attacked MDC supporters around the country, killing more than 100 and forcing thousands from their homes. It became obvious that Zanu-PF would not relinquish its grip on power and Mr Tsvangirai withdrew from the second round, saying it was the only way to save lives. Zimbabwe's economy continued its freefall, reaching its nadir when people were dying from cholera in Harare because the country did not have the foreign currency to import the necessary chemicals to treat the water. Under intense pressure, Mr Mugabe agreed to a coalition government with his long-time rival and, under MDC stewardship, the economy recovered. Morgan Tsvangirai (r) was badly damaged by working with Robert Mugabe But Prime Minister Tsvangirai was severely tarnished by working with Mr Mugabe - the president always managed to keep real power for himself and his allies. By the time of the 2013 election, Mr Mugabe did not need to resort to extreme violence to win easily. He had once more demonstrated his remarkable skills of political survival and he remained in power until he was forced out in 2017. Mr Mugabe justified the 2000 land invasions by saying the UK's Labour government, in power since 1997, had reneged on a British promise to fund peaceful land reform. While it might be expected that an avowedly Marxist liberation fighter would have more in common with the Labour Party than the Conservatives, the opposite turned out to be true. ""Mrs Thatcher, you could trust her. But of course what happened later was a different story with the Labour Party and Blair, who you could never trust"" Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the UK accepted that as the former colonial power, it had the moral duty to help finance the process of buying white-owned land and redistributing it to black farmers. But after a report found the process had been tainted by cronyism, British funding was put on hold. The new Labour government took matters further and declared: ""We do not accept that Britain has a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe."" In 2013, Mr Mugabe observed: ""Mrs Thatcher, you could trust her. But of course what happened later was a different story with the Labour Party and [former Prime Minister Tony] Blair, who you could never trust. ""Who can ever believe what Mr Blair says? Here we call him Bliar."" Despite the vitriol directed at the UK from 2000 onwards, Mr Mugabe was in some ways the epitome of an English gentleman. He was usually turned out in immaculate, dark, three-piece suits and ties - until he was given a makeover in 2000 and advised to campaign in brightly coloured cloth emblazoned with his own face, like many other African leaders. Visitors to State House were always offered tea to drink and he was a huge fan of cricket. ""Cricket civilises people and creates good gentlemen. I want everyone to play cricket in Zimbabwe; I want ours to be a nation of gentlemen,"" he once said. He was educated by Jesuits in the Katuma mission near his birthplace in Zvimba, north-west of Salisbury (now Harare), where he was taken under the wing of an Irish priest, Jerome O'Hea. This is presumably where he developed his abstemious nature - he did not drink alcohol or coffee and was largely vegetarian. ""If he had died after 10 years in power, he would have been my hero forever"" His second wife Grace said he used to wake up at 05:00 for his exercises, including yoga. This healthy lifestyle was no doubt one reason why he lived until the age of 95. For many years, his health was a constant source of speculation. A 2008 US cable quoted in Wikileaks,externalsuggested Mr Mugabe had been diagnosed with cancer, giving him between three and five years to live. This prognosis turned out to be false, and on his 88th birthday Mr Mugabe joked he had ""beaten Christ"" because he had died and been resurrected so many times. While he was vilified in the West, his anti-colonial rhetoric did strike a chord across Africa, even among many who condemned his human rights record. At the 2013 memorial service in Soweto for Nelson Mandela - who replaced Mr Mugabe as Africa's most admired anti-colonial fighter - Zimbabwe's president was wildly cheered by the young South African crowd, even as they booed their own then leader, Jacob Zuma. These children in Harare had to have their lessons in the open air because there was no school building ""A lot of people think that pan-Africanism is a thing of the past but that is not true,"" said Mr Mugabe's staunch ally, Chen Chimutengwende. ""While imperialism and racism exist, pan-Africanism is still needed,"" he told the BBC. But Zimbabwean journalist Wilf Mbanga said that in his latter years, Mr Mugabe had far more support outside his home country than within. ""Those young South Africans who praise him do not have to live under his rule,"" he said, pointing out that many Ghanaians had less than fond memories of life under pan-African hero Kwame Nkrumah, who had inspired Mr Mugabe. So how will Mr Mugabe be remembered? Mr Chan said that until 2000, Mr Mugabe had a ""good report card"", although the verdict later turned to ""disastrous"". ""If he had died after 10 years in power, he would have been my hero forever,"" said Mr Mbanga. ""But look at the schools and hospitals now. ""He has spoilt his legacy. Now, people will remember him for driving people out of Harare, Gukurahundi, election violence and everything else.""

"This video can not be played Should websites be responsible for 'revenge pornography' posts? Porn sites have been accused of hosting revenge porn videos, by a woman whose sister found videos of her online that had been posted without her consent. ""Sophie"" said she felt ""violated"" after sex videos featuring her were viewed hundreds of thousands of times when they were uploaded online. Sophie's sister saw the images on Pornhub. Pornhub said it ""strongly condemns"" revenge porn. It added it had ""the most progressive anti-revenge-porn policy in the industry"". Campaign group #NotYourPorn said such content allowed Pornhub owners MindGeek to make greater advertising revenues. MindGeek said it did not seek ""to monetize revenge porn, and we work swiftly to remove it if it is uploaded"". Sophie - not her real name - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she had been on a day out with her family 18 months ago when she had checked her phone to find missed calls and messages. Her sister's partner had found videos of her on Pornhub - the world's largest porn website. Sophie says one was on Pornhub's main content page and had over 600,000 views, though Pornhub dispute this. ""I felt shocked, embarrassed and violated,"" she said. Sophie had previously made six videos with her ex-partner. They broke up several years ago and she had not given anyone consent to put them online. Within a week of her becoming aware of the videos appearing on Pornhub, they were taken down. However, the appearance of those six videos on Pornhub gave someone the opportunity to create about 100 video clips, and these were subsequently uploaded to a number of porn sites. Sophie went to the police. To date, no-one has been charged. Kate Isaacs, from the #NotYourPorn campaign, said revenge porn was often labelled on porn sites as ""amateur"" or ""home-made"" content - two popular search terms for videos that were making sites more valuable for advertisers. She now wants these sites to do more to delete such content as soon as they are made aware of it, and to prevent it from being reuploaded once taken down. By the time Sophie discovered the videos of her online, she was in a new relationship - and it placed a strain on the couple. Her partner's friends made fun of him over her videos on Pornhub, she said. Sophie also has a teenage daughter, who she said ""hasn't been the same since"". Pornhub dispute one of the videos is Sophie and say it was filmed by a verified model. Pornhub vice-president Corey Price said: ""Content that is uploaded to Pornhub that directly violates our terms of service is removed as soon as we are made aware of it and this includes non-consensual content. ""In 2015, to further ensure the safety of all our fans, we officially took a hard stance against revenge porn, which we believe is a form of sexual assault, and introduced a submission form for the easy removal of non-consensual content. ""We also use a state-of-the-art third-party digital fingerprinting software, which scans any new uploads for potential matches to unauthorised material and makes sure the original video doesn't go back up on the platform."" MindGeek told the BBC it was ""not looking to profit off of illegal content or content that violates our terms of service. ""It's not in our best interest to host and gain revenue from this type of illegal content. We seek to provide users with a safe space to share and consume content,"" it added.

"Sir Philip Green's Topshop retailing empire plunged to a loss last year, blaming a ""dramatically"" changed retail landscape and increased competition. The business, which also includes Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins,has since agreed a rescue deal with its creditorsthat triggered 48 store closures. The results for the year to 1 September 2018 show a loss of Â£169.2m compared with a Â£49.4m profit a year earlier. It also warned it may need fresh funds. The rescue deal, agreed in June, involved the landlords to the chains of stores backing a number of company voluntary arrangements (CVA), allowing the business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. In an update provided in the latest results, the directors say are they ""confident that we will deliver on our plan, improve the way we work and win the hearts and minds of more and more of our customers"". The results are for Taveta Investments, the holding company of the Arcadia group of businesses owned by Sir Philip's wife Tina. The company said a 4.5% fall in its turnover was caused by ""the ongoing challenging global market conditions for retailers"". If exceptional items and other one-off costs are stripped out the company made an operating profit of Â£78.1m, down from Â£124.1m a year earlier. Taveta said profits were knocked because it was not able to close stores at the same pace that sales fell. ""After coming through a challenging year, we are now very clear on our strategic direction,"" it added. Philip Green: Topshop empire 'didn't come close to collapse' Green secures rescue deal for Topshop empire High Street: Five ways UK shopping has changed In a trading update in the latest results, the directors say that after closing its US stores and the Outfit Kids business, the group is expected to remain in its current form with a ""portfolio of diverse, market-leading brands"". Tina Green, owner of Arcadia with her husband, Arcadia chairman Sir Philip Green The results highlight the importance of refinancing a Â£310m loan on the flagship Topshop store on London's Oxford Street, which is currently due to be repaid in December. If that does not happen, the company said ""the lenders would be able to enforce their security on its property in order to recover their debt"". The directors express confidence that the loan can be refinanced. They say the store remains an attractive site, with Nike taking an additional floor in the building, while space previously used by Miss Selfridge has been leased to retailer Vans. However, they also say that the risk around the refinancing of the Oxford Street store and the ""on-going difficult financial conditions in a volatile retail sector"" could force the business to seek fresh financing. On a pre-tax basis, Taveta's loss is Â£177m compared with profits of Â£53.5m a year earlier. Results for Arcadia, filed separately, show a pre-tax loss of Â£93m compared with Â£164m in the previous year. In June, Sir Philip acknowledged to the BBCthat the retail landscape had changed and that he had been slow to react. ""The market place has changed forever - people want a different kind of service. Should we have seen that three or four years ago - maybe. But now we need to get on with the job,"" he told the BBC in June. The business has not been alone in finding the going tough on the High Street. Earlier this year, Britain's biggest department store chain Debenhams fell into the hands of its lenders as part of an administration process, while House of Fraser was sold to Mike Ashley's Sports Direct last year. Marks and Spencer has also illustrated the woes facing traditional retailers, falling out of the FTSE 100 index this week amid competition from firms such as Primark on the High Street and Boohoo online.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he believed voters want the country to ""get on"" with Brexit Boris Johnson has claimed his political opponents ""don't trust the people"" as they vowed to again block his demand for a snap general election. Opposition parties have said they will vote against or abstain in Monday's vote on whether to hold a poll. Mr Johnson said the public was tired of ""dither and delay"" over Brexit, and want us to ""get this thing done"". And he vowed to ""go to Brussels and get a deal"" that would allow the UK to leave the EU on 31 October. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru held talks on Friday on their strategy over the timing of a general election after joining forces earlier this week to block the PM's plan to hold an early vote All four parties have said they will again not support the PM's call for an election in the Commons on Monday. Opposition parties to reject PM election move John Curtice: Why Nicola Sturgeon wants an election They are concerned that Mr Johnson would not stick to his pledge to have the election on 15 October, and would instead wait until after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October - potentially without a deal. Speaking on a visit to Aberdeenshire, the prime minister told journalists that it was ""curious"" the opposition had refused his offer of an election. A bull bumped into a plain clothes police officer while being walked by the PM at a farm in Banchory, near Aberdeen Mr Johnson added: ""They don't trust the people, they don't want an election - perhaps it is because they don't think that they will win. ""Fine. I'll go to Brussels, I'll get a deal and we'll make sure we come out on 31 October"". He insisted a deal would be agreed by 17 or 18 October - the dates of an EU Council summit - and would allow the UK to ""start a new partnership with our European friends"". The PM said the public was tired of ""endless, pointless delays"" to Brexit, and ""want us to get on and do it"", and that ""never in history has the opposition party been given the chance for election and turned it down."" Mr Johnson has previously said he would rather be ""dead in a ditch"" than ask for another extension to Brexit - but he said resigning as PM if the country does not leave the EU by that date was ""not a hypothesis I want to contemplate"". He also said he could see ""no reason"" to agree to a second Scottish independence referendum. In other developments on Friday: There was some good news for Mr Johnson when the High Court in Londonrejected a legal challenge by campaigner Gina Miller, who wanted his plan to suspend Parliament ruled illegal The court immediately said Ms Miller could appeal. A decision in the appeal against a similar ruling in the Court of Session in Edinburgh earlier this weekis expected to be delivered next Wednesday. But the panel of three Court of Session judges refused to grant an interim interdict which would have prevented Parliament being prorogued before they deliver their verdict. A bill aimed at ensuring the UK cannot leave the EU without an exit deal has completed its passage through the House of Lords. Mr Johnson visited a fish market in Peterhead as he kicked off his trip to Scotland Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the possibility of having an election was ""extremely attractive"" but the ""immediate crisis"" of preventing a no-deal Brexit had to be dealt with first. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says she would ""relish"" a general election, and predicted that the SNP would ""beat the Tories"" in Scotland on a ticket of offering the country a chance to ""choose our own future"". Court releases PM's Parliament shutdown memos Could an early election still happen? MPs set for fresh early election vote on Monday But she told BBC Scotland that her priority was stopping a no-deal Brexit, and that a November general election was now looking more likely than October. And she said holding a general election before the end of October could allow Mr Johnson to ""cut and run"". The prime minister's trip to Scotland will include a visit to the Queen's Balmoral estate. He is expected to cut short his visit to the monarch's summer residence - a traditional prime ministerial trip each summer - because of the Brexit crisis. Rather than the usual weekend-long visit, Mr Johnson and girlfriend Carrie Symonds are likely to return to London on Saturday. A politically bruising week for the prime minister has seen Mr Johnson lose his Commons majority, the expulsion of 21 of his own MPs for rebelling and his younger brother resign from government, alongside defeats in the Commons over Brexit. Nicola Sturgeon does not believe a general election in October is in the public interest Mr Johnson used his visit to Scotland to announce Â£51.4m of funding for Scottish farmers over the next two years, in addition to aÂ£160m package unveiled earlier this weekas part of the Spending Review. The move is aimed at settling a long-running row over the distribution of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy payments across the UK, and meets the recommendations of the newly-published Bew Review. The funding was announced as the UK government confirmed it would work to ensure cash for farmers was fairly allocated across the whole of the UK, and that the industry would be ready for a ""prosperous future"" outside the EU. This video can not be played So who actually wants an election? NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick described the move as being the ""largest funding uplift for the sector in recent memory"". But the SNP said Mr Johnson was like a ""thief returning to the scene of a crime"", while Labour said the prime minister was ""no friend"" of Scottish agriculture. The prime minister started his visit to Scotland at Peterhead Fish Market and joined in with a bidding war over a box of cod - which he ended up buying for Â£185. Asked whether Mr Johnson had paid a good price, fish market chief executive Simon Brebner said: ""If you're selling, it's a great price. If you're buying, maybe it's a little high.""

"Irish PM Leo Varadkar has said he ""does not expect any breakthroughs"" in his meeting with Boris Johnson on Monday. Speaking at a press conference in Waterford, he said that the meeting is ""an opportunity to establish a personal relationship"". On Thursday, Mr Varadkar said that some checks on goods and live animals may need to take place near the Irish border in a no-deal Brexit Checks would take place at ports, airports and firms, he said. What is the Irish border backstop? Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? How could backstop alternatives work? UK PM Boris Johnson has said he would""rather be dead in a ditch than delay Brexit"", which is set for 31 October. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar says there may be some checks 'near the border' in a no-deal Speaking on Friday, Mr Varadkar said: ""It's an opportunity for us to talk about each other's positions in relation to the European Union and the withdrawal agreement, to explore where there might be common ground. ""Also as well to talk about Northern Ireland because separate from the major issue of Brexit there is the ongoing suspension of the Assembly and the executive in Northern Ireland."" Mr Varadkar has said he would continue efforts to avoid a no-deal, but would not do so ""at any cost"", adding that the EU had still not received any workable alternative to the backstop from the UK. ""I do fear it, but I am prepared for it,"" he told business leaders in Dublin on Thursday night. Senator Marshall said the Irish government will be mandated to protect the integrity of the border The backstop is a position of last resort, to maintain a seamless border on the island of Ireland. It would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks is agreed. It will not apply if the UK leaves without a deal in October. By John Campbell, BBC News NI economics and business editor We know that the responsibility of the Irish government as a member of the EU would be to collect customs duties and to protect the integrity of the single market. The question is how the Republic's government would fulfil those responsibilities. This week we have seen Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney getting closer to saying 'listen folks, some of this stuff would have to happen, probably close to the border'. The big one is around food and agriculture. Food products coming into the EU from a non-member state must go through what is called a border inspection post, which must be in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry. The discussion is around what is the immediate vicinity of the point of entry. Is it a mile from the border? Is it 10 miles? Where is it? The taoiseach said tariffs would apply to ""goods imported into Ireland from the United Kingdom and vice versa"". ""The tariff schedules are already known,"" he said. ""You will need to be registered as an importer-exporter and you will need to make customs declarations."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mr Varadkar said that in the event of no-deal, the common travel area would remain in place. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald called Mr Varadkar's comments ""extremely unhelpful"" and said checks would ""damage border communities, harm the economy and undermine the architecture of the peace process"". ""These are fundamental issues that will have a massive impact on our country for generations to come and it is the job of an taoiseach and our European partners to prevent this disastrous scenario from emerging,"" she added. Meanwhile, the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland has said that any post-Brexit checks near the border in the Republic are likely to be matched by similar checks in the UK. Seamus Leheny, policy manager for the Freight Transport Association, said checks would ""probably have to be reflected on the northern side of the border"". The government has always insisted it would not be putting up any new infrastructure near the border. ""They might say that now, but that's not a sustainable approach to managing the Irish border because if you don't have controls in place, how does the UK government control what is entering into the GB market,"" said Mr Leheny. Despite the warning, DUP leader Arlene Foster has insisted there will be no new infrastructure at the border in Northern Ireland, even if the Republic introduces checks after Brexit. ""There's been a lot of speculation up until now,"" she said. ""What we need to do is look at the facts and the facts are that the government has said very clearly that they will not be putting infrastructure at the border."" Asked about how the UK was going to control what came across the border into Northern Ireland, she said ""alternative arrangements"" could be put in place, but not infrastructure. Meanwhile, Irish broadcaster RTÃ reportsthe UK has proposed stripping all elements of the backstop out of the withdrawal agreement.,external The only elements of the agreement left is a commitment to the all-island electricity market, the Common Travel Area and the rights of EU citizens, it said. The UK has instead proposed that both sides would make a commitment to no hard border, but only after Britain had left the European Union. What would change with a no-deal Brexit? What could no deal mean for the Irish border? Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?

"This video can not be played Mr Mugabe resigned in 2017, after more than three decades in power As independent Zimbabwe's first prime minister, and later its president, Robert Mugabe promised democracy and reconciliation. But the hope that accompanied independence in 1980 dissolved into violence, corruption and economic disaster. President Mugabe became an outspoken critic of the West, most notably the United Kingdom, the former colonial power, which he denounced as an ""enemy country"". Despite his brutal treatment of political opponents, and his economic mismanagement of a once prosperous country, he continued to attract the support of other African leaders who saw him as a hero of the fight against colonial rule. Robert Gabriel Mugabe was born in what was then Rhodesia on 21 February 1924, the son of a carpenter and one of the majority Shona-speaking people in a country then run by the white minority. Educated at Roman Catholic mission schools, he qualified as a teacher. Winning a scholarship to Fort Hare University in South Africa, he took the first of his seven academic degrees before teaching in Ghana, where he was greatly influenced by the pan-Africanist ideas of Ghana's post-independence leader Kwame Nkrumah. His first wife Sally was Ghanaian. In 1960, Mugabe returned to Rhodesia. At first he worked for the African nationalist cause with Joshua Nkomo, before breaking away to become a founder member of the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu). In 1964, after making a speech in which he called Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith and his government ""cowboys"",  Mugabe was arrested and detained without trial for a decade. Mugabe (l) with Nkomo (r) in 1960. The relationship between the two would sour after independence His baby son died while he was still in prison and he was refused permission to attend the funeral. In 1973, while still in detention, he was chosen as president of Zanu. After his release, he went to Mozambique and directed guerrilla raids into Rhodesia. His Zanu organisation formed a loose alliance with Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (Zapu). During the tortuous negotiations on independence for Rhodesia, he was seen as the most militant of the black leaders, and the most uncompromising in his demands. On a 1976 visit to London, he declared that the only solution to the Rhodesian problem would come out of the barrel of a gun. But his negotiating skills earned him the respect of many of his former critics. The press hailed him as ""the thinking man's guerrilla"". The Lancaster House agreement of 1979 set up a constitution for the new Republic of Zimbabwe, as Rhodesia was to be called, and set February 1980 for the first elections which would be open to the black majority. Fighting the election on a separate platform from Nkomo, Mugabe scored an overwhelming and, to most outside observers, unexpected victory. Zanu secured a comfortable majority, although the polls were marred by accusations of vote-rigging and intimidation from both sides A self-confessed Marxist, Mugabe's victory initially had many white people packing their bags ready to leave Rhodesia, while his supporters danced in the streets. However, the moderate, conciliatory tone of his early statements reassured many of his opponents. He promised a broad-based government, with no victimisation and no nationalisation of private property. His theme, he told them, would be reconciliation. He initially promised a programme of reconciliation Later that year he outlined his economic policy, which mixed private enterprise with public investment. He launched a programme to massively expand access to healthcare and education for black Zimbabweans, who had been marginalised under white-minority rule. With the prime minister frequently advocating one-party rule, the rift between Mugabe and Nkomo widened. After the discovery of a huge cache of arms at Zapu-owned properties, Nkomo, recently demoted in a cabinet reshuffle, was dismissed from government. While paying lip service to democracy, Mugabe gradually stifled political opposition. The mid-1980s saw the massacre of thousands of ethnic Ndebeles seen as Nkomo's supporters in his home region of Matabeleland. Mugabe was implicated in the killings, committed by the Zimbabwean army's North Korean-trained 5th Brigade, but never brought to trial. Under intense pressure, Nkomo agreed for his Zapu to be merged with - or taken over by - Zanu to become the virtually unchallenged Zanu-PF. After abolishing the office of prime minister, Mugabe became president in 1987 and was elected for a third term in 1996. The same year, he married Grace Marufu, after his first wife had died from cancer. Mugabe already had two children with Grace, 40 years his junior. A third was born when the president was 73. Farms were occupied by Zanu-PF supporters He did have some success in building a non-racial society, but in 1992 introduced the Land Acquisition Act, permitting the confiscation of land without appeal. The plan was to redistribute land at the expense of more than 4,500 white farmers, who still owned the bulk of the country's best land. In early 2000, with his presidency under serious threat from the newly formed Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), led by former trade union leader Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe lashed out against the farmers, seen as MDC backers. His supporters, the so-called ""war veterans"", occupied white-owned farms and a number of farmers and their black workers were killed. The action served to undermine the already battered economy as Zimbabwe's once valuable agricultural industry fell into ruin. Mugabe's critics accused him of distributing farms to his cronies, rather than the intended rural poor. 1924: Born.

In the 2000 elections for the House of Assembly, the MDC won 57 out of the 120 seats elected by popular vote, although a further 20 seats were filled by Mugabe's nominees, securing Zanu-PF's hold on power. Two years later, in the presidential elections, Mugabe achieved 56.2% of the vote compared with Mr Tsvangirai's 41.9% against a background of intimidation of MDC supporters. Large numbers of people in rural areas were prevented from voting by the closure of polling stations. MDC activists were attacked around the country in 2008 With the MDC, the US, UK and the European Union not recognising the election result because of the violence and allegations of fraud, Mugabe - and Zimbabwe - became increasingly isolated. The Commonwealth also suspended Zimbabwe from participating in its meetings until it improved its record as a democracy. In May 2005, Mugabe presided over Operation Restore Order, a crackdown on the black market and what was said to be ""general lawlessness"". Some 30,000 street vendors were arrested and whole shanty towns demolished, eventually leaving an estimated 700,000 Zimbabweans homeless. In March 2008, Mugabe lost the first round of the presidential elections but won the run-off in June after Mr Tsvangirai pulled out. In the wake of sustained attacks against his supporters across the country, Mr Tsvangirai maintained that a free and fair election was not possible. Zimbabwe's economic decline accelerated, with inflation rates reaching stratospheric levels. After hundreds of people died from cholera, partly because the government could not afford to import water treatment chemicals, Mugabe agreed to negotiate with his long-time rival about sharing power. The power-sharing agreement was undermined by arguments After months of talks, in February 2009 Mugabe swore in Mr Tsvangirai as prime minister. It came as no surprise that the arrangement was far from perfect, with constant squabbling and accusations by some human rights organisations that Mugabe's political opponents were still being detained and tortured. Mr Tsvangirai's reputation also suffered by his association with the Mugabe regime, despite the fact that he had no influence over the increasingly irascible president. The 2013 election, in which Mugabe won 61% of the vote, ended the power-sharing agreement and Mr Tsvangirai went into the political wilderness. While there were the usual accusations of electoral fraud -  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asked that these be investigated - there was not the widespread violence that had marked previous polls in Zimbabwe. It was an election that saw Robert Mugabe, at the age of 89, confirm his position as the undisputed power in the country. His advancing years, and increasing health problems, saw much speculation as to who might replace him. But the manoeuvring among possible successors revealed how fragmented Zimbabwe's administration was and underlined the fact that it was only held together by Mugabe's dominance. Mugabe himself seemed to delight in playing off his subordinates against each other in a deliberate attempt to dilute whatever opposition might arise. With speculation that his wife, Grace, was poised to take control in the event of his death in office, Mugabe announced in 2015 that he fully intended to fight the 2018 elections, by which time he would be 94. He was the undisputed power in Zimbabwe And, to allay any doubt remaining among possible successors, he announced in February 2016 that he  would remain in power ""until God says 'come'"". In the event it wasn't God but units of the Zimbabwe National Army which came for Robert Mugabe. On 15 November 2017 he was placed under house arrest and, four days later, replaced as the leader of Zanu-PF by his former vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. Defiant to the end Mugabe refused to resign, But, on 21 November, as a motion to impeach him was being debated in the Zimbabwean parliament, the speaker of the House of Assembly announced that Robert Mugabe had finally resigned. Mugabe negotiated a deal which protected him and his family from the risk of future prosecution and enabled him to retain his various business interests. He was also granted a house, servants, vehicles and full diplomatic status. Ascetic in manner, Robert Mugabe dressed conservatively and drank no alcohol. He viewed both friend and foe with a scepticism verging on the paranoid. The man who had been hailed as the hero of Africa's struggle to throw off colonialism had turned into a tyrant, trampling over human rights and turning a once prosperous country into an economic basket case. His legacy is likely to haunt Zimbabwe for years.

"Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu) leader Robert Mugabe was elected prime minister after the end of white minority rule in the former British colony of Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe). Mugabe was the only leader Zimbabwe had known since independence. He is seen here, (second from left) in March 1980, with the Prince of Wales, Zimbabwe African People's Union (Zapu) leader Joshua Nkoma and Britain's Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington. He came to prominence as one of the leaders of a guerrilla war against white minority rule, along with Joshua Nkomo (right). The pair later fell out. Mugabe, seen here with UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1980, initially pursued a policy of reconciliation with his white former enemies, letting them keep their economic wealth. Mugabe ruled alongside President Canaan Banana until 1987, after which he took over the role of president. Some Zimbabweans say things started going wrong when he married his young secretary, Grace, in 1996. The pair are seen here while on a tour of Vietnam in 2001. In 1995 Mugabe met US President Bill Clinton, but back home the economy slumped. He faced new opposition but he came out fighting. Mugabe reverted to the mentality of the guerrilla fighter, blaming his problems on white Zimbabweans and Britain, the former colonial power. From 2000 onwards, former guerrillas rallied behind their leader and became a militia force. They attacked opposition activists and spearheaded the seizure of white-owned farms. More than 100 people were killed in two violent election campaigns, which left Mugabe in power but complaining of a Western plot to undermine him. A staunch Catholic, he said his prayers had been answered with the ""defeat"" of his enemies and the seizure of most white-owned land. As Zimbabwe's economy went from bad to worse to disastrous in the 2000s, Mugabe's political and physical demise was predicted many times. In March 2008, his future looked more uncertain than ever as Zimbabweans voted in presidential elections. After failing to win enough votes to avoid a run-off with opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe displayed characteristic defiance, swearing ""only God"" could remove him from office. In the event, in the face of increasing political violence from ruling party supporters, Mr Tsvangirai pulled out. The economic meltdown continued, and Mugabe agreed to share power with his long-time rival, who became prime minister. Although predictions of Mugabe's demise always proved premature, the mounting pressures took their toll. In 2011, a US diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks suggested he was suffering from prostate cancer. This stoked numerous media reports about his health. ""I have died many times - that's where I have beaten Christ. Christ died once and resurrected once,"" he said on his 88th birthday. Robert Mugabe, 1924 - 2019 All photographs copyright as stated.

"This video can not be played Survivors of the hurricane say there is utter devastation The death toll from Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas will be ""staggering"", the country's government has warned as aid efforts are being stepped up. The official death toll stands at 30, but is expected to rise further. Officials are sending morticians and 200 body bags to the Abaco Islands, the worst-hit part of the archipelago. Dorian - which devastated the northern Bahamas from Sunday to Tuesday - has now made landfall in the US state of North Carolina, but is weakening. Officials say hundreds, possibly thousands, are still missing in the Abacos and Grand Bahama. In pictures: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Path of destruction 'Hurricane's storm surge swallowed my son, 5' Have you been affected by Hurricane Dorian? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external On Thursday Health Minister Duane Sands warned of a ""staggering"" final count. ""The public needs to prepare for unimaginable information about the death toll and the human suffering,"" he told local radio. Dr Ian Norton, who manages the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s emergency medical teams, also told reporters that he was also ""really worried"" about the potential death toll. Great Abaco has been rendered virtually uninhabitable Dorian hit the Bahamas as a category five hurricane with winds reaching 185mph (297km/h). It matched the highest ever recorded at landfall, and stayed over affected areas for two days. The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - were severely damaged or destroyed. Parts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain, leaving vast areas of it flooded. The Island of Great Abaco is virtually uninhabitable, with bodies piled up, no water, power or food, and militias formed to prevent looting, local media report. This video can not be played Residents in the Bahamas say ""it's total devastation"" Aerial images over the Abacos showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels. The only international airport in Grand Bahama was also devastated. As a result, it could not be used for evacuations or aid deliveries. The WHO said flooding had rendered Grand Bahama's main hospital unusable, and a field hospital would need to be set up in its place. Several patients have been airlifted from Marsh Harbour Medical Centre in the Abacos, according to the Associated Press news agency, but the site is still being run as a shelter. Matt Morrison, BBC News, Bahamas Everyone who experienced the storm here on Abaco has a story to tell. Whether it is one of dramatic survival, or the loss of a loved one, every life has been affected. 'It was like being in a tornado for hours on end,' one Marsh Harbour resident told me. 'Everything is gone'. Driving down the streets one sees destruction in every direction. Homes and businesses have nearly all been levelled. Those that are left standing have broken windows and caved in walls. There is an eerie silence, as the few residents around survey the damage. About 5.5 miles off shore, Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary has stationed an aid ship, the Mounts Bay. The 179-meter vessel had been in the area as the storm approached, and the scene onboard is one of urgency and focus. Aid is being loaded onto floating platforms to make the two-hour journey to shore. The crew are on day three, and will continue here until they move on to the next disaster area. The Bahamas' government has signed an emergency declaration giving tax exemptions to medicine, building supplies and other goods that can be used for relief efforts. International aid operations have been primarily focused on Grand Bahama and the Abacos, which were hit worst. Search-and-rescue teams have been combing the worst-hit communities looking for any trace of survivors and bodies.  As of Friday, the US Coast Guard said it had rescued 205 residents. Meanwhile, efforts to deliver aid are being ramped up. Planes and helicopters have been flying in emergency supplies to help the estimated 76,000 people in need of food and shelter. Eight tonnes (8,000kg) of ready-to-eat meals, storage units, generators and other emergency suppliers are to be flown in from Panama, the UN World Food Programme said. A $5.4m (Â£4.3m) budget has been allocated to the UN agency for a three-month emergency operation in the Bahamas. However, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said damage to roads and other infrastructure was hampering relief efforts. Now downgraded to a category 1 hurricane, Dorian has made landfall in the US. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that at 09:00 local time (13:00 GMT) Dorian hit Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with 90mph (145km/h) winds. The storm has already caused severe flooding and widespread power failures in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian causes floods and tornadoes in South Carolina In the Carolinas, more than 900,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes, but it was unclear how many had complied. Forecasters said 10 inches (25 cm) of rain has fallen between the coasts of Charleston, South Carolina and Wilmington, North Carolina 170 miles away. Dorian is expected to push north and out into the Atlantic, but will make landfall again on Saturday in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds are still expected in Virginia and other north-eastern states. Three storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida and another in North Carolina. All four died whilst preparing their homes and shelters for the storm. According to the NHC, a ""hurricane season"" runs in the Atlantic Ocean between 1 June and 30 November. The term denotes a period when most of the year's tropical cyclones take place in the Atlantic, though it typically peaks in the late summer. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms This video can not be played Hurricanes and climate change Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

"This video can not be played Survivors of the hurricane say there is utter devastation The death toll from Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas will be ""staggering"", the country's government has warned as aid efforts are being stepped up. The official death toll stands at 30, but is expected to rise further. Officials are sending morticians and 200 body bags to the Abaco Islands, the worst-hit part of the archipelago. Dorian - which devastated the northern Bahamas from Sunday to Tuesday - has now made landfall in the US state of North Carolina, but is weakening. Officials say hundreds, possibly thousands, are still missing in the Abacos and Grand Bahama. In pictures: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Path of destruction 'Hurricane's storm surge swallowed my son, 5' Have you been affected by Hurricane Dorian? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external On Thursday Health Minister Duane Sands warned of a ""staggering"" final count. ""The public needs to prepare for unimaginable information about the death toll and the human suffering,"" he told local radio. Dr Ian Norton, who manages the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s emergency medical teams, also told reporters that he was also ""really worried"" about the potential death toll. Great Abaco has been rendered virtually uninhabitable Dorian hit the Bahamas as a category five hurricane with winds reaching 185mph (297km/h). It matched the highest ever recorded at landfall, and stayed over affected areas for two days. The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - were severely damaged or destroyed. Parts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain, leaving vast areas of it flooded. The Island of Great Abaco is virtually uninhabitable, with bodies piled up, no water, power or food, and militias formed to prevent looting, local media report. This video can not be played Residents in the Bahamas say ""it's total devastation"" Aerial images over the Abacos showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels. The only international airport in Grand Bahama was also devastated. As a result, it could not be used for evacuations or aid deliveries. The WHO said flooding had rendered Grand Bahama's main hospital unusable, and a field hospital would need to be set up in its place. Several patients have been airlifted from Marsh Harbour Medical Centre in the Abacos, according to the Associated Press news agency, but the site is still being run as a shelter. Matt Morrison, BBC News, Bahamas Everyone who experienced the storm here on Abaco has a story to tell. Whether it is one of dramatic survival, or the loss of a loved one, every life has been affected. 'It was like being in a tornado for hours on end,' one Marsh Harbour resident told me. 'Everything is gone'. Driving down the streets one sees destruction in every direction. Homes and businesses have nearly all been levelled. Those that are left standing have broken windows and caved in walls. There is an eerie silence, as the few residents around survey the damage. About 5.5 miles off shore, Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary has stationed an aid ship, the Mounts Bay. The 179-meter vessel had been in the area as the storm approached, and the scene onboard is one of urgency and focus. Aid is being loaded onto floating platforms to make the two-hour journey to shore. The crew are on day three, and will continue here until they move on to the next disaster area. The Bahamas' government has signed an emergency declaration giving tax exemptions to medicine, building supplies and other goods that can be used for relief efforts. International aid operations have been primarily focused on Grand Bahama and the Abacos, which were hit worst. Search-and-rescue teams have been combing the worst-hit communities looking for any trace of survivors and bodies.  As of Friday, the US Coast Guard said it had rescued 205 residents. Meanwhile, efforts to deliver aid are being ramped up. Planes and helicopters have been flying in emergency supplies to help the estimated 76,000 people in need of food and shelter. Eight tonnes (8,000kg) of ready-to-eat meals, storage units, generators and other emergency suppliers are to be flown in from Panama, the UN World Food Programme said. A $5.4m (Â£4.3m) budget has been allocated to the UN agency for a three-month emergency operation in the Bahamas. However, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said damage to roads and other infrastructure was hampering relief efforts. Now downgraded to a category 1 hurricane, Dorian has made landfall in the US. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that at 09:00 local time (13:00 GMT) Dorian hit Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with 90mph (145km/h) winds. The storm has already caused severe flooding and widespread power failures in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian causes floods and tornadoes in South Carolina In the Carolinas, more than 900,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes, but it was unclear how many had complied. Forecasters said 10 inches (25 cm) of rain has fallen between the coasts of Charleston, South Carolina and Wilmington, North Carolina 170 miles away. Dorian is expected to push north and out into the Atlantic, but will make landfall again on Saturday in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds are still expected in Virginia and other north-eastern states. Three storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida and another in North Carolina. All four died whilst preparing their homes and shelters for the storm. According to the NHC, a ""hurricane season"" runs in the Atlantic Ocean between 1 June and 30 November. The term denotes a period when most of the year's tropical cyclones take place in the Atlantic, though it typically peaks in the late summer. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms This video can not be played Hurricanes and climate change Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

"The children of women who experience severe stress when pregnant are nearly 10 times more likely to develop a personality disorder by the age of 30, a study suggests. Even moderate prolonged stress may have an impact on child development and continue after a baby's birth, it said. More than 3,600 pregnant women in Finland were asked about their stress levels, and their children followed up. Psychiatrists say mums-to-be must have access to mental health support. Other important factors, such as how children are brought up, the family's financial situation and trauma experienced during childhood, are known to contribute to the development of personality disorders and could have played a role. It means that certain aspects of someone's personality make life difficult for them and for other people. They can be overly anxious or emotionally unstable, for example, or paranoid or anti-social - there are a wide range of types. Personality disorders are thought to affect about one in 20 people. They are more likely to have other mental health problems, such as depression, or drug and alcohol problems. Like other mental disorders, upbringing, brain problems and genes can play a part in their development. Every month during pregnancy,the study - in the British Journal of Psychiatry,external- asked women to answer questions about their mental stress levels. They had to say if they had notable stress, some stress or no stress. The women lived around Helsinki, Finland, and their babies were born between 1975 and 1976. When those children turned 30, any diagnoses of personality disorder were noted - there were 40 in total, which were all severe cases involving admission to hospital. The study found prolonged, high levels of stress during pregnancy could have a potentially long-lasting effect on children. Children exposed to severe maternal stress were 9.53 times more likely to develop a personality disorder than those whose mothers experienced no stress. Those exposed to moderate stress had four times the chances. This could be stress related to relationship problems, social factors or psychological problems, for example. It's not known how stress in pregnant women could increase the risk of personality disorders - it could be down to changes caused in the brain or the result of inherited genes, or a number of other factors in the children's upbringing. The researchers tried to tease out the effects of stress alone, by controlling for other factors such as the psychiatric history of the pregnant women, whether they smoked during pregnancy or had depression. Previous research has found links between stress in pregnancy and the development of depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Dr Trudi Seneviratne, who chairs the perinatal faculty at Royal College of Psychiatrists, said pregnancy could be a stressful time and mums-to-be needed support. ""If stress isn't tackled, there is a high chance it will spill into the post-natal period,"" she said. ""It's a really sensitive thing to talk about. ""We don't want parents to think they are damaging their children - but high levels of stress do affect us."" She said NHS England had dramatically improved perinatal mental health services in recent times. Women should be supported at home and work during pregnancy and given coping strategies for when they were stressed, Dr Seneviratne said. ""They need to learn to rest, to ask for support and talk to someone about how they are feeling."" Eating a balanced diet, stopping smoking and getting regular sleep is also advised. More advice is available fromthe Royal College of Psychiatrists' website,externalandNHS UK,external. Lead study author Ross Brannigan, from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, said: ""This study highlights the importance of providing mental health and stress support to both pregnant women and families during the antenatal and postnatal period."" Your midwife or health visitor should ask if you have ever had problems with your mental health in the past and whether you have feelings of hopelessness after your baby is born. You should be offered support,externalfrom health professionals to help you manage your feelings.

"Sir Philip Green's Topshop retailing empire plunged to a loss last year, blaming a ""dramatically"" changed retail landscape and increased competition. The business, which also includes Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins,has since agreed a rescue deal with its creditorsthat triggered 48 store closures. The results for the year to 1 September 2018 show a loss of Â£169.2m compared with a Â£49.4m profit a year earlier. It also warned it may need fresh funds. The rescue deal, agreed in June, involved the landlords to the chains of stores backing a number of company voluntary arrangements (CVA), allowing the business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. In an update provided in the latest results, the directors say are they ""confident that we will deliver on our plan, improve the way we work and win the hearts and minds of more and more of our customers"". The results are for Taveta Investments, the holding company of the Arcadia group of businesses owned by Sir Philip's wife Tina. The company said a 4.5% fall in its turnover was caused by ""the ongoing challenging global market conditions for retailers"". If exceptional items and other one-off costs are stripped out the company made an operating profit of Â£78.1m, down from Â£124.1m a year earlier. Taveta said profits were knocked because it was not able to close stores at the same pace that sales fell. ""After coming through a challenging year, we are now very clear on our strategic direction,"" it added. Philip Green: Topshop empire 'didn't come close to collapse' Green secures rescue deal for Topshop empire High Street: Five ways UK shopping has changed In a trading update in the latest results, the directors say that after closing its US stores and the Outfit Kids business, the group is expected to remain in its current form with a ""portfolio of diverse, market-leading brands"". Tina Green, owner of Arcadia with her husband, Arcadia chairman Sir Philip Green The results highlight the importance of refinancing a Â£310m loan on the flagship Topshop store on London's Oxford Street, which is currently due to be repaid in December. If that does not happen, the company said ""the lenders would be able to enforce their security on its property in order to recover their debt"". The directors express confidence that the loan can be refinanced. They say the store remains an attractive site, with Nike taking an additional floor in the building, while space previously used by Miss Selfridge has been leased to retailer Vans. However, they also say that the risk around the refinancing of the Oxford Street store and the ""on-going difficult financial conditions in a volatile retail sector"" could force the business to seek fresh financing. On a pre-tax basis, Taveta's loss is Â£177m compared with profits of Â£53.5m a year earlier. Results for Arcadia, filed separately, show a pre-tax loss of Â£93m compared with Â£164m in the previous year. In June, Sir Philip acknowledged to the BBCthat the retail landscape had changed and that he had been slow to react. ""The market place has changed forever - people want a different kind of service. Should we have seen that three or four years ago - maybe. But now we need to get on with the job,"" he told the BBC in June. The business has not been alone in finding the going tough on the High Street. Earlier this year, Britain's biggest department store chain Debenhams fell into the hands of its lenders as part of an administration process, while House of Fraser was sold to Mike Ashley's Sports Direct last year. Marks and Spencer has also illustrated the woes facing traditional retailers, falling out of the FTSE 100 index this week amid competition from firms such as Primark on the High Street and Boohoo online.

"Robert Gabriel Mugabe was a man who divided global public opinion like few others. To some, he was an evil dictator who should have ended his days in jail for crimes against humanity. Zimbabwe's ex-president Robert Mugabe dies at 95 To others, he was a revolutionary hero, who fought racial oppression and stood up to Western imperialism and neo-colonialism. On his own terms, he was an undoubted success. First, he delivered independence for Zimbabwe after decades of white-minority rule. He then remained in power for 37 years - outlasting his greatest enemies and rivals such as Tony Blair, George W Bush, Joshua Nkomo, Morgan Tsvangirai and Nelson Mandela. After 2000, he started wearing brightly coloured shirts and caps for election rallies And he destroyed the economic power of Zimbabwe's white community, which was based on their hold over the country's most fertile land. However, his compatriots - except for a small, well-connected elite - paid the price, with the destruction of what had once been one of Africa's most diversified economies. In the end, this came back to haunt him. The outpouring of joy on the streets of Harare which greeted his forced resignation in November 2017 echoed the jubilation in the same city 37 years earlier when it was announced he was the new leader of independent Zimbabwe. Zimbabweans celebrating Robert Mugabe's resignation Although he was allowed to see out his days in peace in his Harare mansion, it was not the end he wanted, having famously boasted: ""Only God, who appointed me, will remove me."" Many Zimbabweans trace the reversal of his - and their - fortunes to his 1996 wedding to his secretary Grace Marufu, 41 years his junior, following the death of his widely respected first wife, Sally, in 1992. ""He changed the moment Sally died, when he married a young gold-digger,"" according to Wilf Mbanga, editor of The Zimbabwean newspaper, who used to be close personal friends with Mr Mugabe. This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation That sentiment was common long before anyone dreamed she might one day harbour presidential ambitions, which were the trigger for his close allies in the military and the ruling Zanu-PF party to oust Mr Mugabe from power. While he was sometimes portrayed as a madman, this was far from the truth. He was extremely intelligent and those who underestimated him usually discovered this to their cost. Stephen Chan, a professor at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, noted Mr Mugabe had repeatedly embarrassed the West with his ""adroit diplomacy"". ""Cricket civilises people and creates good gentlemen. I want everyone to play cricket in Zimbabwe; I want ours to be a nation of gentlemen"" -  undated ""Let the MDC and its leadership be warned that those who play with fire will not only be burnt, but consumed by that fire"" - 2003 election rally ""We are not hungry... Why foist this food upon us? We don't want to be choked. We have enough"" - interview with Sky TV in 2004, amid widespread food shortages ""Don't drink at all, don't smoke, you must exercise and eat vegetables and fruit"" - interview on his 88th birthday in 2012 ""[Nelson] Mandela [South Africa's first black president] has gone a bit too far in doing good to the non-black communities, really in some cases at the expense of [blacks]... That's being too saintly, too good, too much of a saint"" - 2013 state TV interview As a former political rival of Mr Mugabe, who went on to serve as his home affairs minister, Dumiso Dabengwa witnessed the different sides of Zimbabwe's founding father. ""Under normal circumstances, he would be very charming but when he got angry, he was something else - if you crossed him, he could certainly be ruthless,"" he told the BBC before his death in May 2019. Mr Dabengwa said the president would often let him win an argument over policy during the decade they worked together, or they would agree to compromise - not the behaviour of a dictator. But something, he added, changed after 2000 and Mr Mugabe resorted to threats to ensure he got his way. ""He held compromising material over several of his colleagues and they knew they would face criminal charges if they opposed him."" This is not a picture recognised by Chen Chimutengwende, who worked alongside Mr Mugabe in both the Zanu-PF party and government for 30 years. ""In all the time I have worked with him, I have never seen him be vindictive or ill-treat anyone,"" he said. Wilf Mbanga (c) used to be good friends with Robert Mugabe (l) ""He went from trying to convince you with his arguments to a man who would send his thugs to beat you up if you disagreed with him"" Watch: Wilf Mbanga on his friend Robert Mugabe Mr Chimutengwende felt Zimbabwe's leader had been unfairly demonised in the Western media because of his policy of seizing land from white farmers whom he suspects of having influential supporters, especially in the UK, where many trace their roots. The year 2000 marked a watershed both in the history of Zimbabwe and the career of Mr Mugabe. Until then, he was generally feted for reaching out towards the white community following independence, while Zimbabwe's economy was still faring pretty well. After coming to power in 1980, Mr Mugabe greatly expanded education and healthcare for black Zimbabweans and the country enjoyed living standards far higher than its neighbours. In 1995, a World Bank report praised Zimbabwe's rapid progress in the fields of health and literacy. Run by a former teacher, the country had the highest literacy rates in Africa. Money was poured into schools in the 1980s but resources were later squeezed In her book, Dinner With Mugabe, Heidi Hollande said Mr Mugabe used to personally coach illiterate State House workers to help them pass exams. Mr Mbanga recalls listening to the songs of US country singer Jim Reeves together. ""He could be very affectionate, he was an intellectual. He liked explaining things, like a teacher,"" said Mr Mbanga, but then saw a huge change in his former friend. ""He went from trying to convince you with his arguments to a man who would send his thugs to beat you up if you disagreed with him."" In fact, the warning signs were already there - the massacre of thousands of ethnic Ndebeles seen as supporters of Mr Mugabe's rival, Joshua Nkomo, in the 1980s and the start of the economic decline - but these were usually overlooked. Sally Mugabe was said to have been a ""moderating influence"" on her husband Some Zimbabweans say things started going wrong when he married his young secretary, Grace, in 1996. ""Some say he had us all fooled, I am convinced he himself changed,"" Mr Mbanga said. The journalist says that in his early years as president, Mr Mugabe genuinely believed in trying to improve the lives of his people, and introduced a ""leadership code"" which barred ministers from owning too much property. ""Look at him today, he is fabulously wealthy. He is not the person I knew,"" Mr Mbanga said in May 2014. In February 2000, the government lost a referendum on a draft constitution. With parliamentary elections looming four months later and a newly formed opposition party with close links to the ""No"" campaign posing a serious threat, Mr Mugabe unleashed his personal militia. White farmers were attacked, along with their black workers The land invasions turned much of Zimbabwe into no-go areas for the opposition Some were genuine veterans of the 1970s war of independence but others were far younger. TV footage of white farmers queuing up to make donations to the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) meant Mr Mugabe was able to portray the opposition as stooges of the white community, and by extension the UK. The invasion of white-owned farms achieved several goals for Mr Mugabe and his allies: Punish the white community for their ""betrayal"" Remove a source of funding from the opposition Allow the ""war veterans"" to intimidate the many thousands of black farmworkers, largely seen as opposition supporters Ensure that the opposition could not campaign in rural areas Re-energise his supporters, some of whom had been losing faith in his ability to redistribute land - one of the grievances behind the 1970s war of independence Attract new supporters with the promise of land handouts. There was certainly a strong moral argument that land reform was needed in Zimbabwe but the way it was carried out was undoubtedly with political motivations uppermost. Despite the widespread violence, intimidation and electoral fraud, the MDC gained almost as many elected seats as Zanu-PF in 2000. Had it not been for the intimidation in rural areas, Zanu-PF may well have lost its majority. Lovemore Madhuku, one of the leaders of the ""No"" campaign in 2000, described Mr Mugabe as an ""an excellent political calculator"", who adapted his tactics to the situation. ""There are moments when he chooses to be ruthless, others when he chooses to be magnanimousâ¦ He considers what is best - for him - in every situation and reacts accordingly,"" Mr Madhuku told the BBC. This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation He said Mr Mugabe might not have realised the damage the seizure of white-owned land would do to Zimbabwe's economy but in any case, he would not have cared, as long as he remained president. Mr Chan agreed that, ""in terms of Mr Mugabe's value-set, the ownership of the land is more important than the smooth running of the economy"". And the economy continued to decline until 2008. Zimbabwe's shops ran out of basic goods After 28 years of Mr Mugabe's rule, the resourceful, largely self-sufficient country lay in ruins. The inflation rate had reached an unfathomable 231 million per cent and young Zimbabweans were voting with their feet, fleeing the country he had fought to liberate. And yet, from this low point, he once more managed to outmanoeuvre his rivals and remain in power for another nine years. The key to understanding Robert Mugabe is the fight against white-minority rule. In the Rhodesia where he grew up, power was reserved for some 270,000 white people at the expense of about six millions Africans. A host of other laws discriminated against the black majority, largely subsistence farmers. Many black farmers were pushed into marginal areas of the country during the colonial era They were forced to leave their ancestral land and pushed into the country's peripheral regions, with dry soil and low rainfall, while the most fertile areas were reserved for white farmers. Reclaiming the land was one of the main drivers behind the 1970s war which brought Mr Mugabe to power. The son of a carpenter who abandoned his family, as a child Mr Mugabe was said to have been a loner, who spent much of his time reading. Ms Hollande wrote that after his elder brother died of poisoning when Mr Mugabe was just 10, his mother became depressed and the young Mugabe would do everything he could for her, to the extent he was teased as a ""mummy's boy"" at school. He eventually qualified as a teacher and in 1958 went to work in Ghana, which had just become the first African country south of the Sahara to end colonial rule. Encouraged by his Ghanaian wife, Sally, and the pan-Africanist speeches of Ghana's leader Kwame Nkrumah, Mr Mugabe became determined to achieve the same back home. On his return in 1960, he started to campaign for an end to discrimination and was jailed for a decade after being convicted of sedition. While in prison, his supporters wrested control of Zanu, the biggest party fighting white rule, and installed him as leader. On his release, he was supposed to remain in the country but with the help of a white nun, he was smuggled over the border into Mozambique and the Zanu guerrilla camps. After Mr Mugabe won the 1980 elections which led to independence, he pursued a policy of reconciliation with the white community despite the bitterness built up during the war. In a national address after becoming prime minister, he declared: ""If you were my enemy, you are now my friend. If you hated me, you cannot avoid the love that binds me to you and you to me."" ""He was a very nice guy. At that stage, he was not too sure of himself. There were very strong people in Zanu who were not afraid to oppose him. He would never take a decision on his own"" - Dumiso Dabengwa ""He did everything he could to improve the lives of his people. He wanted education for all. He wanted health for all. He introduced a leadership code limiting Zanu-PF cadres to 50 acres of land"" - Wilf Mbanga ""I worked very harmoniously with him and discussed issues. He would let me have my way or we would reach a compromise"" - Dumiso Dabengwa ""After 2000, he started flexing his muscles. He brought in people who he could influence. Several people were compromised - he held something over them"" - Dumiso Dabengwa. ""He has become fabulously wealthy. He is not the person I knew. He changed the moment Sally died [in 1992], when he married a young gold-digger [Grace Mugabe]"" - Wilf Mbanga He allowed Ian Smith, the Rhodesian prime minister who had once declared that black people would not rule the country for 1,000 years and who reportedly personally refused to let Mr Mugabe leave prison for the funeral of his then only son, to remain both an MP and on his farm. At this point, according to Mr Madhuku, Mr Mugabe's hold on power was relatively weak, so he realised he had to reach out to his former enemies. Former home affairs minister Mr Dabengwa said Mr Mugabe was even less self-confident earlier on in his political career. ""When I first met him in the 1960s, he was not sure of himself, of his position in Zanu,"" Mr Dabengwa recalled. ""There were very strong people in Zanu who were not afraid to oppose him. He would never take a decision on his own but would always check with them first."" But slowly, he consolidated control - first over the party which led the war against white-minority rule and later the country as a whole  - until the point where his was the only voice that counted. ""He loves power, it's in his DNA,"" said Mr Madhuku. Throughout his time as president, his closest allies were always those with whom he had endured the hardships of life during the guerrilla war of independence. When they felt their grip on power, and its trappings, were threatened, they reverted wholeheartedly to the conflict mentality. ""We are in a war to defend our rights and the interests of our people. The British have decided to take us on through the MDC,"" he told a 2002 election rally. Fredrick Shaba was one of many MDC officials attacked around the country in elections after 2000 This meant opposition supporters were denounced as traitors - a label which could mean an immediate death sentence. Mr Chimutengwende argued that the scale of the violence was exaggerated and in any case sought to distance it from Mr Mugabe: ""It is not the leader who throws a stone, or asks his followers to throw a stone."" But Mr Dabengwa, the minister in charge of the police in 2000, said Mr Mugabe's Zanu party had been using such methods since the 1980 election. He said that fighters from Zanu's armed wing had been sent out into rural areas to ensure villagers voted the ""right"" way, partly through all-night indoctrination sessions, known as ""pungwes"". ""People were told there were magic binoculars which could tell which way they voted and there were no-go areas for other parties,"" said Mr Dabengwa, whose Zapu party came a distant second in 1980. ""But the British declared those elections free and fair and so Zanu learnt that that was how to win an election."" Although he won those elections in 1980, and formed a coalition government with Zapu, the underlying tensions burst into open violence just two years later. Zapu leader Joshua Nkomo was accused of plotting a coup and the army's North Korea-trained Fifth Brigade was sent to his home region of Matabeleland. After the Gukurahundi killings, Mr Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo agreed to share power More than 20,000 people were killed in Operation Gukurahundi, which means ""the early rain which washes away the chaff"". At the time, South African double-agent Kevin Woods was making daily reports in person to then Prime Minister Mugabe for the internal security force, the Central Intelligence Organisation. ""He obviously wanted to know exactly what Fifth Brigade was doing,"" he wrote in his autobiography. In the end, a subdued Mr Nkomo once more agreed to share power with his enemy in order to end the violence in his home region - a forerunner of what later happened to the MDC. 21 February 1924:Born 1964:Jailed after being convicted of sedition 1973:Becomes Zanu leader 1980:Becomes prime minister of Zimbabwe 1987:Becomes president under new constitution agreed under deal to end Matabeleland massacres 1992:Wife Sally dies 1996:Marries Grace Marufu 2000:Loses referendum, land invasions begin 2002:Wins presidential election amid widespread violence and fraud allegations 2005:Launches Operation Murambatsvina (Drive Out Rubbish), which forces 700,000 urban residents from their homes - seen as punishment for opposition supporters 2008:Comes second in election, violence leads his opponent Morgan Tsvangirai to withdraw from run-off 2009:Forms coalition government 2013:Resoundingly re-elected, Tsvangirai returns to opposition 2017:Forced to resign after army seizes power 6 September 2019:Dies in Singapore, which he visits for hospital treatment Before he was finally ousted, his political low point was in 2008, when MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai beat him in a presidential election, although not by enough for outright victory, according to the official results. There were numerous reports Mr Mugabe was on the verge of resigning, although Mr Madhuku said he did not believe them, as the president subsequently demonstrated his determination to remain in power. Again, a setback led to a sustained campaign of violence against his ""enemies"". The army and Zanu-PF militias attacked MDC supporters around the country, killing more than 100 and forcing thousands from their homes. It became obvious that Zanu-PF would not relinquish its grip on power and Mr Tsvangirai withdrew from the second round, saying it was the only way to save lives. Zimbabwe's economy continued its freefall, reaching its nadir when people were dying from cholera in Harare because the country did not have the foreign currency to import the necessary chemicals to treat the water. Under intense pressure, Mr Mugabe agreed to a coalition government with his long-time rival and, under MDC stewardship, the economy recovered. Morgan Tsvangirai (r) was badly damaged by working with Robert Mugabe But Prime Minister Tsvangirai was severely tarnished by working with Mr Mugabe - the president always managed to keep real power for himself and his allies. By the time of the 2013 election, Mr Mugabe did not need to resort to extreme violence to win easily. He had once more demonstrated his remarkable skills of political survival and he remained in power until he was forced out in 2017. Mr Mugabe justified the 2000 land invasions by saying the UK's Labour government, in power since 1997, had reneged on a British promise to fund peaceful land reform. While it might be expected that an avowedly Marxist liberation fighter would have more in common with the Labour Party than the Conservatives, the opposite turned out to be true. ""Mrs Thatcher, you could trust her. But of course what happened later was a different story with the Labour Party and Blair, who you could never trust"" Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the UK accepted that as the former colonial power, it had the moral duty to help finance the process of buying white-owned land and redistributing it to black farmers. But after a report found the process had been tainted by cronyism, British funding was put on hold. The new Labour government took matters further and declared: ""We do not accept that Britain has a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe."" In 2013, Mr Mugabe observed: ""Mrs Thatcher, you could trust her. But of course what happened later was a different story with the Labour Party and [former Prime Minister Tony] Blair, who you could never trust. ""Who can ever believe what Mr Blair says? Here we call him Bliar."" Despite the vitriol directed at the UK from 2000 onwards, Mr Mugabe was in some ways the epitome of an English gentleman. He was usually turned out in immaculate, dark, three-piece suits and ties - until he was given a makeover in 2000 and advised to campaign in brightly coloured cloth emblazoned with his own face, like many other African leaders. Visitors to State House were always offered tea to drink and he was a huge fan of cricket. ""Cricket civilises people and creates good gentlemen. I want everyone to play cricket in Zimbabwe; I want ours to be a nation of gentlemen,"" he once said. He was educated by Jesuits in the Katuma mission near his birthplace in Zvimba, north-west of Salisbury (now Harare), where he was taken under the wing of an Irish priest, Jerome O'Hea. This is presumably where he developed his abstemious nature - he did not drink alcohol or coffee and was largely vegetarian. ""If he had died after 10 years in power, he would have been my hero forever"" His second wife Grace said he used to wake up at 05:00 for his exercises, including yoga. This healthy lifestyle was no doubt one reason why he lived until the age of 95. For many years, his health was a constant source of speculation. A 2008 US cable quoted in Wikileaks,externalsuggested Mr Mugabe had been diagnosed with cancer, giving him between three and five years to live. This prognosis turned out to be false, and on his 88th birthday Mr Mugabe joked he had ""beaten Christ"" because he had died and been resurrected so many times. While he was vilified in the West, his anti-colonial rhetoric did strike a chord across Africa, even among many who condemned his human rights record. At the 2013 memorial service in Soweto for Nelson Mandela - who replaced Mr Mugabe as Africa's most admired anti-colonial fighter - Zimbabwe's president was wildly cheered by the young South African crowd, even as they booed their own then leader, Jacob Zuma. These children in Harare had to have their lessons in the open air because there was no school building ""A lot of people think that pan-Africanism is a thing of the past but that is not true,"" said Mr Mugabe's staunch ally, Chen Chimutengwende. ""While imperialism and racism exist, pan-Africanism is still needed,"" he told the BBC. But Zimbabwean journalist Wilf Mbanga said that in his latter years, Mr Mugabe had far more support outside his home country than within. ""Those young South Africans who praise him do not have to live under his rule,"" he said, pointing out that many Ghanaians had less than fond memories of life under pan-African hero Kwame Nkrumah, who had inspired Mr Mugabe. So how will Mr Mugabe be remembered? Mr Chan said that until 2000, Mr Mugabe had a ""good report card"", although the verdict later turned to ""disastrous"". ""If he had died after 10 years in power, he would have been my hero forever,"" said Mr Mbanga. ""But look at the schools and hospitals now. ""He has spoilt his legacy. Now, people will remember him for driving people out of Harare, Gukurahundi, election violence and everything else.""

"The children of women who experience severe stress when pregnant are nearly 10 times more likely to develop a personality disorder by the age of 30, a study suggests. Even moderate prolonged stress may have an impact on child development and continue after a baby's birth, it said. More than 3,600 pregnant women in Finland were asked about their stress levels, and their children followed up. Psychiatrists say mums-to-be must have access to mental health support. Other important factors, such as how children are brought up, the family's financial situation and trauma experienced during childhood, are known to contribute to the development of personality disorders and could have played a role. It means that certain aspects of someone's personality make life difficult for them and for other people. They can be overly anxious or emotionally unstable, for example, or paranoid or anti-social - there are a wide range of types. Personality disorders are thought to affect about one in 20 people. They are more likely to have other mental health problems, such as depression, or drug and alcohol problems. Like other mental disorders, upbringing, brain problems and genes can play a part in their development. Every month during pregnancy,the study - in the British Journal of Psychiatry,external- asked women to answer questions about their mental stress levels. They had to say if they had notable stress, some stress or no stress. The women lived around Helsinki, Finland, and their babies were born between 1975 and 1976. When those children turned 30, any diagnoses of personality disorder were noted - there were 40 in total, which were all severe cases involving admission to hospital. The study found prolonged, high levels of stress during pregnancy could have a potentially long-lasting effect on children. Children exposed to severe maternal stress were 9.53 times more likely to develop a personality disorder than those whose mothers experienced no stress. Those exposed to moderate stress had four times the chances. This could be stress related to relationship problems, social factors or psychological problems, for example. It's not known how stress in pregnant women could increase the risk of personality disorders - it could be down to changes caused in the brain or the result of inherited genes, or a number of other factors in the children's upbringing. The researchers tried to tease out the effects of stress alone, by controlling for other factors such as the psychiatric history of the pregnant women, whether they smoked during pregnancy or had depression. Previous research has found links between stress in pregnancy and the development of depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Dr Trudi Seneviratne, who chairs the perinatal faculty at Royal College of Psychiatrists, said pregnancy could be a stressful time and mums-to-be needed support. ""If stress isn't tackled, there is a high chance it will spill into the post-natal period,"" she said. ""It's a really sensitive thing to talk about. ""We don't want parents to think they are damaging their children - but high levels of stress do affect us."" She said NHS England had dramatically improved perinatal mental health services in recent times. Women should be supported at home and work during pregnancy and given coping strategies for when they were stressed, Dr Seneviratne said. ""They need to learn to rest, to ask for support and talk to someone about how they are feeling."" Eating a balanced diet, stopping smoking and getting regular sleep is also advised. More advice is available fromthe Royal College of Psychiatrists' website,externalandNHS UK,external. Lead study author Ross Brannigan, from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, said: ""This study highlights the importance of providing mental health and stress support to both pregnant women and families during the antenatal and postnatal period."" Your midwife or health visitor should ask if you have ever had problems with your mental health in the past and whether you have feelings of hopelessness after your baby is born. You should be offered support,externalfrom health professionals to help you manage your feelings.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he believed voters want the country to ""get on"" with Brexit Boris Johnson has claimed his political opponents ""don't trust the people"" as they vowed to again block his demand for a snap general election. Opposition parties have said they will vote against or abstain in Monday's vote on whether to hold a poll. Mr Johnson said the public was tired of ""dither and delay"" over Brexit, and want us to ""get this thing done"". And he vowed to ""go to Brussels and get a deal"" that would allow the UK to leave the EU on 31 October. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru held talks on Friday on their strategy over the timing of a general election after joining forces earlier this week to block the PM's plan to hold an early vote All four parties have said they will again not support the PM's call for an election in the Commons on Monday. Opposition parties to reject PM election move John Curtice: Why Nicola Sturgeon wants an election They are concerned that Mr Johnson would not stick to his pledge to have the election on 15 October, and would instead wait until after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October - potentially without a deal. Speaking on a visit to Aberdeenshire, the prime minister told journalists that it was ""curious"" the opposition had refused his offer of an election. A bull bumped into a plain clothes police officer while being walked by the PM at a farm in Banchory, near Aberdeen Mr Johnson added: ""They don't trust the people, they don't want an election - perhaps it is because they don't think that they will win. ""Fine. I'll go to Brussels, I'll get a deal and we'll make sure we come out on 31 October"". He insisted a deal would be agreed by 17 or 18 October - the dates of an EU Council summit - and would allow the UK to ""start a new partnership with our European friends"". The PM said the public was tired of ""endless, pointless delays"" to Brexit, and ""want us to get on and do it"", and that ""never in history has the opposition party been given the chance for election and turned it down."" Mr Johnson has previously said he would rather be ""dead in a ditch"" than ask for another extension to Brexit - but he said resigning as PM if the country does not leave the EU by that date was ""not a hypothesis I want to contemplate"". He also said he could see ""no reason"" to agree to a second Scottish independence referendum. In other developments on Friday: There was some good news for Mr Johnson when the High Court in Londonrejected a legal challenge by campaigner Gina Miller, who wanted his plan to suspend Parliament ruled illegal The court immediately said Ms Miller could appeal. A decision in the appeal against a similar ruling in the Court of Session in Edinburgh earlier this weekis expected to be delivered next Wednesday. But the panel of three Court of Session judges refused to grant an interim interdict which would have prevented Parliament being prorogued before they deliver their verdict.

Mr Johnson visited a fish market in Peterhead as he kicked off his trip to Scotland Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the possibility of having an election was ""extremely attractive"" but the ""immediate crisis"" of preventing a no-deal Brexit had to be dealt with first.

MPs set for fresh early election vote on Monday But she told BBC Scotland that her priority was stopping a no-deal Brexit, and that a November general election was now looking more likely than October.

He is expected to cut short his visit to the monarch's summer residence - a traditional prime ministerial trip each summer - because of the Brexit crisis. Rather than the usual weekend-long visit, Mr Johnson and girlfriend Carrie Symonds are likely to return to London on Saturday. A politically bruising week for the prime minister has seen Mr Johnson lose his Commons majority, the expulsion of 21 of his own MPs for rebelling and his younger brother resign from government, alongside defeats in the Commons over Brexit. Nicola Sturgeon does not believe a general election in October is in the public interest Mr Johnson used his visit to Scotland to announce Â£51.4m of funding for Scottish farmers over the next two years, in addition to aÂ£160m package unveiled earlier this weekas part of the Spending Review. The move is aimed at settling a long-running row over the distribution of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy payments across the UK, and meets the recommendations of the newly-published Bew Review. The funding was announced as the UK government confirmed it would work to ensure cash for farmers was fairly allocated across the whole of the UK, and that the industry would be ready for a ""prosperous future"" outside the EU.

"The memo suggested a poll that ""shows up the inequity of the existing border"" A top-secret memo written by an Army general during the Troubles refers to Britain needing to find a way to ""gradually escape"" from its commitment to Northern Ireland. It was discovered by the BBC NI's Spotlight programme during the making of a major new series on the conflict. It was written by Sir Michael Carver, who was providing advice to government in 1972 as the Army's chief of staff. The decades-long violence cost about 3,700 lives. Lord Carver was the Army's chief of staff in 1972 The former chief of staff, later Lord Carver, wrote: ""If I am right, and we want a lasting solution, it must lie in finding a way in which HM Government can gradually escape from the commitment to the border."" He suggested a ""plebiscite"", or poll, organised ""in such a way that it shows up the inequity of the existing border"". Rare film footage shows Martin McGuinness (right) present as a car bomb is assembled The programme makers have also obtained rare film footage showing Martin McGuinness, the former IRA commander, in the presence of people assembling a car bomb. Identifiable by its licence plate, the vehicle was used in an attack on Shipquay Street in the centre of Londonderry in 1972. The car was used in a bomb explosion in Derry city centre In other footage, the former Sinn FÃ©in deputy first minister of Northern Ireland is seen showing children weapons and ammunition. Part one of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History covers 1966 to 1972 and also explores the rise of Ian Paisley, who went on become DUP leader and first minister. What were the Troubles? A former senior army officer, David Hancock, told the programme Mr Paisley ""financed"" a UVF bombing in Kilkeel in 1969. Targeting infrastructure, the blast was blamed on the IRA, but was part of a loyalist campaign designed to destabilise the Stormont government of Terence O'Neill. Ian Paisley pictured speaking during a protest rally Mr Hancock said police had shown him ""evidence"" that Mr Paisley ""had supplied the money which financed the explosion"". Mr Paisley's son Ian, the DUP MP for North Antrim, said the allegations were ""complete and total poppycock"" and criticised the BBC for not approaching the Paisley family with them. Ian Paisley told the Nolan programme on BBC Radio Ulster there was ""absolutely no truth whatsoever in what I can only describe as a filthy story designed to try and impugn the reputation of a dead man"". A BBC Spokesperson said: ""The BBC has complete confidence in the editorial integrity of the programme. ""As no allegations were made against the wider Paisley family it was not necessary to offer them a right to reply."" The series comprises seven programmes and contains interviews with around 100 people as well as archive never shown before. The editor of Spotlight, Jeremy Adams, said the series had uncovered ""new findings"" on the Troubles. ""The past has shaped our present and it's vitally important that truths continue to be told."" The first episode of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Four on Tuesday, 10 September at 20:30 BST.

"This video can not be played Survivors of the hurricane say there is utter devastation The death toll from Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas will be ""staggering"", the country's government has warned as aid efforts are being stepped up. The official death toll stands at 30, but is expected to rise further. Officials are sending morticians and 200 body bags to the Abaco Islands, the worst-hit part of the archipelago. Dorian - which devastated the northern Bahamas from Sunday to Tuesday - has now made landfall in the US state of North Carolina, but is weakening. Officials say hundreds, possibly thousands, are still missing in the Abacos and Grand Bahama. In pictures: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Path of destruction 'Hurricane's storm surge swallowed my son, 5' Have you been affected by Hurricane Dorian? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external On Thursday Health Minister Duane Sands warned of a ""staggering"" final count. ""The public needs to prepare for unimaginable information about the death toll and the human suffering,"" he told local radio. Dr Ian Norton, who manages the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s emergency medical teams, also told reporters that he was also ""really worried"" about the potential death toll. Great Abaco has been rendered virtually uninhabitable Dorian hit the Bahamas as a category five hurricane with winds reaching 185mph (297km/h). It matched the highest ever recorded at landfall, and stayed over affected areas for two days. The International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - were severely damaged or destroyed. Parts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain, leaving vast areas of it flooded. The Island of Great Abaco is virtually uninhabitable, with bodies piled up, no water, power or food, and militias formed to prevent looting, local media report. This video can not be played Residents in the Bahamas say ""it's total devastation"" Aerial images over the Abacos showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels. The only international airport in Grand Bahama was also devastated. As a result, it could not be used for evacuations or aid deliveries. The WHO said flooding had rendered Grand Bahama's main hospital unusable, and a field hospital would need to be set up in its place. Several patients have been airlifted from Marsh Harbour Medical Centre in the Abacos, according to the Associated Press news agency, but the site is still being run as a shelter. Matt Morrison, BBC News, Bahamas Everyone who experienced the storm here on Abaco has a story to tell. Whether it is one of dramatic survival, or the loss of a loved one, every life has been affected. 'It was like being in a tornado for hours on end,' one Marsh Harbour resident told me. 'Everything is gone'. Driving down the streets one sees destruction in every direction. Homes and businesses have nearly all been levelled. Those that are left standing have broken windows and caved in walls. There is an eerie silence, as the few residents around survey the damage. About 5.5 miles off shore, Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary has stationed an aid ship, the Mounts Bay. The 179-meter vessel had been in the area as the storm approached, and the scene onboard is one of urgency and focus. Aid is being loaded onto floating platforms to make the two-hour journey to shore. The crew are on day three, and will continue here until they move on to the next disaster area. The Bahamas' government has signed an emergency declaration giving tax exemptions to medicine, building supplies and other goods that can be used for relief efforts. International aid operations have been primarily focused on Grand Bahama and the Abacos, which were hit worst. Search-and-rescue teams have been combing the worst-hit communities looking for any trace of survivors and bodies.  As of Friday, the US Coast Guard said it had rescued 205 residents. Meanwhile, efforts to deliver aid are being ramped up. Planes and helicopters have been flying in emergency supplies to help the estimated 76,000 people in need of food and shelter. Eight tonnes (8,000kg) of ready-to-eat meals, storage units, generators and other emergency suppliers are to be flown in from Panama, the UN World Food Programme said. A $5.4m (Â£4.3m) budget has been allocated to the UN agency for a three-month emergency operation in the Bahamas. However, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said damage to roads and other infrastructure was hampering relief efforts. Now downgraded to a category 1 hurricane, Dorian has made landfall in the US. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that at 09:00 local time (13:00 GMT) Dorian hit Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with 90mph (145km/h) winds. The storm has already caused severe flooding and widespread power failures in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian causes floods and tornadoes in South Carolina In the Carolinas, more than 900,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes, but it was unclear how many had complied. Forecasters said 10 inches (25 cm) of rain has fallen between the coasts of Charleston, South Carolina and Wilmington, North Carolina 170 miles away. Dorian is expected to push north and out into the Atlantic, but will make landfall again on Saturday in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds are still expected in Virginia and other north-eastern states. Three storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida and another in North Carolina. All four died whilst preparing their homes and shelters for the storm. According to the NHC, a ""hurricane season"" runs in the Atlantic Ocean between 1 June and 30 November. The term denotes a period when most of the year's tropical cyclones take place in the Atlantic, though it typically peaks in the late summer. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms This video can not be played Hurricanes and climate change Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

"Alcohol sold in supermarkets should be taxed at a higher rate than drink sold in pubs, a think tank has suggested. A ""pub relief"" would make drinking at home less affordable and support the pub sector, according to the Social Market Foundation (SMF). The Institute of Alcohol Studies (IAS), which commissioned the research, said it would help to cut problem drinking. Taxing cider and wine by the unit in England would also have public health benefits, the IAS said. The idea would be to shift taxation towards high-strength drinks bought for consumption at home - and away from weaker products bought in pubs and bars, the SMF said. That could mean that beer in pubs would become less expensive, depending on how the duties were structured. Taxing cider and wine by the unit, as is already the case with beer and spirits, would also help cut down problem drinking, it added. According to recent research, cheap supermarket alcohol was the ""number one"" concern for publicans, said IAS senior policy analyst Aveek Bhattacharya, followed by competition from big chains. ""Wetherspoon's comes in, and that's a killer,"" he said, adding: ""Business rates are a big pressure."" The number of pubs in the UK has declined by nearly a quarter since 2008 as small pubs disappear and big chains consolidate their businesses,according to the latest official figures,external. Colin 'CJ' Lewis says higher taxes for supermarket alcohol is a great idea in theory, but might not work out in practice. ""I've been in the game 20 years, and it's got tougher and tougher,"" says ""CJ"" Lewis, the manager of the independent King and Queen pub in London's Fitzrovia district. ""And to be honest, the supermarkets are a little bit to blame,"" he says. He says that alcohol available in supermarkets ""is, in theory, too cheap"". ""The price of alcohol here [in the pub] compared with the price in a supermarket is a bit ridiculous."" However, he adds: ""I can't complain, because I buy it myself."" He says the idea of higher taxes for alcohol in supermarkets is ""great"" for the pub industry in theory, but he's not sure how it would work out in practice. Supermarkets may still find a way to cut prices, he says. And any tax relief on beer sold in brewery-owned pubs might be clawed back from landlords by the breweries, he adds. The breweries could charge those landlords more for their beer, and it would stay the same price in the pub for customers, he says. Mr Bhattacharya said alcohol in supermarkets is cheap for a number of reasons. Alcohol duty has been cut in real terms every year since 2013, and beer duty in real terms is 18% lower than then. One of the main reasons supermarket booze is cheaper than pubs is bargaining power, he says. Supermarkets can squeeze brewers on price because they are such large customers, but when it comes to landlords negotiating with brewers, ""the boot's on the other foot"", he said. Supermarkets can also use alcohol as a loss leader - that is, it's sold at a loss to attract shoppers into stores, where they will buy more profitable items. Katherine Severi, IAS chief executive, said: ""Alcohol has become a lot more affordable, and cheaper too, by comparison with other goods... For too long, alcohol duty has been politicised."" Landlords have a duty of care to people in their pubs, she said, adding that a change in the tax regime would ""reduce societal harms"". Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents brewers, said: ""The focus should be on reducing the overall beer duty rate, which is one of the highest in the EU and places an enormous burden on pubs. ""It is also important that the report recognises that the excise duty regime should encourage the consumption of lower-strength products."" A Treasury statement said: ""We are committed to supporting our pub industry and responsible drinkers, while tackling the sources of harmful drinking. ""That's why we've consistently cut or frozen alcohol duties, saving drinkers Â£5.2bn, and introduced a new higher rate of tax for harmful high-strength ciders.""

"A second person has died in the US from a severe lung disease apparently caused by vaping, public health officials in the state of Oregon have said. The person was said to have fallen ill after trying a product bought at a dispensary for recreational cannabis. The first vaping death was reported in Illinois in August. Experts are investigating a mysterious lung disease linked to use of e-cigarettes which has affected more than 200 people around the country. Several of the cases - which have emerged since the end of June - involve vaping THC, the main active compound in cannabis, experts from the US Centers for Disease Control Prevention said. Oregon health official Ann Thomas said it was not clear whether the most recently reported victim's illness was caused by contaminants, ingredients in the liquid or the vaping device itself. Ms Thomas said the patient, who died in July, was hospitalised and put on a ventilator. They were ""otherwise healthy and quickly became very ill"", she said. Meanwhile the Washington Post reported thathealth officials had linked the illnesses to an oil derived from vitamin E,external, found in samples of marijuana products used by victims. The cause of the mystery illness has not been identified, but all cases involve vaping in some form. Those affected had symptoms including coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue as well as some cases of vomiting and diarrhoea. There was no evidence of an infectious disease - such as a virus or bacteria - being responsible. But much remained a mystery. Officials ordered laboratory tests of vaping liquid samples in a bid to identify any harmful compounds. Michigan bans flavoured e-cigarettes in US first E-cigarettes 'more harmful than we think' US man killed by exploding vape pen A ""black market"" is known to exist for THC-containing vape cartridges, which are sold legally through medical marijuana dispensaries in some states. Users in online communities have warned of the dangers of unregulated fake cartridges. No cause for the mystery illness has so far been identified - and the link to THC products is not yet clear. This video can not be played Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results The American Vaping Association blamed the recent illnesses on illegal vape pens containing THC. But Dr Brian King from the CDC's office on smoking and health warned against thinking of vaping as completely safe. ""We do know that e-cigarettes do not emit a harmless aerosol,"" he said. ""There's a variety of harmful ingredients identified, including things like ultrafine particulates, heavy metals like lead and cancer causing chemicals,"" he said, along with diacetyl - a flavouring used to give a ""buttery"" taste that has been linked to ""severe respiratory illness"". He also warned of the possibility that similar cases had been happening for a long time, but the connection between them had been missed. ""It's possible that the reported cases could have been occurring before this investigation was even initiated,"" he said. Dr King said it was possible ""we weren't necessarily capturing them, but now there's increased diligence in terms of the current investigation that we're better able to"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he believed voters want the country to ""get on"" with Brexit Boris Johnson has claimed his political opponents ""don't trust the people"" as they vowed to again block his demand for a snap general election. Opposition parties have said they will vote against or abstain in Monday's vote on whether to hold a poll. Mr Johnson said the public was tired of ""dither and delay"" over Brexit, and want us to ""get this thing done"". And he vowed to ""go to Brussels and get a deal"" that would allow the UK to leave the EU on 31 October. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru held talks on Friday on their strategy over the timing of a general election after joining forces earlier this week to block the PM's plan to hold an early vote All four parties have said they will again not support the PM's call for an election in the Commons on Monday. Opposition parties to reject PM election move John Curtice: Why Nicola Sturgeon wants an election They are concerned that Mr Johnson would not stick to his pledge to have the election on 15 October, and would instead wait until after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October - potentially without a deal. Speaking on a visit to Aberdeenshire, the prime minister told journalists that it was ""curious"" the opposition had refused his offer of an election. A bull bumped into a plain clothes police officer while being walked by the PM at a farm in Banchory, near Aberdeen Mr Johnson added: ""They don't trust the people, they don't want an election - perhaps it is because they don't think that they will win. ""Fine. I'll go to Brussels, I'll get a deal and we'll make sure we come out on 31 October"". He insisted a deal would be agreed by 17 or 18 October - the dates of an EU Council summit - and would allow the UK to ""start a new partnership with our European friends"". The PM said the public was tired of ""endless, pointless delays"" to Brexit, and ""want us to get on and do it"", and that ""never in history has the opposition party been given the chance for election and turned it down."" Mr Johnson has previously said he would rather be ""dead in a ditch"" than ask for another extension to Brexit - but he said resigning as PM if the country does not leave the EU by that date was ""not a hypothesis I want to contemplate"". He also said he could see ""no reason"" to agree to a second Scottish independence referendum. In other developments on Friday: There was some good news for Mr Johnson when the High Court in Londonrejected a legal challenge by campaigner Gina Miller, who wanted his plan to suspend Parliament ruled illegal The court immediately said Ms Miller could appeal. A decision in the appeal against a similar ruling in the Court of Session in Edinburgh earlier this weekis expected to be delivered next Wednesday. But the panel of three Court of Session judges refused to grant an interim interdict which would have prevented Parliament being prorogued before they deliver their verdict. A bill aimed at ensuring the UK cannot leave the EU without an exit deal has completed its passage through the House of Lords. Mr Johnson visited a fish market in Peterhead as he kicked off his trip to Scotland Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the possibility of having an election was ""extremely attractive"" but the ""immediate crisis"" of preventing a no-deal Brexit had to be dealt with first. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says she would ""relish"" a general election, and predicted that the SNP would ""beat the Tories"" in Scotland on a ticket of offering the country a chance to ""choose our own future"". Court releases PM's Parliament shutdown memos Could an early election still happen? MPs set for fresh early election vote on Monday But she told BBC Scotland that her priority was stopping a no-deal Brexit, and that a November general election was now looking more likely than October. And she said holding a general election before the end of October could allow Mr Johnson to ""cut and run"". The prime minister's trip to Scotland will include a visit to the Queen's Balmoral estate. He is expected to cut short his visit to the monarch's summer residence - a traditional prime ministerial trip each summer - because of the Brexit crisis. Rather than the usual weekend-long visit, Mr Johnson and girlfriend Carrie Symonds are likely to return to London on Saturday. A politically bruising week for the prime minister has seen Mr Johnson lose his Commons majority, the expulsion of 21 of his own MPs for rebelling and his younger brother resign from government, alongside defeats in the Commons over Brexit. Nicola Sturgeon does not believe a general election in October is in the public interest Mr Johnson used his visit to Scotland to announce Â£51.4m of funding for Scottish farmers over the next two years, in addition to aÂ£160m package unveiled earlier this weekas part of the Spending Review. The move is aimed at settling a long-running row over the distribution of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy payments across the UK, and meets the recommendations of the newly-published Bew Review. The funding was announced as the UK government confirmed it would work to ensure cash for farmers was fairly allocated across the whole of the UK, and that the industry would be ready for a ""prosperous future"" outside the EU. This video can not be played So who actually wants an election? NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick described the move as being the ""largest funding uplift for the sector in recent memory"". But the SNP said Mr Johnson was like a ""thief returning to the scene of a crime"", while Labour said the prime minister was ""no friend"" of Scottish agriculture. The prime minister started his visit to Scotland at Peterhead Fish Market and joined in with a bidding war over a box of cod - which he ended up buying for Â£185. Asked whether Mr Johnson had paid a good price, fish market chief executive Simon Brebner said: ""If you're selling, it's a great price. If you're buying, maybe it's a little high.""

"A second person has died in the US from a severe lung disease apparently caused by vaping, public health officials in the state of Oregon have said. The person was said to have fallen ill after trying a product bought at a dispensary for recreational cannabis. The first vaping death was reported in Illinois in August. Experts are investigating a mysterious lung disease linked to use of e-cigarettes which has affected more than 200 people around the country. Several of the cases - which have emerged since the end of June - involve vaping THC, the main active compound in cannabis, experts from the US Centers for Disease Control Prevention said. Oregon health official Ann Thomas said it was not clear whether the most recently reported victim's illness was caused by contaminants, ingredients in the liquid or the vaping device itself. Ms Thomas said the patient, who died in July, was hospitalised and put on a ventilator. They were ""otherwise healthy and quickly became very ill"", she said. Meanwhile the Washington Post reported thathealth officials had linked the illnesses to an oil derived from vitamin E,external, found in samples of marijuana products used by victims. The cause of the mystery illness has not been identified, but all cases involve vaping in some form. Those affected had symptoms including coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue as well as some cases of vomiting and diarrhoea. There was no evidence of an infectious disease - such as a virus or bacteria - being responsible. But much remained a mystery. Officials ordered laboratory tests of vaping liquid samples in a bid to identify any harmful compounds. Michigan bans flavoured e-cigarettes in US first E-cigarettes 'more harmful than we think' US man killed by exploding vape pen A ""black market"" is known to exist for THC-containing vape cartridges, which are sold legally through medical marijuana dispensaries in some states. Users in online communities have warned of the dangers of unregulated fake cartridges. No cause for the mystery illness has so far been identified - and the link to THC products is not yet clear. This video can not be played Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results The American Vaping Association blamed the recent illnesses on illegal vape pens containing THC. But Dr Brian King from the CDC's office on smoking and health warned against thinking of vaping as completely safe. ""We do know that e-cigarettes do not emit a harmless aerosol,"" he said. ""There's a variety of harmful ingredients identified, including things like ultrafine particulates, heavy metals like lead and cancer causing chemicals,"" he said, along with diacetyl - a flavouring used to give a ""buttery"" taste that has been linked to ""severe respiratory illness"". He also warned of the possibility that similar cases had been happening for a long time, but the connection between them had been missed. ""It's possible that the reported cases could have been occurring before this investigation was even initiated,"" he said. Dr King said it was possible ""we weren't necessarily capturing them, but now there's increased diligence in terms of the current investigation that we're better able to"".
