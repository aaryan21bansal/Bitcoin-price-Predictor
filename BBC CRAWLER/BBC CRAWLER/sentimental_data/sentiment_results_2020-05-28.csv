"The law has sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protest The US, UK, Australia and Canada have issued fresh condemnation of Beijing's new security law for Hong Kong, which they say has ""flourished as a bastion of freedom"". They say the international community has a ""significant and long-standing stake"" in its prosperity and stability. China's move to impose the new law during a global pandemic risked undermining trust in governments and international co-operation, they said. China has rejected foreign criticism. The law - approved by China's parliament on Thursday - has already sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protest in Hong Kong. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How is Hong Kong run? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it couldno longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China. This could lead to Hong Kong being treated the same as mainland China under US law, which would have major implications for its trade hub status. The UK on Thursday said visa rights for 300,000 British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong would be extended into a""pathway to future [UK] citizenship""if China did not suspend its security law plans. Direct imposition of the security law by Beijing rather than through Hong Kong's own institutions would ""curtail the Hong Kong people's liberties"" and ""dramatically erode Hong Kong's autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous"", the statement says. It would also conflict with China's international obligations within the Sino-British declaration, under which Hong Kong was returned to China, and would both undermine the ""one country, two systems"" principle and ""raise the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab says he is ""deeply troubled"" by China's actions in Hong Kong The allies also say they are ""deeply concerned"" that the new law will deepen divisions in Hong Kong, which has seen repeated waves of protests and clashes over the territory's relationship with the mainland. ""Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year,"" the statement says. The US and its allies urge China to work with Hong Kong's government and people to find a ""mutually acceptable accommodation"". In other reaction, Japan said Hong Kong was an ""extremely important partner"" and that democracy and stability there must be maintained. What if the US removes Hong Kong's special status? China's parliament has backed the security legislation, which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong. The resolution - which now passes to China's senior leadership - could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time. Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September. President Xi Jinping and other senior figures applauded when the security law was passed However it is expected to criminalise: secession - breaking away from the country subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform. China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong said it ""firmly opposed and refuted"" Mr Pompeo's assertion that Hong Kong had lost its autonomy and urged the US to ""immediately stop meddling"" in China's internal affairs. It described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless"". Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has denied that the law would curtail the rights of Hong Kongers and said it was a ""responsible"" move to protect the law-abiding majority. Twitter fact-checks China amid bias row HK leader dismisses concerns over freedoms Clashes broke out on Wednesday as Hong Kong's parliament debated a different proposed law, which would make it a crime to disrespect the Chinese national anthem. Hundreds of people were arrested in protests over that and the security law. Security remained high on Thursday, as a tense debate in the Legislative Council continued. At least two pro-democracy legislators were ejected from the council on Thursday. One lawmaker, Ted Hui, threw rotten plants on to the floor of the chamber, saying it symbolised the decay of Hong Kong's political system. ""I want the speaker to feel what is meant by rotten,"" he said. The speaker deemed the package to be an ""unknown dangerous object"", and called police and fire crews. Firefighters check the Legislative Council chamber after a lawmaker threw foul-smelling plants on to the floor Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle. They are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has. This video can not be played Police arrested dozens of people in Causeway Bay on Wednesday Under the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact its own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law. But its unpopularity meant it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests. Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement. China is keen to avoid a repeat of that unrest.

"This video can not be played You can now meet up outside with people from another local household, but must keep your distance Coronavirus restrictions in Wales are likely to be relaxed next week so people from two different households can meet each other outdoors, BBC Wales understands. They will need to stay in their local area and remain two metres apart. The changes will not come into force until Monday. Other parts of the UK have loosened restrictions on meeting others. Further details are expected from First Minister Mark Drakeford on Friday. What do Wales' lockdown rules mean? Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown? Households are expected to be able to meet in gardens, as well as away from their homes. It has been illegal for groups of more than two people to meet since lockdown began in March. In a Twitter video, Mr Drakeford thanked people for their ""ongoing help and support and for all the sacrifices you have made"". ""I know being separated from family and friends is difficult,"" he added. People can leave the home to exercise, including cycling Since late March people have been told to stay home except for work, exercise and shopping for essentials. Wales' exercise restrictions are more stringent than England's - people have been told to stay local and not to drive. Most non-essential retail has been forced to close, alongside pubs and restaurants. Exceptions include supermarkets, garden centres and pharmacies. Schools are closed, but some are instead providing childcare for the children of key workers. Different parts of the UK have different rules for lockdown England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all have their own lockdown rules. In England they are set by the UK government, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In the other three countries they are set by their different governments. Groups of six people will be able tomeet outside in England from Monday. In Scotland people will be able to meet their friends and family outsidefrom this Friday. The country's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said people from two different households will be able to meet, but must keep two metres apart. They must also remain outdoors, and in groups of no more than eight. In Northern Ireland groups of six people who do not share a householdcan meet outdoors. The first minister has been dropping big hints for some time that his priority in lifting restrictions is to allow people to see friends and family if it can be done safely. My understanding is the approach will continue to be cautious, with people likely to remain confined to their local area. The strategy seems to be to make a small change and then keep an eye on the reproduction rate of the virus - the R number. That means the rules in Wales may continue to differ from those in other nations of the UK, but Mark Drakeford believes that most Welsh voters support his cautious approach. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said that the R number - the rate that coronavirus is spreading - is the biggest factor in determining when lockdown measures can be eased. If the R number is R2, it means a sick person is likely to transmit the virus to two other people. The latest Welsh Government analysis suggests Wales' R rate remains between 0.7 and 1, ""but still below 1"". Officials want it to remain below one. It is believed that an R of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if R reaches 1.1. The Welsh Government has not set dates for when measures in Wales could be lifted, unlike England. Current plans envisagea traffic light-style system of red, amber and green phases,external, with more restrictions lifted as they progress. This video can not be played The First Minister says that the easing of lockdown has looked at how to meet friends and family again. Former Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies tweeted it was ""great news for those with family and friends nearby"". But he asked what it meant for those who do not, ""particularly in rural communities"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""The people of Wales have generally adhered well to lockdown restrictions, and understand the need to take a cautious approach."" But he said the public would benefit from having a ""clearer plan of how restrictions will be managed"". Darren Millar, Welsh Conservative spokesman for Covid Recovery, said the longer the lockdown continued, ""the more difficult it will be for our economy to recover, the more jobs will be lost, and the more harm will be done to the education of our young people"". ""With infection rates falling and pressures on the NHS easing, it's now essential that the Welsh Government begins to safely and sensibly lift restrictions so that families can be reunited, our economy can begin to bounce back, and our young people can get the education they deserve,"" he added. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Drakeford and Boris Johnson, together with the first ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland, spoke on the phone. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister ""remains determined to work closely with the devolved administrations"". Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown?

"This video can not be played Up to six people can meet up outside from Monday Groups of up to six people from different households will be able to meet outside in England from Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced. They can meet in gardens - in addition to parks - as long as households keep two metres apart. ""These changes mean friends and family will start to meet loved ones,"" in what would be a ""long awaited and joyful moment,"" he added. The PM said it was possible because thegovernment's five testswere being met. Currently, people in England can only meet one other person from another household at a distance in a public place. Speaking at Thursday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson told people they should ""try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession"" to help ""avoid the risk of transmission from lots of different families"". It means people will be able to see ""both parents at once, or both grandparents at once,"" Mr Johnson said. Barbecues will be allowed, the prime minister confirmed, providing people are ""scrupulous"" about washing their hands, maintaining good hygiene and social distancing. He also insisted that the government does not want people to stay overnight at other households. ""I'm afraid we're not at that stage,"" Mr Johnson said. Explained: What the new rules mean What am I allowed to do now? What are the five tests for easing lockdown? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party supports the gradual easing of some lockdown restrictions if it is safe. In Scotland, people from two different householdscan meet outdoors at a distance from Friday- but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said guests should not enter other people's homes, for instance to use the toilet. In Wales, people from two different householdswill be able to meet outside from Monday. And in Northern Ireland, outdoor weddings with 10 people presentmay be allowed from 8 June. It will now be possible to have barbecues with friends and family in England, provided social distancing guidelines are followed Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told the briefing it was ""essential"" that people continue to social distance and wash their hands. ""If someone was to go into the loo because they had to do that, it's absolutely critical that they wipe everything down, wash their hands all the way through"", he said. ""If you were to do something like a barbecue, remember that passing things from one person to another, if you haven't washed your hands, you can pass the virus that way."" Mr Johnson said that, despite the slight relaxation of rules on meeting people outside, those in England deemed most vulnerable to Covid-19 should continue to shield themselves for now. He told those who are shielding that ministers were ""looking carefully at how we can make your life easier"" and hope to ""say more on that soon"". The prime minister warned ""there will be further local outbreaks"" and said the government would reintroduce measures where required, but pledged people who lose income as a result of local lockdowns ""will be helped"". Speaking after the briefing, Labour leader Sir Keir said: ""We support the gradual easing of restrictions on lockdown, it's got to be safe and we need clear guidance from public health and we also need to see the scientific evidence actually published. ""We also need a clear test and trace, effective, clear test and trace monitor operation in place."" SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The PM warned the country should make only ""limited and cautious"" progress out of lockdown, which has been in place since 23 March. The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, echoed Mr Johnson's message of caution. Sir Patrick said the rate of infection was ""close to one"" - the rate at which the number of new cases can rise rapidly - and that ""we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate"". ""That means there is not a lot of room to do things and things need to be done cautiously, step-by-step and monitored and the test and trace system needs to be effective in order to manage that,"" he said. His warning came as anew study by the Office for National Statisticssuggested one in 15 people in England (about 7%) have already had the virus. After Easter, the government set out five conditions for easing lockdown measures safely. The prime minister has said that - as of 28 May - these are being met sufficiently to slightly ease restrictions in England. 1. Making sure the NHS can cope- Mr Johnson said this test was met because there were only 475 hospital admissions in England on 26 May 2. A 'sustained and consistent' fall in the daily death rate- deaths have been falling since the middle of April, with 377 reported on Thursday, meeting this test, he said 3. Rate of infection decreasing to 'manageable levels'- with an average of 2,312 new cases being confirmed in the last seven days, Mr Johnson said this test was met 4. Ensuring supply of tests and PPE can meet future demand- test capacity was at 161,214 a day and new contracts for protective equipment had been signed, the prime minister said 5. Being confident any changes would not risk a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS- Mr Johnson said the adjustments were ""carefully designed"" to keep theR number(the average number of people each infected person passes the disease to) below one In a separate move on Thursday, the governmenttold dental practices in England they can reopenfrom Monday, if they put in place appropriate safety measures. Nurseries and schools - for Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 classes - in Englandwill also be able to reopen from next week. Outdoor markets and car showrooms will also be able to reopen from Monday. They will be followed by non-essential retailers from 15 June if the five tests continue to be met, the PM said. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson told MPs that he hoped to reduce the length of the two metre social distancing measures ""as we make progress in getting the virus down"". The World Health Organization says that a distance of one metre is safe, while other countries suggest 1.5m or 1.8m. But Prof Whitty said the UK's advice would not be changing, adding that staying a metre away was ""somewhere between 10 and 30 times more risky than at two metres"". Meanwhile, a further 377 people have died with coronavirus across all settings in the UK, according to daily figures released on Thursday. The total number of deaths in and outside of hospitals is now 37,837, the Department of Health said.

"This video can not be played ""We cannot let the virus take hold of our lives again"" Coronavirus restrictions in Wales are being tightened following a rise in cases. More than half of the population of Wales are now subject to tighter rules, with the Welsh Government announcing lockdowns for 11 counties and one town. Pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales have now been ordered to shut at 22:00 every night. First Minister Mark Drakeford has also urged people across Wales to only travel if essential. As well as licensed premises closing earlier, off-licences and supermarkets are now not allowed to sell alcohol after 22:00 and hospitality businesses will be required to provide table service only. People must wear face coverings in shops and other indoor public spaces. No more than six people can meet indoors under an extended household, comprised of up to four different households. Butextended households have been suspended in areas under local lockdown. Lockdown began to ease back in June withnon-essential shops reopeningandall children being able to return to school. Travel restrictions were then lifted on 6 Julyand people were allowed toform ""extended households"", with members of one other home. Self-contained accommodation,hairdressersandbeer gardenswere allowed to reopen a week later, and pubs, bars and cafes have since reopened indoors. On 22 August, people were allowed to form an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" with up to four households - double the previous amount allowed. Staff and pupils then returned to school and students started university in September. But a rise in cases sparked fears a second wave of the virus was on its way. What are the current rules and changes, and how do they apply? Social distancing in Llandudno, Conwy At the start of lockdown, strict rules meant people were unable to meet anyone who they did not live with, in a bid to reduce the spread of the virus. But as restrictions were eased and a travel ban was lifted, many of us were able to socialise again. This video can not be played Richard Bluck says he may not be able to hug his daughter until a vaccine is found The number of people able to meet indoors has been capped at six, although under-11s are not included in the six. These six people must be in an extended household - which can be comprised of four households. People in an extended household can have physical contact, exercise, cook and eat together, and also stay in each other's homes, but the people in the extended household cannot be changed once arranged. Up to 30 people are allowed to meet outdoors, including peoples' gardens. The rules on meeting indoors do not apply in areas which have been placed under local lockdown from September. Extended households are currently suspended in these areas. Despite the gradual easing of restrictions over the summer, meetings indoors with anyone outside your extended household have remained illegal. People must observe the 2m rule when meeting friends Groups of up to 30 are able to meet outdoors, so long as they maintain social distancing. You are able to meet in local parks, open spaces and private gardens, though you should not go into someone's home unless they are in your ""extended household"". The Welsh Government has acknowledged people may have to pass through someone's home to reach a private garden, but individuals have been told not to stay inside. Children under 11 do not have to maintain a 2m distance from each other or from adults because of lower rates of transmission in their age group. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading People in Wales were told to wear face coverings in shops and other indoor public spaces from 14 September, following other parts of the UK. Both customers and staff are legally required to wear face coverings in shops, shopping centres, places of worship, hairdressers and salons, cinemas and museums, gyms and leisure centres, and anywhere that is open to members of the public. But you will not be required to wear face coverings inside a public space where you are there to eat or drink, but you will need to wear one in the parts of the premises where people are not eating or drinking Masks will not be mandatory in workplaces or schools and children under 11 will not be required to wear them. Failing to comply could land you with a fine of up to Â£1,920. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? The original ""stay local"" guidance, asking people to stay within five miles of home, ended in July. But in his announcement on restrictions on 22 September, Mr Drakeford urged people to only take essential journeys. In local lockdown areas, people are not allowed to enter or leave the local authority area unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"". Excuses listed in the law include travelling to work if you are not able to work from home, to go to school, or to give care. You can travel to buy food and medical supplies, seek medical assistance or go to the vets, and move home. If you are buying essential items and there is no reasonable alternative to using shops within these counties, you can do so. However, in most cases there are expected to be alternative options, even if this involves travelling a bit further than you would normally. But people are advised tocheck the restrictions,externalwhen it comes to international travel and travel to other parts of the UK, as some areas have local lockdown restrictions, or are on a quarantine list. Service stations are not affected by local lockdowns and can still provide toilet facilities, fuel and food and drink. Pubs, cafes, bars and restaurants were forced to close at the start of lockdown. But beer gardens and outdoor seating have reopened, with some areas, including Cardiff, shutting roads to create alfresco dining space. Since 3 August, people have been able to enjoy a pint, or a soft drink or meal,indoors at their local or favourite restaurant again, after they were allowed to reopen inside. But after the announcement on 22 September, pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales have to shut at 22:00 every night, which is the same time alcohol sales will be stopped in shops and off-licences. This video can not be played The couple were due to celebrate tying the knot in front of 300 guests Couples can host receptions with food for up to 30 people indoors at weddings and civil ceremonies, if social distancing can be maintained and face coverings are worn. Funeral wakes were also be able to be held indoors, under the same rules. There are limits on the type of activity that can take place, according toWelsh Government guidance,external, including a ban on loud music and buffets. People from an area in local lockdown,such as Caerphilly,external, are allowed to attend wedding ceremonies and funerals outside the county, but not wedding receptions or wakes. Weddings and funerals are permitted in Caerphilly county, but people from outside the county must not attend the reception or wake. Most public toilets are managed by local councils and were closed during the height of the pandemic. While many have reopened, some remain closed, and the Welsh Government has said people should consider this when travelling. Rules on face coverings apply in public toilets. Unless you are part of an extended household, the guidance states you must not use someone else's bathroom, or kitchen, if you are visiting them in their garden. More than 120,000 people were told to self-isolate in Wales during the pandemic, meaning for months they were unable to have contact with relatives or go to the shops. But as restrictions were eased, those classed as high-risk, were allowed togo outside to exercise and meet others- at a 2m distance, but were advised not to go into someone else's home or share food with them. This was paused on 16 August, meaning people could see their loved ones again. Currently you are able to go for a walk, run or cycle as often as you want with people from a second household, as long as you are not in large groups and are at least 2m apart. People can also exercise in groups, with up to 30 people being allowed to play sport outside at once. This means exercise classes, team games such as cricket, and sports clubs can meet, but only if they are organised and supervised. Swimming pools, gyms and leisure centres have also been allowed to reopen. People in counties under lockdown can continue to exercise, but not with people from outside the county. Towns popular with tourists such as Tenby suffered from travel restrictions during lockdown You can book a holiday with members of your household or extended household in self-contained accommodation or hotels, B&Bs andcampsites with shared facilitiesin Wales. But you cannot currently go on holiday with anyone that is not part of your household or extended household. People under local lockdown restrictions are not allowed to leave the county, including to go on holiday elsewhere in Wales. This video can not be played Home hairdressing: The basic tips you need Many people were desperate for a cut, colour or to repair the damage done by doing it themselves by the time hairdressers and barbers reopenedon 13 July. But they are now very different places to those you could simply walk into, chat to friends or browse magazines. For a start, there are strict hygiene rules in place, with hairdressers only able to accept booked appointments. The same applies for visitors to tattooists, beauty and tanning salons, which were allowed to open from 27 July. Rules on face coverings apply in these premises. Following the local lockdowns in six areas of Wales, people can only visit such premises within the county area and must wear face coverings. This video can not be played Pupils at Olfcha Comprehensive get used to new systems at school It's back to school in Wales - but not quite as we knew it before. The ""new normal"" in classrooms means working in bubbles and limited contact with pupils outside their group. But parents and teachers have welcomed the staggered return following six months of disruption. Schools initiallywelcomed back pupils in small groupsfor ""check in, catch up and prepare"" sessions on 29 June after being closed for more than three months. Truancy fines will not be issued if pupils do not attendat the start of the school year, but this plan will be reviewed as the term develops. Dozens of schools have reported cases and entire year groups have self-isolated since the start of term, butEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said it was to be expected. Emergency plumbing is allowed if social distancing is maintained and tradesperson and householders are well Repair and maintenance work can be carried out in people's homes, provided the worker is well, has no Covid-19 symptoms andensures a 2m distance is maintained,external. The Welsh Government recommends no work should be carried out in a household which is isolated or where a vulnerable person is being shielded, unless an emergency repair is needed. Llandaff Cathedral is back open for private prayer During lockdown mosques, synagogues and churches were closed in Wales, and there have been limits on the number of people attending funerals and weddings. From 13 July faith leaders were able to gradually resume services, once they felt ready to do so safely. As discussed, places of worship are public spaces where the Welsh Government has said people should wear face coverings. If you are looking to move house, you can view homes for rent or sale in Wales - but you must follow social distancing rules and keep your hands clean. You can also visit estate agents, sales offices or show rooms, but must wear a face covering. Exercising on the beach at Llandudno People were previously told not to travel to second homes in order protect the smaller NHS hospitals in areas where most Welsh boltholes are situated. However, people can now ""travel as far as they like for all purposes"" according to Mr Drakeford, allowing people to visit second homes, providing they are not leaving, or travelling to, an area under local lockdown.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: People in Scotland can meet family and friends from Friday People in Scotland will be able to meet their friends and family outside from Friday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. Ms Sturgeon said people from two different households will be able to meet, but must keep two metres apart. They must also remain outdoors, and in groups of no more than eight. People are still being urged to ""stay at home as much as possible"", with Ms Sturgeon warning that the virus ""is still out there"". The lockdown easing was announced as Ms Sturgeon confirmed the country was ready to introduce the first phase of its four-phase ""route map"" towards reopening society while attempting to suppress the virus. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest developments What can you do in Scotland from Friday? Read the new rules on social distancing,external Coronavirus rates 'similar' across UK Scotland has been in lockdown since 23 March, and did not make major changes to restrictions when they were announced for England earlier this month. Ms Sturgeon said there had now been a ""sustained and unmistakable"" downward trend in the spread of the virus over a number of weeks, meaning changes could now be made. But she warned that ""we have limited room for manoeuvre"" and ""need to get the balance right"". Ms Sturgeon said ""most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume"" from Friday. This will see garden centres opening their doors again and site preparation beginning in the construction industry, with recycling centres re-opening from Monday. Also from Monday, teachers and other staff will be able to return to schools to prepare for re-opening - although most pupils will not return until 11 August, when they will begin a ""blended model"" of education which will see learning split between the classroom and home. Golf course will be able to open to the public from Friday Some outdoor leisure activities where physical distancing can be maintained will be allowed from Friday - including golf, tennis, bowls and fishing. People will be allowed to sit out and sunbathe in parks and open areas, and travel within their local area for exercise - although there is ""strong advice"" not to travel more than five miles for leisure. Ms Sturgeon said she did not want to see large numbers of people heading to beauty spots, warning that ""crowds bring more risk than we judge is acceptable or safe at this point"". Members of two different households will be allowed to meet up so long as they remain outdoors ""in a park or private garden"" and stay 2m (6ft) apart. Ms Sturgeon said the total number of people taking part in any meeting should not exceed eight, and that it was ""strongly recommended that you don't meet with more than one other household per day"". She also warned people not to enter each other's houses or to share picnic or barbecue materials, saying this could create ""a bridge for the virus to spread from one household to another"". She said: ""Please remember that we should still be meeting far fewer people outside your own household than we would in normal times."" The first minister said she was ""a bit nervous"" that limited changes to the rules could ""lead to much greater change in reality"", asking people to ""please, please respect the parameters we are setting out"". She said people should continue to ""stay at home as much as possible"", adding: ""The virus is still out there - lockdown is being modified slightly, but it is not over."" The first minister confirmed the easing of lockdown in Scotland at a podium bearing the words ""stay at home"". She is not switching to ""stay alert"" or some other formulation at this stage. When I asked her if the retained messaging still applied, Nicola Sturgeon insisted staying at home as much as you can remains the starting point. What the new guidance published by the Scottish government does is to expand the range of reasonable reasons why you might leave the house. That inevitably means that as we move into this new phase, ministers are counting on you to follow guidance and exercise good judgement, responsibility, restraint. They hope that works and that new legally enforceable rules are not required. But as the deputy first minister, John Swinney, put it earlier today - the gradual easing of lockdown is not a free for all. The changes do not change the circumstances of those in the ""shielding"" group, those who are most vulnerable to the virus. Ms Sturgeon said she realised this would be ""hard"" for them, and said ministers were trying ""to move to less of a blanket approach"". She said: ""I want you to know today that you have not been forgotten, and you are a central part of our thinking as we consider how we move forward."" The Scottish government has identifiedfour phases for easing the restrictions,external: Phase 1:Virus not yet contained but cases are falling. From 28 May you should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2:Virus controlled. You can meet larger groups outdoors, and meet another household indoors. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops can resume work. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3:Virus suppressed.  You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4:Virus no longer a significant threat. University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. The easing measures were announced as Scotland launched its new nation-wide ""test and protect"" system of tracing and isolating people who may have the virus. Anyone withsymptoms of the virusshould ""take immediate steps"" to book a test through the NHS. If someone tests positive for Covid-19, contact tracers will get in touch with those they have been in close proximity to, advising them to self-isolate for 14 days. Ms Sturgeon said test and protect was a ""crucial part"" of the government's strategy to suppress the virus, but said people should still exercise caution. She said taking precautions like hand washing, the use of face coverings and social distancing ""matters even more"" as rules begin to be relaxed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Lockdown restrictions in Wales are likely to be relaxed next week so people from two different households can meet each other outdoors, BBC Wales understands People in Wales have taken part in what was the tenth - and possibly final - clap for carers event Attendances at Welsh emergency departments remain down on last year, the head of NHS Wales says The scientist running Walesâ largest coronavirus testing laboratory says his team has to âsacrificeâ to tackle the pandemic Fourteen more people have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 1,307, Public Health Wales says It could take five years for the Royal Welsh Show to come to terms with the financial impact of the pandemic, organisers say People in the gig economy are being ""forced into destitution"", a union claims Rachel Flint, James McCarthy and Rhiannon Beacham That's it for our live updates for another day, thanks for joining us. Here are the main points from the day:  Nurses in scrubs stepped out of hospitals to applaud their fellow workers during the fight against coronavirus. Medical staff at the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, took part in the clap for carers tonight. In what could be the final evening of what has become a weekly event, people across Wales took to their doorsteps to thank key workers. In Penarth residents were pictured banging pots, and being joined by their pets as they joined in. A medical worker claps from a house across the road from the Royal Gwent Hospital Residents across Wales grabbed pots and pans to join in A medical worker in scrubs claps for colleagues outside the Newport hospital In Penarth a woman is joined by her dog during the applause Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones said she applauded every key worker, volunteer and person who has obeyed the coronavirus rules. For most of us, lockdown has been a marathon not a sprint and nowhere more so than in one street just outside Prestatyn. Residents in Bryn Llys in Meliden each ran part of the 26.2 miles up and down the street maintaining social distance, to raise cash for the local hospital and care homes. But the woman who helped organise the event said she was desperate to be reunited with loved ones who live elsewhere. Elin Hughes-Jones said: ""The most important thing for me is to see my family. ""I can wait a bit longer to see friends, but family is the main thing for me."" Tomorrow, the Welsh Government is likely to announce an easing of some lockdown restrictions, including being able to meet people from other households, while maintaining social distancing, BBC Wales understands. At Lyon's Lido Beach caravan park, staff are preparing for the eventual reopening but say different advice for England and Wales has complicated things. Managing director Geoff Lyons-Mount said: ""England have gone easier on the opening of things whereas our minister has decided to keep things pretty much tied up, so it's frustrating for us but it's what's good for the area, we've got to look after our residents and the locals."" Thanks were given to ""the key workers who are keeping our society together,"" by Wales Air Ambulance. ""You know who you are, and we salute you,"" the charity said.  Allow Twitter content?

"Thousands of contact tracers are making their first phone calls to track down people who will be told to self-isolate under new test and trace schemes being launched in England and Scotland. Tracers will text, email or call people who test positive with coronavirus and ask who they have had contact with. Any of those contacts deemed at risk of infection will be told to isolate for 14 days, even if they are not sick. Those who have already had the virus will also be asked to self-isolate. The aim of the system is to lift blanket lockdown restrictions and move towards more localised, targeted measures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was confident that the ""vast majority of people"" would participate in the voluntary system. ""In this war on the virus, ultimately we are all on the same side and we've all got a part that we can play,"" he said. The launch came as it was announced that some restrictions are to be easedin ScotlandandNorthern Ireland. How will contact tracing work in England? Scotland's plan for test and trace My new skill as a contact tracer The 25,000 tracers working for England's NHS Test and Trace team started by contacting the 2,013 people who tested positive for the virus on Wednesday. However, shortly after launching, some tracers said they were struggling to access the system. In a statement, the Department of Health insisted it had not crashed, adding: ""Some staff did initially encounter issues logging on to their systems and these are rapidly being resolved."" Trish Mannes, who leads a team of tracing specialists for Public Health England in the South East, told the BBC there had been a ""technical glitch"" but that overall the ""system seems to be working well"". She compared the contact tracing process to ""detective work"", using both ""technical knowledge"" and ""people skills"". ""The things that are important to me are empathy and ability to speak to people and get a rapport - remember we're asking people for a lot of detailed information, it takes time to get that information,"" she said. Share your experiences of being a contact tracer or someone who has been contacted byemailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Two MPs said they were told England's system would not be fully operational ""at local level"" until the end of June. Labour's Ben Bradshaw,externalandLib Dem Daisy Cooper,externalboth tweeted after a call with Baroness Dido Harding, the chairwoman of NHS Test and Trace. Downing Street said the test and trace system would ""improve"" over time but rejected suggestions the scheme had been launched early. But Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said hospital trust leaders were questioning the risk being run by easing the lockdown without having local systems in place. He also said it was ""never going to be the case"" that the UK would have a ""world-class"" test and trace system in place by June - in reference toa previous pledgemade by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Hopson said while work was progressing ""at pace"", the UK was ""weeks behind where we really ought to be"". An app to automatically alert people they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight but the government hopes to have that system up-and-running in England ""in the coming weeks"". The launch of Scotland's new Test and Protect system comes as First Minister Nicola Sturgeonannounced people from two different households will be able to meet outdoors from Friday. Northern Irelandhas its own version of the test and trace programme already. Wales' schemeis due to start in early June. Meanwhile, a further 377 people have died with coronavirus across all settings in the UK,daily figures released on Thursday showed,external. The total number of deaths in and outside of hospitals is now 37,837, the Department of Health said. Anyone who develops symptoms of coronavirus - a persistent cough, fever or a sudden loss of taste or sense of smell - has to isolate for seven days and the rest of their household for 14 days. This is in keeping with rules already in place. But from now on, everyone with symptoms shouldask for a test online,externalor phone to arrange a test by calling 119. If the test comes back negative, everyone in the household can go back to normal. But if the test comes back positive, the contact tracing team or local public health teams will get in touch - via text, email or phone call - to discuss whom the person has come into close contact with and places they have visited. Any of those contacts deemed at risk of catching the virus will be emailed or texted with instructions to go into isolation for 14 days, whether they are sick or not. They will be tested only if they develop symptoms. The rest of their household does not have to isolate, unless someone becomes ill. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Every single person can get a test"" Mr Hancock said people would have to self-isolate on more than one occasion if told to do so by the NHS. Those who have already had the virus must also self-isolate, as it is not known whether they can still transmit it. Only people who have been ""close"" to an infected person will be contacted by tracers. Close contacts are: people you spend 15 minutes or more with at a distance of less than 2m people you have direct contact with - such as sexual partners, household members or people with whom you have had face-to-face conversations at a distance of less than 1m The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in the daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday that it is the public's ""civic duty"" to follow the instructions of the NHS Test and Trace team. ""This will be voluntary at first because we trust everyone to do the right thing. But we can quickly make it mandatory if that's what it takes,"" he added. Scientists,including those advising the government, have warned that it will be harder to get public support for such measures in the wake ofthe row over the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. Mr Cummings was accused of breaking lockdown rules after driving 260 miles from London to County Durham because, he said, he was concerned about childcare for his son when his wife became ill. Those instructed to self-isolate will be eligible for statutory sick pay - Â£95.85 per week - but there are fears that many workers will not be able to live on that amount and will be forced to keep working. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to introduce ""enhanced"" sick pay, saying: ""There will be people whose work conditions and employment conditions make [self-isolating] difficult for them so they need that security."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called on the governmentto extend sick pay to everyone and raise it to the ""real living wage"" - Â£260 per week. She said the entire test and trace system would be ""undermined"" if workers were ""pushed into hardship"" when they were required to self-isolate. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The success of the scheme will depend on how quickly contacts can be found and whether members of the public follow instructions, a report published by the Royal Society said. It concluded that between 5% and 15% of infections could be prevented. But the 15% figure depends on finding contacts within three days and 80% of people reporting their symptoms or going into isolation when asked. By comparison, isolating cases and quarantining members of their household is thought to cut infections by 50%. Prof Anne Johnson, one of the report's authors, said the system ""is an important part in bringing the pandemic under control, but we're very clear it is not a magic bullet"". The national coordinator of NHS Test and Trace said the system requires rapid testing in order to be successful. However, after the prime minister said on Wednesday there was now a target to get test results in less than 24 hours, Prof John Newton added it would be ""very difficult"" to get home testing kit results in less than 48 hours. At the moment coronavirus is being suppressed by lockdown restrictions applied across the whole of society. Baroness Harding said the scheme was designed to allow national lockdown restrictions to be ""traded"" with individual isolation - allowing ""the vast majority to get on with their lives in a much more normal way"". Test and trace will also give far more detail on how and where the virus is spreading. Mr Hancock said this information could lead tolocal lockdowns to tackle flare-ups. Baroness Harding said data from anNHS contact tracing app being piloted on the Isle of Wight- which is not yet ready to be rolled out more widely - suggests people have been within 2m of fewer than five others for more than 15 minutes.

"Lockdown restrictions in Wales are likely to be relaxed next week so people from two different households can meet each other outdoors, BBC Wales understands People in Wales have taken part in what was the tenth - and possibly final - clap for carers event Attendances at Welsh emergency departments remain down on last year, the head of NHS Wales says The scientist running Walesâ largest coronavirus testing laboratory says his team has to âsacrificeâ to tackle the pandemic Fourteen more people have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 1,307, Public Health Wales says It could take five years for the Royal Welsh Show to come to terms with the financial impact of the pandemic, organisers say People in the gig economy are being ""forced into destitution"", a union claims Rachel Flint, James McCarthy and Rhiannon Beacham That's it for our live updates for another day, thanks for joining us. Here are the main points from the day:  Nurses in scrubs stepped out of hospitals to applaud their fellow workers during the fight against coronavirus. Medical staff at the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, took part in the clap for carers tonight. In what could be the final evening of what has become a weekly event, people across Wales took to their doorsteps to thank key workers. In Penarth residents were pictured banging pots, and being joined by their pets as they joined in. A medical worker claps from a house across the road from the Royal Gwent Hospital Residents across Wales grabbed pots and pans to join in A medical worker in scrubs claps for colleagues outside the Newport hospital In Penarth a woman is joined by her dog during the applause Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones said she applauded every key worker, volunteer and person who has obeyed the coronavirus rules. For most of us, lockdown has been a marathon not a sprint and nowhere more so than in one street just outside Prestatyn. Residents in Bryn Llys in Meliden each ran part of the 26.2 miles up and down the street maintaining social distance, to raise cash for the local hospital and care homes. But the woman who helped organise the event said she was desperate to be reunited with loved ones who live elsewhere. Elin Hughes-Jones said: ""The most important thing for me is to see my family. ""I can wait a bit longer to see friends, but family is the main thing for me."" Tomorrow, the Welsh Government is likely to announce an easing of some lockdown restrictions, including being able to meet people from other households, while maintaining social distancing, BBC Wales understands. At Lyon's Lido Beach caravan park, staff are preparing for the eventual reopening but say different advice for England and Wales has complicated things. Managing director Geoff Lyons-Mount said: ""England have gone easier on the opening of things whereas our minister has decided to keep things pretty much tied up, so it's frustrating for us but it's what's good for the area, we've got to look after our residents and the locals."" Thanks were given to ""the key workers who are keeping our society together,"" by Wales Air Ambulance. ""You know who you are, and we salute you,"" the charity said.  Allow Twitter content?

"A mother has called on Boris Johnson to provide support for those migrants who have been financially hit by coronavirus, but cannot claim benefits. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, the woman said her family had lost more than 60% of their income but could not get support due to immigration rules. Despite paying taxes for almost 17 years, she said her family were now unable to ""fulfil our basic needs"". When questioned on the rules, the PM promised to see what the he could do. Support migrants who can't claim benefits, say MPs Single parents challenge welfare rules 'Worst economic crisis since 1930s depression' The family's case was raised by Labour MP Stephen Timms during the PM's appearance at the Liaison Committee on Wednesday. He explained the family had leave to remain, but said the husband had not been put on the job retention scheme and, although the wife was still working, her income was less than household rent - adding that they had no recourse to public funds. ""Isn't it wrong that a hard-working, law-abiding family like that is being forced by the current arrangements into destitution,"" he asked. Mr Johnson initially appeared surprised that the couple could not claim Universal Credit and replied:  ""Clearly people who have worked hard for this country should have support of one kind or another."" He added: ""I will find out how many [people] there are in that position and we will see what we can do."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson questioned on support for migrants hit by the virus Speaking to the BBC, the mother of the family - who wanted to remain anonymous - said she and her husband were ""shocked when we heard the prime minister was unaware of the current situation of families"". She added: ""For almost 17 years, we have been paying our taxes and contributing to economy without claiming a single benefit. Both my children were born here, both are British nationals, yet they are not entitled to any benefits due to our legal status. ""If the condition continues, we won't be able to pay rent, we won't be able to pay the bills. We have young children and I know so many other families are struggling with the same condition. ""I really, really would like for the prime minister to remove NRPF [no recourse to public funds] conditions."" NRPF status is given to some migrants as a condition of their leave to remain in the UK, and prevents them from receiving most government funded benefits. Mr Timms - who is chair of the Work and Pensions Committee -has written to the prime minister,externalasking him how many people in the UK have no recourse to public funds, how many children are affected and what support the government will offer to those in difficulty. The Children's Society charity, which has been campaigning on the issue, estimated more than 100,000 children could be affected by the rules. A government spokesperson said: ""We have been clear that no one should find themselves destitute during this crisis due to circumstances beyond their control. ""We have taken action across the system to support those with no recourse to public funds, including protections from eviction for renters and mortgage holidays, as well as support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, Self Employed Income Support Scheme and those on zero-hours contracts. ""People granted leave under the family and human rights routes can also apply to have the conditions lifted if their financial circumstances have changed.""

We're wrapping up our rolling coverage until tomorrow, but in you can still get updates throughout the BBC News website. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the day's top stories.  Today's coverage was brought to you by our reporters in Singapore, the UK, and Washington DC: Saira Asher, Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Andreas Illmer, Sean Fanning, Hugo Bachega, George Wright, Hamish Mackay, Becky Morton, Deirdre Finnerty, Rob Greenall, Saj Chowdhury, Neil Johnston, Michael Emons, Josh Cheetham and Max Matza. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Moscowâs health department has doubled the official count of Covid-19 deaths in April to over 1500. It says this new tally comes after post mortem examinations confirmed coronavirus in dozens of cases where a Covid test had initially been negative, and in hundreds of cases where an autopsy determined that the virus was a significant factor in causing death, even when a patient had other illnesses. This new methodology is being recommended to Russiaâs regions and is likely to mean the death tally increases across the country, although Moscow was the epicentre of the epidemic for many weeks. A few weeks ago, when reporters here suggested the official numbers were too low after seeing excess mortality figures, they were accused of fake news and distortion. Moscowâs health department is stressing that even the new count puts the Covid-19 mortality rate for the city under 3% - suggesting thatâs well below comparable cities. But it also concedes that the figures for May will be higher. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has revealed how his son violated a government dusk-to-dawn curfew order issued to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He said one of his two sons, whom he did not identify, recently went out to party at night in the coastal city of Mombasa - an epicentre of infections in the country. Social gatherings are prohibited in the East African country. The government has also restricted movement in and out of the capital, Nairobi, and three other coastal counties, including Mombasa, where the first family and the president's mother are currently living. Kenyatta said he gave his son a dressing down for risking the life of his grandmother Ngina Kenyatta. ""You've had your fun and enjoyed yourself, but now you've come back and you're with your grandmother, your grandmother is 80 plus,"" the president said. ""If something happens to your grandmother as a result of what you have done - how will you live with yourself?"" In an interview, the president said no-one was immune to coronavirus containment measures, although he has been criticised for not taking his son to a quarantine centre like other Kenyans who violate the curfew.

Martin Scorsese has spoken about how ""anxiety"" set in during lockdown, after an initial ""relief"" that his heavy 2020 workload had been temporarily lifted. The director has shot a new home-made short film about his experiences of isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic. It premiered on Thursday's edition ofLockdown Culture on BBC Two. Scorsese, who was nominated for an Oscar for The Irishman earlier this year, said he ""didn't realise that the lockdown was going to be so intense"". Read more here. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that he will sign an executive order to allow private store owners to refuse service to customers not wearing a mask. The move marks a significant ramping up of anti-virus measures in the state, which continues to report the highest number of cases and deaths in America. Until now, masks have only been legally required in situations where people cannot maintain a six-foot (1.8 metre) distance from each other. He announced the move at a press conference today, where he was joined by comedian Chris Rock and actress Rosie Perez. Mr Cuomo joked that he had brought the pair as ""reinforcements"" because he wasn't ""cool enough"" to make people heed his advice over masks and coronavirus testing. âThe numbers in our community are staggering,"" said Ms Perez, in a message partially delivered in Spanish. ""This is not a joke, this is not a hoax. This is real.â Chris Rock added that, based on what he'd observed in New York City, âthe kids really arenât wearing the masks. âIâm just hoping to help. I have complete trust in the governor. Weâre soldiers for New York,"" said Mr Rock. Governor Greg Abbott has announced that, from Friday, sports fans will be able to attend outdoor professional sports events in most Texas counties. In a proclamation, Abbott said that venues would have to be capped to 25% capacity, and received approval from the Texas Department of State Health Services. But fans will still be banned from attending indoor sporting events, and the rules do not address college and high school sports. It comes as Texas - America's second-most populous state - rolls out a series of measures to reopen its economy. More than 59,000 confirmed cases have been reported there, making it one of the worst-affected states in the country. Martin PatienceMiddle East correspondent For the past two months, Khaldoon Rifaa has not been able to work as a driver because of Lebanon's lockdown. He is now back on the road, operating a minivan along the coastal motorway from his home city of Tripoli to the capital, Beirut. But standing on the street, he is struggling to find any paying customers to fill up his vehicle. ""Before my life was good,"" says the father-of-five. ""I'd work and I could feed my children."" ""But now, there's no work - there's nothing. I don't even have the money to buy washing powder."" Like many others in Lebanon, he has suddenly been plunged into poverty in a country that has hit breaking point. Some are warning thatthe scale of the catastrophe may be more devastating than the 15-year civil war,external, which raged from 1975 to 1990. Even before coronavirus hit, Lebanon was experiencing the worst economic crisis in the country's history, which triggered large anti-government protests late last year. Read more here. Lebanon has been rocked by anti-government protests for months Doctors protest outside an Ice jail in Florida on 1 May A lawyer for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has admitted in court that the agency is not testing prisoners for Covid-19 before transferring them to other jails unless they are showing symptoms of the illness. ""If the individual is actively ill, if the individual has tested positive or showing symptoms, they are not cleared for travel and they will not be transferred until those issues are resolved,â said assistant US Attorney Dexter Lee in a video court hearing,the Miami Herald reported,external. ""The problem is that there are individuals who are asymptomatic and they may be positive for coronavirus,â he added. The ongoing case is over a Florida judge's order that Ice reduce its local prison population to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Immigration advocates argue that Ice found a ""loophole"" by transferring them to jails in other states. Several recent outbreaks at Ice detention centres have been traced to recent transfers, according to US media. According to their website, Ice currently has 25,911 migrant detainees. The website adds that around half of the 2,620 inmates who have been tested were found to be positive.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson laid out details of a plan to begin an easing of lockdown restrictions in England from next week. We've made a chart detailing what the government is proposing over the next few weeks. Mr Johnson said that, despite the slight relaxation of rules on meeting people outside, those in England deemed most vulnerable to Covid-19 should continue to shield themselves for now.  Clap for Carers founder Annemarie Plas joined the tenth - and perhaps final - applause in south London In Glasgow, they played Dancing in the Streets as they applauded A Salvation Army Centre delivering food parcels also joined the applause Some people gathered outside the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital to applaud People all over the country are stepping out into their gardens, onto their balconies or just leaning out of a window to applaud NHS workers, care home staff and other key workers for their efforts during the pandemic. It may be the last time the nation takes part in the weekly ritual after founder Annemarie Plas saidthe 10th week of clapping would be a good time for it to end. As it approaches 20:00 BST, people in the United Kingdom prepare to Clap for Carers, as has happened every Thursday during the lockdown. The campaign originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown. However, after proving very popular, it was expanded to cover all key workers and has continued at the same time every Thursday.  At a White House briefing on Thursday, spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany defended states' decisions to reopen, saying ""everything does not depend on a vaccine"". ""There's therapeutics,"" she added. She also defended President Donald Trump's tweet commemorating the 100,000 US death toll, which went out the day after the number was passed, and said she had not discussed with Trump the idea of making a vaccine mandatory once it becomes available. McEnany said flags being lowered to half-mast on federal buildings during the previous Memorial Day weekend was an acknowledgment of the growing death toll. She also slammed the perceived liberal bias of US tech companies, after Twitter issued a fact-check label on two of Trump's tweets. She specifically accused Google of allowing China ""to spread misinformation about the coronavirus"".Trump is expected to sign an executive order targeting tech companies later today.

Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""protect them"" from ""an unnecessary attempt to ask a political question"". After several reporters had asked similar questions, both men said they had no wish to get involved in politics. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News About 7% of people in England have previously been infected with coronavirus, antibody tests on a random sample of households suggest. The new data was released bythe Office for National Statistics study,externaland is based on blood samples taken from 885 people from private households after 26 April. The study estimates that about one in 15 people in England have had the virus. These tests detect antibodies which form in the blood when the body fights infections such as Covid-19. The same survey also found that an estimated 133,000 people are currently infected with the virus - 0.24% of the population. Read more: About 7% have had coronavirus, says ONS survey Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Up to six people can meet up outside from Monday Groups of up to six people from different households will be able to meet outside in England from Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced. They can meet in gardens - in addition to parks - as long as households keep two metres apart. ""These changes mean friends and family will start to meet loved ones,"" in what would be a ""long awaited and joyful moment,"" he added. The PM said it was possible because thegovernment's five testswere being met. Currently, people in England can only meet one other person from another household at a distance in a public place. Speaking at Thursday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson told people they should ""try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession"" to help ""avoid the risk of transmission from lots of different families"". It means people will be able to see ""both parents at once, or both grandparents at once,"" Mr Johnson said. Barbecues will be allowed, the prime minister confirmed, providing people are ""scrupulous"" about washing their hands, maintaining good hygiene and social distancing. He also insisted that the government does not want people to stay overnight at other households. ""I'm afraid we're not at that stage,"" Mr Johnson said. Explained: What the new rules mean What am I allowed to do now? What are the five tests for easing lockdown? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party supports the gradual easing of some lockdown restrictions if it is safe. In Scotland, people from two different householdscan meet outdoors at a distance from Friday- but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said guests should not enter other people's homes, for instance to use the toilet. In Wales, people from two different householdswill be able to meet outside from Monday. And in Northern Ireland, outdoor weddings with 10 people presentmay be allowed from 8 June. It will now be possible to have barbecues with friends and family in England, provided social distancing guidelines are followed Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told the briefing it was ""essential"" that people continue to social distance and wash their hands. ""If someone was to go into the loo because they had to do that, it's absolutely critical that they wipe everything down, wash their hands all the way through"", he said. ""If you were to do something like a barbecue, remember that passing things from one person to another, if you haven't washed your hands, you can pass the virus that way."" Mr Johnson said that, despite the slight relaxation of rules on meeting people outside, those in England deemed most vulnerable to Covid-19 should continue to shield themselves for now. He told those who are shielding that ministers were ""looking carefully at how we can make your life easier"" and hope to ""say more on that soon"". The prime minister warned ""there will be further local outbreaks"" and said the government would reintroduce measures where required, but pledged people who lose income as a result of local lockdowns ""will be helped"". Speaking after the briefing, Labour leader Sir Keir said: ""We support the gradual easing of restrictions on lockdown, it's got to be safe and we need clear guidance from public health and we also need to see the scientific evidence actually published.

The PM warned the country should make only ""limited and cautious"" progress out of lockdown, which has been in place since 23 March. The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, echoed Mr Johnson's message of caution. Sir Patrick said the rate of infection was ""close to one"" - the rate at which the number of new cases can rise rapidly - and that ""we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate"". ""That means there is not a lot of room to do things and things need to be done cautiously, step-by-step and monitored and the test and trace system needs to be effective in order to manage that,"" he said. His warning came as anew study by the Office for National Statisticssuggested one in 15 people in England (about 7%) have already had the virus. After Easter, the government set out five conditions for easing lockdown measures safely. The prime minister has said that - as of 28 May - these are being met sufficiently to slightly ease restrictions in England. 1. Making sure the NHS can cope- Mr Johnson said this test was met because there were only 475 hospital admissions in England on 26 May 2. A 'sustained and consistent' fall in the daily death rate- deaths have been falling since the middle of April, with 377 reported on Thursday, meeting this test, he said 3. Rate of infection decreasing to 'manageable levels'- with an average of 2,312 new cases being confirmed in the last seven days, Mr Johnson said this test was met 4. Ensuring supply of tests and PPE can meet future demand- test capacity was at 161,214 a day and new contracts for protective equipment had been signed, the prime minister said 5. Being confident any changes would not risk a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS- Mr Johnson said the adjustments were ""carefully designed"" to keep theR number(the average number of people each infected person passes the disease to) below one In a separate move on Thursday, the governmenttold dental practices in England they can reopenfrom Monday, if they put in place appropriate safety measures. Nurseries and schools - for Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 classes - in Englandwill also be able to reopen from next week. Outdoor markets and car showrooms will also be able to reopen from Monday. They will be followed by non-essential retailers from 15 June if the five tests continue to be met, the PM said. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson told MPs that he hoped to reduce the length of the two metre social distancing measures ""as we make progress in getting the virus down"". The World Health Organization says that a distance of one metre is safe, while other countries suggest 1.5m or 1.8m. But Prof Whitty said the UK's advice would not be changing, adding that staying a metre away was ""somewhere between 10 and 30 times more risky than at two metres"". Meanwhile, a further 377 people have died with coronavirus across all settings in the UK, according to daily figures released on Thursday.

"This video can not be played You can now meet up outside with people from another local household, but must keep your distance Coronavirus restrictions in Wales are likely to be relaxed next week so people from two different households can meet each other outdoors, BBC Wales understands. They will need to stay in their local area and remain two metres apart. The changes will not come into force until Monday. Other parts of the UK have loosened restrictions on meeting others. Further details are expected from First Minister Mark Drakeford on Friday. What do Wales' lockdown rules mean? Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown? Households are expected to be able to meet in gardens, as well as away from their homes. It has been illegal for groups of more than two people to meet since lockdown began in March. In a Twitter video, Mr Drakeford thanked people for their ""ongoing help and support and for all the sacrifices you have made"". ""I know being separated from family and friends is difficult,"" he added. People can leave the home to exercise, including cycling Since late March people have been told to stay home except for work, exercise and shopping for essentials. Wales' exercise restrictions are more stringent than England's - people have been told to stay local and not to drive. Most non-essential retail has been forced to close, alongside pubs and restaurants. Exceptions include supermarkets, garden centres and pharmacies. Schools are closed, but some are instead providing childcare for the children of key workers. Different parts of the UK have different rules for lockdown England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all have their own lockdown rules. In England they are set by the UK government, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In the other three countries they are set by their different governments. Groups of six people will be able tomeet outside in England from Monday. In Scotland people will be able to meet their friends and family outsidefrom this Friday. The country's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said people from two different households will be able to meet, but must keep two metres apart. They must also remain outdoors, and in groups of no more than eight. In Northern Ireland groups of six people who do not share a householdcan meet outdoors. The first minister has been dropping big hints for some time that his priority in lifting restrictions is to allow people to see friends and family if it can be done safely. My understanding is the approach will continue to be cautious, with people likely to remain confined to their local area. The strategy seems to be to make a small change and then keep an eye on the reproduction rate of the virus - the R number. That means the rules in Wales may continue to differ from those in other nations of the UK, but Mark Drakeford believes that most Welsh voters support his cautious approach. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said that the R number - the rate that coronavirus is spreading - is the biggest factor in determining when lockdown measures can be eased. If the R number is R2, it means a sick person is likely to transmit the virus to two other people. The latest Welsh Government analysis suggests Wales' R rate remains between 0.7 and 1, ""but still below 1"". Officials want it to remain below one. It is believed that an R of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if R reaches 1.1. The Welsh Government has not set dates for when measures in Wales could be lifted, unlike England. Current plans envisagea traffic light-style system of red, amber and green phases,external, with more restrictions lifted as they progress. This video can not be played The First Minister says that the easing of lockdown has looked at how to meet friends and family again. Former Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies tweeted it was ""great news for those with family and friends nearby"". But he asked what it meant for those who do not, ""particularly in rural communities"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""The people of Wales have generally adhered well to lockdown restrictions, and understand the need to take a cautious approach."" But he said the public would benefit from having a ""clearer plan of how restrictions will be managed"". Darren Millar, Welsh Conservative spokesman for Covid Recovery, said the longer the lockdown continued, ""the more difficult it will be for our economy to recover, the more jobs will be lost, and the more harm will be done to the education of our young people"". ""With infection rates falling and pressures on the NHS easing, it's now essential that the Welsh Government begins to safely and sensibly lift restrictions so that families can be reunited, our economy can begin to bounce back, and our young people can get the education they deserve,"" he added. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Drakeford and Boris Johnson, together with the first ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland, spoke on the phone. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister ""remains determined to work closely with the devolved administrations"". Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown?

"A mother has called on Boris Johnson to provide support for those migrants who have been financially hit by coronavirus, but cannot claim benefits. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, the woman said her family had lost more than 60% of their income but could not get support due to immigration rules. Despite paying taxes for almost 17 years, she said her family were now unable to ""fulfil our basic needs"". When questioned on the rules, the PM promised to see what the he could do. Support migrants who can't claim benefits, say MPs Single parents challenge welfare rules 'Worst economic crisis since 1930s depression' The family's case was raised by Labour MP Stephen Timms during the PM's appearance at the Liaison Committee on Wednesday. He explained the family had leave to remain, but said the husband had not been put on the job retention scheme and, although the wife was still working, her income was less than household rent - adding that they had no recourse to public funds. ""Isn't it wrong that a hard-working, law-abiding family like that is being forced by the current arrangements into destitution,"" he asked. Mr Johnson initially appeared surprised that the couple could not claim Universal Credit and replied:  ""Clearly people who have worked hard for this country should have support of one kind or another."" He added: ""I will find out how many [people] there are in that position and we will see what we can do."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson questioned on support for migrants hit by the virus Speaking to the BBC, the mother of the family - who wanted to remain anonymous - said she and her husband were ""shocked when we heard the prime minister was unaware of the current situation of families"". She added: ""For almost 17 years, we have been paying our taxes and contributing to economy without claiming a single benefit. Both my children were born here, both are British nationals, yet they are not entitled to any benefits due to our legal status. ""If the condition continues, we won't be able to pay rent, we won't be able to pay the bills. We have young children and I know so many other families are struggling with the same condition. ""I really, really would like for the prime minister to remove NRPF [no recourse to public funds] conditions."" NRPF status is given to some migrants as a condition of their leave to remain in the UK, and prevents them from receiving most government funded benefits. Mr Timms - who is chair of the Work and Pensions Committee -has written to the prime minister,externalasking him how many people in the UK have no recourse to public funds, how many children are affected and what support the government will offer to those in difficulty. The Children's Society charity, which has been campaigning on the issue, estimated more than 100,000 children could be affected by the rules. A government spokesperson said: ""We have been clear that no one should find themselves destitute during this crisis due to circumstances beyond their control. ""We have taken action across the system to support those with no recourse to public funds, including protections from eviction for renters and mortgage holidays, as well as support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, Self Employed Income Support Scheme and those on zero-hours contracts. ""People granted leave under the family and human rights routes can also apply to have the conditions lifted if their financial circumstances have changed.""

Groups of six people will be able tomeet outside in England from Monday. In Scotland people will be able to meet their friends and family outsidefrom this Friday. The country's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said people from two different households will be able to meet, but must keep two metres apart. They must also remain outdoors, and in groups of no more than eight. In Northern Ireland groups of six people who do not share a householdcan meet outdoors. The first minister has been dropping big hints for some time that his priority in lifting restrictions is to allow people to see friends and family if it can be done safely. My understanding is the approach will continue to be cautious, with people likely to remain confined to their local area. The strategy seems to be to make a small change and then keep an eye on the reproduction rate of the virus - the R number. That means the rules in Wales may continue to differ from those in other nations of the UK, but Mark Drakeford believes that most Welsh voters support his cautious approach. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said that the R number - the rate that coronavirus is spreading - is the biggest factor in determining when lockdown measures can be eased. If the R number is R2, it means a sick person is likely to transmit the virus to two other people. The latest Welsh Government analysis suggests Wales' R rate remains between 0.7 and 1, ""but still below 1"". Officials want it to remain below one. It is believed that an R of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if R reaches 1.1. The Welsh Government has not set dates for when measures in Wales could be lifted, unlike England. Current plans envisagea traffic light-style system of red, amber and green phases,external, with more restrictions lifted as they progress. This video can not be played The First Minister says that the easing of lockdown has looked at how to meet friends and family again. Former Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies tweeted it was ""great news for those with family and friends nearby"". But he asked what it meant for those who do not, ""particularly in rural communities"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""The people of Wales have generally adhered well to lockdown restrictions, and understand the need to take a cautious approach."" But he said the public would benefit from having a ""clearer plan of how restrictions will be managed"". Darren Millar, Welsh Conservative spokesman for Covid Recovery, said the longer the lockdown continued, ""the more difficult it will be for our economy to recover, the more jobs will be lost, and the more harm will be done to the education of our young people"". ""With infection rates falling and pressures on the NHS easing, it's now essential that the Welsh Government begins to safely and sensibly lift restrictions so that families can be reunited, our economy can begin to bounce back, and our young people can get the education they deserve,"" he added. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Drakeford and Boris Johnson, together with the first ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland, spoke on the phone. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister ""remains determined to work closely with the devolved administrations"". Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown?

"After almost 10 weeks of lockdown, some restrictions are due to be eased. Families and friends will be able to reunite (outdoors and at a distance), people will be able to play some sports and visit garden centres, and councils are due to reopen their recycling centres. But with Nicola Sturgeon still urging people to ""stay at home"" as much as possible to contain the spread of the virus, life will remain far from normal. So what exactly can people in Scotland do from Friday? Socially-distances trips to the beach could be on the cards this weekend Expect a lot of socially-distanced picnics and barbecues this weekend. From Friday, one household can meet up with another household - as long as they are outside in areas like a park or a private garden. Despite weeks apart, they must resist the urge to hug each other as each family must remain two metres (6ft) from each other. Hand-washing and hygiene should also be a priority and people should avoid touching hard surfaces like gates, walls, fences and park benches. In total, the group meeting up should be no larger than eight - so two families-of-four can meet in the park but two households of five cannot. Read the Scottish government guidelines,external They are being asked to limit their meetings to one household per day, not meeting several families on the same day. And if they are planning to share a barbecue, each household should bring their own food, cutlery and crockery. People will also need to think about the distance they are travelling to meet family and friends. The guidance says we should not go inside other people's homes - so if your destination is so far away that you will need to use someone else's bathroom, you should not go. The first minister has asked people to avoid crowded places With a warm weekend forecast, the first minister has given the green light to more outdoor recreation. From Friday, people will be allowed to sunbathe and sit in parks and open areas. They will be permitted to travel locally - by walking or cycling - for recreation, but the government's ""strong advice"" is that they should not go any further than five miles. Ms Sturgeon said she did not want large numbers of people at tourist hotspots or local beauty spots. ""If you go somewhere and find it crowded, change your plans, use your judgement and go somewhere else,"" she said. However, people will also be able to get back toplaying on golf courses, as restrictions are lifted on non-contact sports. Other sports which will be allowed include: angling archery athletics - running/jogging croquet cycling horse-riding lawn bowls outdoor tennis walking water sports The Scottish government says it is not an exhaustive list but people must use their own judgement and maintain physical distancing. One-on-one personal training and coaching is also permitted if it is outside and they can keep apart. Businesses like pubs, cinemas, theatres, hairdressers and clothing stores must remain closed during phase one of the lockdown easing. However, garden centres and plant nurseries will be able to open their doors from Friday, as long as they have distancing measures in place. The construction industry will be able to start preparing their sites for reopening in the future. Beechgrove host welcomes garden centre reopening And the government said it would no longer be discouraging drive-through food outlets from re-opening. Businesses which are not obliged by law to remain closed must ensure their employees can remain two metres from each other.

"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days.

You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external.

"This video can not be played Up to six people can meet up outside from Monday Groups of up to six people from different households will be able to meet outside in England from Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced. They can meet in gardens - in addition to parks - as long as households keep two metres apart. ""These changes mean friends and family will start to meet loved ones,"" in what would be a ""long awaited and joyful moment,"" he added. The PM said it was possible because thegovernment's five testswere being met. Currently, people in England can only meet one other person from another household at a distance in a public place. Speaking at Thursday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson told people they should ""try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession"" to help ""avoid the risk of transmission from lots of different families"". It means people will be able to see ""both parents at once, or both grandparents at once,"" Mr Johnson said. Barbecues will be allowed, the prime minister confirmed, providing people are ""scrupulous"" about washing their hands, maintaining good hygiene and social distancing. He also insisted that the government does not want people to stay overnight at other households. ""I'm afraid we're not at that stage,"" Mr Johnson said. Explained: What the new rules mean What am I allowed to do now? What are the five tests for easing lockdown? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party supports the gradual easing of some lockdown restrictions if it is safe. In Scotland, people from two different householdscan meet outdoors at a distance from Friday- but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said guests should not enter other people's homes, for instance to use the toilet. In Wales, people from two different householdswill be able to meet outside from Monday. And in Northern Ireland, outdoor weddings with 10 people presentmay be allowed from 8 June. It will now be possible to have barbecues with friends and family in England, provided social distancing guidelines are followed Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told the briefing it was ""essential"" that people continue to social distance and wash their hands. ""If someone was to go into the loo because they had to do that, it's absolutely critical that they wipe everything down, wash their hands all the way through"", he said. ""If you were to do something like a barbecue, remember that passing things from one person to another, if you haven't washed your hands, you can pass the virus that way."" Mr Johnson said that, despite the slight relaxation of rules on meeting people outside, those in England deemed most vulnerable to Covid-19 should continue to shield themselves for now. He told those who are shielding that ministers were ""looking carefully at how we can make your life easier"" and hope to ""say more on that soon"". The prime minister warned ""there will be further local outbreaks"" and said the government would reintroduce measures where required, but pledged people who lose income as a result of local lockdowns ""will be helped"". Speaking after the briefing, Labour leader Sir Keir said: ""We support the gradual easing of restrictions on lockdown, it's got to be safe and we need clear guidance from public health and we also need to see the scientific evidence actually published. ""We also need a clear test and trace, effective, clear test and trace monitor operation in place."" SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The PM warned the country should make only ""limited and cautious"" progress out of lockdown, which has been in place since 23 March. The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, echoed Mr Johnson's message of caution. Sir Patrick said the rate of infection was ""close to one"" - the rate at which the number of new cases can rise rapidly - and that ""we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate"". ""That means there is not a lot of room to do things and things need to be done cautiously, step-by-step and monitored and the test and trace system needs to be effective in order to manage that,"" he said. His warning came as anew study by the Office for National Statisticssuggested one in 15 people in England (about 7%) have already had the virus. After Easter, the government set out five conditions for easing lockdown measures safely. The prime minister has said that - as of 28 May - these are being met sufficiently to slightly ease restrictions in England. 1. Making sure the NHS can cope- Mr Johnson said this test was met because there were only 475 hospital admissions in England on 26 May 2. A 'sustained and consistent' fall in the daily death rate- deaths have been falling since the middle of April, with 377 reported on Thursday, meeting this test, he said 3. Rate of infection decreasing to 'manageable levels'- with an average of 2,312 new cases being confirmed in the last seven days, Mr Johnson said this test was met 4. Ensuring supply of tests and PPE can meet future demand- test capacity was at 161,214 a day and new contracts for protective equipment had been signed, the prime minister said 5. Being confident any changes would not risk a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS- Mr Johnson said the adjustments were ""carefully designed"" to keep theR number(the average number of people each infected person passes the disease to) below one In a separate move on Thursday, the governmenttold dental practices in England they can reopenfrom Monday, if they put in place appropriate safety measures. Nurseries and schools - for Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 classes - in Englandwill also be able to reopen from next week. Outdoor markets and car showrooms will also be able to reopen from Monday. They will be followed by non-essential retailers from 15 June if the five tests continue to be met, the PM said. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson told MPs that he hoped to reduce the length of the two metre social distancing measures ""as we make progress in getting the virus down"". The World Health Organization says that a distance of one metre is safe, while other countries suggest 1.5m or 1.8m. But Prof Whitty said the UK's advice would not be changing, adding that staying a metre away was ""somewhere between 10 and 30 times more risky than at two metres"". Meanwhile, a further 377 people have died with coronavirus across all settings in the UK, according to daily figures released on Thursday. The total number of deaths in and outside of hospitals is now 37,837, the Department of Health said. In other developments: The PM's top aide Dominic Cummingsmight have broken lockdown rules, but it would have been a ""minor breach"", Durham Police have said New test and trace schemeshave begun in England and Scotland The Premier League is setto restart on 17 Junewith Aston Villa v Sheffield United and Manchester City v Arsenal, subject to government approval Coronavirus cases are fallingat roughly the same rate across the UK, according to a leading scientist advising the government A nationwide round of applause for key workers has beenheld for the tenth week running- as its founder suggestsit should be the final one A mother has called on the PM to provide support for those migrants who have been financially hit by coronavirus,but cannot claim benefits GROUNDED WITH LOUIS THEROUX :What's Lenny Henry doing in lockdown?

"EasyJet has said it will cut up to 30% of its workforce - about 4,500 jobs - as it struggles with a collapse in air travel caused by the virus pandemic. The airline did not say exactly how many jobs would go, but it employed 15,000 people at the start of 2020. Pilots' union Balpa reacted angrily, describing the move as an ""ill-considered knee-jerk reaction"". EasyJet, which has big operations at Gatwick and Luton airports, confirmed it would restart flights on 15 June. However, it said that levels of market demand seen in 2019 were not likely to be reached again until 2023. It added that in the coming days, it would launch an employee consultation process on the planned job cuts. It grounded its entire fleet in March as global travel came to a near-halt. ""To effect the restructure of our business, EasyJet will shortly launch an employee consultation process on proposals to reduce staff numbers by up to 30%, reflecting the reduced fleet, the optimisation of our network and bases, improved productivity as well as the promotion of more efficient ways of working,"" the firm said. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term.

""We want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than before, so that easyJet can thrive in the future."" What are the new quarantine rules? When will I be able to go on holiday? Other airlines have already announced job cuts and restructuring programmes as they fight to stay in business. These include: British Airways, which is set to cutup to 12,000 jobsfrom its 42,000-strong workforce Ryanair, which is set to cut3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce- with boss Michael O'Leary saying the move is ""the minimum that we need just to survive the next 12 months"" Virgin Atlantic, which has announcedit is to cut more than 3,000 jobs in the UKout of a total of 10,000 and end its operation at Gatwick airport. The travel industry's hopes of reopening for business as global lockdowns ease have been dealt a blow by the UK government's plan to introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals. From 8 June, people entering the UK from abroad, including returning holidaymakers, will be told to isolate for 14 days or face a Â£1,000 fine. In a letter to the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, hotels and holiday firms said the policy would reduce visitor numbers and could make it harder for Britons to travel abroad. Travel firms say quarantine plan must be scrapped Meanwhile, tour operator Tui has said all its holidays for UK customers will now be suspended until at least the end of June. It had previously cancelled all trips up to 11 June. It has also suspended its Marella Cruises sailings until 30 July. Rival tour operator Jet2holidays has also suspended its holidays until 30 June. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against all but essential international travel. ""EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only two days ago, staff got a 'good news' message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth,"" said Brian Strutton of Balpa. ""Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. EasyJet has not discussed its plans with Balpa, so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK,"" he added. ""EasyJet's own projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023, so this is a temporary problem that doesn't need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction."" Lindsey Olliver, the EasyJet officer for the Unite union, said the airline had made ""an unnecessarily hasty decision"". She added: ""The workforce is currently furloughed under the government's job retention scheme and the airline will continue to receive support until at least October. ""It has also received a government-backed loan of Â£600m and has committed to expenditure on new aircraft."" She said Unite did not know where the job losses were planned and would be seeking ""clarification"" from the company. EasyJet reaffirmed thatit would be introducing security measuresto protect against the spread of coronavirus when it resumes flights.

""EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only two days ago, staff got a 'good news' message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth,"" said Brian Strutton of Balpa. ""Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. EasyJet has not discussed its plans with Balpa, so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK,"" he added. ""EasyJet's own projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023, so this is a temporary problem that doesn't need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction."" Lindsey Olliver, the EasyJet officer for the Unite union, said the airline had made ""an unnecessarily hasty decision"". She added: ""The workforce is currently furloughed under the government's job retention scheme and the airline will continue to receive support until at least October. ""It has also received a government-backed loan of Â£600m and has committed to expenditure on new aircraft."" She said Unite did not know where the job losses were planned and would be seeking ""clarification"" from the company. EasyJet reaffirmed thatit would be introducing security measuresto protect against the spread of coronavirus when it resumes flights. These include requiring passengers and crew to wear masks and not offering on-board meals. The airline said it would release half-year results, covering the six months to the end of March, on 30 June.

"This video can not be played You can now meet up outside with people from another local household, but must keep your distance Coronavirus restrictions in Wales are likely to be relaxed next week so people from two different households can meet each other outdoors, BBC Wales understands. They will need to stay in their local area and remain two metres apart. The changes will not come into force until Monday. Other parts of the UK have loosened restrictions on meeting others. Further details are expected from First Minister Mark Drakeford on Friday. What do Wales' lockdown rules mean? Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown? Households are expected to be able to meet in gardens, as well as away from their homes. It has been illegal for groups of more than two people to meet since lockdown began in March. In a Twitter video, Mr Drakeford thanked people for their ""ongoing help and support and for all the sacrifices you have made"". ""I know being separated from family and friends is difficult,"" he added. People can leave the home to exercise, including cycling Since late March people have been told to stay home except for work, exercise and shopping for essentials. Wales' exercise restrictions are more stringent than England's - people have been told to stay local and not to drive. Most non-essential retail has been forced to close, alongside pubs and restaurants. Exceptions include supermarkets, garden centres and pharmacies. Schools are closed, but some are instead providing childcare for the children of key workers. Different parts of the UK have different rules for lockdown England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all have their own lockdown rules. In England they are set by the UK government, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In the other three countries they are set by their different governments. Groups of six people will be able tomeet outside in England from Monday. In Scotland people will be able to meet their friends and family outsidefrom this Friday. The country's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said people from two different households will be able to meet, but must keep two metres apart. They must also remain outdoors, and in groups of no more than eight. In Northern Ireland groups of six people who do not share a householdcan meet outdoors. The first minister has been dropping big hints for some time that his priority in lifting restrictions is to allow people to see friends and family if it can be done safely. My understanding is the approach will continue to be cautious, with people likely to remain confined to their local area. The strategy seems to be to make a small change and then keep an eye on the reproduction rate of the virus - the R number. That means the rules in Wales may continue to differ from those in other nations of the UK, but Mark Drakeford believes that most Welsh voters support his cautious approach. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said that the R number - the rate that coronavirus is spreading - is the biggest factor in determining when lockdown measures can be eased. If the R number is R2, it means a sick person is likely to transmit the virus to two other people. The latest Welsh Government analysis suggests Wales' R rate remains between 0.7 and 1, ""but still below 1"". Officials want it to remain below one. It is believed that an R of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if R reaches 1.1. The Welsh Government has not set dates for when measures in Wales could be lifted, unlike England. Current plans envisagea traffic light-style system of red, amber and green phases,external, with more restrictions lifted as they progress. This video can not be played The First Minister says that the easing of lockdown has looked at how to meet friends and family again. Former Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies tweeted it was ""great news for those with family and friends nearby"". But he asked what it meant for those who do not, ""particularly in rural communities"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""The people of Wales have generally adhered well to lockdown restrictions, and understand the need to take a cautious approach."" But he said the public would benefit from having a ""clearer plan of how restrictions will be managed"". Darren Millar, Welsh Conservative spokesman for Covid Recovery, said the longer the lockdown continued, ""the more difficult it will be for our economy to recover, the more jobs will be lost, and the more harm will be done to the education of our young people"". ""With infection rates falling and pressures on the NHS easing, it's now essential that the Welsh Government begins to safely and sensibly lift restrictions so that families can be reunited, our economy can begin to bounce back, and our young people can get the education they deserve,"" he added. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Drakeford and Boris Johnson, together with the first ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland, spoke on the phone. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister ""remains determined to work closely with the devolved administrations"". Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown?

"Dominic Cummings is at the centre of a political controversy in the UK The UK prime minister's most senior adviser has come under fire for travelling across the country during the coronavirus lockdown. Dominic Cummings drove 260 miles (418km) from London to Durham, and took a 60-mile round trip from Durham to a nearby town on his wife's birthday - a trip he says he made to test whether his eyesight was good enough to drive. Mr Cummings is facing calls to resign, both from opposition politicians and members of the governing Conservative Party, whose leader, Boris Johnson, he advises. In a highly unusual move for an adviser, Mr Cummings gave a press conference on Monday. He said he believed he acted ""reasonably"" and within the law. He has so far been backed by Mr Johnson and other senior government ministers. But his actions have raised the question - did one of the government's most senior employees ignore the rules he had helped set for millions of people across the nation? Mr Cummings is Boris Johnson's chief adviser. He is not a member of parliament and is not elected. Before the current lockdown scandal, he was best known for masterminding the successful Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, which saw the UK vote by a narrow majority to leave the European Union. Mr Cummings was played by actor Benedict Cumberbatch in Brexit: The Uncivil War - a 2019 drama about the referendum. Last year, he advised Mr Johnson to call an early election and to fight it on a ""Get Brexit Done"" ticket. The vote gave the Conservatives their biggest election win since 1987. Mr Cummings has never been a member of the Conservatives and he is seen as a divisive figure within the party. Former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron once described him as a ""career psychopath"". But he is more than just a run-of-the-mill adviser to Mr Johnson - in many ways, his ideas have forged the government's agenda. He has played a key role in advising the government on its coronavirus strategy. Read our full profile of Dominic Cummings In late March, Mr Cummings drove about 260 miles from his London home with his wife and child to a farm in north-east England owned by his parents. He says that his wife was unwell at the time and that he got sick soon after, with what they believe was coronavirus. Then in mid-April Mr Cummings was spotted with his wife and son in a town a 30-minute drive away from his parents' home. He has said he made the trip in order to test his eyesight, which he was concerned had been impaired by coronavirus. The two newspapers that broke the story, the Mirror and the Guardian, also reported that the adviser returned to northern England a second time - a claim Mr Cummings has denied. This video can not be played Dominic Cummings' full statement on lockdown row The reports about Mr Cummings have prompted widespread outrage. The government's message at the time - a message that Mr Cummings reportedly helped to draft - was ""Stay Home"". The British public had been expressly instructed to self-isolate for two weeks after experiencing coronavirus symptoms. Many avoided travel even at the cost of missing the passing and funerals of loved ones. One of the British government's scientific advisers and Scotland's chief medical officer have both been forced to step down in recent weeks for breaking UK lockdown rules. Both Mr Cummings and Mr Johnson insist that the adviser did not break the rules. In the daily coronavirus briefing on Sunday, Mr Johnson said his chief aide had ""followed the instincts of every father"" and acted responsibly in making the journey. But his remarks only led to more criticism, with members of the public saying they had ignored their own instincts to be with family members in need because they felt they had to follow the rules. Others questioned whether the prime minister was implying they were not acting as responsible parents in following the rules. Boris Johnson has backed his close adviser throughout the scandal On Monday, Mr Cummings made the highly unusual decision to hold a press conference - normally only elected government officials, not the people behind the scenes, publicly speak to the media. Addressing reporters in the garden of the prime minister's house, 10 Downing Street, he gave an account of his movements and said he did not regret his actions. Mr Cummings said he made the trip to his family farm mainly because he needed back-up care for his four-year-old son in case he and his wife were ill. He said it was an ""exceptional situation"" he believed was covered by the coronavirus regulations. He said he stayed in a separate property with his wife and child and followed rules on social distancing. The rules instructed those with coronavirus symptoms and others in their household to stay at home, but they also made this caveat: ""If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible."" Mr Cummings did not apologise and said he had not considered resigning. The government had hoped Monday's press conference would draw a line under the scandal, but it shows no sign of going away. Some have accused Mr Cummings of breaking the ""spirit"" of the lockdown guidance, even if his actions could be defended legally. There are also worries his actions will undermine the government's coronavirus guidance, encouraging the 66 million people living in the UK to follow their own interpretations of the rules. ""It really is one rule for him [Boris Johnson] and his elite friends and another for the rest of us,"" one member of parliament with the opposition Labour Party wrote on Twitter. Some have accused the government of double standards The number of Conservative Party politicians publicly criticising Mr Cummings is growing. On Tuesday,Junior Minister Douglas Ross became the first person to resign from the government in protest.He said Mr Cummings' interpretation of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". Mr Ross said he could not tell people in the community he represents they were wrong to miss funerals and other family events, and that Mr Cummings was right to drive to his parents' home.

We're wrapping up our rolling coverage until tomorrow, but in you can still get updates throughout the BBC News website. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the day's top stories.  Today's coverage was brought to you by our reporters in Singapore, the UK, and Washington DC: Saira Asher, Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Andreas Illmer, Sean Fanning, Hugo Bachega, George Wright, Hamish Mackay, Becky Morton, Deirdre Finnerty, Rob Greenall, Saj Chowdhury, Neil Johnston, Michael Emons, Josh Cheetham and Max Matza. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Moscowâs health department has doubled the official count of Covid-19 deaths in April to over 1500. It says this new tally comes after post mortem examinations confirmed coronavirus in dozens of cases where a Covid test had initially been negative, and in hundreds of cases where an autopsy determined that the virus was a significant factor in causing death, even when a patient had other illnesses. This new methodology is being recommended to Russiaâs regions and is likely to mean the death tally increases across the country, although Moscow was the epicentre of the epidemic for many weeks. A few weeks ago, when reporters here suggested the official numbers were too low after seeing excess mortality figures, they were accused of fake news and distortion. Moscowâs health department is stressing that even the new count puts the Covid-19 mortality rate for the city under 3% - suggesting thatâs well below comparable cities. But it also concedes that the figures for May will be higher. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has revealed how his son violated a government dusk-to-dawn curfew order issued to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He said one of his two sons, whom he did not identify, recently went out to party at night in the coastal city of Mombasa - an epicentre of infections in the country. Social gatherings are prohibited in the East African country. The government has also restricted movement in and out of the capital, Nairobi, and three other coastal counties, including Mombasa, where the first family and the president's mother are currently living. Kenyatta said he gave his son a dressing down for risking the life of his grandmother Ngina Kenyatta. ""You've had your fun and enjoyed yourself, but now you've come back and you're with your grandmother, your grandmother is 80 plus,"" the president said. ""If something happens to your grandmother as a result of what you have done - how will you live with yourself?"" In an interview, the president said no-one was immune to coronavirus containment measures, although he has been criticised for not taking his son to a quarantine centre like other Kenyans who violate the curfew.

Martin Scorsese has spoken about how ""anxiety"" set in during lockdown, after an initial ""relief"" that his heavy 2020 workload had been temporarily lifted. The director has shot a new home-made short film about his experiences of isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic. It premiered on Thursday's edition ofLockdown Culture on BBC Two. Scorsese, who was nominated for an Oscar for The Irishman earlier this year, said he ""didn't realise that the lockdown was going to be so intense"". Read more here. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that he will sign an executive order to allow private store owners to refuse service to customers not wearing a mask. The move marks a significant ramping up of anti-virus measures in the state, which continues to report the highest number of cases and deaths in America. Until now, masks have only been legally required in situations where people cannot maintain a six-foot (1.8 metre) distance from each other. He announced the move at a press conference today, where he was joined by comedian Chris Rock and actress Rosie Perez. Mr Cuomo joked that he had brought the pair as ""reinforcements"" because he wasn't ""cool enough"" to make people heed his advice over masks and coronavirus testing. âThe numbers in our community are staggering,"" said Ms Perez, in a message partially delivered in Spanish. ""This is not a joke, this is not a hoax. This is real.â Chris Rock added that, based on what he'd observed in New York City, âthe kids really arenât wearing the masks. âIâm just hoping to help. I have complete trust in the governor. Weâre soldiers for New York,"" said Mr Rock. Governor Greg Abbott has announced that, from Friday, sports fans will be able to attend outdoor professional sports events in most Texas counties. In a proclamation, Abbott said that venues would have to be capped to 25% capacity, and received approval from the Texas Department of State Health Services. But fans will still be banned from attending indoor sporting events, and the rules do not address college and high school sports. It comes as Texas - America's second-most populous state - rolls out a series of measures to reopen its economy. More than 59,000 confirmed cases have been reported there, making it one of the worst-affected states in the country. Martin PatienceMiddle East correspondent For the past two months, Khaldoon Rifaa has not been able to work as a driver because of Lebanon's lockdown. He is now back on the road, operating a minivan along the coastal motorway from his home city of Tripoli to the capital, Beirut. But standing on the street, he is struggling to find any paying customers to fill up his vehicle. ""Before my life was good,"" says the father-of-five. ""I'd work and I could feed my children."" ""But now, there's no work - there's nothing. I don't even have the money to buy washing powder."" Like many others in Lebanon, he has suddenly been plunged into poverty in a country that has hit breaking point. Some are warning thatthe scale of the catastrophe may be more devastating than the 15-year civil war,external, which raged from 1975 to 1990. Even before coronavirus hit, Lebanon was experiencing the worst economic crisis in the country's history, which triggered large anti-government protests late last year. Read more here. Lebanon has been rocked by anti-government protests for months Doctors protest outside an Ice jail in Florida on 1 May A lawyer for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has admitted in court that the agency is not testing prisoners for Covid-19 before transferring them to other jails unless they are showing symptoms of the illness. ""If the individual is actively ill, if the individual has tested positive or showing symptoms, they are not cleared for travel and they will not be transferred until those issues are resolved,â said assistant US Attorney Dexter Lee in a video court hearing,the Miami Herald reported,external. ""The problem is that there are individuals who are asymptomatic and they may be positive for coronavirus,â he added. The ongoing case is over a Florida judge's order that Ice reduce its local prison population to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Immigration advocates argue that Ice found a ""loophole"" by transferring them to jails in other states. Several recent outbreaks at Ice detention centres have been traced to recent transfers, according to US media. According to their website, Ice currently has 25,911 migrant detainees. The website adds that around half of the 2,620 inmates who have been tested were found to be positive.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson laid out details of a plan to begin an easing of lockdown restrictions in England from next week. We've made a chart detailing what the government is proposing over the next few weeks. Mr Johnson said that, despite the slight relaxation of rules on meeting people outside, those in England deemed most vulnerable to Covid-19 should continue to shield themselves for now.  Clap for Carers founder Annemarie Plas joined the tenth - and perhaps final - applause in south London In Glasgow, they played Dancing in the Streets as they applauded A Salvation Army Centre delivering food parcels also joined the applause Some people gathered outside the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital to applaud People all over the country are stepping out into their gardens, onto their balconies or just leaning out of a window to applaud NHS workers, care home staff and other key workers for their efforts during the pandemic. It may be the last time the nation takes part in the weekly ritual after founder Annemarie Plas saidthe 10th week of clapping would be a good time for it to end. As it approaches 20:00 BST, people in the United Kingdom prepare to Clap for Carers, as has happened every Thursday during the lockdown. The campaign originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown. However, after proving very popular, it was expanded to cover all key workers and has continued at the same time every Thursday.  At a White House briefing on Thursday, spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany defended states' decisions to reopen, saying ""everything does not depend on a vaccine"". ""There's therapeutics,"" she added. She also defended President Donald Trump's tweet commemorating the 100,000 US death toll, which went out the day after the number was passed, and said she had not discussed with Trump the idea of making a vaccine mandatory once it becomes available. McEnany said flags being lowered to half-mast on federal buildings during the previous Memorial Day weekend was an acknowledgment of the growing death toll. She also slammed the perceived liberal bias of US tech companies, after Twitter issued a fact-check label on two of Trump's tweets. She specifically accused Google of allowing China ""to spread misinformation about the coronavirus"".Trump is expected to sign an executive order targeting tech companies later today.

Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""protect them"" from ""an unnecessary attempt to ask a political question"". After several reporters had asked similar questions, both men said they had no wish to get involved in politics. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News About 7% of people in England have previously been infected with coronavirus, antibody tests on a random sample of households suggest. The new data was released bythe Office for National Statistics study,externaland is based on blood samples taken from 885 people from private households after 26 April. The study estimates that about one in 15 people in England have had the virus. These tests detect antibodies which form in the blood when the body fights infections such as Covid-19. The same survey also found that an estimated 133,000 people are currently infected with the virus - 0.24% of the population. Read more: About 7% have had coronavirus, says ONS survey Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hong Kong police confronted pro-democracy protesters on Wednesday China's parliament has backed security legislation for Hong Kong which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory. The resolution - which now passes to China's senior leadership - has caused deep concern among those who say it could end Hong Kong's unique status. It could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time. The move has already sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protest. Clashes broke out on Wednesday as Hong Kong's parliament debated a different proposed law, which would make it a crime to disrespect the Chinese national anthem. Hundreds of people were arrested in protests over that and the security law. Security remains high on Thursday, as a tense debate in the Legislative Council continues. At least two pro-democracy legislators were ejected from the council on Thursday. One lawmaker, Ted Hui, threw rotten plants on to the floor of the chamber, saying it symbolised the decay of Hong Kong's political system. ""I want the speaker to feel what is meant by rotten,"" he said. The speaker deemed the package to be an ""unknown dangerous object"", and called police and fire crews. Firefighters check the Legislative Council chamber after a lawmaker threw foul-smelling plants on to the floor Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September. But hours before the vote was taken in Beijing, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it couldno longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China. That meant that Hong Kong no longer merited being treated differently from the mainland under US law. The declaration could have major implications for Hong Kong's trade hub status and drew an angry reaction from Chinese authorities in the territory. In a strongly worded statement on Thursday, the office of China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong said it ""firmly opposed and refuted"" Mr Pompeo's statement and urged the US to ""immediately stop meddling"" in China's internal affairs. It described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless"". Twitter fact-checks China amid bias row President Xi Jinping and other senior figures applauded when the security law was passed On Friday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the UK was ""deeply concerned"" about the new security law, which ""risks undermining the principle of 'one nations, two systems'"". Japan said it was ""seriously concerned"" by Beijing's move. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Hong Kong was an ""extremely important partner"" and that democracy and stability there must be maintained. The National People's Congress (NPC) - meeting in Beijing after a two-month delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic - backed the security bill resolution with 2,878 votes in favour, one against and six abstentions. ""It will uphold and improve the 'one country, two systems' policy,"" NPC chairman Li Zhanshu told delegates during the closing ceremony. ""It is in line with the constitution and Hong Kong's Basic Law and is in the interest of all Chinese people including Hong Kong people,"" he added. The NPC only ever approves legislation put to it by the government so there was no chance the bill would not be supported. The legislation - referred to as the Draft Decision - now passes to the Standing Committee of the Communist Party which will draw up the full details of the new law. It is expected to criminalise: secession - breaking away from the country subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong The resolution also says that ""when needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law"". That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own. The authorities in Hong Kong insist the law is essential to tackle growing violence and ""terrorism"", and that the territory's residents have nothing to fear from it. Critics fear it could lead to Hong Kongers being prosecuted - even retroactively - for criticising their or the mainland's leadership, joining protests or exercising their current rights under local laws.

"The law has sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protest The US, UK, Australia and Canada have issued fresh condemnation of Beijing's new security law for Hong Kong, which they say has ""flourished as a bastion of freedom"". They say the international community has a ""significant and long-standing stake"" in its prosperity and stability. China's move to impose the new law during a global pandemic risked undermining trust in governments and international co-operation, they said. China has rejected foreign criticism. The law - approved by China's parliament on Thursday - has already sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protest in Hong Kong. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How is Hong Kong run? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it couldno longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China. This could lead to Hong Kong being treated the same as mainland China under US law, which would have major implications for its trade hub status. The UK on Thursday said visa rights for 300,000 British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong would be extended into a""pathway to future [UK] citizenship""if China did not suspend its security law plans. Direct imposition of the security law by Beijing rather than through Hong Kong's own institutions would ""curtail the Hong Kong people's liberties"" and ""dramatically erode Hong Kong's autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous"", the statement says. It would also conflict with China's international obligations within the Sino-British declaration, under which Hong Kong was returned to China, and would both undermine the ""one country, two systems"" principle and ""raise the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab says he is ""deeply troubled"" by China's actions in Hong Kong The allies also say they are ""deeply concerned"" that the new law will deepen divisions in Hong Kong, which has seen repeated waves of protests and clashes over the territory's relationship with the mainland. ""Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year,"" the statement says. The US and its allies urge China to work with Hong Kong's government and people to find a ""mutually acceptable accommodation"". In other reaction, Japan said Hong Kong was an ""extremely important partner"" and that democracy and stability there must be maintained. What if the US removes Hong Kong's special status? China's parliament has backed the security legislation, which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong. The resolution - which now passes to China's senior leadership - could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time. Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September. President Xi Jinping and other senior figures applauded when the security law was passed However it is expected to criminalise: secession - breaking away from the country subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform. China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong said it ""firmly opposed and refuted"" Mr Pompeo's assertion that Hong Kong had lost its autonomy and urged the US to ""immediately stop meddling"" in China's internal affairs. It described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless"". Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has denied that the law would curtail the rights of Hong Kongers and said it was a ""responsible"" move to protect the law-abiding majority. Twitter fact-checks China amid bias row HK leader dismisses concerns over freedoms Clashes broke out on Wednesday as Hong Kong's parliament debated a different proposed law, which would make it a crime to disrespect the Chinese national anthem. Hundreds of people were arrested in protests over that and the security law. Security remained high on Thursday, as a tense debate in the Legislative Council continued. At least two pro-democracy legislators were ejected from the council on Thursday. One lawmaker, Ted Hui, threw rotten plants on to the floor of the chamber, saying it symbolised the decay of Hong Kong's political system. ""I want the speaker to feel what is meant by rotten,"" he said. The speaker deemed the package to be an ""unknown dangerous object"", and called police and fire crews. Firefighters check the Legislative Council chamber after a lawmaker threw foul-smelling plants on to the floor Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle.

"Nissan's UK factory in Sunderland will stay open as the Japanese carmaker carries out a global restructuring amid the coronavirus pandemic. The carmaker also announced it will close its factory in Barcelona with the loss of about 2,800 jobs, prompting protests at the Spanish plant. Hundreds of workers gathered as burning tyres blockaded the site which Nissan said would close from December. Nissan is cutting production amid falling sales and rising losses. On Thursday, the carmaker revealed a $6.2bn (Â£5bn) net loss in the last financial year - the worst result for more than a decade. How can the car industry hope to recover? US ex-Green Beret arrested over Ghosn escape Nissan is part of a three-way alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi, which are restructuring global operations to enable them to work more closely and cut costs. As part of its plans, Nissan said it would focus on several ""key markets"", including Japan, North America and China. Its boss said that it will ""sustain"" its presence in Europe but will leave more room for alliance partners there, such as Renault. The Sunderland plant employs about 7,000 people There has been speculation that Renault could switch some production to the Sunderland factory. Nissan chief executive Makoto Uchida said the company would maintain production at its Sunderland plant. It will begin building cars there again in June, after production was paused due to coronavirus-related lockdown measures. Before the suspension, the factory was preparing for production of the next-generation Qashqai, due out next year. The factory, the UK's biggest car plant, employs about 7,000 people. Mr Uchida described the closure of the Barcelona factory as ""a very difficult decision"". The factory and its nearby facilities employ about 3,000 workers, but the closures could indirectly affect as many as 22,000 jobs, unions have said. ""The loss of the jobs of our Spanish colleagues is a regrettable reminder that automotive manufacturing is facing tremendous challenges,"" said Steve Bush, national officer for automotive at the Unite union. Protestors burned tyres in front of Nissan's plant in Barcelona which is being closed down Some staff in the Barcelona plant started an indefinite strike in early May after initial plans outlined a 20% cut to the workforce. Mr Bush added that Unite is seeking assurances from Nissan ""that the cost-cutting measures spoken about will not impact on our members' jobs, terms and conditions or other benefits at Europe's most efficient plant, Sunderland."" This is good news. For today, Nissan workers can breathe a sigh of relief that Sunderland has been recognised as an important production facility for the future. However, lots of questions remain. Nissan has identified Japan, North America and China as ""core"" markets - not Europe. In Europe, Nissan's alliance partner Renault will assume a greater role and influence in Europe at a time when the global car market will have to make very aggressive cost reductions. The question may arise in the future - who is really in charge in Europe? If it's Renault, what does that mean for future investment in a post-Brexit UK? Nissan alone said it had capacity to make seven million cars when it only needs capacity for five million. Only plants that can demonstrate an ability to be ruthless about cost will continue to attract investment. As Professor David Bailey tweeted this morning: ""Once again, the workforce will have to pull out all the stops to work flexibly to get costs down"". So, some belt tightening ahead, but workers in Sunderland will be thankful they are not in the same position as their counterparts in Spain and Indonesia, where plants closed down. On Thursday, Nissan also outlined plans to reduce the range of models of cars and trucks available in order to cut costs. It said it would reduce the number of models from 69 to about 55 over the next few years, focusing instead on electric vehicles and sports cars. Nissan said that worldwide sales of its vehicles between January and April had dropped by 31.1% in comparison with the same period last year. But even before the Covid-19 outbreak, Nissan's sales and profits had been falling, forcing it to pull back from the ambitious expansion plan devised by now-ousted leader Carlos Ghosn. Ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn fled from Japan to Lebanon in December The carmaker's operating profit had tumbled for four years in a row as it chased market share, particularly in America, leading to overcapacity at its car plants and steep discounts. The pandemic added yet more pressure on the company to step up its cost-cutting efforts. On Thursday the company said it was too difficult to forecast its performance in the next year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Uchida said that the firm's key focus during the pandemic was now to ""pursue steady growth"", instead of the massive sales expansion it pursued in the past.

"Thousands of contact tracers are making their first phone calls to track down people who will be told to self-isolate under new test and trace schemes being launched in England and Scotland. Tracers will text, email or call people who test positive with coronavirus and ask who they have had contact with. Any of those contacts deemed at risk of infection will be told to isolate for 14 days, even if they are not sick. Those who have already had the virus will also be asked to self-isolate. The aim of the system is to lift blanket lockdown restrictions and move towards more localised, targeted measures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was confident that the ""vast majority of people"" would participate in the voluntary system. ""In this war on the virus, ultimately we are all on the same side and we've all got a part that we can play,"" he said. The launch came as it was announced that some restrictions are to be easedin ScotlandandNorthern Ireland. How will contact tracing work in England? Scotland's plan for test and trace My new skill as a contact tracer The 25,000 tracers working for England's NHS Test and Trace team started by contacting the 2,013 people who tested positive for the virus on Wednesday. However, shortly after launching, some tracers said they were struggling to access the system. In a statement, the Department of Health insisted it had not crashed, adding: ""Some staff did initially encounter issues logging on to their systems and these are rapidly being resolved."" Trish Mannes, who leads a team of tracing specialists for Public Health England in the South East, told the BBC there had been a ""technical glitch"" but that overall the ""system seems to be working well"". She compared the contact tracing process to ""detective work"", using both ""technical knowledge"" and ""people skills"". ""The things that are important to me are empathy and ability to speak to people and get a rapport - remember we're asking people for a lot of detailed information, it takes time to get that information,"" she said. Share your experiences of being a contact tracer or someone who has been contacted byemailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Two MPs said they were told England's system would not be fully operational ""at local level"" until the end of June. Labour's Ben Bradshaw,externalandLib Dem Daisy Cooper,externalboth tweeted after a call with Baroness Dido Harding, the chairwoman of NHS Test and Trace. Downing Street said the test and trace system would ""improve"" over time but rejected suggestions the scheme had been launched early. But Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said hospital trust leaders were questioning the risk being run by easing the lockdown without having local systems in place. He also said it was ""never going to be the case"" that the UK would have a ""world-class"" test and trace system in place by June - in reference toa previous pledgemade by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Hopson said while work was progressing ""at pace"", the UK was ""weeks behind where we really ought to be"". An app to automatically alert people they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight but the government hopes to have that system up-and-running in England ""in the coming weeks"". The launch of Scotland's new Test and Protect system comes as First Minister Nicola Sturgeonannounced people from two different households will be able to meet outdoors from Friday. Northern Irelandhas its own version of the test and trace programme already. Wales' schemeis due to start in early June. Meanwhile, a further 377 people have died with coronavirus across all settings in the UK,daily figures released on Thursday showed,external. The total number of deaths in and outside of hospitals is now 37,837, the Department of Health said. Anyone who develops symptoms of coronavirus - a persistent cough, fever or a sudden loss of taste or sense of smell - has to isolate for seven days and the rest of their household for 14 days. This is in keeping with rules already in place. But from now on, everyone with symptoms shouldask for a test online,externalor phone to arrange a test by calling 119. If the test comes back negative, everyone in the household can go back to normal. But if the test comes back positive, the contact tracing team or local public health teams will get in touch - via text, email or phone call - to discuss whom the person has come into close contact with and places they have visited. Any of those contacts deemed at risk of catching the virus will be emailed or texted with instructions to go into isolation for 14 days, whether they are sick or not. They will be tested only if they develop symptoms. The rest of their household does not have to isolate, unless someone becomes ill. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Every single person can get a test"" Mr Hancock said people would have to self-isolate on more than one occasion if told to do so by the NHS. Those who have already had the virus must also self-isolate, as it is not known whether they can still transmit it. Only people who have been ""close"" to an infected person will be contacted by tracers. Close contacts are: people you spend 15 minutes or more with at a distance of less than 2m people you have direct contact with - such as sexual partners, household members or people with whom you have had face-to-face conversations at a distance of less than 1m The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in the daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday that it is the public's ""civic duty"" to follow the instructions of the NHS Test and Trace team. ""This will be voluntary at first because we trust everyone to do the right thing. But we can quickly make it mandatory if that's what it takes,"" he added. Scientists,including those advising the government, have warned that it will be harder to get public support for such measures in the wake ofthe row over the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. Mr Cummings was accused of breaking lockdown rules after driving 260 miles from London to County Durham because, he said, he was concerned about childcare for his son when his wife became ill. Those instructed to self-isolate will be eligible for statutory sick pay - Â£95.85 per week - but there are fears that many workers will not be able to live on that amount and will be forced to keep working. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to introduce ""enhanced"" sick pay, saying: ""There will be people whose work conditions and employment conditions make [self-isolating] difficult for them so they need that security."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called on the governmentto extend sick pay to everyone and raise it to the ""real living wage"" - Â£260 per week. She said the entire test and trace system would be ""undermined"" if workers were ""pushed into hardship"" when they were required to self-isolate. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The success of the scheme will depend on how quickly contacts can be found and whether members of the public follow instructions, a report published by the Royal Society said. It concluded that between 5% and 15% of infections could be prevented. But the 15% figure depends on finding contacts within three days and 80% of people reporting their symptoms or going into isolation when asked. By comparison, isolating cases and quarantining members of their household is thought to cut infections by 50%. Prof Anne Johnson, one of the report's authors, said the system ""is an important part in bringing the pandemic under control, but we're very clear it is not a magic bullet"". The national coordinator of NHS Test and Trace said the system requires rapid testing in order to be successful. However, after the prime minister said on Wednesday there was now a target to get test results in less than 24 hours, Prof John Newton added it would be ""very difficult"" to get home testing kit results in less than 48 hours. At the moment coronavirus is being suppressed by lockdown restrictions applied across the whole of society. Baroness Harding said the scheme was designed to allow national lockdown restrictions to be ""traded"" with individual isolation - allowing ""the vast majority to get on with their lives in a much more normal way"". Test and trace will also give far more detail on how and where the virus is spreading. Mr Hancock said this information could lead tolocal lockdowns to tackle flare-ups. Baroness Harding said data from anNHS contact tracing app being piloted on the Isle of Wight- which is not yet ready to be rolled out more widely - suggests people have been within 2m of fewer than five others for more than 15 minutes.

"Charity shops fear they will be deluged by donations when they start to reopen in just over two weeks. English stores will start opening their doors on 15 June, in line with government guidance. But they face a number of challenges after the coronavirus closures with all new offerings set to be quarantined for 72 hours. Robin Osterley, chief executive of the Charity Retail Association, says shops are expecting to be ""full to bursting"". The UK's 11,000 charity shops help raise almost Â£300m for good causes each year. Many people in lockdown have taken the opportunity to clean out their homes. Mr Osterley said: ""We're not just anticipating a normal three months' worth of donations but also the extra stuff that people may have picked out to donate during their clean-ups."" He urged people to ""be thoughtful about the sorts of things you're donating"". Barnardo's, one of the country's leading charity shop chains, is advising customers to call their local store to ensure the shop is able to take the items, in order to help manage the expected influx. Oxfam is asking customers to stagger donations to avoid items being left outside: ""We welcome that many people are taking the opportunity to de-clutter during lockdown and are asking people to hold on to those items and donate them when shops and donation banks are open again."" Coronavirus: When will shops open and what will the rules be? Who can I meet now? Can we stay safe as lockdown eases? ""Charity retailers are thinking carefully about which shops in their chains to open first,"" pointed out Vicki Burnett, senior consultant at the Charity Retail Consultancy. ""Many are planning a staged approach, opening the more simple-to-manage stores first and leaving the more challenging ones to later."" British Heart Foundation has the biggest branch network with 750 stores. ""From mid-June, we will reopen a small number of BHF shops to establish new safe ways of working with others to follow,"" said Allison Swaine-Hughes, retail director at British Heart Foundation. Barnardo's, the second-largest chain with 710 stores, will be opening 70 at first with a number of new safety measures. Oxfam, the third largest with around 650 shops, has yet to decide when to re-open stores: ""Our priority remains the health and wellbeing of our staff, volunteers and customers,"" the charity said. Cancer Research UK, with 600 stores, plans a phased-reopening from 29 June. ""We're planning significant safety measures and putting new processes in place to receive and handle donations,"" said Julie Byard, director of trading at Cancer Research UK. Charity shops rely on the UK's biggest army of volunteers to keep them going with 233,000 people all over the country lending a helping hand. But, in contrast to the excess of stock expected, here they are bracing for a shortage: ""We are expecting a temporary shortage of volunteers when shops re-open again,"" said Robin Osterley. ""Some may still be in isolation because of the Covid-19 crisis, while others may simply have fears of being out and about"" he pointed out. ""A large proportion of charity shop volunteers will be over 70 and therefore in the vulnerable category and it is inevitable that some volunteers may never return to the roles they had before lockdown,"" said Vicki Burnett. ""But lots of staff and volunteers are also desperate to get back to their shops, having missed the camaraderie and sense of purpose it provides, as well as to return to some form of normality."" There will be some recruitment activity going on over the coming months, she said. Charity shops have many fans who delight in being able to snap up good quality second-hand items at decent prices. But will they rush to return to the shops with coronavirus fears still in the air? ""I think it is very unlikely I'll be buying second-hand clothes again for a long time,"" said Elizabeth Mistry, a journalist and carer who is a keen user of charity shops. ""But I might not be able to resist nipping into Oxfam books just to see what they have - though it would have to be something really special in the short term to actually buy it."" Elizabeth is worried about where donations may have come from. ""Will future donors have to ID the donations for traceability?"" she asked. She is also concerned that the virus may last on cardboard or paper. ""I'd leave a book outside for a day or two in the sun - and even then I would wipe the cover and spine down before bringing it in."" Charity stores will be introducing extra hygiene to reassure customers, said Vicki Burnett. ""They already have great hygiene processes in their shops when it comes to sorting goods - items are washed, steamed or cleaned and this will only increase in the current situation."" Goods that come in will be isolated for 72 hours before being sorted. Which shops are reopening? Charity shop given Â£60k of designer goods.

"It's an uncanny and almost tragically perfect piece of symmetry. The number of US servicemen and women killed in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan - over an aggregate 44 years of fighting - is almost exactly the same as the number of Americans who've now lost their lives to coronavirus in just three months of America's war against the hidden enemy, as Donald Trump likes to refer to Covid-19. He also calls it the Chinese virus, but we'll come to that. Now I know you could replace the Covid-19 deaths with US cancer deaths or road crash victims and come up with similarly stark or perhaps even more dramatic statistics. But sadly, fatal car accidents and terminal tumours have always been with us. A global pandemic has not. And out of nowhere 100,000 American families are this spring mourning loved ones, whose lives have been cut short by this virus. 1.5m Americans have been infected. Many millions more have lost their jobs. How the pandemic in US compares to rest of world One of Donald Trump's first acts when he moved into the Oval Office in 2017, was to restore to a central position the bust of Winston Churchill that Barack Obama had moved out in favour of a bronze of Martin Luther King Jr. And in this fight against coronavirus, Donald Trump does see himself as a war leader; the property tycoon who could work a shovel on a Manhattan building site was also going to be shown to be a man of destiny -  the untried field-marshal, with a baton in his knapsack ready to command the troops to get the job done. But also keeping the home fires burning, and lifting the morale of a frightened nation. It has all been far more jagged than that. Trump toured a Ford car factory that switched to making ventilators Donald Trump is not imbued with the gift of soaring Churchillian rhetoric; there have been no ""we shall fight them on the beaches"" moments. Nor has he conjured the Rooseveltian calm when delivering one of his fireside chats. There have been days of infamy, but they have been invariably generated by things that the president has said, rather than what has been done to the United States. And anyway, for a self-styled war leader he must at least face the charge of ignoring the warnings about the enemy he was confronting in the early stages, appearing more Neville Chamberlain than Winston Churchill. Korean War (1950-1953):36,500 Vietnam War (1961-1975):58,000 Iraq War (2003-2011):4,500 Afghanistan (2001-today):2,000 Covid-19 (Feb 2020- today):100,000 The initial period of the US effort against the virus was marked by one significant action in late January, when the president stopped non-American visitors from China entering the United States. That was smart and decisive (although some have argued, to my mind unfairly, that Trump should have stopped anyone and everyone coming from China). But any tactical advantage that had given the administration was squandered in February where there was a month of inaction and incompetence. Attempts to roll out testing were woeful (the president was badly let down by the Centers for Disease Control). Procurement of PPE was weak. The federal emergency stockpile of vital equipment was like Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard: bare. The president had also disbanded the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council. He also eliminated the US government's $30m (Â£23m) Complex Crises Fund. These were decisions that badly undermined the American ability to counter the disease. This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus All while he was on a determined mission to tell America that this thing from China was no biggie, and certainly was not going to upend the economy - the centrepiece of his strategy for re-election in November. It is worth just going through the president's quotes from these critical few weeks. Jan 22:""It's one person coming in from China and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine."" Feb 2:""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China."" Feb 10:""Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that's true. But we're doing great in our country. China, I spoke with President Xi, and they're working very, very hard. And I think it's going to all work out fine."" Feb 11:""In our country, we only have, basically, 12 cases and most of those people are recovering and some cases fully recovered. So it's actually less."" Feb 24:""The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC and World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock market starting to look very good to me!"" Feb 26:""When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done."" Crisis? What crisis? But in March the contours became clearer, and it was not pretty. The news was all grim. Because of a lack of testing, there had been extensive community transmission - people were coming down with coronavirus, but it wasn't clear where they'd contracted it, who they'd caught it from, how they'd got it. The ""track and trace"" (the language of coronavirus that we've all now become so familiar with) was now impossible. Although the first reported outbreak was out on the West Coast in Washington state, Covid-19 was playing a mean sleight of hand on us all. This pesky virus got us to look in one direction, when we really should have been focused on the other. Where Covid-19 was really letting rip was on the East Coast, especially in the biggest, richest and most densely populated city in the US, New York, with devastating consequences. This video can not be played What Trump voters think of his handling of the virus outbreak If the city was quickly to become the most worrying centre of the outbreak, the borough of Queens became the epicentre of the epicentre - the district where Donald Trump had grown up. And the visuals from there drove home to Americans - and to the president - the scale of the unfolding disaster. At Elmhurst Hospital, refrigerated container lorries were parked to store bodies that the morgue had no way of dealing with. I interviewed a young doctor from there at the height of the pandemic who painted a harrowing picture of daily life and death. The young doctors being asked to play god In the richest city of the wealthiest country on the planet, we saw nurses heading into intensive care units to treat Covid patients wearing bin liners as PPE, because that is all they had. We saw the ER consultant putting on his ski goggles to examine a patient, because the hospital didn't have the right face masks. We saw mass graves being dug on a small island in the Bronx to accommodate all those who'd died with no next of kin, or with no money for a funeral. Like the inscription on the tomb of the unknown soldiers in the Commonwealth war graves: ""known unto God"". America, this all-mighty superpower, with enough weaponry to blow the planet to smithereens many times over, was looking ragged and not in control of events in its own backyard. It's hard to see this chapter of America's story going down as another moment of this nation's greatness. Refrigerator lorries are being used as makeshift mortuaries in New York If Queens is where Donald Trump grew up, Manhattan is where he made his money - and nothing says money like Wall Street, the pulse and oxygen monitor of the US economy. And the president likes to stand over its bed to take its vitals hourly. But as it became clear that the US economy was going to have to shut down, so the Dow Jones index went diving downwards - vertiginous drops, causing circuit-breakers to kick in, and causing the president and his advisers to fret that his whole re-election strategy had gone up in flames. But then the precipitous falls would be followed by dizzying rises as word came from Capitol Hill that lawmakers might be close to some agreement to inject gazillions into the cryogenically frozen economy. More than 25,000 of the deaths have come from New York state, and Governor Andrew Cuomo became coronavirus's first political superstar. His daily factual and highly detailed presentation of what was happening, where it was happening, what was being done to mitigate, and what still needed to be done, became appointment-to-view television across the US. Cometh the hour and all that. This video can not be played New York Governor Andrew Cuomo takes coronavirus test live on TV This lifelong Democrat - who also grew up in Queens - was drawing admiring glances from a lot of Republicans, and with many Democrats quietly thinking: ""I wish he was our candidate for president in November, and not Joe Biden."" Like an old-fashioned newspaper, he delineated clearly what was fact and what was opinion. In the space of 45 highly polished minutes he would deliver the news stories of New York's descent into the abyss, and then give you his op-ed column. He admitted his response wasn't perfect, acknowledging he could have acted earlier. And he also gave praise to Donald Trump where he thought it was due; he tweaked the tail of the administration when he thought it needed a bit of a kicking. At around the same time as Cuomo was capturing the nation's attention, Donald Trump decided he would go daily with a White House briefing too. It is hard to overstate how much Donald Trump loves - and needs - the roar of the crowd. Governing is dull. Campaigning - and the adoration from his rallies - is what gives him energy. It's what gets his heart pumping and the blood circulating. This video can not be played Trump gets in spat with Asian American reporter over ""nasty question"" And because of the lockdown, here was a president who was deprived of the two things he yearns for most - a day out playing golf, and an evening rally addressing raucous, loving crowds. There were also no heads of states visiting him, where the cameras would record his thoughts on whatever was the subject du jour. He was being starved of the oxygen of publicity, and so daily to the briefing room he would come, with us reporters playing the most unlikely role as his ventilator. Being intubated to a bunch of journalists he's never trusted was never going to end well. Vice President Mike Pence had been given the task of heading the coronavirus taskforce. A poisoned chalice it may have been, but it's a task he's performed with aplomb. He is across the detail of everything, and was the perfect link person between the different branches of government and the White House; between the different branches of government and the governors of the 50 states. And two other things he did with considerable deftness. He never forgot to praise the president to the hilt, saluting him for his leadership. Woe betide you if you don't. And he never forgets to display empathy - talking about the suffering of the American people, expressing condolences to those who'd lost loved ones. That is something that came easily to Mr Pence and is something Donald Trump hardly ever does. Though there would be a revolving cast of characters in the briefing room - the two other stalwarts were Dr Anthony Fauci, the independent-minded head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr Deborah Birx, who used to head the fight against Aids for the Obama administration, and was made the coronavirus response co-ordinator. These were the scientists who wanted to ensure that the judgements the president made were evidence based. They had limited success. The face of America's fight against coronavirus 'Ousted' vaccine expert says US is facing its 'darkest winter' No sooner had the US economy gone into shutdown than other, more business-minded voices were in Donald Trump's other ear telling him that the remedy his doctors were prescribing was worse than the disease. Let people go back to work. Reopen the economy. The loss of jobs, the recession, depression, the devastation of the US economy will be worse than the death toll. And you could see where the president's sympathies lay. First he advocated that the US should reopen by Easter, with churches packed. Only to have that kyboshed by doctors Birx and Fauci. When asked about this Dr Fauci gave an object lesson in disagreeing with the president without disagreeing: ""You don't set the timeline, the virus does,"" he told reporters. Masterful. But the impetus to reopen became overwhelming. The jobless totals were soaring, and Donald Trump saw his ""strong economy"" election strategy disappearing down the plug-hole. And all the while the death toll was mounting, ever, ever higher. What started as a trickle at the end of February became a gradual flow. The gradual flow then became a steady stream. And by late April the stream became a torrent. African American communities in New Orleans have been hit hard Coronavirus was indiscriminating about who it infected, but selective with who it killed. The statistics were striking - if you were black or Latino you were much more likely to die. Longstanding health inequalities came to the fore. If you'd grown up in an impoverished background, you were more likely to have the pre-existing conditions - the co-morbidities, as they say in the US - that would prove so deadly with coronavirus: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart disease. And if you live in densely packed, multi-generational households, and work in factories or meat-packing plants where social distancing is impossible, then - surprise, surprise - you're more likely to contract the disease. Why has the virus hit African Americans so hard? The untold story of America's biggest outbreak The US Surgeon General, Admiral Jerome Adams - himself African American - addressed this directly, and spoke powerfully about it. But he seemed to pay a price for doing so - he was not seen again at another White House news conference. Someone must have taken exception to what he said. The president's own erratic performances at these briefings were coming to be seen as counterproductive by Republican strategists. The president's poll numbers were going down. I was at a couple of the most extraordinary briefings. There was the one where the president made it all about himself. His staff had produced a lengthy campaign style video detailing how brilliantly he'd handled the outbreak - for the first 45 minutes of this over two-hour-long news conference, Donald Trump spoke about himself. He spoke about how unfair the media was to him. It was ""poor me"". Not once in those first 45 minutes did he talk about those who'd died, nor about those who'd been infected. Nor about the millions who were fretting about how they were going to pay the bills having lost their jobs. I was also at the briefing where the president spoke about injecting disinfectant to treat coronavirus. Dr Birx, who was sitting at the side of the briefing room, looked like she was in some kind of gastric agony as she listened to the president, but never felt she had the space to stand up and say: ""This is dangerous nonsense."" His performance was lampooned and ridiculed. But as the criticism piled up against the president, so Donald Trump bristled. And there were two culprits who'd be forced onto the perp walk of shame. The first was China. Despite his early praise for President Xi, China was now in Donald Trump's cross-hairs. China had lied and covered up. This was the Wuhan flu, the city where the outbreak originated. The Chinese had taken actions to protect themselves, but not anyone else. Worse still in Donald Trump's eyes, China had intimidated the World Health Organization, and its weak, pusillanimous leadership had allowed itself to be cowed by Beijing, and therefore had failed to warn the world sufficiently of the dangers that this new strain of virus presented. In this, sure, there was blame shifting - but President Trump had a point, both about shortcomings of the WHO, and the candour of the Chinese leadership. Trump gives WHO ultimatum over Covid-19 handling What are President Trump's charges against the WHO? All of this fired up the Trump base, but it was as nothing compared with the president shifting firmly in favour of reopening the US economy. Wild demonstrations sprang up - particularly in Democrat-run states, which the president did nothing to tamp down. In California, surfer dudes, backed by libertarian Republicans and small business owners, protested at beachside locations in a bizarre Baywatch meets the Tea Party moment. In Michigan, heavily armed men carrying assault rifles and dressed as though they were auditioning as extras for a movie about mercenaries laid siege to the State House. A public health emergency, with a virus that is no respecter of whether you are a Democrat or Republican, Trump lover or Trump hater, had divided and bitterly polarised the country. Like everything else. If you want the country to reopen you're with Trump (broadly); if you're wary about reopening too soon you're a Dem (broadly). If you love the fact that the president has ignored the advice of the Food and Drug Administration over the dangers of hydroxychloroquine, and decided to take it anyway, then you are firmly in his camp. And although the president has publicly stated that everyone ought to wear a mask, the fact that he chooses not to is taken as a clear dog-whistle to his supporters that you really don't have to. In the face - so to speak - of all medical advice, the mask is being seen by some as an act of provocation, a symbol of the nanny state. Shopkeepers who insist that customers wear a mask are being intimidated by thuggish gangs patrolling outside their premises. It is grotesque. They are being ripped up and destroyed as though a symbol of oppression by the ""Deep State"", rather than a small effort to halt the spread of the disease. Our film crews have been jostled and abused for wearing face masks while filming these protesters. Needless to say, these people are no respecters of social distancing.

GLOBAL TAKE:Which country has the most generous bailout? THE LOST SIX WEEKS:Missed chances for US to contain outbreak And now that America has reached this grim milestone of 100,000 dead, what of the future? In public opinion there does seem to be a battle going on between head versus heart. Science pitted against gut instinct. The role of the state against the rights of the individual. The US resistance to a continued lockdown If a phone app that can track and trace your movements is the vital tool to prevent a second wave of the virus, it relies on a sizeable majority of the population handing over their personal data for it to be effective. Will that happen? In a country whose founding fathers fretted about the dangers of the state becoming too mighty, I just cannot see it (and this goes far wider than pro- and anti-Trump). And what if, please God, an effective vaccine is found? You can be sure that the anti-vaxx brigade (and remember Donald Trump was once one of its advocates) will be out in force, stirring up doubts about the science, the medicine, the state, Big Brother, you name it. Donald Trump has boasted repeatedly in the past couple of months that no country has done more coronavirus testing that then USA. ""It's not even close,"" he says. No country has built more ventilators or supplied so much PPE to its front-line workers, he says. The president has claimed that other world leaders are jealous of what the US has managed to achieve. Really? Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Greece: envious? Hard to believe somehow. No country has had more deaths, more infections. Anywhere else, so far, is not even close.

"Charity shops fear they will be deluged by donations when they start to reopen in just over two weeks. English stores will start opening their doors on 15 June, in line with government guidance. But they face a number of challenges after the coronavirus closures with all new offerings set to be quarantined for 72 hours. Robin Osterley, chief executive of the Charity Retail Association, says shops are expecting to be ""full to bursting"". The UK's 11,000 charity shops help raise almost Â£300m for good causes each year. Many people in lockdown have taken the opportunity to clean out their homes. Mr Osterley said: ""We're not just anticipating a normal three months' worth of donations but also the extra stuff that people may have picked out to donate during their clean-ups."" He urged people to ""be thoughtful about the sorts of things you're donating"". Barnardo's, one of the country's leading charity shop chains, is advising customers to call their local store to ensure the shop is able to take the items, in order to help manage the expected influx. Oxfam is asking customers to stagger donations to avoid items being left outside: ""We welcome that many people are taking the opportunity to de-clutter during lockdown and are asking people to hold on to those items and donate them when shops and donation banks are open again."" Coronavirus: When will shops open and what will the rules be? Who can I meet now? Can we stay safe as lockdown eases? ""Charity retailers are thinking carefully about which shops in their chains to open first,"" pointed out Vicki Burnett, senior consultant at the Charity Retail Consultancy. ""Many are planning a staged approach, opening the more simple-to-manage stores first and leaving the more challenging ones to later."" British Heart Foundation has the biggest branch network with 750 stores. ""From mid-June, we will reopen a small number of BHF shops to establish new safe ways of working with others to follow,"" said Allison Swaine-Hughes, retail director at British Heart Foundation. Barnardo's, the second-largest chain with 710 stores, will be opening 70 at first with a number of new safety measures. Oxfam, the third largest with around 650 shops, has yet to decide when to re-open stores: ""Our priority remains the health and wellbeing of our staff, volunteers and customers,"" the charity said. Cancer Research UK, with 600 stores, plans a phased-reopening from 29 June. ""We're planning significant safety measures and putting new processes in place to receive and handle donations,"" said Julie Byard, director of trading at Cancer Research UK. Charity shops rely on the UK's biggest army of volunteers to keep them going with 233,000 people all over the country lending a helping hand. But, in contrast to the excess of stock expected, here they are bracing for a shortage: ""We are expecting a temporary shortage of volunteers when shops re-open again,"" said Robin Osterley. ""Some may still be in isolation because of the Covid-19 crisis, while others may simply have fears of being out and about"" he pointed out. ""A large proportion of charity shop volunteers will be over 70 and therefore in the vulnerable category and it is inevitable that some volunteers may never return to the roles they had before lockdown,"" said Vicki Burnett. ""But lots of staff and volunteers are also desperate to get back to their shops, having missed the camaraderie and sense of purpose it provides, as well as to return to some form of normality."" There will be some recruitment activity going on over the coming months, she said. Charity shops have many fans who delight in being able to snap up good quality second-hand items at decent prices. But will they rush to return to the shops with coronavirus fears still in the air? ""I think it is very unlikely I'll be buying second-hand clothes again for a long time,"" said Elizabeth Mistry, a journalist and carer who is a keen user of charity shops. ""But I might not be able to resist nipping into Oxfam books just to see what they have - though it would have to be something really special in the short term to actually buy it."" Elizabeth is worried about where donations may have come from. ""Will future donors have to ID the donations for traceability?"" she asked. She is also concerned that the virus may last on cardboard or paper. ""I'd leave a book outside for a day or two in the sun - and even then I would wipe the cover and spine down before bringing it in."" Charity stores will be introducing extra hygiene to reassure customers, said Vicki Burnett. ""They already have great hygiene processes in their shops when it comes to sorting goods - items are washed, steamed or cleaned and this will only increase in the current situation."" Goods that come in will be isolated for 72 hours before being sorted. Which shops are reopening? Charity shop given Â£60k of designer goods.

"Nissan's UK factory in Sunderland will stay open as the Japanese carmaker carries out a global restructuring amid the coronavirus pandemic. The carmaker also announced it will close its factory in Barcelona with the loss of about 2,800 jobs, prompting protests at the Spanish plant. Hundreds of workers gathered as burning tyres blockaded the site which Nissan said would close from December. Nissan is cutting production amid falling sales and rising losses. On Thursday, the carmaker revealed a $6.2bn (Â£5bn) net loss in the last financial year - the worst result for more than a decade. How can the car industry hope to recover? US ex-Green Beret arrested over Ghosn escape Nissan is part of a three-way alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi, which are restructuring global operations to enable them to work more closely and cut costs. As part of its plans, Nissan said it would focus on several ""key markets"", including Japan, North America and China. Its boss said that it will ""sustain"" its presence in Europe but will leave more room for alliance partners there, such as Renault. The Sunderland plant employs about 7,000 people There has been speculation that Renault could switch some production to the Sunderland factory. Nissan chief executive Makoto Uchida said the company would maintain production at its Sunderland plant. It will begin building cars there again in June, after production was paused due to coronavirus-related lockdown measures. Before the suspension, the factory was preparing for production of the next-generation Qashqai, due out next year. The factory, the UK's biggest car plant, employs about 7,000 people. Mr Uchida described the closure of the Barcelona factory as ""a very difficult decision"". The factory and its nearby facilities employ about 3,000 workers, but the closures could indirectly affect as many as 22,000 jobs, unions have said. ""The loss of the jobs of our Spanish colleagues is a regrettable reminder that automotive manufacturing is facing tremendous challenges,"" said Steve Bush, national officer for automotive at the Unite union. Protestors burned tyres in front of Nissan's plant in Barcelona which is being closed down Some staff in the Barcelona plant started an indefinite strike in early May after initial plans outlined a 20% cut to the workforce. Mr Bush added that Unite is seeking assurances from Nissan ""that the cost-cutting measures spoken about will not impact on our members' jobs, terms and conditions or other benefits at Europe's most efficient plant, Sunderland."" This is good news. For today, Nissan workers can breathe a sigh of relief that Sunderland has been recognised as an important production facility for the future. However, lots of questions remain. Nissan has identified Japan, North America and China as ""core"" markets - not Europe. In Europe, Nissan's alliance partner Renault will assume a greater role and influence in Europe at a time when the global car market will have to make very aggressive cost reductions. The question may arise in the future - who is really in charge in Europe? If it's Renault, what does that mean for future investment in a post-Brexit UK? Nissan alone said it had capacity to make seven million cars when it only needs capacity for five million. Only plants that can demonstrate an ability to be ruthless about cost will continue to attract investment. As Professor David Bailey tweeted this morning: ""Once again, the workforce will have to pull out all the stops to work flexibly to get costs down"". So, some belt tightening ahead, but workers in Sunderland will be thankful they are not in the same position as their counterparts in Spain and Indonesia, where plants closed down. On Thursday, Nissan also outlined plans to reduce the range of models of cars and trucks available in order to cut costs. It said it would reduce the number of models from 69 to about 55 over the next few years, focusing instead on electric vehicles and sports cars. Nissan said that worldwide sales of its vehicles between January and April had dropped by 31.1% in comparison with the same period last year. But even before the Covid-19 outbreak, Nissan's sales and profits had been falling, forcing it to pull back from the ambitious expansion plan devised by now-ousted leader Carlos Ghosn. Ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn fled from Japan to Lebanon in December The carmaker's operating profit had tumbled for four years in a row as it chased market share, particularly in America, leading to overcapacity at its car plants and steep discounts. The pandemic added yet more pressure on the company to step up its cost-cutting efforts. On Thursday the company said it was too difficult to forecast its performance in the next year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Uchida said that the firm's key focus during the pandemic was now to ""pursue steady growth"", instead of the massive sales expansion it pursued in the past.

"US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order targeting social media firms, the White House has said. It comes after he threatened to shut down social media platforms he accused of stifling conservative voices. The latest dispute emerged after Twitter added fact-check links to his tweets for the first time. The order's details have not been shared and it is unclear what regulatory steps the president can take without new laws passed by Congress. White House officials gave no further information on what is expected in the executive order which is set to be signed on Thursday. Before leaving Washington for Florida to watcha space launch that was postponed due to bad weather, Mr Trump again accused Twitter and other social media of bias, without offering evidence.

Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page that described the claims as ""unsubstantiated"". On Wednesday Mr Trump threatened to ""strongly regulate"" or even ""close down"" social media platforms. He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"" and that he would not allow this to happen.

"It's an uncanny and almost tragically perfect piece of symmetry. The number of US servicemen and women killed in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan - over an aggregate 44 years of fighting - is almost exactly the same as the number of Americans who've now lost their lives to coronavirus in just three months of America's war against the hidden enemy, as Donald Trump likes to refer to Covid-19. He also calls it the Chinese virus, but we'll come to that. Now I know you could replace the Covid-19 deaths with US cancer deaths or road crash victims and come up with similarly stark or perhaps even more dramatic statistics. But sadly, fatal car accidents and terminal tumours have always been with us. A global pandemic has not. And out of nowhere 100,000 American families are this spring mourning loved ones, whose lives have been cut short by this virus. 1.5m Americans have been infected. Many millions more have lost their jobs. How the pandemic in US compares to rest of world One of Donald Trump's first acts when he moved into the Oval Office in 2017, was to restore to a central position the bust of Winston Churchill that Barack Obama had moved out in favour of a bronze of Martin Luther King Jr. And in this fight against coronavirus, Donald Trump does see himself as a war leader; the property tycoon who could work a shovel on a Manhattan building site was also going to be shown to be a man of destiny -  the untried field-marshal, with a baton in his knapsack ready to command the troops to get the job done. But also keeping the home fires burning, and lifting the morale of a frightened nation. It has all been far more jagged than that. Trump toured a Ford car factory that switched to making ventilators Donald Trump is not imbued with the gift of soaring Churchillian rhetoric; there have been no ""we shall fight them on the beaches"" moments. Nor has he conjured the Rooseveltian calm when delivering one of his fireside chats. There have been days of infamy, but they have been invariably generated by things that the president has said, rather than what has been done to the United States. And anyway, for a self-styled war leader he must at least face the charge of ignoring the warnings about the enemy he was confronting in the early stages, appearing more Neville Chamberlain than Winston Churchill. Korean War (1950-1953):36,500 Vietnam War (1961-1975):58,000 Iraq War (2003-2011):4,500 Afghanistan (2001-today):2,000 Covid-19 (Feb 2020- today):100,000 The initial period of the US effort against the virus was marked by one significant action in late January, when the president stopped non-American visitors from China entering the United States. That was smart and decisive (although some have argued, to my mind unfairly, that Trump should have stopped anyone and everyone coming from China). But any tactical advantage that had given the administration was squandered in February where there was a month of inaction and incompetence. Attempts to roll out testing were woeful (the president was badly let down by the Centers for Disease Control). Procurement of PPE was weak. The federal emergency stockpile of vital equipment was like Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard: bare. The president had also disbanded the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council. He also eliminated the US government's $30m (Â£23m) Complex Crises Fund. These were decisions that badly undermined the American ability to counter the disease. This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus All while he was on a determined mission to tell America that this thing from China was no biggie, and certainly was not going to upend the economy - the centrepiece of his strategy for re-election in November. It is worth just going through the president's quotes from these critical few weeks. Jan 22:""It's one person coming in from China and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine."" Feb 2:""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China."" Feb 10:""Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that's true. But we're doing great in our country. China, I spoke with President Xi, and they're working very, very hard. And I think it's going to all work out fine."" Feb 11:""In our country, we only have, basically, 12 cases and most of those people are recovering and some cases fully recovered. So it's actually less."" Feb 24:""The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC and World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock market starting to look very good to me!"" Feb 26:""When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done."" Crisis? What crisis? But in March the contours became clearer, and it was not pretty. The news was all grim. Because of a lack of testing, there had been extensive community transmission - people were coming down with coronavirus, but it wasn't clear where they'd contracted it, who they'd caught it from, how they'd got it. The ""track and trace"" (the language of coronavirus that we've all now become so familiar with) was now impossible. Although the first reported outbreak was out on the West Coast in Washington state, Covid-19 was playing a mean sleight of hand on us all. This pesky virus got us to look in one direction, when we really should have been focused on the other. Where Covid-19 was really letting rip was on the East Coast, especially in the biggest, richest and most densely populated city in the US, New York, with devastating consequences. This video can not be played What Trump voters think of his handling of the virus outbreak If the city was quickly to become the most worrying centre of the outbreak, the borough of Queens became the epicentre of the epicentre - the district where Donald Trump had grown up. And the visuals from there drove home to Americans - and to the president - the scale of the unfolding disaster. At Elmhurst Hospital, refrigerated container lorries were parked to store bodies that the morgue had no way of dealing with. I interviewed a young doctor from there at the height of the pandemic who painted a harrowing picture of daily life and death. The young doctors being asked to play god In the richest city of the wealthiest country on the planet, we saw nurses heading into intensive care units to treat Covid patients wearing bin liners as PPE, because that is all they had. We saw the ER consultant putting on his ski goggles to examine a patient, because the hospital didn't have the right face masks. We saw mass graves being dug on a small island in the Bronx to accommodate all those who'd died with no next of kin, or with no money for a funeral. Like the inscription on the tomb of the unknown soldiers in the Commonwealth war graves: ""known unto God"". America, this all-mighty superpower, with enough weaponry to blow the planet to smithereens many times over, was looking ragged and not in control of events in its own backyard. It's hard to see this chapter of America's story going down as another moment of this nation's greatness. Refrigerator lorries are being used as makeshift mortuaries in New York If Queens is where Donald Trump grew up, Manhattan is where he made his money - and nothing says money like Wall Street, the pulse and oxygen monitor of the US economy. And the president likes to stand over its bed to take its vitals hourly. But as it became clear that the US economy was going to have to shut down, so the Dow Jones index went diving downwards - vertiginous drops, causing circuit-breakers to kick in, and causing the president and his advisers to fret that his whole re-election strategy had gone up in flames. But then the precipitous falls would be followed by dizzying rises as word came from Capitol Hill that lawmakers might be close to some agreement to inject gazillions into the cryogenically frozen economy. More than 25,000 of the deaths have come from New York state, and Governor Andrew Cuomo became coronavirus's first political superstar. His daily factual and highly detailed presentation of what was happening, where it was happening, what was being done to mitigate, and what still needed to be done, became appointment-to-view television across the US. Cometh the hour and all that. This video can not be played New York Governor Andrew Cuomo takes coronavirus test live on TV This lifelong Democrat - who also grew up in Queens - was drawing admiring glances from a lot of Republicans, and with many Democrats quietly thinking: ""I wish he was our candidate for president in November, and not Joe Biden."" Like an old-fashioned newspaper, he delineated clearly what was fact and what was opinion. In the space of 45 highly polished minutes he would deliver the news stories of New York's descent into the abyss, and then give you his op-ed column. He admitted his response wasn't perfect, acknowledging he could have acted earlier. And he also gave praise to Donald Trump where he thought it was due; he tweaked the tail of the administration when he thought it needed a bit of a kicking. At around the same time as Cuomo was capturing the nation's attention, Donald Trump decided he would go daily with a White House briefing too. It is hard to overstate how much Donald Trump loves - and needs - the roar of the crowd. Governing is dull. Campaigning - and the adoration from his rallies - is what gives him energy. It's what gets his heart pumping and the blood circulating. This video can not be played Trump gets in spat with Asian American reporter over ""nasty question"" And because of the lockdown, here was a president who was deprived of the two things he yearns for most - a day out playing golf, and an evening rally addressing raucous, loving crowds. There were also no heads of states visiting him, where the cameras would record his thoughts on whatever was the subject du jour. He was being starved of the oxygen of publicity, and so daily to the briefing room he would come, with us reporters playing the most unlikely role as his ventilator. Being intubated to a bunch of journalists he's never trusted was never going to end well. Vice President Mike Pence had been given the task of heading the coronavirus taskforce. A poisoned chalice it may have been, but it's a task he's performed with aplomb. He is across the detail of everything, and was the perfect link person between the different branches of government and the White House; between the different branches of government and the governors of the 50 states. And two other things he did with considerable deftness. He never forgot to praise the president to the hilt, saluting him for his leadership. Woe betide you if you don't. And he never forgets to display empathy - talking about the suffering of the American people, expressing condolences to those who'd lost loved ones. That is something that came easily to Mr Pence and is something Donald Trump hardly ever does. Though there would be a revolving cast of characters in the briefing room - the two other stalwarts were Dr Anthony Fauci, the independent-minded head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr Deborah Birx, who used to head the fight against Aids for the Obama administration, and was made the coronavirus response co-ordinator. These were the scientists who wanted to ensure that the judgements the president made were evidence based. They had limited success. The face of America's fight against coronavirus 'Ousted' vaccine expert says US is facing its 'darkest winter' No sooner had the US economy gone into shutdown than other, more business-minded voices were in Donald Trump's other ear telling him that the remedy his doctors were prescribing was worse than the disease. Let people go back to work. Reopen the economy. The loss of jobs, the recession, depression, the devastation of the US economy will be worse than the death toll. And you could see where the president's sympathies lay. First he advocated that the US should reopen by Easter, with churches packed. Only to have that kyboshed by doctors Birx and Fauci. When asked about this Dr Fauci gave an object lesson in disagreeing with the president without disagreeing: ""You don't set the timeline, the virus does,"" he told reporters. Masterful. But the impetus to reopen became overwhelming. The jobless totals were soaring, and Donald Trump saw his ""strong economy"" election strategy disappearing down the plug-hole. And all the while the death toll was mounting, ever, ever higher. What started as a trickle at the end of February became a gradual flow. The gradual flow then became a steady stream. And by late April the stream became a torrent. African American communities in New Orleans have been hit hard Coronavirus was indiscriminating about who it infected, but selective with who it killed. The statistics were striking - if you were black or Latino you were much more likely to die. Longstanding health inequalities came to the fore. If you'd grown up in an impoverished background, you were more likely to have the pre-existing conditions - the co-morbidities, as they say in the US - that would prove so deadly with coronavirus: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart disease. And if you live in densely packed, multi-generational households, and work in factories or meat-packing plants where social distancing is impossible, then - surprise, surprise - you're more likely to contract the disease. Why has the virus hit African Americans so hard? The untold story of America's biggest outbreak The US Surgeon General, Admiral Jerome Adams - himself African American - addressed this directly, and spoke powerfully about it. But he seemed to pay a price for doing so - he was not seen again at another White House news conference. Someone must have taken exception to what he said. The president's own erratic performances at these briefings were coming to be seen as counterproductive by Republican strategists. The president's poll numbers were going down. I was at a couple of the most extraordinary briefings. There was the one where the president made it all about himself. His staff had produced a lengthy campaign style video detailing how brilliantly he'd handled the outbreak - for the first 45 minutes of this over two-hour-long news conference, Donald Trump spoke about himself. He spoke about how unfair the media was to him. It was ""poor me"". Not once in those first 45 minutes did he talk about those who'd died, nor about those who'd been infected. Nor about the millions who were fretting about how they were going to pay the bills having lost their jobs. I was also at the briefing where the president spoke about injecting disinfectant to treat coronavirus. Dr Birx, who was sitting at the side of the briefing room, looked like she was in some kind of gastric agony as she listened to the president, but never felt she had the space to stand up and say: ""This is dangerous nonsense."" His performance was lampooned and ridiculed. But as the criticism piled up against the president, so Donald Trump bristled. And there were two culprits who'd be forced onto the perp walk of shame. The first was China. Despite his early praise for President Xi, China was now in Donald Trump's cross-hairs. China had lied and covered up. This was the Wuhan flu, the city where the outbreak originated. The Chinese had taken actions to protect themselves, but not anyone else. Worse still in Donald Trump's eyes, China had intimidated the World Health Organization, and its weak, pusillanimous leadership had allowed itself to be cowed by Beijing, and therefore had failed to warn the world sufficiently of the dangers that this new strain of virus presented. In this, sure, there was blame shifting - but President Trump had a point, both about shortcomings of the WHO, and the candour of the Chinese leadership. Trump gives WHO ultimatum over Covid-19 handling What are President Trump's charges against the WHO? All of this fired up the Trump base, but it was as nothing compared with the president shifting firmly in favour of reopening the US economy. Wild demonstrations sprang up - particularly in Democrat-run states, which the president did nothing to tamp down. In California, surfer dudes, backed by libertarian Republicans and small business owners, protested at beachside locations in a bizarre Baywatch meets the Tea Party moment. In Michigan, heavily armed men carrying assault rifles and dressed as though they were auditioning as extras for a movie about mercenaries laid siege to the State House. A public health emergency, with a virus that is no respecter of whether you are a Democrat or Republican, Trump lover or Trump hater, had divided and bitterly polarised the country. Like everything else. If you want the country to reopen you're with Trump (broadly); if you're wary about reopening too soon you're a Dem (broadly). If you love the fact that the president has ignored the advice of the Food and Drug Administration over the dangers of hydroxychloroquine, and decided to take it anyway, then you are firmly in his camp. And although the president has publicly stated that everyone ought to wear a mask, the fact that he chooses not to is taken as a clear dog-whistle to his supporters that you really don't have to. In the face - so to speak - of all medical advice, the mask is being seen by some as an act of provocation, a symbol of the nanny state. Shopkeepers who insist that customers wear a mask are being intimidated by thuggish gangs patrolling outside their premises. It is grotesque. They are being ripped up and destroyed as though a symbol of oppression by the ""Deep State"", rather than a small effort to halt the spread of the disease. Our film crews have been jostled and abused for wearing face masks while filming these protesters. Needless to say, these people are no respecters of social distancing. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? UPLIFTING STORY:'I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' POST-COVID WORLD:Will we ever shake hands again? GLOBAL TAKE:Which country has the most generous bailout? THE LOST SIX WEEKS:Missed chances for US to contain outbreak And now that America has reached this grim milestone of 100,000 dead, what of the future? In public opinion there does seem to be a battle going on between head versus heart. Science pitted against gut instinct. The role of the state against the rights of the individual. The US resistance to a continued lockdown If a phone app that can track and trace your movements is the vital tool to prevent a second wave of the virus, it relies on a sizeable majority of the population handing over their personal data for it to be effective. Will that happen? In a country whose founding fathers fretted about the dangers of the state becoming too mighty, I just cannot see it (and this goes far wider than pro- and anti-Trump). And what if, please God, an effective vaccine is found? You can be sure that the anti-vaxx brigade (and remember Donald Trump was once one of its advocates) will be out in force, stirring up doubts about the science, the medicine, the state, Big Brother, you name it. Donald Trump has boasted repeatedly in the past couple of months that no country has done more coronavirus testing that then USA. ""It's not even close,"" he says. No country has built more ventilators or supplied so much PPE to its front-line workers, he says. The president has claimed that other world leaders are jealous of what the US has managed to achieve. Really? Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Greece: envious? Hard to believe somehow. No country has had more deaths, more infections. Anywhere else, so far, is not even close.

"This video can not be played Staff conducting virus tests in Cardiff and Newport share their experiences The scientist running Wales' largest coronavirus testing laboratory has spoken of the ""sacrifice"" his team is making to tackle the pandemic. Jonathan Evans runs the virology centre at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales which conducted its first positive Covid-19 test in February. He said staff were working long hours, carrying out about 2,500 daily tests. A lead nurse at one drive-through test centre said ""good morale"" was protecting staff from the pressure. Swabs taken at drive-through testing centres, care homes and health board test sites are all taken to the Cardiff laboratory to be processed. Initially, it was the only laboratory in Wales conducting tests for coronavirus, but others are now sharing the workload. Before the pandemic hit, Mr Evans' laboratory was at its busiest when processing tests for sexually transmitted diseases. Back then, a ""normal day"" would involve carrying out 400 chlamydia tests. ""Duringswine flu,externalwe would get up to testing around 200 samples a day, but that was only on a couple of days,"" he said. ""We are now up at over 2,500 tests per day on a test [for COVID19] that only existed in January, on a virus that didn't exist before December. ""And so the amount of procedures and systems we have had to develop and put in place to be able to safely offer that service has been nothing short of phenomenal."" Covid-19 contact tracing to start from 1 June More than 2,000 deaths in Wales with Covid-19 'Allow Welsh ministers to borrow more money' While staffing has increased from 30 to 50 people, the extra workload has placed great strain on his team. ""I can't speak highly enough of my staff. Bank holidays - what are they? Weekends - they don't exist any more,"" said Mr Evans. ""All the staff are currently working six or seven days a week, commonly 60 to 70 hours."" Mr Evans said many of his relatively young team had moved to Cardiff to work at the laboratory and were experiencing the same lockdown restrictions as everyone else when not on shift. ""One of our colleagues should have beencelebrating Eidonly a couple of days ago with her family and couldn't because she was actually in work here having to do a 12-hour shift instead of being at home with her family in Blackburn. ""It's at moments like that in which you realise the sacrifice the team are making for the greater good."" Test centre lead nurse Amanda Luther: ""We are getting through it as best we can"" Among the samples being processed by the Cardiff laboratory are those collected by staff at Newport's drive-through centre at Rodney Parade - home of Newport's football and rugby teams. A hospitality tent normally used to host sponsors during matches has been repurposed to hold staff involved in contacting people to visit for testing and three bays have been constructed to carry out tests on people arriving by car. Lead nurse Amanda Luther said staff were ""working very, very hard"". ""Yes, it is an awful lot of pressure. We are asked to achieve an awful lot with the number of staff we have got. ""But because morale is so good, and everybody is supporting each other, we are getting through it as best we can."" People wait in their vehicles at the drive through test centre at Rodney Parade Staff who have been moved from their usual roles to help run the testing centre include Holly Taylor, who previously worked in a hospital appointments office. ""My job here is to book appointments and action referrals that are sent through by organisations who want their staff tested,"" she said. ""We are a seven-day operation. It is mostly full-on, you don't realise the time going by. ""Nobody is used to this kind of thing. But I only started working for the NHS in November so I have been in at the deep end."" Holly Taylor: ""Nobody is used to this kind of thing"" Despite being based at the centre, Ms Taylor said she did not always appreciate the fact she was on the front line. ""It is nice and rewarding when you go home and you think 'I have done all this for all these people',"" she said. Some of the people she has had to contact to take the test have been particularly unwell. ""We have had some very concerned and stressed out people on the phone,"" she said. ""They are people who do not sound at all well. But that is why we are here, isn't it? To get them booked, tested and ready to get back to work."" Wales' testing system is being overseen by Public Health Wales, where a prepared plan for testing during the pandemic had to be quickly adapted. Dr John Boulton, the director of quality improvement and patient safety, said the original document lasted ""several hours"". ""It has evolved as we have gone along,"" he said.

"The Dragon's Heart Hospital, at the Principality Stadium, one of the UK's biggest field hospitals The billions of public cash being spent by the Welsh Government on tackling the coronavirus pandemic have been revealed. A total of Â£2.4bn is going on healthcare, businesses, councils, transport and other services. Most - Â£1.6bn - is being used to support the economy. Welsh Government Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said ministers should be able to be allowed to raise more cash through borrowing. Most of the cash has come from Â£1.8bn in extra funding from the UK Treasury. The additional funds mean the Welsh budget for 2020-21 is now 10% larger than it was in March. City and town centres have largely closed as a result of the coronavirus lockdown measures The Welsh Government said it is spending Â£1.7bn, including Â£100m on infrastructure, on measures to support the economy and protect jobs. That includes Â£500m on an economic resilience fund - providing financial support to companies. But the bulk is being spent on business rate relief - a tax paid by firms for the premises they use. More than Â£1bn is being distributed by councils through the tax cuts, and associated grants. To date councils have issued Â£625m in 50,700 business rates grants. The Welsh Government is spending Â£100m on PPE Meanwhile Â£763m is being spent on health and public services, including Â£166m for emergency field hospitals Â£100m for personal protective equipment (PPE) Â£91m on additional NHS staffing Â£40m to pay every care worker a one-off Â£500 bonus. The Welsh Government's contact tracing programme - designed to help ease Wales out of lockdown - has been allocated Â£57m. A total of Â£40m is being spent keeping trains running Meanwhile councils are being given Â£188m through a local authority hardship fund. That includes Â£40m to support extra costs from adult social care Â£40m for free school meals Â£78m to help councils with lost income Â£7m for temporary morgues Councils have claimed they face a deficit of Â£173m through a loss of income and increased costs. Welsh Local Government Association finance spokesperson Antony Hunt warned there was a ""risk that the disease will cast its long shadow over essential local services for years to come"". ""This budget is a good start, and that partnership approach will need to continue to address the financial impacts of this pandemic,"" he added. Lockdown has been in place in Wales since March Some Â£40m is being allocated to ensure the continued operation and maintenance of train services. A total of Â£24m is going to help the Welsh voluntary sector, while Â£15m is being spent on a direct food delivery scheme for people shielding. The extra UK treasury cash comes as a result of new spending on public services in England due to coronavirus. An additional Â£256m has been found from Welsh reserves, and Â£245m from repurposed European funding, according to the Welsh Government's supplementary budget. Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's finance spokesman said ministers needed to find a ""new way of doing things"" as ""new priorities are emerging"", ""We should have had a taste of that willingness to innovate. It's not there."" Rebecca Evans said she and her colleagues should be able to borrow more cash Earlier, Wales' Finance Minister Rebecca Evans urged UK ministers to allow the Welsh Government to borrow more money to help deal with pandemic. Under current rules the Welsh Government is able to borrow Â£150m a year for infrastructure, up to a limit of Â£1bn, and Â£200m a year for day-to-day spending. Speaking at the daily Welsh Government press briefing, Ms Evans said: ""Our capacity and our ability to get money to the frontline has been constrained by the rigid financial rules imposed by the UK Government"". The minister said the Welsh Government wanted ""more flexibility to help us respond to the crisis"". She said the UK Treasury should end ""the arbitrary limits on our borrowing"" and also remove ""the limits on the amount we can draw down from our own reserves"". Responding to the minister, a UK Government spokesperson said: ""An unprecedented level of financial support for Wales - more than Â£2.2 billion extra - has been provided by the UK Government during the coronavirus pandemic and we continue to work more closely than ever with the Welsh Government."" Ms Evans call for more borrowing was described as dangerous by Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Nick Ramsay. He said a ""bold and innovative"" budget was required but what had been presented ""lacked those qualities"". ""Yes, these are unprecedented times but the call for caps on borrowing to be removed could trap Wales and its people into decades of debt,"" he said. Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless said the supplementary budget ""accentuates our concern that the continuing lockdown of Wales, as England reopens, will mean income tax will rise in Wales next year thanks to devolution"". The additional spending outlined in today's plans is eye-watering in its scale. The Welsh Government will spend an additional Â£2.46bn this year, 10% more than was planned just a few short months ago. The bulk of the money, Â£1.6bn, is going on a massive package of loans and business rate relief in an attempt to ensure that businesses and jobs survive the pandemic. The health service too receives a huge spending boost of Â£763m with Â£100m being spent on PPE equipment alone and Â£166m on emergency field hospitals such as Llandudno's Ysbyty Enfys and Cardiff's Ysbyty Calon y Ddraig. Such is the size of the crisis though that there are fears that the additional spending still isn't enough and that even more money will have to be found to see Wales through.

"Lockdown restrictions in Wales are likely to be relaxed next week so people from two different households can meet each other outdoors, BBC Wales understands People in Wales have taken part in what was the tenth - and possibly final - clap for carers event Attendances at Welsh emergency departments remain down on last year, the head of NHS Wales says The scientist running Walesâ largest coronavirus testing laboratory says his team has to âsacrificeâ to tackle the pandemic Fourteen more people have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 1,307, Public Health Wales says It could take five years for the Royal Welsh Show to come to terms with the financial impact of the pandemic, organisers say People in the gig economy are being ""forced into destitution"", a union claims Rachel Flint, James McCarthy and Rhiannon Beacham That's it for our live updates for another day, thanks for joining us. Here are the main points from the day:  Nurses in scrubs stepped out of hospitals to applaud their fellow workers during the fight against coronavirus. Medical staff at the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, took part in the clap for carers tonight. In what could be the final evening of what has become a weekly event, people across Wales took to their doorsteps to thank key workers. In Penarth residents were pictured banging pots, and being joined by their pets as they joined in. A medical worker claps from a house across the road from the Royal Gwent Hospital Residents across Wales grabbed pots and pans to join in A medical worker in scrubs claps for colleagues outside the Newport hospital In Penarth a woman is joined by her dog during the applause Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones said she applauded every key worker, volunteer and person who has obeyed the coronavirus rules. For most of us, lockdown has been a marathon not a sprint and nowhere more so than in one street just outside Prestatyn. Residents in Bryn Llys in Meliden each ran part of the 26.2 miles up and down the street maintaining social distance, to raise cash for the local hospital and care homes. But the woman who helped organise the event said she was desperate to be reunited with loved ones who live elsewhere. Elin Hughes-Jones said: ""The most important thing for me is to see my family. ""I can wait a bit longer to see friends, but family is the main thing for me."" Tomorrow, the Welsh Government is likely to announce an easing of some lockdown restrictions, including being able to meet people from other households, while maintaining social distancing, BBC Wales understands. At Lyon's Lido Beach caravan park, staff are preparing for the eventual reopening but say different advice for England and Wales has complicated things. Managing director Geoff Lyons-Mount said: ""England have gone easier on the opening of things whereas our minister has decided to keep things pretty much tied up, so it's frustrating for us but it's what's good for the area, we've got to look after our residents and the locals."" Thanks were given to ""the key workers who are keeping our society together,"" by Wales Air Ambulance. ""You know who you are, and we salute you,"" the charity said.  Allow Twitter content?

"Hong Kong police confronted pro-democracy protesters on Wednesday China's parliament has backed security legislation for Hong Kong which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory. The resolution - which now passes to China's senior leadership - has caused deep concern among those who say it could end Hong Kong's unique status. It could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time. The move has already sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protest. Clashes broke out on Wednesday as Hong Kong's parliament debated a different proposed law, which would make it a crime to disrespect the Chinese national anthem. Hundreds of people were arrested in protests over that and the security law. Security remains high on Thursday, as a tense debate in the Legislative Council continues. At least two pro-democracy legislators were ejected from the council on Thursday. One lawmaker, Ted Hui, threw rotten plants on to the floor of the chamber, saying it symbolised the decay of Hong Kong's political system. ""I want the speaker to feel what is meant by rotten,"" he said. The speaker deemed the package to be an ""unknown dangerous object"", and called police and fire crews. Firefighters check the Legislative Council chamber after a lawmaker threw foul-smelling plants on to the floor Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September. But hours before the vote was taken in Beijing, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it couldno longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China. That meant that Hong Kong no longer merited being treated differently from the mainland under US law. The declaration could have major implications for Hong Kong's trade hub status and drew an angry reaction from Chinese authorities in the territory. In a strongly worded statement on Thursday, the office of China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong said it ""firmly opposed and refuted"" Mr Pompeo's statement and urged the US to ""immediately stop meddling"" in China's internal affairs. It described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless"". Twitter fact-checks China amid bias row President Xi Jinping and other senior figures applauded when the security law was passed On Friday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the UK was ""deeply concerned"" about the new security law, which ""risks undermining the principle of 'one nations, two systems'"". Japan said it was ""seriously concerned"" by Beijing's move. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Hong Kong was an ""extremely important partner"" and that democracy and stability there must be maintained. The National People's Congress (NPC) - meeting in Beijing after a two-month delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic - backed the security bill resolution with 2,878 votes in favour, one against and six abstentions. ""It will uphold and improve the 'one country, two systems' policy,"" NPC chairman Li Zhanshu told delegates during the closing ceremony. ""It is in line with the constitution and Hong Kong's Basic Law and is in the interest of all Chinese people including Hong Kong people,"" he added. The NPC only ever approves legislation put to it by the government so there was no chance the bill would not be supported. The legislation - referred to as the Draft Decision - now passes to the Standing Committee of the Communist Party which will draw up the full details of the new law. It is expected to criminalise: secession - breaking away from the country subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong The resolution also says that ""when needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law"". That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own. The authorities in Hong Kong insist the law is essential to tackle growing violence and ""terrorism"", and that the territory's residents have nothing to fear from it. Critics fear it could lead to Hong Kongers being prosecuted - even retroactively - for criticising their or the mainland's leadership, joining protests or exercising their current rights under local laws. Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How is Hong Kong run?

This video can not be played Police arrested dozens of people in Causeway Bay on Wednesday Under the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact its own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law. But its unpopularity meant it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests. Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement. China is keen to avoid a repeat of that unrest.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: People in Scotland can meet family and friends from Friday People in Scotland will be able to meet their friends and family outside from Friday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. Ms Sturgeon said people from two different households will be able to meet, but must keep two metres apart. They must also remain outdoors, and in groups of no more than eight. People are still being urged to ""stay at home as much as possible"", with Ms Sturgeon warning that the virus ""is still out there"". The lockdown easing was announced as Ms Sturgeon confirmed the country was ready to introduce the first phase of its four-phase ""route map"" towards reopening society while attempting to suppress the virus. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest developments What can you do in Scotland from Friday? Read the new rules on social distancing,external Coronavirus rates 'similar' across UK Scotland has been in lockdown since 23 March, and did not make major changes to restrictions when they were announced for England earlier this month. Ms Sturgeon said there had now been a ""sustained and unmistakable"" downward trend in the spread of the virus over a number of weeks, meaning changes could now be made. But she warned that ""we have limited room for manoeuvre"" and ""need to get the balance right"". Ms Sturgeon said ""most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume"" from Friday. This will see garden centres opening their doors again and site preparation beginning in the construction industry, with recycling centres re-opening from Monday. Also from Monday, teachers and other staff will be able to return to schools to prepare for re-opening - although most pupils will not return until 11 August, when they will begin a ""blended model"" of education which will see learning split between the classroom and home. Golf course will be able to open to the public from Friday Some outdoor leisure activities where physical distancing can be maintained will be allowed from Friday - including golf, tennis, bowls and fishing. People will be allowed to sit out and sunbathe in parks and open areas, and travel within their local area for exercise - although there is ""strong advice"" not to travel more than five miles for leisure. Ms Sturgeon said she did not want to see large numbers of people heading to beauty spots, warning that ""crowds bring more risk than we judge is acceptable or safe at this point"". Members of two different households will be allowed to meet up so long as they remain outdoors ""in a park or private garden"" and stay 2m (6ft) apart. Ms Sturgeon said the total number of people taking part in any meeting should not exceed eight, and that it was ""strongly recommended that you don't meet with more than one other household per day"". She also warned people not to enter each other's houses or to share picnic or barbecue materials, saying this could create ""a bridge for the virus to spread from one household to another"". She said: ""Please remember that we should still be meeting far fewer people outside your own household than we would in normal times."" The first minister said she was ""a bit nervous"" that limited changes to the rules could ""lead to much greater change in reality"", asking people to ""please, please respect the parameters we are setting out"". She said people should continue to ""stay at home as much as possible"", adding: ""The virus is still out there - lockdown is being modified slightly, but it is not over."" The first minister confirmed the easing of lockdown in Scotland at a podium bearing the words ""stay at home"". She is not switching to ""stay alert"" or some other formulation at this stage. When I asked her if the retained messaging still applied, Nicola Sturgeon insisted staying at home as much as you can remains the starting point. What the new guidance published by the Scottish government does is to expand the range of reasonable reasons why you might leave the house. That inevitably means that as we move into this new phase, ministers are counting on you to follow guidance and exercise good judgement, responsibility, restraint. They hope that works and that new legally enforceable rules are not required. But as the deputy first minister, John Swinney, put it earlier today - the gradual easing of lockdown is not a free for all. The changes do not change the circumstances of those in the ""shielding"" group, those who are most vulnerable to the virus. Ms Sturgeon said she realised this would be ""hard"" for them, and said ministers were trying ""to move to less of a blanket approach"". She said: ""I want you to know today that you have not been forgotten, and you are a central part of our thinking as we consider how we move forward."" The Scottish government has identifiedfour phases for easing the restrictions,external: Phase 1:Virus not yet contained but cases are falling. From 28 May you should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2:Virus controlled. You can meet larger groups outdoors, and meet another household indoors. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops can resume work. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3:Virus suppressed.  You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4:Virus no longer a significant threat. University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. The easing measures were announced as Scotland launched its new nation-wide ""test and protect"" system of tracing and isolating people who may have the virus. Anyone withsymptoms of the virusshould ""take immediate steps"" to book a test through the NHS. If someone tests positive for Covid-19, contact tracers will get in touch with those they have been in close proximity to, advising them to self-isolate for 14 days. Ms Sturgeon said test and protect was a ""crucial part"" of the government's strategy to suppress the virus, but said people should still exercise caution. She said taking precautions like hand washing, the use of face coverings and social distancing ""matters even more"" as rules begin to be relaxed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"On Tuesday's Newsnight, Emily Maitlis said the row had caused ""a deep national disquiet"" Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis has said she did not present the BBC Two programme on Wednesday because she had ""asked for the night off"". She was responding to suggestions that the BBC had replaced her after ruling her introduction about Dominic Cummings on Tuesdaybroke impartiality rules. The BBC said her wording ""risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides, and expressing an opinion"". But the corporation insisted she had not been removed or suspended.

Maitlis is not scheduled to present the show again this week - Emma Barnett is fronting Thursday's programme, with Kirsty Wark on Friday. In a statement on Thursday, the BBC said its public ruling about Maitlis's script was not about ""apportioning blame to anyone"". It said: ""Our editorial guidelines allow us to make professional judgments but not to express opinion. ""The dividing line can be fine, but we aim to say so if we think we have overstepped the mark. ""The introduction to Newsnight was intended as a summary of the issues that would be explored, with all the supporting facts and evidence, in the programme. But as broadcast, it risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides, and expressing an opinion, rather than being impartial. ""It said that 'the country' was 'shocked the government cannot see' Dominic Cummings broke lockdown rules; that he 'made those who struggled to keep the rules feel like fools'. ""But there are some who do not share this opinion, nor think that the issue is a 'scandal' or the prime minister has displayed 'blind loyalty'. ""By presenting a matter of public and political debate as if the country was unanimous in its view, we consider Newsnight risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides - or that the introduction constituted the presenter's opinions, rather than a summary of the journalism which would follow, which explored these issues rigorously and fairly and, crucially, with the supporting evidence."" Maitlis's introduction also said the ""public mood"" was ""one of fury, contempt and anguish"". She continued: ""The prime minister knows all this. But despite the resignation of one minister, growing unease from his backbenchers, a dramatic early warning from the polls and a deep national disquiet, Boris Johnson has chosen to ignore it. ""Tonight we consider what this blind loyalty tells us about the workings of Number 10."" Dominic Cummings is Boris Johnson's most senior aide In a statement on Wednesday, the BBC said: ""While we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme. ""As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality."" On Thursday, media regulator Ofcom said it had received 247 complaints about Maitlis's opening remarks. Mr Cummings' 260-mile journey has been the focus of intense media scrutiny since coming to light last week. On Monday, the prime minister's most senior adviser explained that he decided to make the trip because he felt it would be better to self-isolate in a place where he had options for childcare if required. Boris Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into his adviser's conduct, insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row. On Thursday, police said Mr Cummings' trip from Durham to Barnard Castle, about 30 miles away, ""might have been minor breach"" of lockdown rules, but that no action would be taken against him. ""Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing"", the force said. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Nissan's UK factory in Sunderland will stay open as the Japanese carmaker carries out a global restructuring amid the coronavirus pandemic. The carmaker also announced it will close its factory in Barcelona with the loss of about 2,800 jobs, prompting protests at the Spanish plant. Hundreds of workers gathered as burning tyres blockaded the site which Nissan said would close from December. Nissan is cutting production amid falling sales and rising losses. On Thursday, the carmaker revealed a $6.2bn (Â£5bn) net loss in the last financial year - the worst result for more than a decade. How can the car industry hope to recover? US ex-Green Beret arrested over Ghosn escape Nissan is part of a three-way alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi, which are restructuring global operations to enable them to work more closely and cut costs. As part of its plans, Nissan said it would focus on several ""key markets"", including Japan, North America and China. Its boss said that it will ""sustain"" its presence in Europe but will leave more room for alliance partners there, such as Renault. The Sunderland plant employs about 7,000 people There has been speculation that Renault could switch some production to the Sunderland factory. Nissan chief executive Makoto Uchida said the company would maintain production at its Sunderland plant. It will begin building cars there again in June, after production was paused due to coronavirus-related lockdown measures. Before the suspension, the factory was preparing for production of the next-generation Qashqai, due out next year. The factory, the UK's biggest car plant, employs about 7,000 people. Mr Uchida described the closure of the Barcelona factory as ""a very difficult decision"". The factory and its nearby facilities employ about 3,000 workers, but the closures could indirectly affect as many as 22,000 jobs, unions have said. ""The loss of the jobs of our Spanish colleagues is a regrettable reminder that automotive manufacturing is facing tremendous challenges,"" said Steve Bush, national officer for automotive at the Unite union. Protestors burned tyres in front of Nissan's plant in Barcelona which is being closed down Some staff in the Barcelona plant started an indefinite strike in early May after initial plans outlined a 20% cut to the workforce. Mr Bush added that Unite is seeking assurances from Nissan ""that the cost-cutting measures spoken about will not impact on our members' jobs, terms and conditions or other benefits at Europe's most efficient plant, Sunderland."" This is good news. For today, Nissan workers can breathe a sigh of relief that Sunderland has been recognised as an important production facility for the future. However, lots of questions remain. Nissan has identified Japan, North America and China as ""core"" markets - not Europe. In Europe, Nissan's alliance partner Renault will assume a greater role and influence in Europe at a time when the global car market will have to make very aggressive cost reductions. The question may arise in the future - who is really in charge in Europe? If it's Renault, what does that mean for future investment in a post-Brexit UK? Nissan alone said it had capacity to make seven million cars when it only needs capacity for five million. Only plants that can demonstrate an ability to be ruthless about cost will continue to attract investment. As Professor David Bailey tweeted this morning: ""Once again, the workforce will have to pull out all the stops to work flexibly to get costs down"". So, some belt tightening ahead, but workers in Sunderland will be thankful they are not in the same position as their counterparts in Spain and Indonesia, where plants closed down. On Thursday, Nissan also outlined plans to reduce the range of models of cars and trucks available in order to cut costs. It said it would reduce the number of models from 69 to about 55 over the next few years, focusing instead on electric vehicles and sports cars. Nissan said that worldwide sales of its vehicles between January and April had dropped by 31.1% in comparison with the same period last year. But even before the Covid-19 outbreak, Nissan's sales and profits had been falling, forcing it to pull back from the ambitious expansion plan devised by now-ousted leader Carlos Ghosn. Ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn fled from Japan to Lebanon in December The carmaker's operating profit had tumbled for four years in a row as it chased market share, particularly in America, leading to overcapacity at its car plants and steep discounts. The pandemic added yet more pressure on the company to step up its cost-cutting efforts. On Thursday the company said it was too difficult to forecast its performance in the next year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Uchida said that the firm's key focus during the pandemic was now to ""pursue steady growth"", instead of the massive sales expansion it pursued in the past.

"EasyJet has said it will cut up to 30% of its workforce - about 4,500 jobs - as it struggles with a collapse in air travel caused by the virus pandemic. The airline did not say exactly how many jobs would go, but it employed 15,000 people at the start of 2020. Pilots' union Balpa reacted angrily, describing the move as an ""ill-considered knee-jerk reaction"". EasyJet, which has big operations at Gatwick and Luton airports, confirmed it would restart flights on 15 June. However, it said that levels of market demand seen in 2019 were not likely to be reached again until 2023. It added that in the coming days, it would launch an employee consultation process on the planned job cuts. It grounded its entire fleet in March as global travel came to a near-halt. ""To effect the restructure of our business, EasyJet will shortly launch an employee consultation process on proposals to reduce staff numbers by up to 30%, reflecting the reduced fleet, the optimisation of our network and bases, improved productivity as well as the promotion of more efficient ways of working,"" the firm said. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term. He said the airline was planning to reduce the size of its fleet and would continue to cut costs. ""We want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than before, so that easyJet can thrive in the future."" What are the new quarantine rules? When will I be able to go on holiday? Other airlines have already announced job cuts and restructuring programmes as they fight to stay in business. These include: British Airways, which is set to cutup to 12,000 jobsfrom its 42,000-strong workforce Ryanair, which is set to cut3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce- with boss Michael O'Leary saying the move is ""the minimum that we need just to survive the next 12 months"" Virgin Atlantic, which has announcedit is to cut more than 3,000 jobs in the UKout of a total of 10,000 and end its operation at Gatwick airport. The travel industry's hopes of reopening for business as global lockdowns ease have been dealt a blow by the UK government's plan to introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals. From 8 June, people entering the UK from abroad, including returning holidaymakers, will be told to isolate for 14 days or face a Â£1,000 fine. In a letter to the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, hotels and holiday firms said the policy would reduce visitor numbers and could make it harder for Britons to travel abroad. Travel firms say quarantine plan must be scrapped Meanwhile, tour operator Tui has said all its holidays for UK customers will now be suspended until at least the end of June. It had previously cancelled all trips up to 11 June. It has also suspended its Marella Cruises sailings until 30 July. Rival tour operator Jet2holidays has also suspended its holidays until 30 June. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against all but essential international travel. ""EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only two days ago, staff got a 'good news' message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth,"" said Brian Strutton of Balpa. ""Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. EasyJet has not discussed its plans with Balpa, so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK,"" he added. ""EasyJet's own projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023, so this is a temporary problem that doesn't need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction."" Lindsey Olliver, the EasyJet officer for the Unite union, said the airline had made ""an unnecessarily hasty decision"". She added: ""The workforce is currently furloughed under the government's job retention scheme and the airline will continue to receive support until at least October. ""It has also received a government-backed loan of Â£600m and has committed to expenditure on new aircraft."" She said Unite did not know where the job losses were planned and would be seeking ""clarification"" from the company. EasyJet reaffirmed thatit would be introducing security measuresto protect against the spread of coronavirus when it resumes flights. These include requiring passengers and crew to wear masks and not offering on-board meals. The airline said it would release half-year results, covering the six months to the end of March, on 30 June.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: People in Scotland can meet family and friends from Friday People in Scotland will be able to meet their friends and family outside from Friday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. Ms Sturgeon said people from two different households will be able to meet, but must keep two metres apart. They must also remain outdoors, and in groups of no more than eight. People are still being urged to ""stay at home as much as possible"", with Ms Sturgeon warning that the virus ""is still out there"". The lockdown easing was announced as Ms Sturgeon confirmed the country was ready to introduce the first phase of its four-phase ""route map"" towards reopening society while attempting to suppress the virus. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest developments What can you do in Scotland from Friday? Read the new rules on social distancing,external Coronavirus rates 'similar' across UK Scotland has been in lockdown since 23 March, and did not make major changes to restrictions when they were announced for England earlier this month. Ms Sturgeon said there had now been a ""sustained and unmistakable"" downward trend in the spread of the virus over a number of weeks, meaning changes could now be made. But she warned that ""we have limited room for manoeuvre"" and ""need to get the balance right"". Ms Sturgeon said ""most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume"" from Friday. This will see garden centres opening their doors again and site preparation beginning in the construction industry, with recycling centres re-opening from Monday. Also from Monday, teachers and other staff will be able to return to schools to prepare for re-opening - although most pupils will not return until 11 August, when they will begin a ""blended model"" of education which will see learning split between the classroom and home. Golf course will be able to open to the public from Friday Some outdoor leisure activities where physical distancing can be maintained will be allowed from Friday - including golf, tennis, bowls and fishing. People will be allowed to sit out and sunbathe in parks and open areas, and travel within their local area for exercise - although there is ""strong advice"" not to travel more than five miles for leisure. Ms Sturgeon said she did not want to see large numbers of people heading to beauty spots, warning that ""crowds bring more risk than we judge is acceptable or safe at this point"". Members of two different households will be allowed to meet up so long as they remain outdoors ""in a park or private garden"" and stay 2m (6ft) apart. Ms Sturgeon said the total number of people taking part in any meeting should not exceed eight, and that it was ""strongly recommended that you don't meet with more than one other household per day"". She also warned people not to enter each other's houses or to share picnic or barbecue materials, saying this could create ""a bridge for the virus to spread from one household to another"". She said: ""Please remember that we should still be meeting far fewer people outside your own household than we would in normal times."" The first minister said she was ""a bit nervous"" that limited changes to the rules could ""lead to much greater change in reality"", asking people to ""please, please respect the parameters we are setting out"". She said people should continue to ""stay at home as much as possible"", adding: ""The virus is still out there - lockdown is being modified slightly, but it is not over."" The first minister confirmed the easing of lockdown in Scotland at a podium bearing the words ""stay at home"". She is not switching to ""stay alert"" or some other formulation at this stage. When I asked her if the retained messaging still applied, Nicola Sturgeon insisted staying at home as much as you can remains the starting point. What the new guidance published by the Scottish government does is to expand the range of reasonable reasons why you might leave the house. That inevitably means that as we move into this new phase, ministers are counting on you to follow guidance and exercise good judgement, responsibility, restraint. They hope that works and that new legally enforceable rules are not required. But as the deputy first minister, John Swinney, put it earlier today - the gradual easing of lockdown is not a free for all. The changes do not change the circumstances of those in the ""shielding"" group, those who are most vulnerable to the virus. Ms Sturgeon said she realised this would be ""hard"" for them, and said ministers were trying ""to move to less of a blanket approach"". She said: ""I want you to know today that you have not been forgotten, and you are a central part of our thinking as we consider how we move forward."" The Scottish government has identifiedfour phases for easing the restrictions,external: Phase 1:Virus not yet contained but cases are falling. From 28 May you should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2:Virus controlled. You can meet larger groups outdoors, and meet another household indoors. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops can resume work. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3:Virus suppressed.  You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4:Virus no longer a significant threat. University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. The easing measures were announced as Scotland launched its new nation-wide ""test and protect"" system of tracing and isolating people who may have the virus. Anyone withsymptoms of the virusshould ""take immediate steps"" to book a test through the NHS. If someone tests positive for Covid-19, contact tracers will get in touch with those they have been in close proximity to, advising them to self-isolate for 14 days. Ms Sturgeon said test and protect was a ""crucial part"" of the government's strategy to suppress the virus, but said people should still exercise caution. She said taking precautions like hand washing, the use of face coverings and social distancing ""matters even more"" as rules begin to be relaxed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"On Tuesday's Newsnight, Emily Maitlis said the row had caused ""a deep national disquiet"" Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis has said she did not present the BBC Two programme on Wednesday because she had ""asked for the night off"". She was responding to suggestions that the BBC had replaced her after ruling her introduction about Dominic Cummings on Tuesdaybroke impartiality rules. The BBC said her wording ""risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides, and expressing an opinion"". But the corporation insisted she had not been removed or suspended.

Maitlis is not scheduled to present the show again this week - Emma Barnett is fronting Thursday's programme, with Kirsty Wark on Friday. In a statement on Thursday, the BBC said its public ruling about Maitlis's script was not about ""apportioning blame to anyone"". It said: ""Our editorial guidelines allow us to make professional judgments but not to express opinion. ""The dividing line can be fine, but we aim to say so if we think we have overstepped the mark. ""The introduction to Newsnight was intended as a summary of the issues that would be explored, with all the supporting facts and evidence, in the programme. But as broadcast, it risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides, and expressing an opinion, rather than being impartial. ""It said that 'the country' was 'shocked the government cannot see' Dominic Cummings broke lockdown rules; that he 'made those who struggled to keep the rules feel like fools'. ""But there are some who do not share this opinion, nor think that the issue is a 'scandal' or the prime minister has displayed 'blind loyalty'. ""By presenting a matter of public and political debate as if the country was unanimous in its view, we consider Newsnight risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides - or that the introduction constituted the presenter's opinions, rather than a summary of the journalism which would follow, which explored these issues rigorously and fairly and, crucially, with the supporting evidence."" Maitlis's introduction also said the ""public mood"" was ""one of fury, contempt and anguish"". She continued: ""The prime minister knows all this. But despite the resignation of one minister, growing unease from his backbenchers, a dramatic early warning from the polls and a deep national disquiet, Boris Johnson has chosen to ignore it. ""Tonight we consider what this blind loyalty tells us about the workings of Number 10."" Dominic Cummings is Boris Johnson's most senior aide In a statement on Wednesday, the BBC said: ""While we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme. ""As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality."" On Thursday, media regulator Ofcom said it had received 247 complaints about Maitlis's opening remarks. Mr Cummings' 260-mile journey has been the focus of intense media scrutiny since coming to light last week. On Monday, the prime minister's most senior adviser explained that he decided to make the trip because he felt it would be better to self-isolate in a place where he had options for childcare if required. Boris Johnson has ruled out an inquiry into his adviser's conduct, insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row. On Thursday, police said Mr Cummings' trip from Durham to Barnard Castle, about 30 miles away, ""might have been minor breach"" of lockdown rules, but that no action would be taken against him. ""Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing"", the force said. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

We're wrapping up our rolling coverage until tomorrow, but in you can still get updates throughout the BBC News website. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the day's top stories.  Today's coverage was brought to you by our reporters in Singapore, the UK, and Washington DC: Saira Asher, Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Andreas Illmer, Sean Fanning, Hugo Bachega, George Wright, Hamish Mackay, Becky Morton, Deirdre Finnerty, Rob Greenall, Saj Chowdhury, Neil Johnston, Michael Emons, Josh Cheetham and Max Matza. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Moscowâs health department has doubled the official count of Covid-19 deaths in April to over 1500. It says this new tally comes after post mortem examinations confirmed coronavirus in dozens of cases where a Covid test had initially been negative, and in hundreds of cases where an autopsy determined that the virus was a significant factor in causing death, even when a patient had other illnesses. This new methodology is being recommended to Russiaâs regions and is likely to mean the death tally increases across the country, although Moscow was the epicentre of the epidemic for many weeks. A few weeks ago, when reporters here suggested the official numbers were too low after seeing excess mortality figures, they were accused of fake news and distortion. Moscowâs health department is stressing that even the new count puts the Covid-19 mortality rate for the city under 3% - suggesting thatâs well below comparable cities. But it also concedes that the figures for May will be higher. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has revealed how his son violated a government dusk-to-dawn curfew order issued to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He said one of his two sons, whom he did not identify, recently went out to party at night in the coastal city of Mombasa - an epicentre of infections in the country. Social gatherings are prohibited in the East African country. The government has also restricted movement in and out of the capital, Nairobi, and three other coastal counties, including Mombasa, where the first family and the president's mother are currently living. Kenyatta said he gave his son a dressing down for risking the life of his grandmother Ngina Kenyatta. ""You've had your fun and enjoyed yourself, but now you've come back and you're with your grandmother, your grandmother is 80 plus,"" the president said. ""If something happens to your grandmother as a result of what you have done - how will you live with yourself?"" In an interview, the president said no-one was immune to coronavirus containment measures, although he has been criticised for not taking his son to a quarantine centre like other Kenyans who violate the curfew.

The director has shot a new home-made short film about his experiences of isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic. It premiered on Thursday's edition ofLockdown Culture on BBC Two.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that he will sign an executive order to allow private store owners to refuse service to customers not wearing a mask. The move marks a significant ramping up of anti-virus measures in the state, which continues to report the highest number of cases and deaths in America. Until now, masks have only been legally required in situations where people cannot maintain a six-foot (1.8 metre) distance from each other. He announced the move at a press conference today, where he was joined by comedian Chris Rock and actress Rosie Perez. Mr Cuomo joked that he had brought the pair as ""reinforcements"" because he wasn't ""cool enough"" to make people heed his advice over masks and coronavirus testing. âThe numbers in our community are staggering,"" said Ms Perez, in a message partially delivered in Spanish. ""This is not a joke, this is not a hoax. This is real.â Chris Rock added that, based on what he'd observed in New York City, âthe kids really arenât wearing the masks. âIâm just hoping to help. I have complete trust in the governor. Weâre soldiers for New York,"" said Mr Rock. Governor Greg Abbott has announced that, from Friday, sports fans will be able to attend outdoor professional sports events in most Texas counties. In a proclamation, Abbott said that venues would have to be capped to 25% capacity, and received approval from the Texas Department of State Health Services. But fans will still be banned from attending indoor sporting events, and the rules do not address college and high school sports. It comes as Texas - America's second-most populous state - rolls out a series of measures to reopen its economy. More than 59,000 confirmed cases have been reported there, making it one of the worst-affected states in the country. Martin PatienceMiddle East correspondent For the past two months, Khaldoon Rifaa has not been able to work as a driver because of Lebanon's lockdown. He is now back on the road, operating a minivan along the coastal motorway from his home city of Tripoli to the capital, Beirut. But standing on the street, he is struggling to find any paying customers to fill up his vehicle. ""Before my life was good,"" says the father-of-five. ""I'd work and I could feed my children."" ""But now, there's no work - there's nothing. I don't even have the money to buy washing powder."" Like many others in Lebanon, he has suddenly been plunged into poverty in a country that has hit breaking point. Some are warning thatthe scale of the catastrophe may be more devastating than the 15-year civil war,external, which raged from 1975 to 1990. Even before coronavirus hit, Lebanon was experiencing the worst economic crisis in the country's history, which triggered large anti-government protests late last year. Read more here. Lebanon has been rocked by anti-government protests for months Doctors protest outside an Ice jail in Florida on 1 May A lawyer for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has admitted in court that the agency is not testing prisoners for Covid-19 before transferring them to other jails unless they are showing symptoms of the illness. ""If the individual is actively ill, if the individual has tested positive or showing symptoms, they are not cleared for travel and they will not be transferred until those issues are resolved,â said assistant US Attorney Dexter Lee in a video court hearing,the Miami Herald reported,external. ""The problem is that there are individuals who are asymptomatic and they may be positive for coronavirus,â he added. The ongoing case is over a Florida judge's order that Ice reduce its local prison population to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Immigration advocates argue that Ice found a ""loophole"" by transferring them to jails in other states. Several recent outbreaks at Ice detention centres have been traced to recent transfers, according to US media. According to their website, Ice currently has 25,911 migrant detainees. The website adds that around half of the 2,620 inmates who have been tested were found to be positive.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson laid out details of a plan to begin an easing of lockdown restrictions in England from next week. We've made a chart detailing what the government is proposing over the next few weeks. Mr Johnson said that, despite the slight relaxation of rules on meeting people outside, those in England deemed most vulnerable to Covid-19 should continue to shield themselves for now.  Clap for Carers founder Annemarie Plas joined the tenth - and perhaps final - applause in south London In Glasgow, they played Dancing in the Streets as they applauded A Salvation Army Centre delivering food parcels also joined the applause Some people gathered outside the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital to applaud People all over the country are stepping out into their gardens, onto their balconies or just leaning out of a window to applaud NHS workers, care home staff and other key workers for their efforts during the pandemic. It may be the last time the nation takes part in the weekly ritual after founder Annemarie Plas saidthe 10th week of clapping would be a good time for it to end. As it approaches 20:00 BST, people in the United Kingdom prepare to Clap for Carers, as has happened every Thursday during the lockdown. The campaign originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown. However, after proving very popular, it was expanded to cover all key workers and has continued at the same time every Thursday.  At a White House briefing on Thursday, spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany defended states' decisions to reopen, saying ""everything does not depend on a vaccine"". ""There's therapeutics,"" she added. She also defended President Donald Trump's tweet commemorating the 100,000 US death toll, which went out the day after the number was passed, and said she had not discussed with Trump the idea of making a vaccine mandatory once it becomes available. McEnany said flags being lowered to half-mast on federal buildings during the previous Memorial Day weekend was an acknowledgment of the growing death toll. She also slammed the perceived liberal bias of US tech companies, after Twitter issued a fact-check label on two of Trump's tweets. She specifically accused Google of allowing China ""to spread misinformation about the coronavirus"".Trump is expected to sign an executive order targeting tech companies later today. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Boris Johnson deflects Dominic Cummings questions to scientists Prime Minister Boris Johnson intervened during Thursday's daily coronvirus briefing to prevent advisers Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance answering questions about his aide, Dominic Cummings. Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""protect them"" from ""an unnecessary attempt to ask a political question"". After several reporters had asked similar questions, both men said they had no wish to get involved in politics. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News About 7% of people in England have previously been infected with coronavirus, antibody tests on a random sample of households suggest. The new data was released bythe Office for National Statistics study,externaland is based on blood samples taken from 885 people from private households after 26 April. The study estimates that about one in 15 people in England have had the virus. These tests detect antibodies which form in the blood when the body fights infections such as Covid-19. The same survey also found that an estimated 133,000 people are currently infected with the virus - 0.24% of the population. Read more: About 7% have had coronavirus, says ONS survey Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hong Kong police confronted pro-democracy protesters on Wednesday China's parliament has backed security legislation for Hong Kong which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory. The resolution - which now passes to China's senior leadership - has caused deep concern among those who say it could end Hong Kong's unique status. It could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time. The move has already sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protest. Clashes broke out on Wednesday as Hong Kong's parliament debated a different proposed law, which would make it a crime to disrespect the Chinese national anthem. Hundreds of people were arrested in protests over that and the security law. Security remains high on Thursday, as a tense debate in the Legislative Council continues. At least two pro-democracy legislators were ejected from the council on Thursday. One lawmaker, Ted Hui, threw rotten plants on to the floor of the chamber, saying it symbolised the decay of Hong Kong's political system. ""I want the speaker to feel what is meant by rotten,"" he said. The speaker deemed the package to be an ""unknown dangerous object"", and called police and fire crews. Firefighters check the Legislative Council chamber after a lawmaker threw foul-smelling plants on to the floor Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September. But hours before the vote was taken in Beijing, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it couldno longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China. That meant that Hong Kong no longer merited being treated differently from the mainland under US law. The declaration could have major implications for Hong Kong's trade hub status and drew an angry reaction from Chinese authorities in the territory. In a strongly worded statement on Thursday, the office of China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong said it ""firmly opposed and refuted"" Mr Pompeo's statement and urged the US to ""immediately stop meddling"" in China's internal affairs. It described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless"". Twitter fact-checks China amid bias row President Xi Jinping and other senior figures applauded when the security law was passed On Friday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the UK was ""deeply concerned"" about the new security law, which ""risks undermining the principle of 'one nations, two systems'"". Japan said it was ""seriously concerned"" by Beijing's move. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Hong Kong was an ""extremely important partner"" and that democracy and stability there must be maintained. The National People's Congress (NPC) - meeting in Beijing after a two-month delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic - backed the security bill resolution with 2,878 votes in favour, one against and six abstentions. ""It will uphold and improve the 'one country, two systems' policy,"" NPC chairman Li Zhanshu told delegates during the closing ceremony. ""It is in line with the constitution and Hong Kong's Basic Law and is in the interest of all Chinese people including Hong Kong people,"" he added. The NPC only ever approves legislation put to it by the government so there was no chance the bill would not be supported. The legislation - referred to as the Draft Decision - now passes to the Standing Committee of the Communist Party which will draw up the full details of the new law. It is expected to criminalise: secession - breaking away from the country subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong The resolution also says that ""when needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law"". That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own. The authorities in Hong Kong insist the law is essential to tackle growing violence and ""terrorism"", and that the territory's residents have nothing to fear from it. Critics fear it could lead to Hong Kongers being prosecuted - even retroactively - for criticising their or the mainland's leadership, joining protests or exercising their current rights under local laws. Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How is Hong Kong run? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests HK leader dismisses concerns over freedoms They are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has. This video can not be played Police arrested dozens of people in Causeway Bay on Wednesday Under the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact its own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law. But its unpopularity meant it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests. Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement. China is keen to avoid a repeat of that unrest.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: People in Scotland can meet family and friends from Friday People in Scotland will be able to meet their friends and family outside from Friday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. Ms Sturgeon said people from two different households will be able to meet, but must keep two metres apart. They must also remain outdoors, and in groups of no more than eight. People are still being urged to ""stay at home as much as possible"", with Ms Sturgeon warning that the virus ""is still out there"". The lockdown easing was announced as Ms Sturgeon confirmed the country was ready to introduce the first phase of its four-phase ""route map"" towards reopening society while attempting to suppress the virus. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest developments What can you do in Scotland from Friday? Read the new rules on social distancing,external Coronavirus rates 'similar' across UK Scotland has been in lockdown since 23 March, and did not make major changes to restrictions when they were announced for England earlier this month. Ms Sturgeon said there had now been a ""sustained and unmistakable"" downward trend in the spread of the virus over a number of weeks, meaning changes could now be made. But she warned that ""we have limited room for manoeuvre"" and ""need to get the balance right"". Ms Sturgeon said ""most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume"" from Friday. This will see garden centres opening their doors again and site preparation beginning in the construction industry, with recycling centres re-opening from Monday. Also from Monday, teachers and other staff will be able to return to schools to prepare for re-opening - although most pupils will not return until 11 August, when they will begin a ""blended model"" of education which will see learning split between the classroom and home. Golf course will be able to open to the public from Friday Some outdoor leisure activities where physical distancing can be maintained will be allowed from Friday - including golf, tennis, bowls and fishing. People will be allowed to sit out and sunbathe in parks and open areas, and travel within their local area for exercise - although there is ""strong advice"" not to travel more than five miles for leisure. Ms Sturgeon said she did not want to see large numbers of people heading to beauty spots, warning that ""crowds bring more risk than we judge is acceptable or safe at this point"". Members of two different households will be allowed to meet up so long as they remain outdoors ""in a park or private garden"" and stay 2m (6ft) apart. Ms Sturgeon said the total number of people taking part in any meeting should not exceed eight, and that it was ""strongly recommended that you don't meet with more than one other household per day"". She also warned people not to enter each other's houses or to share picnic or barbecue materials, saying this could create ""a bridge for the virus to spread from one household to another"". She said: ""Please remember that we should still be meeting far fewer people outside your own household than we would in normal times."" The first minister said she was ""a bit nervous"" that limited changes to the rules could ""lead to much greater change in reality"", asking people to ""please, please respect the parameters we are setting out"". She said people should continue to ""stay at home as much as possible"", adding: ""The virus is still out there - lockdown is being modified slightly, but it is not over."" The first minister confirmed the easing of lockdown in Scotland at a podium bearing the words ""stay at home"". She is not switching to ""stay alert"" or some other formulation at this stage. When I asked her if the retained messaging still applied, Nicola Sturgeon insisted staying at home as much as you can remains the starting point. What the new guidance published by the Scottish government does is to expand the range of reasonable reasons why you might leave the house. That inevitably means that as we move into this new phase, ministers are counting on you to follow guidance and exercise good judgement, responsibility, restraint. They hope that works and that new legally enforceable rules are not required. But as the deputy first minister, John Swinney, put it earlier today - the gradual easing of lockdown is not a free for all. The changes do not change the circumstances of those in the ""shielding"" group, those who are most vulnerable to the virus. Ms Sturgeon said she realised this would be ""hard"" for them, and said ministers were trying ""to move to less of a blanket approach"". She said: ""I want you to know today that you have not been forgotten, and you are a central part of our thinking as we consider how we move forward."" The Scottish government has identifiedfour phases for easing the restrictions,external: Phase 1:Virus not yet contained but cases are falling. From 28 May you should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2:Virus controlled. You can meet larger groups outdoors, and meet another household indoors. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops can resume work. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3:Virus suppressed.  You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4:Virus no longer a significant threat. University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. The easing measures were announced as Scotland launched its new nation-wide ""test and protect"" system of tracing and isolating people who may have the virus. Anyone withsymptoms of the virusshould ""take immediate steps"" to book a test through the NHS. If someone tests positive for Covid-19, contact tracers will get in touch with those they have been in close proximity to, advising them to self-isolate for 14 days. Ms Sturgeon said test and protect was a ""crucial part"" of the government's strategy to suppress the virus, but said people should still exercise caution. She said taking precautions like hand washing, the use of face coverings and social distancing ""matters even more"" as rules begin to be relaxed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"EasyJet has said it will cut up to 30% of its workforce - about 4,500 jobs - as it struggles with a collapse in air travel caused by the virus pandemic. The airline did not say exactly how many jobs would go, but it employed 15,000 people at the start of 2020. Pilots' union Balpa reacted angrily, describing the move as an ""ill-considered knee-jerk reaction"". EasyJet, which has big operations at Gatwick and Luton airports, confirmed it would restart flights on 15 June. However, it said that levels of market demand seen in 2019 were not likely to be reached again until 2023. It added that in the coming days, it would launch an employee consultation process on the planned job cuts. It grounded its entire fleet in March as global travel came to a near-halt. ""To effect the restructure of our business, EasyJet will shortly launch an employee consultation process on proposals to reduce staff numbers by up to 30%, reflecting the reduced fleet, the optimisation of our network and bases, improved productivity as well as the promotion of more efficient ways of working,"" the firm said. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term. He said the airline was planning to reduce the size of its fleet and would continue to cut costs. ""We want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than before, so that easyJet can thrive in the future."" What are the new quarantine rules? When will I be able to go on holiday? Other airlines have already announced job cuts and restructuring programmes as they fight to stay in business. These include: British Airways, which is set to cutup to 12,000 jobsfrom its 42,000-strong workforce Ryanair, which is set to cut3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce- with boss Michael O'Leary saying the move is ""the minimum that we need just to survive the next 12 months"" Virgin Atlantic, which has announcedit is to cut more than 3,000 jobs in the UKout of a total of 10,000 and end its operation at Gatwick airport. The travel industry's hopes of reopening for business as global lockdowns ease have been dealt a blow by the UK government's plan to introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals. From 8 June, people entering the UK from abroad, including returning holidaymakers, will be told to isolate for 14 days or face a Â£1,000 fine. In a letter to the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, hotels and holiday firms said the policy would reduce visitor numbers and could make it harder for Britons to travel abroad. Travel firms say quarantine plan must be scrapped Meanwhile, tour operator Tui has said all its holidays for UK customers will now be suspended until at least the end of June. It had previously cancelled all trips up to 11 June. It has also suspended its Marella Cruises sailings until 30 July. Rival tour operator Jet2holidays has also suspended its holidays until 30 June. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against all but essential international travel. ""EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only two days ago, staff got a 'good news' message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth,"" said Brian Strutton of Balpa. ""Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. EasyJet has not discussed its plans with Balpa, so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK,"" he added. ""EasyJet's own projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023, so this is a temporary problem that doesn't need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction."" Lindsey Olliver, the EasyJet officer for the Unite union, said the airline had made ""an unnecessarily hasty decision"". She added: ""The workforce is currently furloughed under the government's job retention scheme and the airline will continue to receive support until at least October. ""It has also received a government-backed loan of Â£600m and has committed to expenditure on new aircraft."" She said Unite did not know where the job losses were planned and would be seeking ""clarification"" from the company. EasyJet reaffirmed thatit would be introducing security measuresto protect against the spread of coronavirus when it resumes flights. These include requiring passengers and crew to wear masks and not offering on-board meals. The airline said it would release half-year results, covering the six months to the end of March, on 30 June.

Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent It could be the most important job of our times. And now, after receiving a 95% pass rate in my final exam, I can proudly say, I am a qualified contact tracer. What is not clear is just how well trained most of the people undertaking this vital task in the UK will be. A contact tracer does the detective work of calling up people known to be infected with a disease and working out where they have been in recent days and who they might have met. The idea is then to track down those with whom they have been in close proximity and tell them to go into quarantine. Read about my contact tracing traininghere. A driver on the Tyne and Wear Metro has described working during lockdown as ""very strange"", and paid tribute to key workers who have to rely on public transport. The network recently received asecond government bailout to keep it runningwhile passenger numbers are low due to coronavirus. Craig Pearson, who has been driving trains for seven years, said the past few weeks had been ""challenging but also rewarding because I feel like I am playing my part in helping the country at a time of crisis"". The 37-year-old, from Gateshead, said: ""There are many NHS staff and other
essential workers relying on the Metro... we get a lot of supermarket workers
still travelling too."" However, with people being told only to travel when it is essential, he described it as ""eerily quiet"". ""Itâs a strange thing for us to see.â The government hopes a free NHS smartphone app will work in tandem with manual tracing which launched today. The app was originally due to be rolled out nationwide in mid-May, but ministers now say it will be ready ''in the coming weeks''. Everyone with a smartphone will be asked to download the app, which will run in the background of their phone, provided Bluetooth is switched on. If a user develops coronavirus symptoms, it is up to them to let the app inform the NHS. That message may trigger an anonymous alert to other users with whom they recently had significant contact, potentially asking them to go into quarantine or be tested. You can read morehere.

Clap for Carers - which originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff - has taken place every Thursday at 20:00 for the past 10 weeks of lockdown. Tonight's, however, could be the last as Annemarie Plas,who is credited with starting the nationwide applause, said it has ""had its moment""and should end. The first event on 26 March, three days after the UK went into lockdown, proved very popular, and it was eventually expanded to cover all key workers and has continued every week, with people peering out of their windows or standing on their doorsteps to show their appreciation by clapping, cheering, banging saucepans and playing instruments.

"Charity shops fear they will be deluged by donations when they start to reopen in just over two weeks. English stores will start opening their doors on 15 June, in line with government guidance. But they face a number of challenges after the coronavirus closures with all new offerings set to be quarantined for 72 hours. Robin Osterley, chief executive of the Charity Retail Association, says shops are expecting to be ""full to bursting"". The UK's 11,000 charity shops help raise almost Â£300m for good causes each year. Many people in lockdown have taken the opportunity to clean out their homes. Mr Osterley said: ""We're not just anticipating a normal three months' worth of donations but also the extra stuff that people may have picked out to donate during their clean-ups."" He urged people to ""be thoughtful about the sorts of things you're donating"". Barnardo's, one of the country's leading charity shop chains, is advising customers to call their local store to ensure the shop is able to take the items, in order to help manage the expected influx. Oxfam is asking customers to stagger donations to avoid items being left outside: ""We welcome that many people are taking the opportunity to de-clutter during lockdown and are asking people to hold on to those items and donate them when shops and donation banks are open again."" Coronavirus: When will shops open and what will the rules be? Who can I meet now? Can we stay safe as lockdown eases? ""Charity retailers are thinking carefully about which shops in their chains to open first,"" pointed out Vicki Burnett, senior consultant at the Charity Retail Consultancy. ""Many are planning a staged approach, opening the more simple-to-manage stores first and leaving the more challenging ones to later."" British Heart Foundation has the biggest branch network with 750 stores. ""From mid-June, we will reopen a small number of BHF shops to establish new safe ways of working with others to follow,"" said Allison Swaine-Hughes, retail director at British Heart Foundation. Barnardo's, the second-largest chain with 710 stores, will be opening 70 at first with a number of new safety measures. Oxfam, the third largest with around 650 shops, has yet to decide when to re-open stores: ""Our priority remains the health and wellbeing of our staff, volunteers and customers,"" the charity said. Cancer Research UK, with 600 stores, plans a phased-reopening from 29 June. ""We're planning significant safety measures and putting new processes in place to receive and handle donations,"" said Julie Byard, director of trading at Cancer Research UK. Charity shops rely on the UK's biggest army of volunteers to keep them going with 233,000 people all over the country lending a helping hand. But, in contrast to the excess of stock expected, here they are bracing for a shortage: ""We are expecting a temporary shortage of volunteers when shops re-open again,"" said Robin Osterley. ""Some may still be in isolation because of the Covid-19 crisis, while others may simply have fears of being out and about"" he pointed out. ""A large proportion of charity shop volunteers will be over 70 and therefore in the vulnerable category and it is inevitable that some volunteers may never return to the roles they had before lockdown,"" said Vicki Burnett. ""But lots of staff and volunteers are also desperate to get back to their shops, having missed the camaraderie and sense of purpose it provides, as well as to return to some form of normality."" There will be some recruitment activity going on over the coming months, she said. Charity shops have many fans who delight in being able to snap up good quality second-hand items at decent prices. But will they rush to return to the shops with coronavirus fears still in the air? ""I think it is very unlikely I'll be buying second-hand clothes again for a long time,"" said Elizabeth Mistry, a journalist and carer who is a keen user of charity shops. ""But I might not be able to resist nipping into Oxfam books just to see what they have - though it would have to be something really special in the short term to actually buy it."" Elizabeth is worried about where donations may have come from. ""Will future donors have to ID the donations for traceability?"" she asked. She is also concerned that the virus may last on cardboard or paper. ""I'd leave a book outside for a day or two in the sun - and even then I would wipe the cover and spine down before bringing it in."" Charity stores will be introducing extra hygiene to reassure customers, said Vicki Burnett. ""They already have great hygiene processes in their shops when it comes to sorting goods - items are washed, steamed or cleaned and this will only increase in the current situation."" Goods that come in will be isolated for 72 hours before being sorted. Which shops are reopening? Charity shop given Â£60k of designer goods.

"EasyJet has said it will cut up to 30% of its workforce - about 4,500 jobs - as it struggles with a collapse in air travel caused by the virus pandemic. The airline did not say exactly how many jobs would go, but it employed 15,000 people at the start of 2020. Pilots' union Balpa reacted angrily, describing the move as an ""ill-considered knee-jerk reaction"". EasyJet, which has big operations at Gatwick and Luton airports, confirmed it would restart flights on 15 June. However, it said that levels of market demand seen in 2019 were not likely to be reached again until 2023. It added that in the coming days, it would launch an employee consultation process on the planned job cuts. It grounded its entire fleet in March as global travel came to a near-halt. ""To effect the restructure of our business, EasyJet will shortly launch an employee consultation process on proposals to reduce staff numbers by up to 30%, reflecting the reduced fleet, the optimisation of our network and bases, improved productivity as well as the promotion of more efficient ways of working,"" the firm said. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term. He said the airline was planning to reduce the size of its fleet and would continue to cut costs. ""We want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than before, so that easyJet can thrive in the future."" What are the new quarantine rules? When will I be able to go on holiday? Other airlines have already announced job cuts and restructuring programmes as they fight to stay in business. These include: British Airways, which is set to cutup to 12,000 jobsfrom its 42,000-strong workforce Ryanair, which is set to cut3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce- with boss Michael O'Leary saying the move is ""the minimum that we need just to survive the next 12 months"" Virgin Atlantic, which has announcedit is to cut more than 3,000 jobs in the UKout of a total of 10,000 and end its operation at Gatwick airport. The travel industry's hopes of reopening for business as global lockdowns ease have been dealt a blow by the UK government's plan to introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals. From 8 June, people entering the UK from abroad, including returning holidaymakers, will be told to isolate for 14 days or face a Â£1,000 fine. In a letter to the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, hotels and holiday firms said the policy would reduce visitor numbers and could make it harder for Britons to travel abroad. Travel firms say quarantine plan must be scrapped Meanwhile, tour operator Tui has said all its holidays for UK customers will now be suspended until at least the end of June. It had previously cancelled all trips up to 11 June. It has also suspended its Marella Cruises sailings until 30 July. Rival tour operator Jet2holidays has also suspended its holidays until 30 June. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against all but essential international travel. ""EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only two days ago, staff got a 'good news' message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth,"" said Brian Strutton of Balpa. ""Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. EasyJet has not discussed its plans with Balpa, so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK,"" he added. ""EasyJet's own projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023, so this is a temporary problem that doesn't need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction."" Lindsey Olliver, the EasyJet officer for the Unite union, said the airline had made ""an unnecessarily hasty decision"". She added: ""The workforce is currently furloughed under the government's job retention scheme and the airline will continue to receive support until at least October. ""It has also received a government-backed loan of Â£600m and has committed to expenditure on new aircraft."" She said Unite did not know where the job losses were planned and would be seeking ""clarification"" from the company. EasyJet reaffirmed thatit would be introducing security measuresto protect against the spread of coronavirus when it resumes flights. These include requiring passengers and crew to wear masks and not offering on-board meals. The airline said it would release half-year results, covering the six months to the end of March, on 30 June.

"Nicola Sturgeon says it is now time to move to Phase 1 of easing lockdown restrictions From tomorrow people can meet with another household outdoors - recommending gatherings of no more than eight Also on Friday, people will be allowed to sunbathe and relax in places like the park, while social distancing Non-contact sports like golf, tennis and bowling will be allowed for the first time in more than eight weeks as part of the changes The R number - the measure of how infectious Covid-19 is - has been below one for a period of three weeks - and currently sits at between 0.7 and 1 The ""Test and Protect"" strategy to identify and isolate new cases is now up and running in Scotland BBC Scotland News Thanks for joining us on the coronavirus live page today. Here are the main stories of the day:  Join us again tomorrow morning for the latest developments. A scene from Glasgow's Botanic Gardens today Police have urged the public to avoid busy areas such as parks, beaches and lochs as lockdown measures are eased and temperatures rise. From tomorrow, Scots will be allowed to sunbathe, play certain non-contact sports and meet people from other households outdoors. ""We recognise that people have made significant sacrifices until now, and while the temptation may be to head straight for one of our beauty spots, we would ask people to use their judgement and avoid going to places which are normally busy during the good weather,â said Chief Constable Iain Livingstone. âWe want people to enjoy our outdoor spaces safely and our officers will be robustly tackling crime and anti-social behaviour in our communities.â He added that officers will continue to ""explain legislation and guidance"" to the public and ""encourage compliance."" âWe will use enforcement as a last resort only where there is a clear breach of the legislation,â he said. Coronavirus cases are falling at roughly the same rate across the UK, according to a leading scientist advising the government. Prof Graham Medley said there was no evidence of differences in the reproduction (R) number across the UK. Deaths and cases have fallen in every UK nation and region since early April. That suggests the R number - the measure of how many new people are infected by each case - is below one everywhere. The government is keeping a close eye on R as it reviews lockdown. If it goes above one, the epidemic will grow. Read more here. Donald Findlay says the Hearts plans don't address anything new and have already been rejected Four clubs in Leagues One and Two have told BBC Scotland they will vote against the proposal put forward by Hearts on reconstruction. The Edinburgh side, relegated from the Premiership after the season was called to an end prematurely due to the coronavirus, are advocating a change to three divisions of 14, away from the current 12-10-10-10 set up. But Cowdenbeath chairman Donald Findlay has described the Hearts plan as ""self-seeking"" and a ""non-starter"". Forfar Athletic, Peterhead, and Elgin City are already publicly opposed to the idea and if two more clubs from the bottom two tiers think the same way, it is destined to fail. ""This is all about Hearts not being prepared to accept relegation,"" said former Rangers chairman Findlay. Read more Garden
centre retailer Dobbies has announced it will reopen 12 stores across Scotland
on Friday following the Scottish government's updated guidance on lockdown restrictions. The company said social distancing
measures had been implemented to allow the stores to operate safely. A limited
number of customers will be permitted in the outlets at one time and a queuing system will
be in operation outside the stores. Hand sanitising and
trolley cleaning stations will also be available at the entrance of all stores. The restaurants and soft play areas will remain temporarily closed. Dobbies began reopening its other UK stores on 11 May. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Distancing measures are slightly different across Europe ""Walking past somebody on a pavement is not a high risk activity,"" Professor Robert Dingwall from Nottingham Trent University told Drivetime earlier. The sociologist was of the opinion that the two-metre distance rule was ""plucked out of the air"" at the start of the crisis. Professor Dingwall, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, told BBC Radio Scotland: ""It's one of those things that was put in place very hastily on the basis of a partial understanding of the available evidence. As time has gone on, it's justification has looked more threadbare."" He believes halving the physical distancing advice would benefit many businesses trying to get up and running again and says he expects the UK government to adopt this stance soon. Of the two-metre ruling, which remains a key element of Scotland's phase one out of lockdown, he says it is ""exaggerated, does unnecessary economic damage and inflates the fear factor"". He adds that one metre is ""effectively the international standard"", endorsed by the World Health Organisation and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland On contact tracing, John Swinney confirms people will be asked to go back over a two-week period. It will be important to think about the manner in which you are interact with people because of the definition of a contact, he adds. Another person has been in touch to ask about employers who are expecting parents to go back to work if kids are not back in school. The deputy first minister says it is important to ""establish harmony"" between the interests of business and of education. ""I would make a plea to employers to be flexible and accommodating for staff,"" he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Swinney says the five-mile driving rule is specifically to discourage people travelling to beauty spots.

This would allow tourists to travel between two countries without needing to quarantine. The UK is set to put in place these deals with places like Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Turkey, Mr Calder suggests.

"Thousands of contact tracers are making their first phone calls to track down people who will be told to self-isolate under new test and trace schemes being launched in England and Scotland. Tracers will text, email or call people who test positive with coronavirus and ask who they have had contact with. Any of those contacts deemed at risk of infection will be told to isolate for 14 days, even if they are not sick. Those who have already had the virus will also be asked to self-isolate. The aim of the system is to lift blanket lockdown restrictions and move towards more localised, targeted measures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was confident that the ""vast majority of people"" would participate in the voluntary system. ""In this war on the virus, ultimately we are all on the same side and we've all got a part that we can play,"" he said. The launch came as it was announced that some restrictions are to be easedin ScotlandandNorthern Ireland. How will contact tracing work in England? Scotland's plan for test and trace My new skill as a contact tracer The 25,000 tracers working for England's NHS Test and Trace team started by contacting the 2,013 people who tested positive for the virus on Wednesday. However, shortly after launching, some tracers said they were struggling to access the system. In a statement, the Department of Health insisted it had not crashed, adding: ""Some staff did initially encounter issues logging on to their systems and these are rapidly being resolved."" Trish Mannes, who leads a team of tracing specialists for Public Health England in the South East, told the BBC there had been a ""technical glitch"" but that overall the ""system seems to be working well"". She compared the contact tracing process to ""detective work"", using both ""technical knowledge"" and ""people skills"". ""The things that are important to me are empathy and ability to speak to people and get a rapport - remember we're asking people for a lot of detailed information, it takes time to get that information,"" she said. Share your experiences of being a contact tracer or someone who has been contacted byemailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Two MPs said they were told England's system would not be fully operational ""at local level"" until the end of June. Labour's Ben Bradshaw,externalandLib Dem Daisy Cooper,externalboth tweeted after a call with Baroness Dido Harding, the chairwoman of NHS Test and Trace. Downing Street said the test and trace system would ""improve"" over time but rejected suggestions the scheme had been launched early. But Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said hospital trust leaders were questioning the risk being run by easing the lockdown without having local systems in place. He also said it was ""never going to be the case"" that the UK would have a ""world-class"" test and trace system in place by June - in reference toa previous pledgemade by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Hopson said while work was progressing ""at pace"", the UK was ""weeks behind where we really ought to be"". An app to automatically alert people they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight but the government hopes to have that system up-and-running in England ""in the coming weeks"". The launch of Scotland's new Test and Protect system comes as First Minister Nicola Sturgeonannounced people from two different households will be able to meet outdoors from Friday. Northern Irelandhas its own version of the test and trace programme already. Wales' schemeis due to start in early June. Meanwhile, a further 377 people have died with coronavirus across all settings in the UK,daily figures released on Thursday showed,external. The total number of deaths in and outside of hospitals is now 37,837, the Department of Health said. Anyone who develops symptoms of coronavirus - a persistent cough, fever or a sudden loss of taste or sense of smell - has to isolate for seven days and the rest of their household for 14 days. This is in keeping with rules already in place. But from now on, everyone with symptoms shouldask for a test online,externalor phone to arrange a test by calling 119. If the test comes back negative, everyone in the household can go back to normal. But if the test comes back positive, the contact tracing team or local public health teams will get in touch - via text, email or phone call - to discuss whom the person has come into close contact with and places they have visited. Any of those contacts deemed at risk of catching the virus will be emailed or texted with instructions to go into isolation for 14 days, whether they are sick or not. They will be tested only if they develop symptoms. The rest of their household does not have to isolate, unless someone becomes ill. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Every single person can get a test"" Mr Hancock said people would have to self-isolate on more than one occasion if told to do so by the NHS. Those who have already had the virus must also self-isolate, as it is not known whether they can still transmit it. Only people who have been ""close"" to an infected person will be contacted by tracers. Close contacts are: people you spend 15 minutes or more with at a distance of less than 2m people you have direct contact with - such as sexual partners, household members or people with whom you have had face-to-face conversations at a distance of less than 1m The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in the daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday that it is the public's ""civic duty"" to follow the instructions of the NHS Test and Trace team. ""This will be voluntary at first because we trust everyone to do the right thing. But we can quickly make it mandatory if that's what it takes,"" he added. Scientists,including those advising the government, have warned that it will be harder to get public support for such measures in the wake ofthe row over the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. Mr Cummings was accused of breaking lockdown rules after driving 260 miles from London to County Durham because, he said, he was concerned about childcare for his son when his wife became ill. Those instructed to self-isolate will be eligible for statutory sick pay - Â£95.85 per week - but there are fears that many workers will not be able to live on that amount and will be forced to keep working. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to introduce ""enhanced"" sick pay, saying: ""There will be people whose work conditions and employment conditions make [self-isolating] difficult for them so they need that security."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called on the governmentto extend sick pay to everyone and raise it to the ""real living wage"" - Â£260 per week. She said the entire test and trace system would be ""undermined"" if workers were ""pushed into hardship"" when they were required to self-isolate. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The success of the scheme will depend on how quickly contacts can be found and whether members of the public follow instructions, a report published by the Royal Society said. It concluded that between 5% and 15% of infections could be prevented. But the 15% figure depends on finding contacts within three days and 80% of people reporting their symptoms or going into isolation when asked. By comparison, isolating cases and quarantining members of their household is thought to cut infections by 50%. Prof Anne Johnson, one of the report's authors, said the system ""is an important part in bringing the pandemic under control, but we're very clear it is not a magic bullet"". The national coordinator of NHS Test and Trace said the system requires rapid testing in order to be successful. However, after the prime minister said on Wednesday there was now a target to get test results in less than 24 hours, Prof John Newton added it would be ""very difficult"" to get home testing kit results in less than 48 hours. At the moment coronavirus is being suppressed by lockdown restrictions applied across the whole of society. Baroness Harding said the scheme was designed to allow national lockdown restrictions to be ""traded"" with individual isolation - allowing ""the vast majority to get on with their lives in a much more normal way"". Test and trace will also give far more detail on how and where the virus is spreading. Mr Hancock said this information could lead tolocal lockdowns to tackle flare-ups. Baroness Harding said data from anNHS contact tracing app being piloted on the Isle of Wight- which is not yet ready to be rolled out more widely - suggests people have been within 2m of fewer than five others for more than 15 minutes.

"US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order targeting social media firms, the White House has said. It comes after he threatened to shut down social media platforms he accused of stifling conservative voices. The latest dispute emerged after Twitter added fact-check links to his tweets for the first time. The order's details have not been shared and it is unclear what regulatory steps the president can take without new laws passed by Congress. White House officials gave no further information on what is expected in the executive order which is set to be signed on Thursday. Before leaving Washington for Florida to watcha space launch that was postponed due to bad weather, Mr Trump again accused Twitter and other social media of bias, without offering evidence. What are executive orders? Twitter tags Trump post with fact-checking warning Trump threatens to shut down social media firms Mr Trump also continued his criticism of social media platforms on Twitter, ending a tweet with: ""Now they are going absolutely CRAZY.

The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social media companies flared up again on Tuesday when one of his posts was given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time. He had tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent."" Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page that described the claims as ""unsubstantiated"". On Wednesday Mr Trump threatened to ""strongly regulate"" or even ""close down"" social media platforms. He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"" and that he would not allow this to happen. In an earlier tweet, he said that Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"". Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.""

Mr Trump wrote a similar post on Facebook about mail-in ballots on Tuesday, and no such warnings were applied. In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship. Fox said it would play its full interview with Mr Zuckerberg on Thursday. Twitter has tightened its policies in recent years as it faced criticism that its hands-off approach was helping fake accounts and misinformation to thrive. Some of America's biggest technology companies have also been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating their users' privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon face antitrust probes by federal and state authorities and a US congressional panel.

"Disney+ soaked up more than half of the new subscriptions to online streaming services in the UK during lockdown, Kantar's data suggests One in five households in Britain â six million â signed up to an online video subscription service during the Covid-19 lockdown, data suggests. The majority of those sign-ups, 52%, are going to Disney+, according to market research firm Kantar. The most-enjoyed piece of content, though, was Netflixâs exclusive documentary series Tiger King. AppleTV+ struggled to engage TV viewers, however, according to the research. Kantarâs data shows the tech giantâs TV service was popular on smartphone and tablet devices, but lagged behind competitors in terms of TV screen viewing. âItâs been a huge quarter for streaming in the UK. We can certainly associate a good deal of that with the current lockdown situation,â Dominic Sunnebo, senior vice president at Kantar, told the BBC. Mr Sunnebo also noted the instant popularity of Disney+, which only launched in the UK on 24 March. âOf people who are in the video streaming sector already, one in five now have a Disney+ streaming subscription,â he said. âItâs unheard of.â There are now, on average, 2.3 online video subscriptions per household in the UK. Although comparable data is not available for previous years, Mr Sunnebo said that because of the launch of new services such as Disney+, it was safe to assume that the average number of online video subscriptions had risen comfortably in the last couple of years. He added that 36% of new subscriptions between February and April â 2.2 million â were made by people who had never previously signed up to a streaming service. Kantarâs data is gathered from a panel of 15,000 consumers and interviews with 2,500 new streaming service subscribers each quarter. Apple struggled to make the same impact with TV viewers, however. Mr Sunnebo argued that this was probably because that easiest way to access Apple TV+ on a TV screen was through purchasing a separate device, the Apple TV media player. Appleâs strategy, he said, was to rely on slowly building an audience of viewers happy to pay for this hardware. âBy trying to drive Apple TV sales in the meantime, theyâre continuing to generate revenue and biding time to broaden their catalogue of content,â he added. Recent examples of this include the addition of old episodes of thechildren's show Fraggle Rockas well the commission of new ones. And,according to news site Deadline,external, Apple has just struck a deal to stream Martin Scorsese's forthcoming film Killers of the Flower Moon, which is set to feature Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert DeNiro.

"This video can not be played Staff conducting virus tests in Cardiff and Newport share their experiences The scientist running Wales' largest coronavirus testing laboratory has spoken of the ""sacrifice"" his team is making to tackle the pandemic. Jonathan Evans runs the virology centre at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales which conducted its first positive Covid-19 test in February. He said staff were working long hours, carrying out about 2,500 daily tests. A lead nurse at one drive-through test centre said ""good morale"" was protecting staff from the pressure. Swabs taken at drive-through testing centres, care homes and health board test sites are all taken to the Cardiff laboratory to be processed. Initially, it was the only laboratory in Wales conducting tests for coronavirus, but others are now sharing the workload. Before the pandemic hit, Mr Evans' laboratory was at its busiest when processing tests for sexually transmitted diseases. Back then, a ""normal day"" would involve carrying out 400 chlamydia tests. ""Duringswine flu,externalwe would get up to testing around 200 samples a day, but that was only on a couple of days,"" he said. ""We are now up at over 2,500 tests per day on a test [for COVID19] that only existed in January, on a virus that didn't exist before December. ""And so the amount of procedures and systems we have had to develop and put in place to be able to safely offer that service has been nothing short of phenomenal."" Covid-19 contact tracing to start from 1 June More than 2,000 deaths in Wales with Covid-19 'Allow Welsh ministers to borrow more money' While staffing has increased from 30 to 50 people, the extra workload has placed great strain on his team. ""I can't speak highly enough of my staff. Bank holidays - what are they? Weekends - they don't exist any more,"" said Mr Evans. ""All the staff are currently working six or seven days a week, commonly 60 to 70 hours."" Mr Evans said many of his relatively young team had moved to Cardiff to work at the laboratory and were experiencing the same lockdown restrictions as everyone else when not on shift. ""One of our colleagues should have beencelebrating Eidonly a couple of days ago with her family and couldn't because she was actually in work here having to do a 12-hour shift instead of being at home with her family in Blackburn. ""It's at moments like that in which you realise the sacrifice the team are making for the greater good."" Test centre lead nurse Amanda Luther: ""We are getting through it as best we can"" Among the samples being processed by the Cardiff laboratory are those collected by staff at Newport's drive-through centre at Rodney Parade - home of Newport's football and rugby teams. A hospitality tent normally used to host sponsors during matches has been repurposed to hold staff involved in contacting people to visit for testing and three bays have been constructed to carry out tests on people arriving by car. Lead nurse Amanda Luther said staff were ""working very, very hard"". ""Yes, it is an awful lot of pressure. We are asked to achieve an awful lot with the number of staff we have got. ""But because morale is so good, and everybody is supporting each other, we are getting through it as best we can."" People wait in their vehicles at the drive through test centre at Rodney Parade Staff who have been moved from their usual roles to help run the testing centre include Holly Taylor, who previously worked in a hospital appointments office. ""My job here is to book appointments and action referrals that are sent through by organisations who want their staff tested,"" she said. ""We are a seven-day operation. It is mostly full-on, you don't realise the time going by. ""Nobody is used to this kind of thing. But I only started working for the NHS in November so I have been in at the deep end."" Holly Taylor: ""Nobody is used to this kind of thing"" Despite being based at the centre, Ms Taylor said she did not always appreciate the fact she was on the front line. ""It is nice and rewarding when you go home and you think 'I have done all this for all these people',"" she said. Some of the people she has had to contact to take the test have been particularly unwell. ""We have had some very concerned and stressed out people on the phone,"" she said. ""They are people who do not sound at all well. But that is why we are here, isn't it? To get them booked, tested and ready to get back to work."" Wales' testing system is being overseen by Public Health Wales, where a prepared plan for testing during the pandemic had to be quickly adapted. Dr John Boulton, the director of quality improvement and patient safety, said the original document lasted ""several hours"". ""It has evolved as we have gone along,"" he said. Dr John Boulton said staff ""have left their family"" to set up test sites ""I think a lot of the teams would probably say they're quite tired at this point because the effort has been intense. ""The changes that we've had to put in place over the last number of weeks have been really quite hard work. ""We've had teams that have been up in north Wales and have left their family for several days to actually support the setting up of testing sites. They've sacrificed an awful lot.""

We're wrapping up our rolling coverage until tomorrow, but in you can still get updates throughout the BBC News website. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the day's top stories.  Today's coverage was brought to you by our reporters in Singapore, the UK, and Washington DC: Saira Asher, Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Andreas Illmer, Sean Fanning, Hugo Bachega, George Wright, Hamish Mackay, Becky Morton, Deirdre Finnerty, Rob Greenall, Saj Chowdhury, Neil Johnston, Michael Emons, Josh Cheetham and Max Matza. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Moscowâs health department has doubled the official count of Covid-19 deaths in April to over 1500. It says this new tally comes after post mortem examinations confirmed coronavirus in dozens of cases where a Covid test had initially been negative, and in hundreds of cases where an autopsy determined that the virus was a significant factor in causing death, even when a patient had other illnesses. This new methodology is being recommended to Russiaâs regions and is likely to mean the death tally increases across the country, although Moscow was the epicentre of the epidemic for many weeks. A few weeks ago, when reporters here suggested the official numbers were too low after seeing excess mortality figures, they were accused of fake news and distortion. Moscowâs health department is stressing that even the new count puts the Covid-19 mortality rate for the city under 3% - suggesting thatâs well below comparable cities. But it also concedes that the figures for May will be higher. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has revealed how his son violated a government dusk-to-dawn curfew order issued to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He said one of his two sons, whom he did not identify, recently went out to party at night in the coastal city of Mombasa - an epicentre of infections in the country. Social gatherings are prohibited in the East African country. The government has also restricted movement in and out of the capital, Nairobi, and three other coastal counties, including Mombasa, where the first family and the president's mother are currently living. Kenyatta said he gave his son a dressing down for risking the life of his grandmother Ngina Kenyatta. ""You've had your fun and enjoyed yourself, but now you've come back and you're with your grandmother, your grandmother is 80 plus,"" the president said. ""If something happens to your grandmother as a result of what you have done - how will you live with yourself?"" In an interview, the president said no-one was immune to coronavirus containment measures, although he has been criticised for not taking his son to a quarantine centre like other Kenyans who violate the curfew.

Martin Scorsese has spoken about how ""anxiety"" set in during lockdown, after an initial ""relief"" that his heavy 2020 workload had been temporarily lifted. The director has shot a new home-made short film about his experiences of isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic. It premiered on Thursday's edition ofLockdown Culture on BBC Two. Scorsese, who was nominated for an Oscar for The Irishman earlier this year, said he ""didn't realise that the lockdown was going to be so intense"". Read more here. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that he will sign an executive order to allow private store owners to refuse service to customers not wearing a mask. The move marks a significant ramping up of anti-virus measures in the state, which continues to report the highest number of cases and deaths in America. Until now, masks have only been legally required in situations where people cannot maintain a six-foot (1.8 metre) distance from each other. He announced the move at a press conference today, where he was joined by comedian Chris Rock and actress Rosie Perez. Mr Cuomo joked that he had brought the pair as ""reinforcements"" because he wasn't ""cool enough"" to make people heed his advice over masks and coronavirus testing. âThe numbers in our community are staggering,"" said Ms Perez, in a message partially delivered in Spanish. ""This is not a joke, this is not a hoax. This is real.â Chris Rock added that, based on what he'd observed in New York City, âthe kids really arenât wearing the masks. âIâm just hoping to help. I have complete trust in the governor. Weâre soldiers for New York,"" said Mr Rock. Governor Greg Abbott has announced that, from Friday, sports fans will be able to attend outdoor professional sports events in most Texas counties. In a proclamation, Abbott said that venues would have to be capped to 25% capacity, and received approval from the Texas Department of State Health Services. But fans will still be banned from attending indoor sporting events, and the rules do not address college and high school sports. It comes as Texas - America's second-most populous state - rolls out a series of measures to reopen its economy. More than 59,000 confirmed cases have been reported there, making it one of the worst-affected states in the country. Martin PatienceMiddle East correspondent For the past two months, Khaldoon Rifaa has not been able to work as a driver because of Lebanon's lockdown. He is now back on the road, operating a minivan along the coastal motorway from his home city of Tripoli to the capital, Beirut. But standing on the street, he is struggling to find any paying customers to fill up his vehicle. ""Before my life was good,"" says the father-of-five. ""I'd work and I could feed my children."" ""But now, there's no work - there's nothing. I don't even have the money to buy washing powder."" Like many others in Lebanon, he has suddenly been plunged into poverty in a country that has hit breaking point. Some are warning thatthe scale of the catastrophe may be more devastating than the 15-year civil war,external, which raged from 1975 to 1990. Even before coronavirus hit, Lebanon was experiencing the worst economic crisis in the country's history, which triggered large anti-government protests late last year. Read more here. Lebanon has been rocked by anti-government protests for months Doctors protest outside an Ice jail in Florida on 1 May A lawyer for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has admitted in court that the agency is not testing prisoners for Covid-19 before transferring them to other jails unless they are showing symptoms of the illness. ""If the individual is actively ill, if the individual has tested positive or showing symptoms, they are not cleared for travel and they will not be transferred until those issues are resolved,â said assistant US Attorney Dexter Lee in a video court hearing,the Miami Herald reported,external. ""The problem is that there are individuals who are asymptomatic and they may be positive for coronavirus,â he added. The ongoing case is over a Florida judge's order that Ice reduce its local prison population to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Immigration advocates argue that Ice found a ""loophole"" by transferring them to jails in other states. Several recent outbreaks at Ice detention centres have been traced to recent transfers, according to US media. According to their website, Ice currently has 25,911 migrant detainees. The website adds that around half of the 2,620 inmates who have been tested were found to be positive.

This video can not be played Coronavirus: UK's tenth  - and possibly final - clap for carers  Staff at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital stood under a display of floral hearts for the applause Residents and carers at the Scisset Mount Care Home in Huddersfield also marked the occasion Boaters in Worcester applauded in the sunshine Boris Johnson â who was treated for Covid-19 at St Thomas' Hospital in London - stepped outside No 10 to clap Founder Annemarie Plas says the applause should become an annual, rather than a weekly, event Earlier today, we brought you updates from Downing Street's latest coronavirus briefing. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson laid out details of a plan to begin an easing of lockdown restrictions in England from next week. We've made a chart detailing what the government is proposing over the next few weeks. Mr Johnson said that, despite the slight relaxation of rules on meeting people outside, those in England deemed most vulnerable to Covid-19 should continue to shield themselves for now.  Clap for Carers founder Annemarie Plas joined the tenth - and perhaps final - applause in south London In Glasgow, they played Dancing in the Streets as they applauded A Salvation Army Centre delivering food parcels also joined the applause Some people gathered outside the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital to applaud People all over the country are stepping out into their gardens, onto their balconies or just leaning out of a window to applaud NHS workers, care home staff and other key workers for their efforts during the pandemic. It may be the last time the nation takes part in the weekly ritual after founder Annemarie Plas saidthe 10th week of clapping would be a good time for it to end. As it approaches 20:00 BST, people in the United Kingdom prepare to Clap for Carers, as has happened every Thursday during the lockdown. The campaign originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown. However, after proving very popular, it was expanded to cover all key workers and has continued at the same time every Thursday.  At a White House briefing on Thursday, spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany defended states' decisions to reopen, saying ""everything does not depend on a vaccine"". ""There's therapeutics,"" she added. She also defended President Donald Trump's tweet commemorating the 100,000 US death toll, which went out the day after the number was passed, and said she had not discussed with Trump the idea of making a vaccine mandatory once it becomes available. McEnany said flags being lowered to half-mast on federal buildings during the previous Memorial Day weekend was an acknowledgment of the growing death toll. She also slammed the perceived liberal bias of US tech companies, after Twitter issued a fact-check label on two of Trump's tweets. She specifically accused Google of allowing China ""to spread misinformation about the coronavirus"".Trump is expected to sign an executive order targeting tech companies later today.

Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""protect them"" from ""an unnecessary attempt to ask a political question"". After several reporters had asked similar questions, both men said they had no wish to get involved in politics. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News About 7% of people in England have previously been infected with coronavirus, antibody tests on a random sample of households suggest. The new data was released bythe Office for National Statistics study,externaland is based on blood samples taken from 885 people from private households after 26 April. The study estimates that about one in 15 people in England have had the virus. These tests detect antibodies which form in the blood when the body fights infections such as Covid-19. The same survey also found that an estimated 133,000 people are currently infected with the virus - 0.24% of the population. Read more: About 7% have had coronavirus, says ONS survey Â© 2025 BBC.
