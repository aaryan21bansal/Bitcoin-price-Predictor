"Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror law A Scottish man who has been held in an Indian jail without conviction for three years has told the BBC he was tortured to sign a blank confession. Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror laws, accused of conspiring to murder a number of right-wing Hindu leaders. Court documents allege he helped fund the crimes and claim he was a member of a ""terrorist gang"". Mr Johal told the BBC via his lawyer he had been ""falsely implicated"". In answers to BBC questions obtained by his lawyer during a virtual prison meeting, the 33-year-old says he was physically tortured into signing a blank confession and forced to record a video which was broadcast on Indian TV. ""They made me sign blank pieces of paper and asked me to say certain lines in front of a camera under fear of extreme torture,"" he said via his lawyer. Mr Johal's legal team also shared a copy of what they say is a handwritten letter from shortly after his arrest in November 2017 in which he details allegations of how the torture took place. ""Multiple shocks were administered by placing (the) crocodile clips on my earlobes, nipples and private parts,"" the letter says. ""Multiple shocks were given each day. ""Two people would stretch my legs, another person would slap and strike me from behind, and the shocks were given by the seated officers."" ""At some stages I was left unable to walk and had to be carried out of the interrogation room."" The BBC has been unable to independently verify these allegations of torture. The Indian authorities strongly deny them, and have said ""there is no evidence of mistreatment or torture as alleged"". Jagtar got married in India in 2017 Mr Johal travelled to India in October 2017 for his wedding. Videos of the occasion show the new groom jumping enthusiastically to Bhangra music as he celebrated. In another he is seen holding his wife's hand, as they perform their first dance in front of friends and family. ""It was a cheerful day for us, it went exactly as planned,"" recalls his brother Gurpreet Singh Johal. But a fortnight later, while on a shopping trip with his new bride in the North Indian state of Punjab, Mr Johal was taken away by police and has been in detention ever since. Follow Rajini on Twitter,external His brother Gurpreet, who lives in Scotland, says Mr Johal was a peaceful activist and is convinced he was arrested because he had written about historical human rights violations against Sikhs in India. ""I believe my brother is being targeted because he was outspoken,"" Gurpreet says. ""I believe he is innocent and will be proved innocent once the trial starts. ""Otherwise Indian officials should release him and return him back to his country."" Jagtar Singh Johal (right) arrives at court in India in November 2017 Charge-sheets from the Indian authorities outline the case against Mr Johal and a group of men whom they believe were involved in a ""series of killings"" of right wing Hindu leaders. It is claimed Mr Johal was a member of Khalistan Liberation Front (KLF), described in the documents as an international ""terrorist gang"". He is accused of paying Â£3,000 to the former head of the KLF to help fund the crimes. The documents claim he ""actively participated and had complete knowledge of the conspiracy"". ""There are very serious charges against him including murder and abetment of terrorism,"" an Indian government official told the BBC. ""The seriousness of charges against him have been shared with the British authorities,"" they added. Footage which claims to show Mr Johal in custody was broadcast on Indian TV Mr Johal's lawyer, Jaspal Singh Manjphur, who has represented him since he was first arrested, told the BBC he was concerned by the length of time it was taking for the case to go through the Indian legal system. ""He has been in custody for over three years,"" Mr Manjphur said. ""Normally, if the prosecution wants, they can complete the case in that much time."" Mr Manjphur said the authorities had yet to provide any him with any evidence linking his client to the crimes and feared he was being framed, a charge denied by officials. A few weeks ago, Mr Johal was accused of being involved in another crime. While in prison he has been arrested for helping to plot the murder of a man in October 2020. ""He is in a high security jail, he is under CCTV surveillance for 24 hours. How can he be in contact with anyone?"", Mr Manjphur said. Mr Johal was last seen in public at court in Delhi earlier this month Mr Johal is being held at Delhi's maximum security Tihar jail. He claims he is often forced to stay in solitary confinement and is denied the same facilities as other prisoners, such as hot water. ""By making me stay in these conditions, they are ensuring that my mental condition remains disturbed,"" he said. ""It is very tough to live here,"" he said. The vast majority of inmates at the prison are, like Mr Johal, held before a conviction in what is known as an ""under-trial"" in India. At the end of 2019, 82% of prisoners held in Tihar jail had yet to complete the trial process. In India it can take many years before under-trial prisoners ever get to court, especially in terror cases where bail is hard to secure, a concern for Mr Johal's lawyer. ""He will languish in jail until the trial is completed, in such cases it could take anywhere between five to 10 years,"" Mr Manjphur said. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has raised the case with his Indian counterpart The human rights charity Reprieve has written to the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, asking that he calls for Mr Johal's immediate release. Reprieve is also worried that some of the charges Mr Johal is awaiting trial for carry the death penalty as the maximum punishment. But experts stress that executions in India are extremely rare. The UK's Foreign Commonwealth and Development office told the BBC that Mr Raab did raise the case with his Indian counterpart during his trip to India in December. ""We have consistently raised concerns about his case with the Government of India, including allegations of torture and mistreatment and his right to a fair trial,"" it said in a statement. ""Our staff continue to support Jagtar Singh Johal following his detention in India, and are in regular contact with his family and prison officials about his health and wellbeing."" Hundreds of people protested outside the Foreign Office But Mr Johal's brother Gurpreet said the family was still waiting for a meeting with the foreign secretary. He said: ""We are calling for either Jagtar to be charged and a fair trial to take place or to be returned back to his country so he can spend his life with his wife in the UK."" In August last year Gurpreet Singh Johal was joined by dozens who protested outside Downing Street. Jagtar Singh Johal's case has sparked protests around the world, from Westminster to Washington, Geneva to Toronto. In his statement to the BBC, Mr Johal had this message for officials back home: ""I plead to the UK government to support me, I'm a British citizen and the government should understand that.""

"Apple sales have hit another record, as families loaded up on the firm's latest phones, laptops and gadgets during the Christmas period. Sales in the last three months of 2020 hit more than $111bn (Â£81bn) - up 21% from the prior year. The gains come as the pandemic pushes more activity online, fuelling demand for new technology. Apple now counts more than 1.65 billion active devices globally, including more than 1 billion iPhones. Apple's gains follow the release of its new iPhone 12 suite of phones, which executives said had convinced a record number of people to switch to the company or upgrade from older models. The firm said growth in China - where the pandemic has already loosened its grip on the economy - was particularly strong,helped in part by demand for phones compatible with new 5G networks. Sales in the firm's greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, jumped 57%. In Europe, sales roles 17%, and they rose 11% in the Americas. ""The products are doing very well all around the world,"" said Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer. ""As we look ahead into the March quarter, we're very optimistic."" Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said he thought the firm was just at the beginning of a ""super-cycle"" as Apple devotees finally trade in old phones, coinciding with upgrades to telecommunications networks. ""With 5G now in the cards and roughly 40% of its 'golden jewel' iPhone installed base not upgrading their phones in the last 3.5 years, [Apple chief Tim] Cook & Co have the stage set for a renaissance of growth,"" he wrote. Big Tech is having an exceptionally lucrative pandemic. It's hard not to be wowed by some of these figures. That Apple recorded more than $100bn in sales in just three months is simply astonishing. Facebook figures are also well up on where they were last year. As other companies have struggled to survive, Big Tech has flourished. There are other reasons for some of these incredible figures. Certainly it seems iPhone enthusiasts were holding out for the new 5G enabled iPhone12. But it's not just Apple and Facebook, all of the massive tech companies are having a bumper year. Covid-19 means people are spending more time indoors - buying things online, watching things online and chatting online. Perhaps then it's no surprise that these companies are posting record breaking figures. But others point to these figures as yet more evidence that Big Tech has become too big to fail. These figures are impressive. But they also attract the attention of politicians who are increasingly asking difficult questions - like are these tech mega companies operating in a market that is fair and with enough competition? Apple said profits in the quarter reached nearly $28.8bn, up 29% compared with the same quarter last year. The gains seen by technology firms like Apple contrast with losses hitting many other economic sectors, as the virus restricts activity and keeps shoppers at home. Other tech firms, such as Microsoft and Facebook, have also enjoyed strong growth. Facebook on Wednesday said increased online shopping during the pandemic helped lift ad revenue in the quarter by 30%. The number of people active on its apps - which also include WhatsApp and Instagram - also rose to 2.6 billion daily, up 15% compared to 2019. It said ad spending could slow as the Covid crisis relaxes and shopper appetite returns for services like travel rather than products. It also warned that plans by Apple to change how it shares user data could weigh on growth.

"This video can not be played The prime minister said he knew pupils and teachers wanted ""nothing more than to get back to the classroom"" Schools in England will not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March, the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said this was the earliest schools could reopen and ""depends on lots of things going right"". The BBC has been told the aim is for all schools and year groups in England to return at the same time. Their return would mark the first stage in lifting the lockdown, the PM said. He told a Downing Street news conference: ""The date of 8 March is the earliest that we think it is sensible to set for schools to go back and obviously we hope that all schools will go back."" ""I'm hopeful, but that's the earliest that we can do it and it depends on lots of things going right, and... it also depends on us all now continuing to work together to drive down the incidence of the disease through the basic methods we've used throughout this pandemic,"" he added. There was not enough data yetto decide when to end the lockdown, he said, but intended to set out a plan for how it could be eased - and the criteria involved - in the final week of February BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the 8 March date as ""very much a hope and certainly not a guarantee"". Meanwhile, a further 1,725 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. The UK's official coronavirus death toll surpassed 100,000 on Tuesday. What about schools in the rest of the UK? Kuenssberg: Wary Johnson careful not to raise hopes 'Knackered and confused.' That's just the parents Vaccinate teachers at half-term - Starmer Mr Johnson told MPs the country remained in a ""perilous situation"" as he said UK nationals and residents arriving from 30 high-risk countrieswould soon be ordered to quarantine in hotels. He revealed a plan for the ""gradual and phased"" lifting of the lockdown in England could come in the week beginning 22 February. Other restrictions on daily life could be eased after schools reopen, but he explained this would depend on hitting vaccination targets, the capacity of the NHS, and deaths falling. An earlier plan for mass testing for pupils and staff remains in place, the BBC has been told. England's schools have been closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers since the Christmas break. In Scotland, it is hoped schools may begin a phased return in the middle of February. In Wales, measures including school and college closures will be reviewed on Friday. In Northern Ireland, a review will take place on Thursday. The prime minister said he understood frustration among pupils and teachers ""and for parents and for carers who spent so many months juggling their day jobs, not only with home schooling but meeting the myriad other demands of their children from breakfast until bedtime"". The government initially planned to review England's lockdown measures - including school closures - on 15 February, which had raised hopes that pupils could return to classes after half term. Acknowledging the impact of continued school closures, Mr Johnson pledged to ""work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure that pupils have the chance to make up their learning"" before 2024. He said Â£300m ""of new money to schools"" would fund a catch-up programme over the coming year, with financial incentives for providers to educate pupils who have missed lessons due to the pandemic. After complaints about confusion and drift about when schools in England are going back, Boris Johnson has sought to bring some certainty. They won't be going back straight after half term - but the target date will be 8 March. Sources say the aim is for all schools and year groups in England, in primary and secondary, to return back on that date - rather than it being the starting date of a phased or regional return. Although that could be subject to any changes in local Covid-19 levels. When schools do go back it is expected there will be mass testing for pupils and staff, in the scheme initially planned for the start of term. It still leaves parents home schooling for another five weeks - and means most of this term will have been without face-to-face lessons. This will be a particular worry for pupils heading for whatever replaces GCSEs and A-levels this summer, after almost a full year of stop-start lessons. Head teachers say the delay is ""no surprise"" - and reopening must be done safely. And Labour says half term should be used to vaccinate teachers to help schools stay open. But the prime minister will hope that parents would rather have some clarity about what's happening with schools, even if that means a longer delay. Teachers' and head teachers' unions said they supported reopening schools but added that it must be safe and not rushed. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said that although the most vulnerable would be protected by March, most parents would not be. ""It fails completely to recognise the role schools have played in community transmission. The prime minister has already forgotten what he told the nation at the beginning of this lockdown, that schools are a 'vector for transmission',"" she said. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the government needs to work with head teachers to review safety measures and create a ""workable plan"" for schools to reopen fully. ""The government will also have to put effort into reassuring families that it is safe to send their children back to school - there is a confidence test the government must pass to make the return a success,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Stella Kyriakides: ""AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments"" The EU has urged pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca to supply it with more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine from UK plants, amid a row over shortages. The company has infuriated the bloc by saying it can deliver only a fraction of the doses it promised for the first quarter of the year. It blames production issues at European plants, but the EU says doses made elsewhere should make up the shortfall. The EU has been criticised for the slow rollout of its vaccinations. The contract between the EU and AstraZeneca contains a confidentiality clause but the EU has asked the company to release the details nevertheless. Reports said last week that the EU would get 60% fewer doses of the vaccine than promised for January-March 2021. The EU reiterated its position after the two sides met on Wednesday evening to try to resolve the issue. Health CommissionerStella Kyriakides tweeted that the EU regretted the ""continued lack of clarity,externalon the delivery schedule"". ""We will work with the company to find solutions and deliver vaccines rapidly for EU citizens,"" she said. An AstraZeneca spokesman said the company had ""committed to even closer co-ordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months"". What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? Vaccine plant evacuated over suspicious package The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Pfizer/BioNTech, which has an even bigger vaccine-production deal with the EU, is also experiencing delays. French drug maker Sanofi has announced that it will help produce 125 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab by the end of the year. The company will allow Germany-based BioNTech to use its facilities in Frankfurt from July, Sanofi said in a statement, having delayed the development of its own vaccine. At a news conference earlier on Wednesday, Ms Kyriakides said UK factories, which have not experienced problems, were part of its deal with the company and had to deliver. ""The 27 European Union member states are united that AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments in our agreements,"" she said. Covid map: Where have the 100m cases been? Some symptoms 'more common' with new variant In an interview on Tuesday with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, AstraZenecaCEO Pascal Soriot said the contract compelled it to make its ""best effort"", rather than obliging it to meet a set deadline for delivery of the vaccines,external. Ms Kyriakides said this characterisation of the deal was ""not correct or acceptable"", and called on the company to be ""open and transparent"" about its production of vaccines. ""We signed an advanced purchase agreement for a product which at the time did not exist and which still today is not yet authorised and we signed it precisely to ensure that the company builds a manufacturing capacity to produce the vaccine early so that they can deliver a certain volume of doses the day that it is authorised,"" she said. She added that the EU rejected ""the logic of first-come first-serve"". The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved by the EU ""That may work at the neighbourhood butcher's but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements."" She appeared to be responding to Mr Soriot, who said that the UK had signed its contract with AstraZeneca three months before the EU and that this extra time had been used to ""fix all the glitches we experienced"" regarding the UK. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I'm confident of our supplies and we'll keep rolling out vaccines as fast we possibly can. ""I am very pleased at the moment that we have the fastest rollout of vaccines in Europe by some way."" In a nutshell, here is why EU officials are furious with AstraZeneca. They say the contract between them and the pharmaceutical giant clearly stipulates that the two main vaccine production factories in the UK are to be classed as primary manufacturing sites, and the production sites in Belgium and the Netherlands are secondary priorities. The vaccine production issues are in Belgium and the Netherlands (they have been producing lower yields). So, this is a no-brainer to EU officials - the UK sites should be used to transport the vaccines across the continent. And today's impromptu news conference by the EU's Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides shows that any tolerance of the company's previous explanations has worn thin. In fact, EU officials point out to me that EU money went into upgrading the facilities in the UK and that they fully expected it to be operational for them. This has turned into a deeply unpleasant row, and sets the stage for a difficult meeting with the UK-Swedish company. The EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the company has reported production delays at two plants, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium. Mr Soriot said production was ""basically two months behind where we wanted to be"". Italy was among the countries threatening to sue over the delays.  448mEU population 8.4mPeople received vaccine so far (1.9%) 2.3bnDoses ordered overall 400mDoses ordered from AstraZeneca (Not yet EMA approved) - 17% of total The AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to give it the green light on Friday. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. Officials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year. The EU has also ordered 2.3 billion doses of vaccines from four other companies, of which only those of Pfizer/BioNTech (600 million) and Moderna (160 million) have been approved. This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race Pfizer has not been able to supply the 12.5 million vaccines it promised the EU by the end of 2020, saying last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. As a result of delays, on Wednesday Spanish officials said the Madrid region was halting almost all vaccinations for two weeks and supplies in Catalonia were also threatened. The EU has threatened to restrict the exports of vaccines made within the bloc to deal with the shortfall. Have you been affected by vaccine supply issues?

"This video can not be played Philippa Day: Benefits problems 'destroyed Nottingham mum' Authorities who dealt with a benefits claim from a single mother, who took a fatal overdose after her payments were cut, made 28 errors in managing her case, a coroner has found. Philippa Day, 27, was found collapsed at her Nottingham home beside a letter rejecting her request for an at-home benefits assessment in August 2019. She died after two months in a coma. Nottingham Coroner's Court heard the way her claim was dealt with was the ""predominant factor"" in her overdose. Recording a narrative conclusion, coroner Gordon Clow said he could not determine whether she intended to die rather than put her life at risk. Miss Day, who had been diagnosed with unstable personality disorder, had been receiving disabled living allowance (DLA) payments as she had type 1 diabetes. Those payments stopped in January 2019 after she made an application for a personal independence payment (PIP), reducing her income from Â£228 a week to Â£60. This, the inquest heard, was because a form she had sent went missing and her payments were not reinstated for months, despite her eligibility. This led to her taking out short-term loans and ending up in debt. The court heard in June, she called the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to say she was ""starving"" and ""couldn't survive like this for much longer"". Philippa Day (left) took a fatal overdose and died in October 2019 She was then asked to attend a face-to-face assessment despite it being ""distressing"" for her, Mr Clow said. The coroner added Miss Day's mental health problems were ""exacerbated"" by the benefits process. He accepted it had been ""the last straw"" for Miss Day who was already experiencing a range of stressors. He said: ""Were it not for this problem, it is not likely that she would have [overdosed] on the 7th or 8th of August."" Call handlers repeatedly failed to flag that the case required ""additional support"" due to her mental health problems, the coroner said. The DWP did not tell her community psychiatric nurse that she had not returned the form before refusing her application, which could have resolved the issue. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The coroner said call handlers received little to no training on personality disorders like Miss Day's - all that was available was a factsheet. Capita was made aware of the risks to Miss Day's health from a face-to-face interview by her community psychiatric nurse, but did not act on it, he added. Mr Clow said: ""Given the sheer number of problems in the handling of her claim, I am unable to conclude that each of these was attributable to individual human error."" He concluded the failure to administer her benefit claim in a way that avoided exacerbating her mental health problems was the ""predominant factor"" that caused Miss Day to overdose. Mr Clow recommended changes at both the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Capita, the authorities involved. In a prevention of future deaths report, Mr Clow said the DWP should consider timely mental health training for call handlers and address ""poor record keeping"". The DWP and Capita were also directed to review the change of assessment process so that it does not ""create unnecessary distress"". A spokesman for the DWP said: ""This is a deeply tragic case. Our sincere condolences are with Miss Day's family and we will carefully consider the coroner's findings."" A Capita spokesman said the company also apologised for the mistakes made. ""We have strengthened our processes over the last 18 months and are committed to continuously working to deliver a high-quality, empathetic service for every claimant,"" he said. ""In partnership with the DWP, we will act upon the coroner's findings and make further improvements to our processes."" This conclusion amounts to a near dismantling of the process for applying for the main disability benefit for people with psychiatric problems. While around 40% of claimants for personal independence payments have mental health conditions, the inquest found that call handlers for the DWP didn't receive adequate mental health training. The coroner found there was an ""institutional assumption"" in the DWP that problems with a claim were the claimants' fault. Last year a report from the National Audit Office (NAO) found the department had investigated 69 suicides of benefit claimants since 2014-15. There were more cases they could have looked into, said the NAO, but in any case the department couldn't demonstrate any improvements from their investigations had actually been implemented.

"Tesla is led by billionaire Elon Musk Tesla reported record deliveries in the fourth quarter, boosted by increased demand for electric vehicles. But its shares fell in after-hours trading after profit fell short of analyst expectations. While many car firms were hit hard in 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic, Tesla bucked the trend. Its shares surged nearly 700% over the year, making it the world's most valuable carmaker. Governments around the world have been ""setting tougher targets for switching to electric vehicles"", helping to increase interest in Tesla, said Rebecca Crook, chief growth officer at digital agency Somo. ""Tesla had an incredibly successful 2020, joining the likes of Amazon as the unofficial 'winners' of a turbulent year,"" she said. ""It's been a challenging past 12 months for car manufacturers,"" she said. ""It's critical for Tesla to maintain this momentum because its success sends optimism into the wider automotive industry."" Tesla asked to recall 158,000 cars over safety concerns Tesla: Soaring share price creates army of 'Teslanaires' Tesla, which is led by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, saw steady sales and profitable quarters in 2020 as other car manufacturers were hit by the effects of the Covid-19 crisis. But the race is on in the car industry to develop electric vehicles to meet emissions targets and challenge Tesla's market lead. The company delivered 180,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a quarterly record, even though it narrowly missed its overall 2020 goal of half a million deliveries. Net income, excluding share-based compensation payouts to Mr Musk, rose to $903m (Â£660m) from $386m last year, falling short of average analyst expectations for a $1.08bn quarterly profit. This combined with a lack of a clear target for 2021 vehicle deliveries sent shares down 4% in after-hours trade. Investors had hoped for a significant increase over the company's 2020 delivery goal of half a million vehicles. ""Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. In some years we may grow faster, which we expect to be the case in 2021,"" Tesla said in a statement. But investor focus was ""always going to be on profitability"", which was lower than the market had expected, said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""We think that reflects the shift from premium Model S and X vehicles to lower priced Model 3s and Model Ys,"" he said. ""Tesla will argue... as more vehicles are fed through production lines profitability will improve. That's true, but it relies on global demand for an ever-increasing number of Teslas."" The good news for Tesla is that electric vehicles have caught the public imagination, said Mr Hyett, adding that Joe Biden's entrance to the White House will probably mean more focus on electric vehicles. ""However, an increasingly competitive landscape means Tesla will have to work harder in the future,"" he said. At present Tesla is heavily reliant on selling carbon credits to rivals, but as those rivals begin producing electric vehicles of their own, that demand will fall, he added.

"It is the second time a routine by Nia Dennis has gone viral A US gymnast's routine celebrating ""black excellence"" has gone viral, with millions of views on social media. The floor routine by Nia Dennis, an athlete at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA), incorporated songs by artists including Kendrick Lamar, BeyoncÃ© and Missy Elliott. She said Black Lives Matter protests inspired the performance, which saw her kneel with her fist in the air. ""I had to... for the culture,"" the 21-year-old wrote on Instagram.

"Jonathan Mok posted a selfie and another photo of his injuries on Facebook A 16-year-old boy has been sentenced for racially attacking a Singapore student who was told ""we don't want your coronavirus in our country"". Jonathan Mok was beaten up on Oxford Street last February by a group of boys in an ""unprovoked attack"". The teenager wasconvicted of racially aggravated grievous bodily harmfollowing a trial at Highbury Corner Youth Court. The chair of the bench gave the boy an 18-month youth rehabilitation order. He was also ordered to wear an electronic tag, follow a curfew order between 20:00 and 07:00 for 10 weeks and must pay Â£600 compensation to Mr Mok. Chair of the bench Mervyn Mandell warned that had he been an adult he ""would have gone to jail for a very long time"". ""This was an unprovoked attack for no reason other than his [Mr Mok's] appearance,"" he said. Jonathan Mok had been walking home after having dinner in central London Mr Mok, 23, suffered a complicated fracture to his nose and cheekbone which required surgery, screws and stitches. Images of his swollen eye were shared widely on social media following the attack. The court heard previously how the UCL law student turned around after a friend of the attacker made a remark about coronavirus towards him. Witnesses described a ""commotion on the street"" where Mr Mok and his friend were ""confronted by a group of white males"". They heard someone shout ""you are diseased don't come near me"". Mr Mok was then punched in the face. The teenager joined the attack and continued to punch and kick Mr Mok. Prosecutor Simon Maughan said the teenager was ""quick to get involved"" in the group attack. A victim impact statement read out on behalf of Mr Mok said the crime had ""taken a heavy toll"" on him and his family. He added: ""My legal education had to be halted for a month due to surgery and follow up medical appointments. ""I have anxiety and have problems sleeping. I believe the defendant is a threat to Singaporeans and South East Asians. He has shown no remorse."" The teenager's defence barrister Gerard Pitt said the boy handed himself in following a police CCTV appeal last March. No-one else has been charged in connection with the attack. Mr Pitt said: ""He has always maintained he did not say anything about coronavirus and that was vindicated at the trial."" The court heard Mr Mok could not be 100% sure the defendant was the boy who said anything about coronavirus. The boy had no previous convictions, but had two youth cautions for common assaults, the court was told. Before being sentenced the teenager said: ""When I saw the picture I felt disgusted.

"The government will set out a ""roadmap"" for reopening schools, the economy and society on 22 February, the PM says Boris Johnson also tells a Downing Street briefing that 8 March is the earliest date schools could reopen It will take weeks for case numbers to come down to ""really low levels"", says UK's chief scientific adviser A further 1,725 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, making 101,887 deaths with the virus in the UK Travellers to the UK from countries where there are concerns about new virus variants will go into hotel quarantine, the government said earlier But Wales and Scotland say the quarantine plans don't go far enough At PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked why the UK has the highest number of deaths in Europe The EU urges AstraZeneca to supply it with more doses of its Covid vaccine from UK plants, amid a row over shortages Edited by Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald Thank you for joining us for our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by Alex Therrien, Cherry Wilson, Claire Heald, Ella Wills, Georgina Rannard, Jennifer Meierhans, Jennifer Scott, Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Penny Spiller and Sarah Collerton. We are going to be wrapping up the live page for this evening soon. Let's have a recap of some of the key dates and figures announced today. A WHO team is in Wuhan to investigate the origins of Covid-19 The United States wants a ârobust and
clearâ international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus in China,
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki says. She told reporters that the âmisinformationâ
from some sources in China was âof great concern to usâ and added that âit's
imperative that we get to the bottom of the early days of the pandemicâ. The Biden administration also intends
to return to having âstaff on the ground in Beijingâ, from scientists and policy experts,
she said, noting that this was something that âfell back in the last
administrationâ. President Trump frequently referred to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"", directly blaming China for the outbreak. Beijing has said it believes the virus originated outside of the country. A World Health Organization team is currently in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to begin investigating the origins of the virus.  This video can not be played Californiaâs Governor Newsom eases Covid restrictions - why now? Cases are beginning to fall in California, but death rates remain the same in the US state. Governor Gavin Newsom has lifted restrictions, meaning Californians can now eat in outdoor restaurants and beauty salons have opened. But some accuse authorities of playing politics. We know... who could imagine, right? But in March 2020, as the UK, parts of the US and elsewhere, went into their first lockdown, millions of people suddenly had a lot more time alone at home, with the internet as their friend. On social media others seemed to be having the times of their lives playing with their dogs, posting adorable photos and recording cute animal-themed TikToks. The message: a furry friend would make lockdown a lot less lonely. People who had been putting off getting a dog because of a lack of time at home suddenly had a glut of it. They saw lockdown as the perfect opportunity to finally raise a puppy. Now, almost a year later, animal shelters are starting to see older puppies with behavioural issues being handed in by frustrated owners, and pet sales websites are filling up with listings for puppies being resold. Read how some around the world have been getting on with their pandemic puppies here. Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check A man making false and misleading statements about Covid-19 tried to remove a sick coronavirus patient from East Surrey Hospital, and is wanted by police. The man filmed himself arguing with doctors in the ward, demanding to be allowed to take the patient home. Doctors at the hospital are seen in the video warning against such an action - stating that the patient would die if he left their care. It follows atrend of people filming supposedly ""empty hospitals""and then posting them online and encouraging others to do the same, spread on social media platforms. In a statement, Michael Wilson, chief executive of Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: ""Any suggestion that Covid-19 doesn't exist or isn't serious is not only extremely disrespectful to the NHS staff caring for patients affected by the virus, but it also puts the lives of others at risk."" The video has been shared thousands of times on social media. The man behind the camera makes a number of discredited claims that are very popular in Covid-19 conspiracy communities online. What are they - and what's the truth behind them? Eva Gicain with her daughter Elleana and husband Limuel A nurse who gave birth nearly three months ago while seriously ill with Covid-19 has held her daughter for the first time. Eva Gicain, 30, had the long-awaited reunion with her baby after being discharged from theRoyal Papworth Hospital,externalin Cambridge earlier this month. Baby Elleana had to be delivered about a month early by C-section, but Mrs Gicain has no memory of her birth. ""When I held Elleana for the first time I didn't want to let go,"" she said. Her husband Limuel, 30, who also had Covid-19, was unable to visit her and had to wait three weeks to see Elleana, who was in a special care baby unit. Limuel had to register the birth alone and needed to know how his wife wanted to spell their daughter's name - but he could not contact her. Find out how he did ithere. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Yvonne Richmond Tulloch says timely support may help prevent future problems Bereavement support charities are calling for more funding in light of what they call the ""terrible toll of 100,000 deaths from Covid-19"". They say many families have been unable to be with loved ones as they died or gather to support one another. They argue there has been ""huge demand"" for counselling and guidance but some providers lack sufficient resources. The government says it is committed to ensuring those who are grieving have access to the support they need. Read more from Hugh here. Earlier, the home secretary set out how the new UK border measures will work. These are to ensure ""only a small number of people for whom it is absolutely essential to travel are doing so"", she says. This video can not be played Priti Patel sets out new UK border measures Norwayâs borders are to be closed to all but essential visitors, prime minister Erna Solberg has announced. She said that while exceptions will
apply to a few groups, such as health workers: âIn practise, the border will be
closed to anyone not living in Norway.â The measures will be reviewed in two
weeks, she said. Norway announced a lockdown of the
region around its capital Oslo on Saturday after an outbreak of a more
contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK. Production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has resumed at a plant after it was suspended when a suspicious package was received. The Wockhardt UK plant on Wrexham Industrial Estate in North Wales was evacuated and the Army sent a bomb disposal unit. Police say the package was made safe and its contents ""taken away for analysis"". Wockhardt says staff had been allowed to return and its production schedule had not been affected. Both Downing Street and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford had been receiving updates on the incident since police were calledat about 10:40 GMT. This video can not be played Prof Jonathan Van-Tam on Covid and schools One of the big headlines today has been that most children, who are not at school, will not go back until at least 8 March. At the Downing Street press conference, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam was asked about the vaccine and children returning to school. Here he sets out, and answers, some of the key questions around children and the virus. Here are some of the latest stories about the coronavirus from around the world: TheEU has urged AstraZeneca to supply it with Covid-19 vaccines from UK plantsas production issues at European plants have delayed  supply of the
first batch of at least 300 million requested doses. The issue has raised tensions between the firm and
the EU bloc. French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi says it will start mass
production later this year of the vaccine developed by its rivals
Pfizer/BioNTech in a bid to help the EU meet its vaccination targets. An 11-year-old Colombian boy says he has receiveddeath threats after calling for better access to educationduring the pandemic. Francisco
Vera is a known campaigner on the environment and childrenâs rights. Peru has announced a two-week lockdown covering a third of the
country until mid-February following a spike in infections. Iceland has begun issuing digital vaccination certificates to residents who have had two doses. The certificates are designed make it easier for people to travel but are not recognised in Europe. Japanâs prime minister has apologised after several of his
ministers visited nightclubs despite his government urging the public to avoid unnecessary
outings Earlier today, a further 1,725 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK - the second highest daily figure since the pandemic began. It comes a day after the UK surpassed 100,000 deaths by this measure. Below we look in more detail at the UK's coronavirus numbers. Dominic Yeatman from the Metro asks whether the prime minister agrees with a figure given by the head of AstraZeneca in which he apparently said the number of people vaccinated in the UK could be 28 to 30 million by the end of February. Boris Johnson says he can't confirm the numbers but is ""confident"" of the UK's vaccine supply and pleased the UK has the ""fastest roll out in Europe"". Mr Yeatman also asks whether the Covid public health advice should be changed after a study found people affected with the new variant are less likely to lose their sense of smell and taste. Jonathan Van-Tam says health advice is under ""regular review"" but the cough and fever symptoms are still ""extremely important"". Adam Vaughan at the New Scientist asks for more information on the vaccine's impact on transmission or if there are any cases of people who have been vaccinated being hospitalised with coronavirus. Patrick Vallance says data from Israel on the effect of the vaccines on covid transmission ""is preliminary"". ""We've got to be extremely cautious and wait until we've got proper data,"" he says. ""You shouldn't expect to see nobody getting ill who has been vaccinated, vaccines are not 100% effective...we will still see people who get the disease, we will still see people who get severe disease, but it'll be much, much reduced with the vaccine."" Jonathan Vam-Tam says: ""I know everyone is straining to get information but we can't get it any faster than we can get it."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asked about transmission rates in people given the vaccine Tom Newton Dunn from Times Radio asks what we know so far about the rate at which people who have had the vaccine can transmit coronavirus. Jonathan Van Tam says there is no clear data on how the vaccine impacts transmission of coronavirus but there are studies working on finding out and we will have that information in time. He said the question is less ""will they"" and more ""to what extent"" do they stop transmission. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""you don't have vaccines of this efficacy without there being some effect on transmission"". He says it's an important question as ""it will also determine to what extent these vaccines can be used across wider society to reduce transmission overall"". Newton Dunn asks how the prime minister came to the date of 8 March to reopen schools and whether it would have been ""wiser to wait until you were sure"". The prime minister says the date depends on the vaccines working in reducing mortality and serious disease.... and we need to make sure the infection rate is in the right place. ""We will keep it all under constant review,"" he says. The prime minister repeats that he takes ""full responsibility"" for the government's handling of the crisis. But the ""brutal and difficult dilemmas"" faced mean there are no ""good answers"", he adds. He is asked about the row between AstraZeneca and the European Union over vaccine supplies - the bloc has asked the company to supply it with more doses from UK plants. Boris Johnson says he is ""very confident"" that jabs for use in the UK will continue to get through. He adds that the creation of vaccines, and their distribution, is a ""great multinational effort"". Jonathan Van-Tam says ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children In Downing Street, the prime minister is asked a question by Henry, who's in Cornwall. Henry says many clinically vulnerable children have been shielding since the first lockdown and have been unable to return to school at all during that time - even when schools were back for a while. He asks the briefing when children may be able to receive the Covid vaccine. Jonathan Van-Tam says the current advice is that children who are extremely at risk can have a discussion with their physician and parents about the benefits of vaccination in children under 16. However, this would be using the vaccine in an ""off-licence way"" so it needs to be a ""carefully discussed, individual decision"" - but it is possible to go down that route. He adds that ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children - but believes ""that will come in time"". This video can not be played Covid-19: 'AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments' An update now from the latest twist in the row over the AstraZeneca vaccine supply to the EU. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has called upon AstraZeneca to ""deliver on its commitments"" to supply vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic. Tensions have risen after the pharmaceutical company said its rollout of at least 300 million doses in Europe had been hit with delays and supply problems. Ms Kyriakides said vaccine suppliers have a ""moral, societal and contractual responsibility which they need to uphold"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Many MPs and campaigners have been putting pressure on the government to provide financial support to millions of UK taxpayers not entitled to special funding schemes during the pandemic. Who are these workers and why have they been unable to receive this help? Many of those without financial support fall between two schemes. One of these groups is people who make less than half of their income from self-employment, meaning they are ineligible for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS). Some will have an employer, which means they could be furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) - and receive financial support that way, but many do not. 'I went to war for this country and now I need help' 'No furlough because they shut the company' 'Discriminated against simply for the way that we're taxed' The decision on SEISS is made based on their accounts for 2018-19, although if they are ineligible based on that year, Revenue & Customs (HMRC) may also look at the previous two years. So, for example, if someone worked a part-time job with an employer from 2016 to 2019 while trying to establish their own self-employed business, they might find they are not eligible for any support. Also, the income making up the more than 50% that would disqualify someone from SEISS does not have to come from just earnings from an employer - it could be rent being paid to a property, income from investments or a pension. HMRC estimates about 1.4 million self-employed people in the UK did not qualify for SEISS because of the 50% rule. A complicated work history can also make claiming support hard. And this has been a particular problem for people working in creative industries, who often work a series of short-term contracts with gaps in-between. A National Audit Office report,externalin October quoted estimates from ExcludedUK, which represents people who have been unable to access financial support during the pandemic, about 400,000 short-term contractors moving between jobs had been ineligible for support in the UK. People who were newly self-employed and so had never submitted a relevant tax return would also have been ineligible for SEISS. And HMRC estimated that was about 200,000 people. Another example is directors of their own companies who pay themselves through dividends, which is usually the way companies share profits among shareholders, rather than a salary. Many people with their own businesses find dividends a better way of paying themselves, because they take money from the business only when it has made a profit. But HMRC does not distinguish between such payments and dividends paid to investors. The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed estimates 710,000 limited-company directors in the UK have been receiving little financial support during the pandemic. Company directors could also be eligible for government-backed loans for their businesses. But unlike the funding from the other support schemes, that would need to be repaid. People who had trading profits of more than Â£50,000 in 2018-19 are ineligible for SEISS, whichthe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates,externaldisqualified about 225,000 people. Kate Bell from trade-union umbrella body the TUC suggested to theTreasury Committee investigation,externalinto the ""excluded"", in June, the government might look into whether this could ""be applied more on a taper basis"" rather than a strict cut-off. But at the moment, someone earning Â£49,999 would be eligible for significant support, while someone earning Â£50,000 would receive nothing. And that is despite the fact, as the IFS points out, furloughed workers with an income of Â£50,000 or more can still receive support of Â£2,500 a month. Other groups without financial support include those made redundant during the pandemic instead of being furloughed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs: ""As long as restrictions are in place, we will continue to support everyone affected by them."" saying that people unable to access the government's financial-support schemes could be eligible for universal credit. But not everybody will be able to claim. Eligibility depends on factors such as whether a claimant has children, savings or any other income coming into their household, which are not taken into account for the Covid support schemes. The NAO, Treasury Committee and Public Accounts Committee have all recommended the government finds ways to support people who have lost their income but missed out on funding throughout the pandemic.

Updates were brought to you by Alex Therrien, Cherry Wilson, Claire Heald, Ella Wills, Georgina Rannard, Jennifer Meierhans, Jennifer Scott, Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Penny Spiller and Sarah Collerton. We are going to be wrapping up the live page for this evening soon. Let's have a recap of some of the key dates and figures announced today. A WHO team is in Wuhan to investigate the origins of Covid-19 The United States wants a ârobust and
clearâ international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus in China,
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki says. She told reporters that the âmisinformationâ
from some sources in China was âof great concern to usâ and added that âit's
imperative that we get to the bottom of the early days of the pandemicâ. The Biden administration also intends
to return to having âstaff on the ground in Beijingâ, from scientists and policy experts,
she said, noting that this was something that âfell back in the last
administrationâ. President Trump frequently referred to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"", directly blaming China for the outbreak. Beijing has said it believes the virus originated outside of the country. A World Health Organization team is currently in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to begin investigating the origins of the virus.

Governor Gavin Newsom has lifted restrictions, meaning Californians can now eat in outdoor restaurants and beauty salons have opened. But some accuse authorities of playing politics. We know... who could imagine, right? But in March 2020, as the UK, parts of the US and elsewhere, went into their first lockdown, millions of people suddenly had a lot more time alone at home, with the internet as their friend. On social media others seemed to be having the times of their lives playing with their dogs, posting adorable photos and recording cute animal-themed TikToks. The message: a furry friend would make lockdown a lot less lonely. People who had been putting off getting a dog because of a lack of time at home suddenly had a glut of it. They saw lockdown as the perfect opportunity to finally raise a puppy. Now, almost a year later, animal shelters are starting to see older puppies with behavioural issues being handed in by frustrated owners, and pet sales websites are filling up with listings for puppies being resold. Read how some around the world have been getting on with their pandemic puppies here.

Eva Gicain with her daughter Elleana and husband Limuel A nurse who gave birth nearly three months ago while seriously ill with Covid-19 has held her daughter for the first time. Eva Gicain, 30, had the long-awaited reunion with her baby after being discharged from theRoyal Papworth Hospital,externalin Cambridge earlier this month. Baby Elleana had to be delivered about a month early by C-section, but Mrs Gicain has no memory of her birth. ""When I held Elleana for the first time I didn't want to let go,"" she said. Her husband Limuel, 30, who also had Covid-19, was unable to visit her and had to wait three weeks to see Elleana, who was in a special care baby unit.

region around its capital Oslo on Saturday after an outbreak of a more
contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK. Production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has resumed at a plant after it was suspended when a suspicious package was received. The Wockhardt UK plant on Wrexham Industrial Estate in North Wales was evacuated and the Army sent a bomb disposal unit. Police say the package was made safe and its contents ""taken away for analysis"". Wockhardt says staff had been allowed to return and its production schedule had not been affected. Both Downing Street and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford had been receiving updates on the incident since police were calledat about 10:40 GMT. This video can not be played Prof Jonathan Van-Tam on Covid and schools One of the big headlines today has been that most children, who are not at school, will not go back until at least 8 March. At the Downing Street press conference, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam was asked about the vaccine and children returning to school. Here he sets out, and answers, some of the key questions around children and the virus. Here are some of the latest stories about the coronavirus from around the world: TheEU has urged AstraZeneca to supply it with Covid-19 vaccines from UK plantsas production issues at European plants have delayed  supply of the
first batch of at least 300 million requested doses. The issue has raised tensions between the firm and
the EU bloc. French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi says it will start mass
production later this year of the vaccine developed by its rivals
Pfizer/BioNTech in a bid to help the EU meet its vaccination targets. An 11-year-old Colombian boy says he has receiveddeath threats after calling for better access to educationduring the pandemic. Francisco
Vera is a known campaigner on the environment and childrenâs rights. Peru has announced a two-week lockdown covering a third of the
country until mid-February following a spike in infections. Iceland has begun issuing digital vaccination certificates to residents who have had two doses.

Adam Vaughan at the New Scientist asks for more information on the vaccine's impact on transmission or if there are any cases of people who have been vaccinated being hospitalised with coronavirus. Patrick Vallance says data from Israel on the effect of the vaccines on covid transmission ""is preliminary"". ""We've got to be extremely cautious and wait until we've got proper data,"" he says. ""You shouldn't expect to see nobody getting ill who has been vaccinated, vaccines are not 100% effective...we will still see people who get the disease, we will still see people who get severe disease, but it'll be much, much reduced with the vaccine."" Jonathan Vam-Tam says: ""I know everyone is straining to get information but we can't get it any faster than we can get it."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asked about transmission rates in people given the vaccine Tom Newton Dunn from Times Radio asks what we know so far about the rate at which people who have had the vaccine can transmit coronavirus. Jonathan Van Tam says there is no clear data on how the vaccine impacts transmission of coronavirus but there are studies working on finding out and we will have that information in time. He said the question is less ""will they"" and more ""to what extent"" do they stop transmission. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""you don't have vaccines of this efficacy without there being some effect on transmission"". He says it's an important question as ""it will also determine to what extent these vaccines can be used across wider society to reduce transmission overall"". Newton Dunn asks how the prime minister came to the date of 8 March to reopen schools and whether it would have been ""wiser to wait until you were sure"". The prime minister says the date depends on the vaccines working in reducing mortality and serious disease.... and we need to make sure the infection rate is in the right place. ""We will keep it all under constant review,"" he says. The prime minister repeats that he takes ""full responsibility"" for the government's handling of the crisis. But the ""brutal and difficult dilemmas"" faced mean there are no ""good answers"", he adds. He is asked about the row between AstraZeneca and the European Union over vaccine supplies - the bloc has asked the company to supply it with more doses from UK plants. Boris Johnson says he is ""very confident"" that jabs for use in the UK will continue to get through. He adds that the creation of vaccines, and their distribution, is a ""great multinational effort"". Jonathan Van-Tam says ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children In Downing Street, the prime minister is asked a question by Henry, who's in Cornwall. Henry says many clinically vulnerable children have been shielding since the first lockdown and have been unable to return to school at all during that time - even when schools were back for a while. He asks the briefing when children may be able to receive the Covid vaccine. Jonathan Van-Tam says the current advice is that children who are extremely at risk can have a discussion with their physician and parents about the benefits of vaccination in children under 16. However, this would be using the vaccine in an ""off-licence way"" so it needs to be a ""carefully discussed, individual decision"" - but it is possible to go down that route. He adds that ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children - but believes ""that will come in time"". This video can not be played Covid-19: 'AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments' An update now from the latest twist in the row over the AstraZeneca vaccine supply to the EU. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has called upon AstraZeneca to ""deliver on its commitments"" to supply vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic. Tensions have risen after the pharmaceutical company said its rollout of at least 300 million doses in Europe had been hit with delays and supply problems. Ms Kyriakides said vaccine suppliers have a ""moral, societal and contractual responsibility which they need to uphold"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Stella Kyriakides: ""AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments"" The EU has urged pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca to supply it with more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine from UK plants, amid a row over shortages. The company has infuriated the bloc by saying it can deliver only a fraction of the doses it promised for the first quarter of the year. It blames production issues at European plants, but the EU says doses made elsewhere should make up the shortfall. The EU has been criticised for the slow rollout of its vaccinations. The contract between the EU and AstraZeneca contains a confidentiality clause but the EU has asked the company to release the details nevertheless. Reports said last week that the EU would get 60% fewer doses of the vaccine than promised for January-March 2021. The EU reiterated its position after the two sides met on Wednesday evening to try to resolve the issue. Health CommissionerStella Kyriakides tweeted that the EU regretted the ""continued lack of clarity,externalon the delivery schedule"". ""We will work with the company to find solutions and deliver vaccines rapidly for EU citizens,"" she said. An AstraZeneca spokesman said the company had ""committed to even closer co-ordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months"". What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? Vaccine plant evacuated over suspicious package The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Pfizer/BioNTech, which has an even bigger vaccine-production deal with the EU, is also experiencing delays. French drug maker Sanofi has announced that it will help produce 125 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab by the end of the year. The company will allow Germany-based BioNTech to use its facilities in Frankfurt from July, Sanofi said in a statement, having delayed the development of its own vaccine. At a news conference earlier on Wednesday, Ms Kyriakides said UK factories, which have not experienced problems, were part of its deal with the company and had to deliver. ""The 27 European Union member states are united that AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments in our agreements,"" she said. Covid map: Where have the 100m cases been? Some symptoms 'more common' with new variant In an interview on Tuesday with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, AstraZenecaCEO Pascal Soriot said the contract compelled it to make its ""best effort"", rather than obliging it to meet a set deadline for delivery of the vaccines,external. Ms Kyriakides said this characterisation of the deal was ""not correct or acceptable"", and called on the company to be ""open and transparent"" about its production of vaccines. ""We signed an advanced purchase agreement for a product which at the time did not exist and which still today is not yet authorised and we signed it precisely to ensure that the company builds a manufacturing capacity to produce the vaccine early so that they can deliver a certain volume of doses the day that it is authorised,"" she said. She added that the EU rejected ""the logic of first-come first-serve"". The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved by the EU ""That may work at the neighbourhood butcher's but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements."" She appeared to be responding to Mr Soriot, who said that the UK had signed its contract with AstraZeneca three months before the EU and that this extra time had been used to ""fix all the glitches we experienced"" regarding the UK. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I'm confident of our supplies and we'll keep rolling out vaccines as fast we possibly can. ""I am very pleased at the moment that we have the fastest rollout of vaccines in Europe by some way."" In a nutshell, here is why EU officials are furious with AstraZeneca. They say the contract between them and the pharmaceutical giant clearly stipulates that the two main vaccine production factories in the UK are to be classed as primary manufacturing sites, and the production sites in Belgium and the Netherlands are secondary priorities. The vaccine production issues are in Belgium and the Netherlands (they have been producing lower yields). So, this is a no-brainer to EU officials - the UK sites should be used to transport the vaccines across the continent. And today's impromptu news conference by the EU's Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides shows that any tolerance of the company's previous explanations has worn thin. In fact, EU officials point out to me that EU money went into upgrading the facilities in the UK and that they fully expected it to be operational for them. This has turned into a deeply unpleasant row, and sets the stage for a difficult meeting with the UK-Swedish company. The EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the company has reported production delays at two plants, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium. Mr Soriot said production was ""basically two months behind where we wanted to be"". Italy was among the countries threatening to sue over the delays.  448mEU population 8.4mPeople received vaccine so far (1.9%) 2.3bnDoses ordered overall 400mDoses ordered from AstraZeneca (Not yet EMA approved) - 17% of total The AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to give it the green light on Friday. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. Officials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year. The EU has also ordered 2.3 billion doses of vaccines from four other companies, of which only those of Pfizer/BioNTech (600 million) and Moderna (160 million) have been approved. This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race Pfizer has not been able to supply the 12.5 million vaccines it promised the EU by the end of 2020, saying last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. As a result of delays, on Wednesday Spanish officials said the Madrid region was halting almost all vaccinations for two weeks and supplies in Catalonia were also threatened. The EU has threatened to restrict the exports of vaccines made within the bloc to deal with the shortfall. Have you been affected by vaccine supply issues?

"The scalloped hammerhead is critically endangered Scientists say sharks and rays are disappearing from the world's oceans at an ""alarming"" rate. The number of sharks found in the open oceans has plunged by 71% over half a century, mainly due to over-fishing, according to a new study. Three-quarters of the species studied are now threated with extinction. And the researchers say immediate action is needed to secure a brighter future for these ""extraordinary, irreplaceable animals"". They are calling on governments to implement science-based fishing limits. Study researcher, Dr Richard Sherley of the University of Exeter, said the declines appear to be driven very much by fishing pressures. He told BBC News: ""That's the driver for the 70% reduction in the last 50 years. For every 10 sharks you had in the open ocean in the 1970s, you would have three today, across these species, on average."" 'Extinction risk' to sharks and rays Reef sharks are in major decline worldwide One woman's mission to protect hammerhead shark Sharks and rays are caught for their meat, fins and liver oil. They are also captured for recreational fishing and turn up by accident in the catch of fishing boats that are targeting other stocks. Sharks are long-lived species that tend to produce few young Of the 31 species studied, 24 are now threatened with extinction, and three shark species (the oceanic whitetip shark, and the scalloped and great hammerhead sharks) have declined so sharply they are now classified as critically endangered - the highest threat category, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Prof Nicholas Dulvy of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, said oceanic sharks and rays are at exceptionally high risk of extinction, much more so than the average bird, mammal or frog, despite ranging far from land. ""Overfishing of oceanic sharks and rays jeopardises the health of entire ocean ecosystems as well as food security for some of the world's poorest countries,"" he said. The researchers compiled global data on sharks and rays found in the open oceans (as opposed to reef sharks or those found close to shore). Of the 1,200 or so species of sharks and rays in the world, 31 are oceanic, travelling large distances across water. ""These are some of the big, important, open ocean predators that people will be familiar with,"" said Dr Sherley. ""The kind of sharks that people might describe as awe-inspiring or charismatic."" He said political will is needed to reverse the trends. ""The science is there, there needs to be the desire to do those stock assessments, to implement the measures that are needed to reduce the take of sharks and that political will has to come from pressure from citizens,"" Dr Sherley explained. Despite this ""gloomy"" picture, the scientists said a few shark conservation stories give cause for hope. Sonja Fordham, president of Shark Advocates International, a non-profit project of The Ocean Foundation, said a couple of species, including the great white, have started to recover through science-based fishing limits. ""Relatively simple safeguards can help to save sharks and rays, but time is running out,"" she said. ""We urgently need conservation action across the globe to prevent myriad negative consequences and secure a brighter future for these extraordinary, irreplaceable animals."" Populations can recover with appropriate conservation Sharks are at the top of the food chain, and crucial to the health of the oceans. Their loss impacts other marine animals as well as human livelihoods. ""Oceanic sharks and rays are vital to the health of vast marine ecosystems, but because they are hidden beneath the ocean surface, it has been difficult to assess and monitor their status,"" said Nathan Pacoureau of Simon Fraser University. ""Our study represents the first global synthesis of the state of these essential species at a time when countries should be addressing insufficient progress towards global sustainability goals. ""While we initially intended it as a useful report card, we now must hope it also serves as an urgent wake-up call."" The research is published in the journal, Nature.

"Already 100,000 people in the UK have died with Covid, according to the official count. The idea of 100,000 deaths is hard for many of us to comprehend. But each was a human being who lived and loved in their own unique way. This is the story of one of them. By 3:01am, alone in a hospital room, Ann Fitzgerald reached for her phone. This would be her last chance to contact her husband of four decades, the man she'd raised two children with, her Tony - to Ann, he was always her Tony. The couple had made a pact. So long as Ann was in hospital with Covid, Tony would spend his nights dozing upright in a chair at their bungalow in Pewfall, Merseyside. That way, he would wake up if there was a message alert. It wasn't much of a sacrifice, Tony thought, not when the woman he'd loved for 47 years was all by herself and frightened. And besides, each time his phone bleeped Tony would know she was still alive, and silently he'd thank the stars. And so in the early hours of Tuesday 7 April, Ann's last message arrived. She'd summoned the energy to take a farewell selfie as she lay in bed wearing an oxygen mask. ""She must have thought: 'Here's something so you won't forget me,'"" says Tony. Two-and-a-half hours later, Ann was dead. She was 65, a mother, a wife, a neighbour, a colleague and a friend, and one of999 people,externalin the UK who died that day with the novel coronavirus. Soon after the hospital rang and told Tony of her death, he was at her bedside, dressed from head to toe in PPE. No visitors had been allowed to see her while she was alive, but now she was gone it was apparently fine - for reasons he didn't understand. Tony wept as he apologised to his wife's lifeless body for letting her go like this, with no loved ones by her side. Then he turned and cursed the sterile white hospital ceiling and walls, because they'd been with her at the end and he hadn't. Back then, few could have imagined the UK's death toll would reach 100,000, or anything close to it. At that point, the tally stood at 10,000; three weeks previously the UK government's Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance had said limiting the final figure to twice that sum would be a ""good outcome"". Now, 10 months on, the total number of people in the UK who have died within 28 days of a coronavirus diagnosis has increased tenfold, while UK excess deaths in 2020 were at theirhighest levelsince World War Two. The UK has had one of the highest rates of recorded coronavirus deaths in the world so far. By any measure, 100,000 is a devastating amount, roughly equivalent to two Premier League football grounds, or the number of people who attend the Reading festival every year. For many people, the sheer scale of loss conveyed by the figure will be impossible to grasp. Why is the UK's death toll so bad? Your tributes to those who have died 'Something really precious has been taken away from me' ""Numbers with lots of zeros are very difficult to interpret, and can be made to look large or small,"" says Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge. ""If I say that 100,000 deaths is two months' worth of normal mortality, then it may not look so bad.  If I say that it is more than all the [UK] civilian deaths in WW2, or as if everyone in a city the size of Durham got killed, then it sounds worse.  It is challenging to adequately convey such a large number of individual tragedies."" But while many may have become numb to the daily death figures, behind every statistic is a real life lost - a real life like Ann's. ""That is why this arbitrary numerical milestone is important,"" says Hetan Shah, chief executive of the British Academy and a former executive director of the Royal Statistical Society. ""It is a chance to reflect again on the terrible toll this pandemic has taken on so many British families."" In a Manchester nightclub one evening in 1973, 18-year-old Tony felt a tap on his arm. It was Ann, a year his senior, whom he knew by sight as a barmaid in one of the city-centre pubs he sometimes drank in. She'd always stood out to him, with her olive skin and striking good looks, but he'd never dared imagine she might be interested in him romantically. ""I'm here with that fella over there,"" she told him, gesturing towards across the room. ""But I don't like him and I don't know what to do."" Tony walked over to Ann's date and told him to clear off. Then Tony returned to Ann, and the two of them had a drink together, and then another. Before long they were a couple and Tony decided he was the luckiest man in the world. Soon he learned all about Ann's background. Her Lithuanian-born Jewish father had died when she was two years old, and with her mother unable to cope she'd been passed between relatives throughout her childhood. By 16 she was living in a bedsit, supporting herself with waitressing and bar work - she'd also been employed at the legendary art-deco Kardoma cafÃ© on Market Street and at George Best's nightclub, Oscar's. ""As a consequence of her upbringing she was really, really independent,"" says Tony. ""She was really good at talking to people, and she was sharp - the sharpest, wittiest person I've ever met."" They rented a flat in Fallowfield together and made it their home. After Ann was offered relief work running bars around Manchester, Tony quit his job as a sales rep to join her. Eventually, in 1981, they took on their own pub. It was in what was then a tough part of Salford, but Ann had grown up nearby and knew how to handle the local characters: ""She could have you in stitches, but she could throw you a look, and you knew you had to behave yourself,"" Tony says. The couple were offered the chance to take on another pub in Sale Moor. They thought they were going upmarket, but it turned out to be quite the reverse; Tony would joke that he should take away all the tables and chairs and install a boxing ring instead. But Ann wasn't intimidated by anyone. According to Tony, when a notorious local villain turned up and demanded a free drink, Ann stood her ground: ""My husband's name is above the front door, and he pays for his drinks, so you're going to pay for yours,"" she told him. Impressed, the villain ended up buying one for Ann instead. She and Tony knew it was time to quit when burglars broke in one night while their baby daughter slept in her cot upstairs. Tony went back on the road as a salesman; Ann worked variously as a debt counsellor, an incident manager for the RAC, and a sales trainer at a cotton firm. Their children, Gary, and Rachel, never once heard them argue, Tony says. For six years the couple had a stall at Altrincham Market selling women's clothes. ""People would come, not necessarily to buy something - they just wanted to see Ann,"" says Tony. ""And as a consequence, they'd buy something they didn't really want."" Each time this happened, Ann would give Tony a wink. By the start of 2020, Ann and Tony were looking forward to a long retirement together. Both their children had left home, and they'd recently moved to the bungalow. The news broadcasts had begun describing a deadly pandemic that had spread from China. But Ann wasn't leaving the house much while she recovered from an operation to replace both hips. Then one Thursday in March she went for a haircut; she asked for the colour to be darkened slightly too, and when he first saw her afterwards Tony told her how much he loved it. Ann mentioned that the hairdresser had been coughing. Three days later, Ann began coughing too, and soon afterwards so did Tony. But with a fever, she felt worse, and within a few more days she was barely able to stand. She asked Tony to call 999. The paramedics helped her to the ambulance. It haunts Tony now that he didn't hug or kiss her as they said goodbye. ""Neither of us thought for one moment that it would be the last day I would ever see her alive,"" he says. She told him they'd probably give her antibiotics and he could come and pick her up in a few hours. But later that day she phoned him to say the doctors suspected Covid and they would be keeping her in. As in many hospitals during the first wave, no visiting was allowed. Tony could only stay in touch with her by phone. When a doctor told him the next 24 hours were critical, he didn't tell Ann, because he knew how scared she was already by then. But he did pass on something else the medic had said - that they were deeply impressed by her upbeat attitude and fighting spirit. Tony told her, too, that he believed she would be home soon: ""I had to say that to keep her fighting, and fight she did for 10 days."" The last time they spoke was Saturday 4 April. Ann told Tony she thought she'd turned a corner; she'd eaten a sandwich and some yoghurt. After that, talking became too difficult for her; she wasn't in intensive care but the mask she wore to help her breathe was getting in the way. Three days after their last conversation, Tony was sitting in a white hospital room beside Ann's body. He sat with her there for an hour. He didn't just apologise, he also promised he'd make sure she was remembered properly. When it was time to leave, a nurse gave him a booklet about bereavement and a black bag in which to put Ann's belongings. Tony carried them along a hospital corridor, wondering how he would tell Gary and Rachel their mum was dead. There are eight photographs of Ann in Tony's living room. In each of them she looks full of joy. ""Every time I look around, there's a picture of Ann somewhere,"" Tony says. ""She's smiling and I'm thinking, 'If only I could turn back the clock.' But I can't, you know, and nor can all those other families and relations, either."" Nearly 10 months after Ann's death, Tony finds himself resenting the home he's been left alone inside. If they hadn't moved there, he reasons, Ann wouldn't have gone to that hairdresser's that day and caught the virus - she'd still be alive, perhaps. He feels robbed of the 20 additional years he hoped they'd spend together, as surely will thousands of other bereaved relatives. While the impact on the very oldest has been widely recognised, those who might have looked forward to a long retirement have been badly hit, too - during the pandemic, around 15% of all UK fatalities with Covid mentioned on the death certificate have been among those aged 65-74. Tony desperately wishes his life would go back to how it was, but knows it won't. Ann's funeral didn't give him any closure. Tony would rather she had been buried, but the undertaker warned him to hurry - extra restrictions could be introduced any time - so he took the date that was offered by the crematorium. As it was, under the rules that were already in force, only 10 mourners were permitted, spaced out around the chapel. No flowers or photographs on display, no hugging. Tony understood why all this was necessary - but it wasn't the celebration of Ann's bright, gregarious, love-filled life that he thought she deserved. He'd have to plan another one when all this was over. As the months went on, Tony joined online Covid support groups. It helped talking to others who understood how it felt to have lost someone. There was the family of a 19-year-old boy. A woman who was mourning both her mum and her dad. Another woman whose husband had died in the car as she drove him to hospital. He thought of these stories each time he switched on the news and watched the Covid mortality figures climb higher and higher. Behind these cold statistics were human lives. And each was as unique as Ann, with a personality and backstory entirely of their own. It would have been Ann and Tony's 41st wedding anniversary on 6 October, the day before the six-month anniversary of her death. The following month, a few days after the UK's Covid death toll reached 50,000, Tony once again felt Ann's absence bitterly on what would have been her 66th birthday. ""Christmas was a nightmare for me,"" he says. Under the rules for the festive season, Gary and Rachel and their partners were able to be there with him, and cooking lunch kept him busy most of the day. But afterwards, when he was on his own again, the reality hit that another celebration had gone by without Ann beside him, and Tony sat down and sobbed. For millions the arrival of the Covid vaccines has brought hope, but it is a cold comfort for those who have lost someone. If every one of the 100,000 were loved by a dozen people, ""that's a million people in Britain who have been bereaved"", says the bioethicist and sociologist Prof Sir Tom Shakespeare. ""We need a national monument, some form of remembering."" Tony is not one of those who will find it hard to grasp the significance of this bleak milestone. ""To me it's 100,000 poor souls fighting for breath, and they've not had a hug from anyone in their family,"" he says. ""There's a name - there's a person behind that number. And then they've passed away, and the family goes through the grief that I've been through - the numbness, the shock, the anguish and the pain to come.""

"Robin Swann says all health workers are valued and have worked tirelessly during the pandemic Health workers in Northern Ireland are to get a ""special recognition"" payment for their work during the pandemic. It is intended that all staff will receive a payment of Â£500, said Health Minister Robin Swann. However, it will be subject to approval from the Department of Finance. There had been calls from some political parties and health unions for staff to be recognised for their efforts. Scotland has already announced a similar one-off payment and Mr Swann said it would reflect the ""principle of parity"". ""There are no words to properly convey what health workers have done for us, we will never be able to repay that debt,"" added the minister. The development comes as Northern Ireland's Department of Health has recorded 16 more coronavirus-related deaths, taking its toll so far to 1,779. A further 527 people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. There are 775 people in Northern Ireland's hospitals who are being treated for the virus - 68 of them are in intensive care and the number of people requiring ventilators has risen to 56. In the Republic of Ireland, 54 more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded on Wednesday. It brings the Republic of Ireland's death toll to 3,120. The Irish Department of Health also confirmed 1,335 more Covid-19 cases. Speaking at the weekly health news conference on Wednesday, Mr Swann said the pandemic had caused ""destruction"" and left ""heartbreak in its wake"". ""Staying at home is making a difference. The R-number has been moving in the right direction,"" he said. ""We have to sustain and build on that progress."" The reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 after Christmas relaxations. It has been falling since lockdown restrictions were introduced on 26 December, and Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said NI's R-number for hospital admissions has now fallen back below one. But he warned that the pressure on the system was still significant and would continue for several more weeks. He added that there would need to be a ""sustained"" drop in the figures before relaxations of the lockdown could be considered by the executive. It has also been confirmed that the number of people in Northern Ireland who have received their first Covid-19 now stands at 168,140. More than 50,000 people aged over 80 have been vaccinated. On the payment to health workers, Mr Swann said it would ""not be without its challenges"" but that he valued all staff in the health service. ""For some people, especially some of our lower paid workers, it may in fact have an adverse impact on their social security payments or supports that recipients may be claiming,"" he added. ""I have written to the ministers of finance and communities asking them to urgently consider the issue and to engage with the tax and benefit authorities in Great Britain to request that these payments are excluded from consideration in this regard."" There will also be a one-off payment of Â£2,000 for all non-salaried students on clinical placements in the health service. Mr Swann added that he intends to provide a one-off payment for carers as well, describing them as ""among the greatest unsung heroes"" of the pandemic. But he said: ""There is still more work to be done in this regard and it will be significantly more complex to administer than the staff payment."" Kevin McAdam, who is from Unite the union, said the ""recognition payments"" will be allocated with assurances that this will not affect pay negotiations with healthcare workers. Mr McAdam welcomed that health care workers and non-salaried students on placements will be ""receiving something more tangible than applause"". ""The student payment is a recognition payment, it does not solve the problems around whether student placements should be paid, I think that is an argument for another day."" Meanwhile, a senior Department of Finance official has warned there is ""a higher than usual risk"" ofsome Â£430m unspent by the NI Executivebeing returned to the Treasury. Ministers must submit further funding bids, or risk it being handed back at the end of the financial year. A department official, Jeff McGuinness, said the Treasury was being pressed to show flexibility in carrying unspent money over but added that it was ""imperative"" Stormont pressed ahead, rather then rely on agreement from Treasury. He said the other devolved administrations were also asking the Treasury for similar levels of carry-forward of unspent fiscal allocations.

"The government will set out a ""roadmap"" for reopening schools, the economy and society on 22 February, the PM says Boris Johnson also tells a Downing Street briefing that 8 March is the earliest date schools could reopen It will take weeks for case numbers to come down to ""really low levels"", says UK's chief scientific adviser A further 1,725 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, making 101,887 deaths with the virus in the UK Travellers to the UK from countries where there are concerns about new virus variants will go into hotel quarantine, the government said earlier But Wales and Scotland say the quarantine plans don't go far enough At PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked why the UK has the highest number of deaths in Europe The EU urges AstraZeneca to supply it with more doses of its Covid vaccine from UK plants, amid a row over shortages Edited by Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald Thank you for joining us for our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by Alex Therrien, Cherry Wilson, Claire Heald, Ella Wills, Georgina Rannard, Jennifer Meierhans, Jennifer Scott, Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Penny Spiller and Sarah Collerton. We are going to be wrapping up the live page for this evening soon. Let's have a recap of some of the key dates and figures announced today. A WHO team is in Wuhan to investigate the origins of Covid-19 The United States wants a ârobust and
clearâ international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus in China,
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki says. She told reporters that the âmisinformationâ
from some sources in China was âof great concern to usâ and added that âit's
imperative that we get to the bottom of the early days of the pandemicâ. The Biden administration also intends
to return to having âstaff on the ground in Beijingâ, from scientists and policy experts,
she said, noting that this was something that âfell back in the last
administrationâ. President Trump frequently referred to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"", directly blaming China for the outbreak. Beijing has said it believes the virus originated outside of the country. A World Health Organization team is currently in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to begin investigating the origins of the virus.  This video can not be played Californiaâs Governor Newsom eases Covid restrictions - why now? Cases are beginning to fall in California, but death rates remain the same in the US state. Governor Gavin Newsom has lifted restrictions, meaning Californians can now eat in outdoor restaurants and beauty salons have opened. But some accuse authorities of playing politics. We know... who could imagine, right? But in March 2020, as the UK, parts of the US and elsewhere, went into their first lockdown, millions of people suddenly had a lot more time alone at home, with the internet as their friend. On social media others seemed to be having the times of their lives playing with their dogs, posting adorable photos and recording cute animal-themed TikToks. The message: a furry friend would make lockdown a lot less lonely. People who had been putting off getting a dog because of a lack of time at home suddenly had a glut of it. They saw lockdown as the perfect opportunity to finally raise a puppy. Now, almost a year later, animal shelters are starting to see older puppies with behavioural issues being handed in by frustrated owners, and pet sales websites are filling up with listings for puppies being resold. Read how some around the world have been getting on with their pandemic puppies here. Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check A man making false and misleading statements about Covid-19 tried to remove a sick coronavirus patient from East Surrey Hospital, and is wanted by police. The man filmed himself arguing with doctors in the ward, demanding to be allowed to take the patient home. Doctors at the hospital are seen in the video warning against such an action - stating that the patient would die if he left their care. It follows atrend of people filming supposedly ""empty hospitals""and then posting them online and encouraging others to do the same, spread on social media platforms. In a statement, Michael Wilson, chief executive of Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: ""Any suggestion that Covid-19 doesn't exist or isn't serious is not only extremely disrespectful to the NHS staff caring for patients affected by the virus, but it also puts the lives of others at risk."" The video has been shared thousands of times on social media. The man behind the camera makes a number of discredited claims that are very popular in Covid-19 conspiracy communities online. What are they - and what's the truth behind them? Eva Gicain with her daughter Elleana and husband Limuel A nurse who gave birth nearly three months ago while seriously ill with Covid-19 has held her daughter for the first time. Eva Gicain, 30, had the long-awaited reunion with her baby after being discharged from theRoyal Papworth Hospital,externalin Cambridge earlier this month. Baby Elleana had to be delivered about a month early by C-section, but Mrs Gicain has no memory of her birth. ""When I held Elleana for the first time I didn't want to let go,"" she said. Her husband Limuel, 30, who also had Covid-19, was unable to visit her and had to wait three weeks to see Elleana, who was in a special care baby unit. Limuel had to register the birth alone and needed to know how his wife wanted to spell their daughter's name - but he could not contact her. Find out how he did ithere. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Yvonne Richmond Tulloch says timely support may help prevent future problems Bereavement support charities are calling for more funding in light of what they call the ""terrible toll of 100,000 deaths from Covid-19"". They say many families have been unable to be with loved ones as they died or gather to support one another. They argue there has been ""huge demand"" for counselling and guidance but some providers lack sufficient resources. The government says it is committed to ensuring those who are grieving have access to the support they need. Read more from Hugh here. Earlier, the home secretary set out how the new UK border measures will work. These are to ensure ""only a small number of people for whom it is absolutely essential to travel are doing so"", she says. This video can not be played Priti Patel sets out new UK border measures Norwayâs borders are to be closed to all but essential visitors, prime minister Erna Solberg has announced. She said that while exceptions will
apply to a few groups, such as health workers: âIn practise, the border will be
closed to anyone not living in Norway.â The measures will be reviewed in two
weeks, she said. Norway announced a lockdown of the
region around its capital Oslo on Saturday after an outbreak of a more
contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK. Production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has resumed at a plant after it was suspended when a suspicious package was received. The Wockhardt UK plant on Wrexham Industrial Estate in North Wales was evacuated and the Army sent a bomb disposal unit. Police say the package was made safe and its contents ""taken away for analysis"". Wockhardt says staff had been allowed to return and its production schedule had not been affected. Both Downing Street and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford had been receiving updates on the incident since police were calledat about 10:40 GMT. This video can not be played Prof Jonathan Van-Tam on Covid and schools One of the big headlines today has been that most children, who are not at school, will not go back until at least 8 March. At the Downing Street press conference, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam was asked about the vaccine and children returning to school. Here he sets out, and answers, some of the key questions around children and the virus. Here are some of the latest stories about the coronavirus from around the world: TheEU has urged AstraZeneca to supply it with Covid-19 vaccines from UK plantsas production issues at European plants have delayed  supply of the
first batch of at least 300 million requested doses. The issue has raised tensions between the firm and
the EU bloc. French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi says it will start mass
production later this year of the vaccine developed by its rivals
Pfizer/BioNTech in a bid to help the EU meet its vaccination targets. An 11-year-old Colombian boy says he has receiveddeath threats after calling for better access to educationduring the pandemic. Francisco
Vera is a known campaigner on the environment and childrenâs rights. Peru has announced a two-week lockdown covering a third of the
country until mid-February following a spike in infections. Iceland has begun issuing digital vaccination certificates to residents who have had two doses. The certificates are designed make it easier for people to travel but are not recognised in Europe. Japanâs prime minister has apologised after several of his
ministers visited nightclubs despite his government urging the public to avoid unnecessary
outings Earlier today, a further 1,725 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK - the second highest daily figure since the pandemic began. It comes a day after the UK surpassed 100,000 deaths by this measure. Below we look in more detail at the UK's coronavirus numbers. Dominic Yeatman from the Metro asks whether the prime minister agrees with a figure given by the head of AstraZeneca in which he apparently said the number of people vaccinated in the UK could be 28 to 30 million by the end of February. Boris Johnson says he can't confirm the numbers but is ""confident"" of the UK's vaccine supply and pleased the UK has the ""fastest roll out in Europe"". Mr Yeatman also asks whether the Covid public health advice should be changed after a study found people affected with the new variant are less likely to lose their sense of smell and taste. Jonathan Van-Tam says health advice is under ""regular review"" but the cough and fever symptoms are still ""extremely important"". Adam Vaughan at the New Scientist asks for more information on the vaccine's impact on transmission or if there are any cases of people who have been vaccinated being hospitalised with coronavirus. Patrick Vallance says data from Israel on the effect of the vaccines on covid transmission ""is preliminary"". ""We've got to be extremely cautious and wait until we've got proper data,"" he says. ""You shouldn't expect to see nobody getting ill who has been vaccinated, vaccines are not 100% effective...we will still see people who get the disease, we will still see people who get severe disease, but it'll be much, much reduced with the vaccine."" Jonathan Vam-Tam says: ""I know everyone is straining to get information but we can't get it any faster than we can get it."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asked about transmission rates in people given the vaccine Tom Newton Dunn from Times Radio asks what we know so far about the rate at which people who have had the vaccine can transmit coronavirus. Jonathan Van Tam says there is no clear data on how the vaccine impacts transmission of coronavirus but there are studies working on finding out and we will have that information in time. He said the question is less ""will they"" and more ""to what extent"" do they stop transmission. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""you don't have vaccines of this efficacy without there being some effect on transmission"". He says it's an important question as ""it will also determine to what extent these vaccines can be used across wider society to reduce transmission overall"". Newton Dunn asks how the prime minister came to the date of 8 March to reopen schools and whether it would have been ""wiser to wait until you were sure"". The prime minister says the date depends on the vaccines working in reducing mortality and serious disease.... and we need to make sure the infection rate is in the right place. ""We will keep it all under constant review,"" he says. The prime minister repeats that he takes ""full responsibility"" for the government's handling of the crisis. But the ""brutal and difficult dilemmas"" faced mean there are no ""good answers"", he adds. He is asked about the row between AstraZeneca and the European Union over vaccine supplies - the bloc has asked the company to supply it with more doses from UK plants. Boris Johnson says he is ""very confident"" that jabs for use in the UK will continue to get through. He adds that the creation of vaccines, and their distribution, is a ""great multinational effort"". Jonathan Van-Tam says ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children In Downing Street, the prime minister is asked a question by Henry, who's in Cornwall. Henry says many clinically vulnerable children have been shielding since the first lockdown and have been unable to return to school at all during that time - even when schools were back for a while. He asks the briefing when children may be able to receive the Covid vaccine. Jonathan Van-Tam says the current advice is that children who are extremely at risk can have a discussion with their physician and parents about the benefits of vaccination in children under 16. However, this would be using the vaccine in an ""off-licence way"" so it needs to be a ""carefully discussed, individual decision"" - but it is possible to go down that route. He adds that ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children - but believes ""that will come in time"". This video can not be played Covid-19: 'AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments' An update now from the latest twist in the row over the AstraZeneca vaccine supply to the EU. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has called upon AstraZeneca to ""deliver on its commitments"" to supply vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic. Tensions have risen after the pharmaceutical company said its rollout of at least 300 million doses in Europe had been hit with delays and supply problems. Ms Kyriakides said vaccine suppliers have a ""moral, societal and contractual responsibility which they need to uphold"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played The prime minister said he knew pupils and teachers wanted ""nothing more than to get back to the classroom"" Schools in England will not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March, the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said this was the earliest schools could reopen and ""depends on lots of things going right"". The BBC has been told the aim is for all schools and year groups in England to return at the same time. Their return would mark the first stage in lifting the lockdown, the PM said. He told a Downing Street news conference: ""The date of 8 March is the earliest that we think it is sensible to set for schools to go back and obviously we hope that all schools will go back."" ""I'm hopeful, but that's the earliest that we can do it and it depends on lots of things going right, and... it also depends on us all now continuing to work together to drive down the incidence of the disease through the basic methods we've used throughout this pandemic,"" he added. There was not enough data yetto decide when to end the lockdown, he said, but intended to set out a plan for how it could be eased - and the criteria involved - in the final week of February BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the 8 March date as ""very much a hope and certainly not a guarantee"". Meanwhile, a further 1,725 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. The UK's official coronavirus death toll surpassed 100,000 on Tuesday. What about schools in the rest of the UK? Kuenssberg: Wary Johnson careful not to raise hopes 'Knackered and confused.' That's just the parents Vaccinate teachers at half-term - Starmer Mr Johnson told MPs the country remained in a ""perilous situation"" as he said UK nationals and residents arriving from 30 high-risk countrieswould soon be ordered to quarantine in hotels. He revealed a plan for the ""gradual and phased"" lifting of the lockdown in England could come in the week beginning 22 February. Other restrictions on daily life could be eased after schools reopen, but he explained this would depend on hitting vaccination targets, the capacity of the NHS, and deaths falling. An earlier plan for mass testing for pupils and staff remains in place, the BBC has been told. England's schools have been closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers since the Christmas break. In Scotland, it is hoped schools may begin a phased return in the middle of February. In Wales, measures including school and college closures will be reviewed on Friday. In Northern Ireland, a review will take place on Thursday. The prime minister said he understood frustration among pupils and teachers ""and for parents and for carers who spent so many months juggling their day jobs, not only with home schooling but meeting the myriad other demands of their children from breakfast until bedtime"". The government initially planned to review England's lockdown measures - including school closures - on 15 February, which had raised hopes that pupils could return to classes after half term. Acknowledging the impact of continued school closures, Mr Johnson pledged to ""work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure that pupils have the chance to make up their learning"" before 2024. He said Â£300m ""of new money to schools"" would fund a catch-up programme over the coming year, with financial incentives for providers to educate pupils who have missed lessons due to the pandemic. After complaints about confusion and drift about when schools in England are going back, Boris Johnson has sought to bring some certainty. They won't be going back straight after half term - but the target date will be 8 March. Sources say the aim is for all schools and year groups in England, in primary and secondary, to return back on that date - rather than it being the starting date of a phased or regional return. Although that could be subject to any changes in local Covid-19 levels. When schools do go back it is expected there will be mass testing for pupils and staff, in the scheme initially planned for the start of term. It still leaves parents home schooling for another five weeks - and means most of this term will have been without face-to-face lessons. This will be a particular worry for pupils heading for whatever replaces GCSEs and A-levels this summer, after almost a full year of stop-start lessons. Head teachers say the delay is ""no surprise"" - and reopening must be done safely. And Labour says half term should be used to vaccinate teachers to help schools stay open. But the prime minister will hope that parents would rather have some clarity about what's happening with schools, even if that means a longer delay. Teachers' and head teachers' unions said they supported reopening schools but added that it must be safe and not rushed. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said that although the most vulnerable would be protected by March, most parents would not be. ""It fails completely to recognise the role schools have played in community transmission. The prime minister has already forgotten what he told the nation at the beginning of this lockdown, that schools are a 'vector for transmission',"" she said. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the government needs to work with head teachers to review safety measures and create a ""workable plan"" for schools to reopen fully. ""The government will also have to put effort into reassuring families that it is safe to send their children back to school - there is a confidence test the government must pass to make the return a success,"" he said.

The coronavirus pandemic led to larger amounts spent via contactless payments on debit cards, credit cards, and cards connected to smartphones. It has been less than a year since the limit was raised from Â£30 to Â£45. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it will consult ""shortly"" on a change in the rules. ""It is important that payments regulation keeps pace with consumer and merchant expectations,"" the regulator said. ""Recognising changing behaviour in how people pay, as part of a wider consultation, we will shortly be seeking views on amending our rules to allow for a possible increase in theÂ contactlessÂ limit to Â£100."" The FCA can set the boundaries for payments, under its rules, but the card issuers would have the power to set the actual limits. The pandemic has changed the way we pay for things The use of contactless technology by consumers has risen sharply in recent years, with more services adopting the technology and most shops offering it as an option. To protect workers and consumers during the Covid outbreak, an increase to the current limit of Â£45 was rushed through by the regulator in April last year. The latest figures show that the proportion of contactless payments had fallen slightly compared with pre-pandemic levels, because lockdown measures hit the use of pubs, restaurant, and public transport. They accounted for 41% of card transactions. However, there was a 16% increase in the total value of contactless payments in the UK in October, compared with the same month a year earlier, the latest data from UK Finance - which represents banks - shows. Cash refusal 'creeping into UK economy' Will we be getting our cash from shops, not ATMs? Half of all debit card payments now contactless The amount spent on contactless hit a monthly record in August, boosted by the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and fewer coronavirus-related restrictions. A total of Â£8.4bn was spent on credit and debit cards using contactless during that month. ""The industry believes that a more flexible approach could be merited in future, which takes into account consumer demand, fraud prevention, security and convenience,"" said a spokesman for UK Finance. ""Contactless is one of a range of payment methods and the industry will also continue to work closely with the regulator to ensure that customers can pay in a way that suits them."" However, there may be less enthusiasm from some shopkeepers concerned about higher-value theft as a result of the proposed changes. Andrew Cregan, payments policy advisor at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""We have concerns about raising the contactless limit, with losses from incomplete contactless payments at self-checkouts currently costing retailers millions in lost revenue. ""Card companies should take measures to reduce incomplete payments and we urge customers to make sure their own transactions always go through. However, the overwhelming priority at the moment must be for the government to address the rocketing card fees.""

"This video can not be played The prime minister said he knew pupils and teachers wanted ""nothing more than to get back to the classroom"" Schools in England will not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March, the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said this was the earliest schools could reopen and ""depends on lots of things going right"". The BBC has been told the aim is for all schools and year groups in England to return at the same time. Their return would mark the first stage in lifting the lockdown, the PM said. He told a Downing Street news conference: ""The date of 8 March is the earliest that we think it is sensible to set for schools to go back and obviously we hope that all schools will go back."" ""I'm hopeful, but that's the earliest that we can do it and it depends on lots of things going right, and... it also depends on us all now continuing to work together to drive down the incidence of the disease through the basic methods we've used throughout this pandemic,"" he added. There was not enough data yetto decide when to end the lockdown, he said, but intended to set out a plan for how it could be eased - and the criteria involved - in the final week of February BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the 8 March date as ""very much a hope and certainly not a guarantee"". Meanwhile, a further 1,725 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. The UK's official coronavirus death toll surpassed 100,000 on Tuesday. What about schools in the rest of the UK? Kuenssberg: Wary Johnson careful not to raise hopes 'Knackered and confused.' That's just the parents Vaccinate teachers at half-term - Starmer Mr Johnson told MPs the country remained in a ""perilous situation"" as he said UK nationals and residents arriving from 30 high-risk countrieswould soon be ordered to quarantine in hotels. He revealed a plan for the ""gradual and phased"" lifting of the lockdown in England could come in the week beginning 22 February. Other restrictions on daily life could be eased after schools reopen, but he explained this would depend on hitting vaccination targets, the capacity of the NHS, and deaths falling. An earlier plan for mass testing for pupils and staff remains in place, the BBC has been told. England's schools have been closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers since the Christmas break. In Scotland, it is hoped schools may begin a phased return in the middle of February. In Wales, measures including school and college closures will be reviewed on Friday. In Northern Ireland, a review will take place on Thursday. The prime minister said he understood frustration among pupils and teachers ""and for parents and for carers who spent so many months juggling their day jobs, not only with home schooling but meeting the myriad other demands of their children from breakfast until bedtime"". The government initially planned to review England's lockdown measures - including school closures - on 15 February, which had raised hopes that pupils could return to classes after half term. Acknowledging the impact of continued school closures, Mr Johnson pledged to ""work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure that pupils have the chance to make up their learning"" before 2024. He said Â£300m ""of new money to schools"" would fund a catch-up programme over the coming year, with financial incentives for providers to educate pupils who have missed lessons due to the pandemic. After complaints about confusion and drift about when schools in England are going back, Boris Johnson has sought to bring some certainty. They won't be going back straight after half term - but the target date will be 8 March. Sources say the aim is for all schools and year groups in England, in primary and secondary, to return back on that date - rather than it being the starting date of a phased or regional return. Although that could be subject to any changes in local Covid-19 levels. When schools do go back it is expected there will be mass testing for pupils and staff, in the scheme initially planned for the start of term. It still leaves parents home schooling for another five weeks - and means most of this term will have been without face-to-face lessons. This will be a particular worry for pupils heading for whatever replaces GCSEs and A-levels this summer, after almost a full year of stop-start lessons. Head teachers say the delay is ""no surprise"" - and reopening must be done safely. And Labour says half term should be used to vaccinate teachers to help schools stay open. But the prime minister will hope that parents would rather have some clarity about what's happening with schools, even if that means a longer delay. Teachers' and head teachers' unions said they supported reopening schools but added that it must be safe and not rushed. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said that although the most vulnerable would be protected by March, most parents would not be. ""It fails completely to recognise the role schools have played in community transmission. The prime minister has already forgotten what he told the nation at the beginning of this lockdown, that schools are a 'vector for transmission',"" she said. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the government needs to work with head teachers to review safety measures and create a ""workable plan"" for schools to reopen fully. ""The government will also have to put effort into reassuring families that it is safe to send their children back to school - there is a confidence test the government must pass to make the return a success,"" he said.

"This video can not be played ""I'm devastated that I have been penalised because of my husband's death"" When Kim Kingston lost her husband to cancer, she had no idea she could be cut out from government support because she inherited money from his pension. When the coronavirus crisis struck, Kim's work was cut off by the lockdown. But she has received nothing from government schemes designed to help support the self-employed. Kim, from Southsea in Portsmouth, is among millions shut out from help, many of whom could easily be included if the government chose to, research shows. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which carried out its research for the BBC, concludes there is ""clear unfairness"" in some of the exclusions. The government said it had ""designed and provided one of the most generous self-employed income support schemes in the world"". The Treasury's position is that self-employment support has been targeted at lower earners and those most reliant on trading income, and that many people may be eligible for other government support. Why can't some workers get Covid help? Kim, who is also a make-up artist, lost her husband David to cancer in November 2018, She refused to let her clients down, keeping up her work between visits to her husband David as he lay in hospital with a brain tumour. ""I don't think you can ever fully adjust to losing someone who's been in your life for so long. ""We did everything together; we had a good marriage. He was my best friend - he was a wonderful, wonderful man."" When he died Kim poured energy into her work, even as she grieved and supported her children, using money passed to her from David's pension scheme to redevelop The Beauty Shed, her business premises in the rear garden of her family home in Southsea. Ms Kingston, a mother of two, lost her husband David to cancer in 2018 ""I had a little wooden shed and used that as my treatment room. It was always my dream to have something bigger that was purpose-built for everything I needed it to do. ""By using that pension to build my dream - and David's dream as well - was amazing because I know if he was here he would think: 'This is fantastic'."" In 2019 her business took off. ""In 2019 I did 54 weddings, travelling all over the south coast. It's a job I thoroughly enjoy doing - it's great to be part of someone's biggest day of their lives. But then in 2020 because of the pandemic it collapsed - I've only done four."" ""[Chancellor] Rishi Sunak stood up and said no-one would be forgotten. No one would be left behind. So I felt a massive sense of relief, because I could work, that my business would be looked after - which clearly it hasn't been because I've been excluded from any help."" ""Boris Johnson keeps saying the government's doing 'everything we can'. But they are not - they're just not."" When the pandemic struck in the spring of 2020, she was shocked to learn that the money from David's pension ruled her out of the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) treated it as income, and because it was slightly larger than her income from self-employment in 2018/19, she fell foul of a rule excluding people who earn less than 50% of their income from self-employment. Ms Kingston said her relief was short-lived after Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he'd support businesses. ""I still can't get my head round the fact that a dead person's money can be seen as an income. My accountant couldn't explain it to me. The rule is supposed to stop people claiming because they have another job. So basically I'm being told my dead husband's pension money is another job."" HMRC estimates that 1.4 million people aren't eligible for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,externalbecause their income from self-employment is less than half of their overall income. Many are ruled out because they top up modest pension incomes with part-time jobs or self-employment. Research body the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there was ""clear unfairness"" in some of the exclusions. The IFS found 1.3 million people excluded by that rule could be included at a cost of less than Â£800m for three months. A further 225,000 people are excluded by a rule that means you are ineligible if you earn more than Â£50,000. They could also be included at a cost of Â£1.3bn over three months - or less if support was reduced for higher earners. That compares to around Â£90bn that the government expects to spend on furlough and self-employment. IFS director Paul Johnson told the Today programme that for some people, their self-employment pay ""is very small indeed, but for some its an important part of their income"" and that losing it all is ""creating  serious hardship"". The money needed to support those excluded is ""a very small percentage of the self employment scheme itself and 1% of the self employment scheme and the furlough scheme together."" ""The Treasury have drawn a line, in a sense very generously for most, and then just put a complete cut off for other groups,"" he said. To extend it ""would be relatively cheap and it would certainly help some people who are clearly in significant trouble."" He told the BBC: ""It may be a minority but it's certainly left some people with real, big problems. If your income goes down from Â£55,000 to nothing through no fault of your own, you are clearly in big trouble,"" he said. Research by Standard Life Foundation suggests that 3.8 million adults have lost earnings because of anti-virus measures yet received nothing from either the furlough or the self-employed schemes. This includes those excluded from the self-employed schemes and those denied furlough and instead made redundant. Standard Life Foundation chief executive Mubin Haq said: ""At the start of the pandemic the Chancellor promised workers they would be supported. Millions have but far too many, who've worked hard and paid their taxes have been left high and dry. Too many are struggling to pay for food and everyday essentials."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""As the IFS acknowledge, the government has designed and provided one of the most generous self-employed income support schemes in the world which has helped nearly 3 million people claim almost Â£20bn pounds. ""The scheme is targeted to provide support to those most in need - lower earners and those that rely solely on their self-employment income. ""Many of those who do not qualify will benefit from other measure in our unprecedented Â£280bn package of support, such as furlough. ""We acknowledge that it has not been possible to support everyone in the way they might want, but we continue to work with stakeholders and keep our schemes under review.""

"""A legacy of poor decisions"" by the UK before and during the pandemic led to one of the worst death rates in the world, scientists have said. Labour also criticised ""monumental mistakes"" by the prime minister in delaying acting on scientific advice over lockdowns three times. After UK deaths passed 100,000, Boris Johnson said he took ""full responsibility"" for the actions taken. But he said it was too soon to learn the lessons from the pandemic response. Prof Linda Bauld, public health expert from the University of Edinburgh, said the UK's current position was ""a legacy of poor decisions that were taken when we eased restrictions"". She told the BBC the lack of focus on test and trace and the ""absolute inability to recognise"" the need to address international travel had also led to a more deadly winter surge. Prof Sir Michael Marmot, who carried out a review of inequalities in Covid-19 deaths, said the UK had entered the pandemic ""in a bad state"" with rising health inequality, a slowdown in life expectancy improvements and a lack of investment in the public sector. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth rejected Mr Johnson's claim that he had done ""everything we could"" to minimise the death toll, adding: ""I do not accept that."" Why is the UK's death toll so bad? Kuenssberg: Grim milestone in an abnormal year Coronavirus: Your tributes to those who have died 'Hard to compute sorrow' of 100,000 deaths - PM He said the prime minister had been given scientific advice to impose lockdowns and ""pushed that back"" - not only in March but again in September and December. The government also failed to create a working contact-tracing system, did not introduce effective health controls at the borders and still did not offer ""proper sick pay"", he said. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""I mourn every death in this pandemic and we share the grief of all those who have been bereaved. I and the government take full responsibility for all the actions we have taken to fight this pandemic."" He said there would be time to reflect on the decisions taken, but he did not think the right time was in the middle of the pandemic when ""37,000 people are struggling with Covid in our hospitals"". The government needed to focus on keeping the virus under control and continuing the fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe, he said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces UK deaths from Covid-19 have passed 100,000 He said his message to grieving families was that he ""deeply, personally"" regretted the loss of life and that the best way to honour the memory of those who had died and honour those who were currently grieving was ""to work together to bring this virus down, to keep it under control in the way that we are"". Asked about the government's ""legacy of poor decisions"", Mr Johnson said ministers followed scientific advice and did everything they could to minimise suffering. He said there were ""no easy solutions"" but the UK could be proud of its efforts to distribute the vaccine. After leading a minute's silence in the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""truly sorry"" for any mistakes, as Scotland recorded a total of 5,888 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. She said the government did everything it could, but added: ""I don't think any of us, reflecting on numbers like these, can conclude that we have always succeeded."" Next month, the prime minister hopes topublish a document giving details of the criteria he will use to start lifting the lockdown, a senior government source told the BBC. It will include factors such as the number of hospitalisations and deaths, the progress of the vaccination programme, any changes to the virus and the impact easing restrictions might have on the epidemic - but will be dependent on emerging data about how effectively the vaccine stops the virus spreading. The UK is the fifth country to pass 100,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. A scientist advising the government has warned the UK could face as many as 50,000 more coronavirus deaths. Prof Calum Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the BBC's Newsnight: ""It would really not surprise me if we're looking at another 40-50,000 deaths before this burns out. ""The deaths on the way up are likely to be mirrored by the number of deaths on the way down in this wave. Each one again is a tragedy and each one represents probably four or five people who survive but are damaged by Covid."" He said the UK had experienced some ""bad luck"" with the emergence of a new, more transmissible variant but had also suffered from ""decades of underinvestment"" in the NHS and ""a public health authority that's been eroded"" . Meanwhile, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell asked people, regardless of whether they had faith, to reflect on the ""enormity"" of the pandemic and join in a ""prayer for the nation"" at 18:00 GMT every day from 1 February. They said the death statistics were were not ""just an abstract figure"", saying: ""Each number is a person: someone we loved and someone who loved us."" Muslim leaders backed the call for a daily prayer. Qari Asim, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said Muslims and wider black, Asian and minority ethnic communities had been disproportionately affected by the ""tsunami of pain, grief and devastation"" - with many unable to properly mourn due to Covid restrictions.

"This video can not be played Stella Kyriakides: ""AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments"" The EU has urged pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca to supply it with more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine from UK plants, amid a row over shortages. The company has infuriated the bloc by saying it can deliver only a fraction of the doses it promised for the first quarter of the year. It blames production issues at European plants, but the EU says doses made elsewhere should make up the shortfall. The EU has been criticised for the slow rollout of its vaccinations. The contract between the EU and AstraZeneca contains a confidentiality clause but the EU has asked the company to release the details nevertheless. Reports said last week that the EU would get 60% fewer doses of the vaccine than promised for January-March 2021. The EU reiterated its position after the two sides met on Wednesday evening to try to resolve the issue. Health CommissionerStella Kyriakides tweeted that the EU regretted the ""continued lack of clarity,externalon the delivery schedule"". ""We will work with the company to find solutions and deliver vaccines rapidly for EU citizens,"" she said. An AstraZeneca spokesman said the company had ""committed to even closer co-ordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months"". What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? Vaccine plant evacuated over suspicious package The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Pfizer/BioNTech, which has an even bigger vaccine-production deal with the EU, is also experiencing delays. French drug maker Sanofi has announced that it will help produce 125 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab by the end of the year. The company will allow Germany-based BioNTech to use its facilities in Frankfurt from July, Sanofi said in a statement, having delayed the development of its own vaccine. At a news conference earlier on Wednesday, Ms Kyriakides said UK factories, which have not experienced problems, were part of its deal with the company and had to deliver. ""The 27 European Union member states are united that AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments in our agreements,"" she said. Covid map: Where have the 100m cases been? Some symptoms 'more common' with new variant In an interview on Tuesday with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, AstraZenecaCEO Pascal Soriot said the contract compelled it to make its ""best effort"", rather than obliging it to meet a set deadline for delivery of the vaccines,external. Ms Kyriakides said this characterisation of the deal was ""not correct or acceptable"", and called on the company to be ""open and transparent"" about its production of vaccines. ""We signed an advanced purchase agreement for a product which at the time did not exist and which still today is not yet authorised and we signed it precisely to ensure that the company builds a manufacturing capacity to produce the vaccine early so that they can deliver a certain volume of doses the day that it is authorised,"" she said. She added that the EU rejected ""the logic of first-come first-serve"". The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved by the EU ""That may work at the neighbourhood butcher's but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements."" She appeared to be responding to Mr Soriot, who said that the UK had signed its contract with AstraZeneca three months before the EU and that this extra time had been used to ""fix all the glitches we experienced"" regarding the UK. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I'm confident of our supplies and we'll keep rolling out vaccines as fast we possibly can. ""I am very pleased at the moment that we have the fastest rollout of vaccines in Europe by some way."" In a nutshell, here is why EU officials are furious with AstraZeneca. They say the contract between them and the pharmaceutical giant clearly stipulates that the two main vaccine production factories in the UK are to be classed as primary manufacturing sites, and the production sites in Belgium and the Netherlands are secondary priorities. The vaccine production issues are in Belgium and the Netherlands (they have been producing lower yields). So, this is a no-brainer to EU officials - the UK sites should be used to transport the vaccines across the continent. And today's impromptu news conference by the EU's Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides shows that any tolerance of the company's previous explanations has worn thin. In fact, EU officials point out to me that EU money went into upgrading the facilities in the UK and that they fully expected it to be operational for them. This has turned into a deeply unpleasant row, and sets the stage for a difficult meeting with the UK-Swedish company. The EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the company has reported production delays at two plants, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium. Mr Soriot said production was ""basically two months behind where we wanted to be"". Italy was among the countries threatening to sue over the delays.  448mEU population 8.4mPeople received vaccine so far (1.9%) 2.3bnDoses ordered overall 400mDoses ordered from AstraZeneca (Not yet EMA approved) - 17% of total The AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to give it the green light on Friday. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. Officials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year. The EU has also ordered 2.3 billion doses of vaccines from four other companies, of which only those of Pfizer/BioNTech (600 million) and Moderna (160 million) have been approved. This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race Pfizer has not been able to supply the 12.5 million vaccines it promised the EU by the end of 2020, saying last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. As a result of delays, on Wednesday Spanish officials said the Madrid region was halting almost all vaccinations for two weeks and supplies in Catalonia were also threatened. The EU has threatened to restrict the exports of vaccines made within the bloc to deal with the shortfall. Have you been affected by vaccine supply issues?

"""A legacy of poor decisions"" by the UK before and during the pandemic led to one of the worst death rates in the world, scientists have said. Labour also criticised ""monumental mistakes"" by the prime minister in delaying acting on scientific advice over lockdowns three times. After UK deaths passed 100,000, Boris Johnson said he took ""full responsibility"" for the actions taken. But he said it was too soon to learn the lessons from the pandemic response. Prof Linda Bauld, public health expert from the University of Edinburgh, said the UK's current position was ""a legacy of poor decisions that were taken when we eased restrictions"". She told the BBC the lack of focus on test and trace and the ""absolute inability to recognise"" the need to address international travel had also led to a more deadly winter surge. Prof Sir Michael Marmot, who carried out a review of inequalities in Covid-19 deaths, said the UK had entered the pandemic ""in a bad state"" with rising health inequality, a slowdown in life expectancy improvements and a lack of investment in the public sector. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth rejected Mr Johnson's claim that he had done ""everything we could"" to minimise the death toll, adding: ""I do not accept that."" Why is the UK's death toll so bad? Kuenssberg: Grim milestone in an abnormal year Coronavirus: Your tributes to those who have died 'Hard to compute sorrow' of 100,000 deaths - PM He said the prime minister had been given scientific advice to impose lockdowns and ""pushed that back"" - not only in March but again in September and December. The government also failed to create a working contact-tracing system, did not introduce effective health controls at the borders and still did not offer ""proper sick pay"", he said. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""I mourn every death in this pandemic and we share the grief of all those who have been bereaved. I and the government take full responsibility for all the actions we have taken to fight this pandemic."" He said there would be time to reflect on the decisions taken, but he did not think the right time was in the middle of the pandemic when ""37,000 people are struggling with Covid in our hospitals"". The government needed to focus on keeping the virus under control and continuing the fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe, he said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces UK deaths from Covid-19 have passed 100,000 He said his message to grieving families was that he ""deeply, personally"" regretted the loss of life and that the best way to honour the memory of those who had died and honour those who were currently grieving was ""to work together to bring this virus down, to keep it under control in the way that we are"". Asked about the government's ""legacy of poor decisions"", Mr Johnson said ministers followed scientific advice and did everything they could to minimise suffering. He said there were ""no easy solutions"" but the UK could be proud of its efforts to distribute the vaccine. After leading a minute's silence in the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""truly sorry"" for any mistakes, as Scotland recorded a total of 5,888 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. She said the government did everything it could, but added: ""I don't think any of us, reflecting on numbers like these, can conclude that we have always succeeded."" Next month, the prime minister hopes topublish a document giving details of the criteria he will use to start lifting the lockdown, a senior government source told the BBC. It will include factors such as the number of hospitalisations and deaths, the progress of the vaccination programme, any changes to the virus and the impact easing restrictions might have on the epidemic - but will be dependent on emerging data about how effectively the vaccine stops the virus spreading. The UK is the fifth country to pass 100,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. A scientist advising the government has warned the UK could face as many as 50,000 more coronavirus deaths. Prof Calum Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the BBC's Newsnight: ""It would really not surprise me if we're looking at another 40-50,000 deaths before this burns out. ""The deaths on the way up are likely to be mirrored by the number of deaths on the way down in this wave. Each one again is a tragedy and each one represents probably four or five people who survive but are damaged by Covid."" He said the UK had experienced some ""bad luck"" with the emergence of a new, more transmissible variant but had also suffered from ""decades of underinvestment"" in the NHS and ""a public health authority that's been eroded"" . Meanwhile, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell asked people, regardless of whether they had faith, to reflect on the ""enormity"" of the pandemic and join in a ""prayer for the nation"" at 18:00 GMT every day from 1 February. They said the death statistics were were not ""just an abstract figure"", saying: ""Each number is a person: someone we loved and someone who loved us."" Muslim leaders backed the call for a daily prayer. Qari Asim, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said Muslims and wider black, Asian and minority ethnic communities had been disproportionately affected by the ""tsunami of pain, grief and devastation"" - with many unable to properly mourn due to Covid restrictions. On Tuesday, a further 1,631 coronavirus deaths were recorded, taking the total number of people who had died within 28 days of a positive test to 100,162.

"Young people have taken to the streets all over the world to show their concern about climate change Despite the pandemic, almost two thirds of people around the world now view climate change as a global emergency. That's the key finding from thelargest opinion poll yet conducted,externalon tackling global warming. More than a million people in 50 countries took part in the survey, with almost half the participants aged between 14 and 18. Conserving forests and land emerged as the most popular solution for tackling the issue. Bank criticised for funding carbon-intensive firms John Kerry calls Trump 'reckless' over climate Biden's first act sets ambitious climate tone The poll, called the ""People's Climate Vote"", has been organised by the United Nations Development Programme in conjunction with Oxford University. The organisers distributed poll questions through adverts in mobile gaming apps across 50 countries, between October and December last year. Huge numbers of 14-18 year olds took part in the poll Around 1.22 million people of all genders, ages, and educational backgrounds took part, but with significant numbers of younger people. Some 550,000 people aged 14-18 took part. Across all countries, 64% of participants saw climate change as an emergency, requiring urgent responses from countries.  The margin of error was +/- 2%. This result varied somewhat by age and location. In the UK and Italy, 81% agreed with the question, while this dropped to 50% among those responding from Moldova. Newly installed US President Joe Biden can take some comfort that 65% of those in the US taking part now view climate change as an emergency. Fires in California and Australia have influenced people's views on climate change Overall, younger people were more likely to agree with the view that rising temperatures were an emergency, with nearly 70% in favour. For people over the age of 60, this dropped to 58%. ""People are scared, they are seeing the the wildfires in Australia and California, they're seeing the category five storms and in the Caribbean, they are seeing flooding in in Southeast Asia,"" said Cassie Flynn, strategic adviser to the UNDP. ""And they're looking around them and they're saying, this is a real problem. We have to do something about this."" The actions that people tend to favour when it comes to tackling climate change depend, to some extent, on where people live. In eight of the 10 countries with the highest emissions from generating electricity, there were majorities in favour of using more green energy. Former Secretary of State John Kerry is the new climate czar in the Biden administration But in countries with bigger emissions from deforestation and land use changes, there was majority support for conserving forests and land. This emerged from the overall survey as the most popular policy for dealing with climate change, by a narrow margin. Conserve forests and land (54%) Use solar, wind and renewable power (53%) Climate friendly farming techniques(52%) Investing more money in green businesses and jobs (50%). The least-favoured options for tackling climate change in this survey were a plant-based diet, with only 30% of respondents believing it to be the best. Germany, with 44%, and the UK, with 43%, were the countries where plant-based diets received the strongest support. The authors say that across all countries, remarkably few people declined to support any policy. Pakistan emerged as the country with the greatest number of people not favouring any policy, at 5%. It was followed by the United States, with 4%. One of the key differences that emerged in the data was the level of education. Flooding in the UK is likely to increase under future climate change scenarios ""When it comes to demographics, something that we saw very clearly was that there is a high correlation between a level of education and belief in the climate emergency. The more educated you are, the more likely you are to believe that there is a climate emergency,"" said Cassie Flynn. ""And this is really, really powerful, because it doesn't matter where you're from, it doesn't matter your age, education really, really is important."" While the overall findings show roughly the same responses from men and women, there were quite pronounced differences at the country level. In Canada, women and girls were 12% more likely to say that climate change is an emergency than men and boys. The US, UK and Australia had smaller differences in the same direction. In contrast, India, Georgia, Vietnam and Nigeria went in the opposite direction, with men and boys being 9-12% more likely to say that warming is an emergency. Postponed from last year, Cop26 is due to be held in Glasgow in November With a new president in the White House who is making climate change a priority, and with a key global conference taking place in Glasgow later this year, the organisers of the poll believe that it is an important time for world leaders to hear a wide range of voices on climate change. ""How they respond to the climate crisis, how they respond to the Covid crisis, is really going to chart an entirely new pathway. And so in many ways, it is this moment of choice,"" said Cassie Flynn from UNDP. ""And what we wanted to do with the people's climate vote is to bring people's voices to that decision making, to bring people's voices to the climate debate."" Follow Matton Twitter,external.

"Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton and Chief Scientific Adviser for Health Dr Rob Orford have been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic They say there is a worry that new variants of coronavirus may emerge which are resistant to vaccines The children's commissioner urges ministers to explain the pandemic milestones that will trigger the return of pupils to classrooms The boss of the DVLA is Swansea is accused by a senior MP of giving âmisleadingâ information over Covid-19 cases amongst its workers Boris Johnson says the UK government is working ""flat out"" to tackle the DVLA outbreak after it was raised at Prime Minister's Questions Lola Mayor and Andy Roberts Thank you for joining us for our live coverage of the Welsh Government press conference on the pandemic. Here are today's main points:  Thanks for joining us - have a good afternoon and stay safe. The Royal Welsh Show - the biggest agricultural show in Europe -has been cancelled for the second year runningbecause of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The board met on Wednesday to discuss holding the show as scheduled in July, but after discussions with Welsh Government decided it wouldn't be feasible. Steve Hughson, chief executive of the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society, said:

âWe continue to work alongside the Welsh Government and Public Health Wales to create a road map for the safe re-opening of events. ""Our events are central to the rural economy and way of life and mean so much to members, exhibitors, traders and visitors. ""We fully understand the responsibility on all of us to ensure we deliver our events as soon as it is safe to do so."" Mr Hughson said the society had provided free facilities for a Covid testing centre and a mass vaccination centre at its showground in Llanelwedd, Powys. A plant where doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine are produced and stored has been evacuated after receiving a suspicious package. North Wales Police said a cordon had been put in place near the Wockhardt plant on the Wrexham Industrial Estate and the public had been asked to keep away. Wockhardt UK said: ""Upon expert advice we have partially evacuated the site pending a full investigation."" The BBC understands that the bomb disposal unit is on site. There are no reports of any injuries. Public Health Wales today reported that official death total had risen by 49, hospital patients with Covid-19 have fallen by 11 and those in critical care or ventilated have fallen by seven. Wales now has a 14.2% positivity rate for coronavirus on testing. The prime minister says the UK government has been ""working flat out on the problem at the DVLA"", aftera high number of cases of Covid-19 amongst the workforce at the Swansea-based agency. A coronavirus outbreak was declared at the centre in the Clase area of the city in December after 352 cases in the space of four months. Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris called on Boris Johnson to take ""full responsibility"" for the ""woeful and reckless management of the Covid outbreak at the DVLA government sites in my constituency"". During Prime Minister's Questions she also asked him to ensure that Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is ""held accountable for the inexcusable damage and devastation this has caused"". Mr Johnson replied: ""We have been working flat out on the problem at the DVLA - all staff who can work from home are doing so. ""Measures have been taken to minimise the number of people on the site at any one time, and more than 2,000 tests have been carried out by the DVLA in the last fortnight alone,  with all results so far coming back negative."" The new, dominant variant of Covid-19 in the UK doesnât appear to have any more impact on young and healthy people than the original strain, according to the Welsh Governmentâs chief scientific adviser for Health. Dr Rob Orford said that the so-called Kent variant was being closely monitored. âIt doesnât seem to have any difference in the way it infects people across the ages, which is really positiveâ, he said. ""Wherever there is an opportunity to mix there will be transmission, so we need to be very careful about how we open up. Dr Orford added: âOf course weâre looking at the other variants - the two from Brazil and the one from South Africa - very closely and are asking the same question. âAs always the more data weâve got, the more confident we can be in how we react to that, how we assess and how we respond to them."" The chief medical officer for Wales said there is ""no headroom"" for easing Covid restrictions. On Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford is due to set out what restrictions will be in place for the next three weeks. However, speaking at today's Welsh Government briefing, Dr Frank Atheron said the February review in three weeks' time will be the one ""to think about further relaxations"". An all-Wales approach remains the âbest hopeâ option for tackling the pandemic, according to Walesâ chief medical officer. Dr Frank Athertonâs comments came after he was asked whether local lockdowns could be reintroduced instead national restrictions. âMy personal view is that we're better sticking with a Wales-wide approach,â Dr Atherton said. He added that a lot had been learnt from the local restrictions introduced in several areas last year. âOne thing we did learn is that things move very quickly around the country. âWe've talked before about whether we should have a north and a south division, and we've seen the virus move very quickly from the south of Wales up to the north of Wales. âI think it moves so quickly that an all-Wales approach to my mind remains the best hope for us.â It is ""inevitable"" that some people aged under 80 will be invited for Covid-19 vaccinations before those over-80s in some parts of Wales have received the jab, Wales' chief medical officer said. Dr Frank Atherton said he expected to see ""a bit of variation between health boards"" due to the ""scale"" and ""complexity"" of the vaccination programme. ""The health boards are all absolutely clear about who the priority groups are,"" he said. ""Inevitably some over-70s will start to be invited in some health boards before all the over-80s are covered. ""But we're well on track to get through those first."" Wales remains âon trackâ to offer first doses of Covid-19 vaccinations to all of the Welsh Governmentâs top four priority groups by the middle of February, according to the chief medical officer. Dr Frank Atherton said that despite the initial target of offering vaccines to 70 per cent of people aged over 80 by last weekend being missed, good progress was still being made. âWe currently have around 52 per cent of the over-80s vaccinatedâ, he said. ""But within that other group, people living in care homes and people who are working in care homes â over seventy per cent of those have now been vaccinated. âWeâre making solid progress on those, and the intention still remains to get through all those first priority groups by the middle of February and we believe weâre on track for that."" Dr Atherton also insisted the aim of offering vaccinations to seven in every ten people over the age of 80 by last Sunday ""was never a targetâ. The âbiggest worryâ with the new Covid variants is that they will not respond to treatments or vaccines, according to the Welsh Governmentâs chief scientific adviser on health. Dr Rob Orford told Wednesday's press conference that the new variants posed new challenges because of their potential to alter the course of the pandemic by speeding up the rate of transmission and quickly increasing the number of people infected. He added: âThe biggest worry, of course, is that a new variant could emerge which wonât respond to our treatments or vaccines â putting us back to square one againâ. A new variant of coronavirus, known as the Kent variant, is the dominant strain across Wales, according to the Welsh Governmentâs chief scientific adviser for health. Dr Rob Orford said this strain is more contagious than the form of the virus previously circulating in Wales. âIt is now present in all parts of Wales with levels of at least 50% or more. It is highest in north Wales,"" he said. Dr Orford that despite reports that the Kent strain was more deadly, studies of death rates ""have not been able to say that definitivelyâ. He said the new strain was more contagious and travelled very quickly. Dr Orford said three other new variants were being tracked â ones which had  emerged in South Africa and Brazil. He said there had been10 cases of the South African variant identified in Wales, all of which were ""imported cases from people who have travelled abroadâ. The Welsh Governmentâs chief medical officer has confirmed that more than 312,000 people in Wales have had their first dose of the vaccine. âThatâs a shade under 10% of our population,"" Dr Frank Atherton said at Wednesday's Welsh Government press conference. âThis is real progressâ. Dr Atherton added that the Welsh Government was on course for the âfirst milestoneâ of offering vaccines to the first four priority groups by mid-February. Wales' R rate of transmission is now below one, but ""we are not out of the woods"", according to the chief medical officer for Wales. Dr Frank Atherton said the country is âbeginning to see an overall improvementâ and that cases had been falling steadily since earlier this month. âThe seven-day case rate for Wales is currently around 200 cases per 100,000 people,"" he told today's press briefing. âThis is significantly lower than the very high rates of 650 cases per 100,000 people that we were seeing in the weeks before Christmas. âThe good news is that itâs falling in all parts of Wales. âWe believe the R number is below 1 â at between 0.7 and 0.9. âAll this tells us that transmission of the infection is slowing and the size of the current outbreak is shrinking."" The boss of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in Swansea has been accused by a senior MP of giving""misleading"" information about Covid-19 cases amongst workers. Giving evidence to the Commons Transport Committee, chief executive Julie Lennard said of 546 cases at its Swansea office since March, 535 were between September and December. Committee chairman Huw Merriman MP said the DVLA previously indicated cases were spread out over the who period since March. Ministers were urged to intervene after staff were said to be too scared to go to work. Mr Merriman said: ""If I had a grand total of 546 [cases], and 535 of those were from September, I wouldn't write a letter and point it to my attention that it was a cumulative number stretching back from March, when March to September is a grand total of 11. ""I found it rather misleading."" Ms Lennard apologised if it was misleading and said in the haste to get information together ahead of the meeting ""things could have been clearer"". An outbreak had been declared in December, but the DVLA insisted safety was a priority and that it followed guidance to ""help keep our offices Covid secure"". Around 6,000 people work at the DVLA's 16-storey HQ in Swansea Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton and Chief Scientific Adviser for Health Dr Rob Orford are about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. You can watch proceedings live on BBC One Wales,on the BBC iPlayer, onS4C, or via the Coronavirus Update video link above. Wrexham has the highest rolling seven-day case rate in Wales with 503.1 people per 100,000 population testing positive. That is followed by neighbouring Flintshire with 384.4 and Denbighshire with 263.3. Ceredigion has the lowest case rate at 86.7 per 100,000 people, followed by Conwy with 127.1. The Wales average is 204 per 100,000. On Wednesday, a further 49 deaths in Wales of people with coronavirus were reported by Public Heath Wales. Of those, there were 11 in both the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area and Cardiff and Vale. Ten were in Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales and nine were in Aneurin Bevan in south east Wales. Swansea Bay reported six, Hywel Dda in west Wales reported three, and one death was from a resident outside of Wales. A total of 312,305 people have now received a Covid vaccination in Wales, Public Health Wales said. It is an increase of 22,749 on yesterday's running total. Of these, 639 people have now received their second dose. This means 9.9 per cent of the total population of Wales have been vaccinated. It comes as the Welsh Government blamed bad weather fornot reaching their targetof 70% of all over-80s getting the vaccine by last weekend. A further 49 people have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales. This takes the official death total in the pandemic to 4,610. There were 537 new reports of the virus today, taking the number of cases to 189,689. Nearly 2.4 million tests have now been carried out in Wales. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Stella Kyriakides: ""AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments"" The EU has urged pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca to supply it with more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine from UK plants, amid a row over shortages. The company has infuriated the bloc by saying it can deliver only a fraction of the doses it promised for the first quarter of the year. It blames production issues at European plants, but the EU says doses made elsewhere should make up the shortfall. The EU has been criticised for the slow rollout of its vaccinations. The contract between the EU and AstraZeneca contains a confidentiality clause but the EU has asked the company to release the details nevertheless. Reports said last week that the EU would get 60% fewer doses of the vaccine than promised for January-March 2021. The EU reiterated its position after the two sides met on Wednesday evening to try to resolve the issue. Health CommissionerStella Kyriakides tweeted that the EU regretted the ""continued lack of clarity,externalon the delivery schedule"". ""We will work with the company to find solutions and deliver vaccines rapidly for EU citizens,"" she said. An AstraZeneca spokesman said the company had ""committed to even closer co-ordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months"". What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? Vaccine plant evacuated over suspicious package The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Pfizer/BioNTech, which has an even bigger vaccine-production deal with the EU, is also experiencing delays. French drug maker Sanofi has announced that it will help produce 125 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab by the end of the year. The company will allow Germany-based BioNTech to use its facilities in Frankfurt from July, Sanofi said in a statement, having delayed the development of its own vaccine. At a news conference earlier on Wednesday, Ms Kyriakides said UK factories, which have not experienced problems, were part of its deal with the company and had to deliver. ""The 27 European Union member states are united that AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments in our agreements,"" she said. Covid map: Where have the 100m cases been? Some symptoms 'more common' with new variant In an interview on Tuesday with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, AstraZenecaCEO Pascal Soriot said the contract compelled it to make its ""best effort"", rather than obliging it to meet a set deadline for delivery of the vaccines,external. Ms Kyriakides said this characterisation of the deal was ""not correct or acceptable"", and called on the company to be ""open and transparent"" about its production of vaccines. ""We signed an advanced purchase agreement for a product which at the time did not exist and which still today is not yet authorised and we signed it precisely to ensure that the company builds a manufacturing capacity to produce the vaccine early so that they can deliver a certain volume of doses the day that it is authorised,"" she said. She added that the EU rejected ""the logic of first-come first-serve"". The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved by the EU ""That may work at the neighbourhood butcher's but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements."" She appeared to be responding to Mr Soriot, who said that the UK had signed its contract with AstraZeneca three months before the EU and that this extra time had been used to ""fix all the glitches we experienced"" regarding the UK. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I'm confident of our supplies and we'll keep rolling out vaccines as fast we possibly can. ""I am very pleased at the moment that we have the fastest rollout of vaccines in Europe by some way."" In a nutshell, here is why EU officials are furious with AstraZeneca. They say the contract between them and the pharmaceutical giant clearly stipulates that the two main vaccine production factories in the UK are to be classed as primary manufacturing sites, and the production sites in Belgium and the Netherlands are secondary priorities. The vaccine production issues are in Belgium and the Netherlands (they have been producing lower yields). So, this is a no-brainer to EU officials - the UK sites should be used to transport the vaccines across the continent. And today's impromptu news conference by the EU's Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides shows that any tolerance of the company's previous explanations has worn thin. In fact, EU officials point out to me that EU money went into upgrading the facilities in the UK and that they fully expected it to be operational for them. This has turned into a deeply unpleasant row, and sets the stage for a difficult meeting with the UK-Swedish company. The EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the company has reported production delays at two plants, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium. Mr Soriot said production was ""basically two months behind where we wanted to be"". Italy was among the countries threatening to sue over the delays.  448mEU population 8.4mPeople received vaccine so far (1.9%) 2.3bnDoses ordered overall 400mDoses ordered from AstraZeneca (Not yet EMA approved) - 17% of total The AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to give it the green light on Friday. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. Officials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year. The EU has also ordered 2.3 billion doses of vaccines from four other companies, of which only those of Pfizer/BioNTech (600 million) and Moderna (160 million) have been approved. This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race Pfizer has not been able to supply the 12.5 million vaccines it promised the EU by the end of 2020, saying last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. As a result of delays, on Wednesday Spanish officials said the Madrid region was halting almost all vaccinations for two weeks and supplies in Catalonia were also threatened. The EU has threatened to restrict the exports of vaccines made within the bloc to deal with the shortfall. Have you been affected by vaccine supply issues?

The Welsh Governmentâs chief medical officer has confirmed that more than 312,000 people in Wales have had their first dose of the vaccine. âThatâs a shade under 10% of our population,"" Dr Frank Atherton said at Wednesday's Welsh Government press conference. âThis is real progressâ. Dr Atherton added that the Welsh Government was on course for the âfirst milestoneâ of offering vaccines to the first four priority groups by mid-February. Wales' R rate of transmission is now below one, but ""we are not out of the woods"", according to the chief medical officer for Wales. Dr Frank Atherton said the country is âbeginning to see an overall improvementâ and that cases had been falling steadily since earlier this month. âThe seven-day case rate for Wales is currently around 200 cases per 100,000 people,"" he told today's press briefing. âThis is significantly lower than the very high rates of 650 cases per 100,000 people that we were seeing in the weeks before Christmas. âThe good news is that itâs falling in all parts of Wales. âWe believe the R number is below 1 â at between 0.7 and 0.9. âAll this tells us that transmission of the infection is slowing and the size of the current outbreak is shrinking."" The boss of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in Swansea has been accused by a senior MP of giving""misleading"" information about Covid-19 cases amongst workers. Giving evidence to the Commons Transport Committee, chief executive Julie Lennard said of 546 cases at its Swansea office since March, 535 were between September and December. Committee chairman Huw Merriman MP said the DVLA previously indicated cases were spread out over the who period since March. Ministers were urged to intervene after staff were said to be too scared to go to work. Mr Merriman said: ""If I had a grand total of 546 [cases], and 535 of those were from September, I wouldn't write a letter and point it to my attention that it was a cumulative number stretching back from March, when March to September is a grand total of 11. ""I found it rather misleading."" Ms Lennard apologised if it was misleading and said in the haste to get information together ahead of the meeting ""things could have been clearer"". An outbreak had been declared in December, but the DVLA insisted safety was a priority and that it followed guidance to ""help keep our offices Covid secure"". Around 6,000 people work at the DVLA's 16-storey HQ in Swansea Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton and Chief Scientific Adviser for Health Dr Rob Orford are about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. You can watch proceedings live on BBC One Wales,on the BBC iPlayer, onS4C, or via the Coronavirus Update video link above. Wrexham has the highest rolling seven-day case rate in Wales with 503.1 people per 100,000 population testing positive. That is followed by neighbouring Flintshire with 384.4 and Denbighshire with 263.3. Ceredigion has the lowest case rate at 86.7 per 100,000 people, followed by Conwy with 127.1. The Wales average is 204 per 100,000. On Wednesday, a further 49 deaths in Wales of people with coronavirus were reported by Public Heath Wales. Of those, there were 11 in both the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area and Cardiff and Vale. Ten were in Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales and nine were in Aneurin Bevan in south east Wales. Swansea Bay reported six, Hywel Dda in west Wales reported three, and one death was from a resident outside of Wales. A total of 312,305 people have now received a Covid vaccination in Wales, Public Health Wales said. It is an increase of 22,749 on yesterday's running total. Of these, 639 people have now received their second dose. This means 9.9 per cent of the total population of Wales have been vaccinated. It comes as the Welsh Government blamed bad weather fornot reaching their targetof 70% of all over-80s getting the vaccine by last weekend. A further 49 people have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales. This takes the official death total in the pandemic to 4,610. There were 537 new reports of the virus today, taking the number of cases to 189,689. Nearly 2.4 million tests have now been carried out in Wales. Â© 2025 BBC.

We are going to be wrapping up the live page for this evening soon. Let's have a recap of some of the key dates and figures announced today. A WHO team is in Wuhan to investigate the origins of Covid-19 The United States wants a ârobust and
clearâ international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus in China,
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki says. She told reporters that the âmisinformationâ
from some sources in China was âof great concern to usâ and added that âit's
imperative that we get to the bottom of the early days of the pandemicâ. The Biden administration also intends
to return to having âstaff on the ground in Beijingâ, from scientists and policy experts,
she said, noting that this was something that âfell back in the last
administrationâ. President Trump frequently referred to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"", directly blaming China for the outbreak. Beijing has said it believes the virus originated outside of the country. A World Health Organization team is currently in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to begin investigating the origins of the virus.  This video can not be played Californiaâs Governor Newsom eases Covid restrictions - why now? Cases are beginning to fall in California, but death rates remain the same in the US state. Governor Gavin Newsom has lifted restrictions, meaning Californians can now eat in outdoor restaurants and beauty salons have opened. But some accuse authorities of playing politics. We know... who could imagine, right? But in March 2020, as the UK, parts of the US and elsewhere, went into their first lockdown, millions of people suddenly had a lot more time alone at home, with the internet as their friend. On social media others seemed to be having the times of their lives playing with their dogs, posting adorable photos and recording cute animal-themed TikToks. The message: a furry friend would make lockdown a lot less lonely. People who had been putting off getting a dog because of a lack of time at home suddenly had a glut of it. They saw lockdown as the perfect opportunity to finally raise a puppy. Now, almost a year later, animal shelters are starting to see older puppies with behavioural issues being handed in by frustrated owners, and pet sales websites are filling up with listings for puppies being resold. Read how some around the world have been getting on with their pandemic puppies here. Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check A man making false and misleading statements about Covid-19 tried to remove a sick coronavirus patient from East Surrey Hospital, and is wanted by police. The man filmed himself arguing with doctors in the ward, demanding to be allowed to take the patient home. Doctors at the hospital are seen in the video warning against such an action - stating that the patient would die if he left their care. It follows atrend of people filming supposedly ""empty hospitals""and then posting them online and encouraging others to do the same, spread on social media platforms. In a statement, Michael Wilson, chief executive of Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: ""Any suggestion that Covid-19 doesn't exist or isn't serious is not only extremely disrespectful to the NHS staff caring for patients affected by the virus, but it also puts the lives of others at risk."" The video has been shared thousands of times on social media. The man behind the camera makes a number of discredited claims that are very popular in Covid-19 conspiracy communities online. What are they - and what's the truth behind them? Eva Gicain with her daughter Elleana and husband Limuel A nurse who gave birth nearly three months ago while seriously ill with Covid-19 has held her daughter for the first time. Eva Gicain, 30, had the long-awaited reunion with her baby after being discharged from theRoyal Papworth Hospital,externalin Cambridge earlier this month. Baby Elleana had to be delivered about a month early by C-section, but Mrs Gicain has no memory of her birth. ""When I held Elleana for the first time I didn't want to let go,"" she said. Her husband Limuel, 30, who also had Covid-19, was unable to visit her and had to wait three weeks to see Elleana, who was in a special care baby unit. Limuel had to register the birth alone and needed to know how his wife wanted to spell their daughter's name - but he could not contact her. Find out how he did ithere. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Yvonne Richmond Tulloch says timely support may help prevent future problems Bereavement support charities are calling for more funding in light of what they call the ""terrible toll of 100,000 deaths from Covid-19"". They say many families have been unable to be with loved ones as they died or gather to support one another. They argue there has been ""huge demand"" for counselling and guidance but some providers lack sufficient resources. The government says it is committed to ensuring those who are grieving have access to the support they need. Read more from Hugh here. Earlier, the home secretary set out how the new UK border measures will work. These are to ensure ""only a small number of people for whom it is absolutely essential to travel are doing so"", she says. This video can not be played Priti Patel sets out new UK border measures Norwayâs borders are to be closed to all but essential visitors, prime minister Erna Solberg has announced. She said that while exceptions will
apply to a few groups, such as health workers: âIn practise, the border will be
closed to anyone not living in Norway.â The measures will be reviewed in two
weeks, she said. Norway announced a lockdown of the
region around its capital Oslo on Saturday after an outbreak of a more
contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK. Production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has resumed at a plant after it was suspended when a suspicious package was received. The Wockhardt UK plant on Wrexham Industrial Estate in North Wales was evacuated and the Army sent a bomb disposal unit. Police say the package was made safe and its contents ""taken away for analysis"". Wockhardt says staff had been allowed to return and its production schedule had not been affected. Both Downing Street and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford had been receiving updates on the incident since police were calledat about 10:40 GMT. This video can not be played Prof Jonathan Van-Tam on Covid and schools One of the big headlines today has been that most children, who are not at school, will not go back until at least 8 March. At the Downing Street press conference, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam was asked about the vaccine and children returning to school. Here he sets out, and answers, some of the key questions around children and the virus. Here are some of the latest stories about the coronavirus from around the world: TheEU has urged AstraZeneca to supply it with Covid-19 vaccines from UK plantsas production issues at European plants have delayed  supply of the
first batch of at least 300 million requested doses. The issue has raised tensions between the firm and
the EU bloc. French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi says it will start mass
production later this year of the vaccine developed by its rivals
Pfizer/BioNTech in a bid to help the EU meet its vaccination targets. An 11-year-old Colombian boy says he has receiveddeath threats after calling for better access to educationduring the pandemic. Francisco
Vera is a known campaigner on the environment and childrenâs rights. Peru has announced a two-week lockdown covering a third of the
country until mid-February following a spike in infections. Iceland has begun issuing digital vaccination certificates to residents who have had two doses. The certificates are designed make it easier for people to travel but are not recognised in Europe. Japanâs prime minister has apologised after several of his
ministers visited nightclubs despite his government urging the public to avoid unnecessary
outings Earlier today, a further 1,725 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK - the second highest daily figure since the pandemic began. It comes a day after the UK surpassed 100,000 deaths by this measure. Below we look in more detail at the UK's coronavirus numbers. Dominic Yeatman from the Metro asks whether the prime minister agrees with a figure given by the head of AstraZeneca in which he apparently said the number of people vaccinated in the UK could be 28 to 30 million by the end of February. Boris Johnson says he can't confirm the numbers but is ""confident"" of the UK's vaccine supply and pleased the UK has the ""fastest roll out in Europe"". Mr Yeatman also asks whether the Covid public health advice should be changed after a study found people affected with the new variant are less likely to lose their sense of smell and taste. Jonathan Van-Tam says health advice is under ""regular review"" but the cough and fever symptoms are still ""extremely important"". Adam Vaughan at the New Scientist asks for more information on the vaccine's impact on transmission or if there are any cases of people who have been vaccinated being hospitalised with coronavirus. Patrick Vallance says data from Israel on the effect of the vaccines on covid transmission ""is preliminary"". ""We've got to be extremely cautious and wait until we've got proper data,"" he says. ""You shouldn't expect to see nobody getting ill who has been vaccinated, vaccines are not 100% effective...we will still see people who get the disease, we will still see people who get severe disease, but it'll be much, much reduced with the vaccine."" Jonathan Vam-Tam says: ""I know everyone is straining to get information but we can't get it any faster than we can get it."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asked about transmission rates in people given the vaccine Tom Newton Dunn from Times Radio asks what we know so far about the rate at which people who have had the vaccine can transmit coronavirus. Jonathan Van Tam says there is no clear data on how the vaccine impacts transmission of coronavirus but there are studies working on finding out and we will have that information in time. He said the question is less ""will they"" and more ""to what extent"" do they stop transmission. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""you don't have vaccines of this efficacy without there being some effect on transmission"". He says it's an important question as ""it will also determine to what extent these vaccines can be used across wider society to reduce transmission overall"". Newton Dunn asks how the prime minister came to the date of 8 March to reopen schools and whether it would have been ""wiser to wait until you were sure"". The prime minister says the date depends on the vaccines working in reducing mortality and serious disease.... and we need to make sure the infection rate is in the right place. ""We will keep it all under constant review,"" he says. The prime minister repeats that he takes ""full responsibility"" for the government's handling of the crisis. But the ""brutal and difficult dilemmas"" faced mean there are no ""good answers"", he adds. He is asked about the row between AstraZeneca and the European Union over vaccine supplies - the bloc has asked the company to supply it with more doses from UK plants. Boris Johnson says he is ""very confident"" that jabs for use in the UK will continue to get through. He adds that the creation of vaccines, and their distribution, is a ""great multinational effort"". Jonathan Van-Tam says ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children In Downing Street, the prime minister is asked a question by Henry, who's in Cornwall. Henry says many clinically vulnerable children have been shielding since the first lockdown and have been unable to return to school at all during that time - even when schools were back for a while. He asks the briefing when children may be able to receive the Covid vaccine. Jonathan Van-Tam says the current advice is that children who are extremely at risk can have a discussion with their physician and parents about the benefits of vaccination in children under 16. However, this would be using the vaccine in an ""off-licence way"" so it needs to be a ""carefully discussed, individual decision"" - but it is possible to go down that route. He adds that ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children - but believes ""that will come in time"". This video can not be played Covid-19: 'AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments' An update now from the latest twist in the row over the AstraZeneca vaccine supply to the EU. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has called upon AstraZeneca to ""deliver on its commitments"" to supply vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic. Tensions have risen after the pharmaceutical company said its rollout of at least 300 million doses in Europe had been hit with delays and supply problems. Ms Kyriakides said vaccine suppliers have a ""moral, societal and contractual responsibility which they need to uphold"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Police say the package was made safe and its contents ""taken away for analysis"". Wockhardt says staff had been allowed to return and its production schedule had not been affected. Both Downing Street and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford had been receiving updates on the incident since police were calledat about 10:40 GMT. This video can not be played Prof Jonathan Van-Tam on Covid and schools One of the big headlines today has been that most children, who are not at school, will not go back until at least 8 March. At the Downing Street press conference, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam was asked about the vaccine and children returning to school. Here he sets out, and answers, some of the key questions around children and the virus. Here are some of the latest stories about the coronavirus from around the world: TheEU has urged AstraZeneca to supply it with Covid-19 vaccines from UK plantsas production issues at European plants have delayed  supply of the
first batch of at least 300 million requested doses. The issue has raised tensions between the firm and
the EU bloc. French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi says it will start mass
production later this year of the vaccine developed by its rivals
Pfizer/BioNTech in a bid to help the EU meet its vaccination targets. An 11-year-old Colombian boy says he has receiveddeath threats after calling for better access to educationduring the pandemic. Francisco
Vera is a known campaigner on the environment and childrenâs rights. Peru has announced a two-week lockdown covering a third of the
country until mid-February following a spike in infections. Iceland has begun issuing digital vaccination certificates to residents who have had two doses. The certificates are designed make it easier for people to travel but are not recognised in Europe. Japanâs prime minister has apologised after several of his
ministers visited nightclubs despite his government urging the public to avoid unnecessary
outings Earlier today, a further 1,725 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK - the second highest daily figure since the pandemic began. It comes a day after the UK surpassed 100,000 deaths by this measure. Below we look in more detail at the UK's coronavirus numbers. Dominic Yeatman from the Metro asks whether the prime minister agrees with a figure given by the head of AstraZeneca in which he apparently said the number of people vaccinated in the UK could be 28 to 30 million by the end of February. Boris Johnson says he can't confirm the numbers but is ""confident"" of the UK's vaccine supply and pleased the UK has the ""fastest roll out in Europe"". Mr Yeatman also asks whether the Covid public health advice should be changed after a study found people affected with the new variant are less likely to lose their sense of smell and taste. Jonathan Van-Tam says health advice is under ""regular review"" but the cough and fever symptoms are still ""extremely important"". Adam Vaughan at the New Scientist asks for more information on the vaccine's impact on transmission or if there are any cases of people who have been vaccinated being hospitalised with coronavirus. Patrick Vallance says data from Israel on the effect of the vaccines on covid transmission ""is preliminary"". ""We've got to be extremely cautious and wait until we've got proper data,"" he says. ""You shouldn't expect to see nobody getting ill who has been vaccinated, vaccines are not 100% effective...we will still see people who get the disease, we will still see people who get severe disease, but it'll be much, much reduced with the vaccine."" Jonathan Vam-Tam says: ""I know everyone is straining to get information but we can't get it any faster than we can get it."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asked about transmission rates in people given the vaccine Tom Newton Dunn from Times Radio asks what we know so far about the rate at which people who have had the vaccine can transmit coronavirus. Jonathan Van Tam says there is no clear data on how the vaccine impacts transmission of coronavirus but there are studies working on finding out and we will have that information in time. He said the question is less ""will they"" and more ""to what extent"" do they stop transmission. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""you don't have vaccines of this efficacy without there being some effect on transmission"". He says it's an important question as ""it will also determine to what extent these vaccines can be used across wider society to reduce transmission overall"". Newton Dunn asks how the prime minister came to the date of 8 March to reopen schools and whether it would have been ""wiser to wait until you were sure"". The prime minister says the date depends on the vaccines working in reducing mortality and serious disease.... and we need to make sure the infection rate is in the right place. ""We will keep it all under constant review,"" he says. The prime minister repeats that he takes ""full responsibility"" for the government's handling of the crisis. But the ""brutal and difficult dilemmas"" faced mean there are no ""good answers"", he adds. He is asked about the row between AstraZeneca and the European Union over vaccine supplies - the bloc has asked the company to supply it with more doses from UK plants. Boris Johnson says he is ""very confident"" that jabs for use in the UK will continue to get through. He adds that the creation of vaccines, and their distribution, is a ""great multinational effort"". Jonathan Van-Tam says ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children In Downing Street, the prime minister is asked a question by Henry, who's in Cornwall. Henry says many clinically vulnerable children have been shielding since the first lockdown and have been unable to return to school at all during that time - even when schools were back for a while. He asks the briefing when children may be able to receive the Covid vaccine. Jonathan Van-Tam says the current advice is that children who are extremely at risk can have a discussion with their physician and parents about the benefits of vaccination in children under 16. However, this would be using the vaccine in an ""off-licence way"" so it needs to be a ""carefully discussed, individual decision"" - but it is possible to go down that route. He adds that ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children - but believes ""that will come in time"". This video can not be played Covid-19: 'AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments' An update now from the latest twist in the row over the AstraZeneca vaccine supply to the EU. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has called upon AstraZeneca to ""deliver on its commitments"" to supply vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic. Tensions have risen after the pharmaceutical company said its rollout of at least 300 million doses in Europe had been hit with delays and supply problems. Ms Kyriakides said vaccine suppliers have a ""moral, societal and contractual responsibility which they need to uphold"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Already 100,000 people in the UK have died with Covid, according to the official count. The idea of 100,000 deaths is hard for many of us to comprehend. But each was a human being who lived and loved in their own unique way. This is the story of one of them. By 3:01am, alone in a hospital room, Ann Fitzgerald reached for her phone. This would be her last chance to contact her husband of four decades, the man she'd raised two children with, her Tony - to Ann, he was always her Tony. The couple had made a pact. So long as Ann was in hospital with Covid, Tony would spend his nights dozing upright in a chair at their bungalow in Pewfall, Merseyside. That way, he would wake up if there was a message alert. It wasn't much of a sacrifice, Tony thought, not when the woman he'd loved for 47 years was all by herself and frightened. And besides, each time his phone bleeped Tony would know she was still alive, and silently he'd thank the stars. And so in the early hours of Tuesday 7 April, Ann's last message arrived. She'd summoned the energy to take a farewell selfie as she lay in bed wearing an oxygen mask. ""She must have thought: 'Here's something so you won't forget me,'"" says Tony. Two-and-a-half hours later, Ann was dead. She was 65, a mother, a wife, a neighbour, a colleague and a friend, and one of999 people,externalin the UK who died that day with the novel coronavirus. Soon after the hospital rang and told Tony of her death, he was at her bedside, dressed from head to toe in PPE. No visitors had been allowed to see her while she was alive, but now she was gone it was apparently fine - for reasons he didn't understand. Tony wept as he apologised to his wife's lifeless body for letting her go like this, with no loved ones by her side. Then he turned and cursed the sterile white hospital ceiling and walls, because they'd been with her at the end and he hadn't. Back then, few could have imagined the UK's death toll would reach 100,000, or anything close to it. At that point, the tally stood at 10,000; three weeks previously the UK government's Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance had said limiting the final figure to twice that sum would be a ""good outcome"". Now, 10 months on, the total number of people in the UK who have died within 28 days of a coronavirus diagnosis has increased tenfold, while UK excess deaths in 2020 were at theirhighest levelsince World War Two. The UK has had one of the highest rates of recorded coronavirus deaths in the world so far. By any measure, 100,000 is a devastating amount, roughly equivalent to two Premier League football grounds, or the number of people who attend the Reading festival every year. For many people, the sheer scale of loss conveyed by the figure will be impossible to grasp. Why is the UK's death toll so bad? Your tributes to those who have died 'Something really precious has been taken away from me' ""Numbers with lots of zeros are very difficult to interpret, and can be made to look large or small,"" says Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge. ""If I say that 100,000 deaths is two months' worth of normal mortality, then it may not look so bad.  If I say that it is more than all the [UK] civilian deaths in WW2, or as if everyone in a city the size of Durham got killed, then it sounds worse.  It is challenging to adequately convey such a large number of individual tragedies."" But while many may have become numb to the daily death figures, behind every statistic is a real life lost - a real life like Ann's. ""That is why this arbitrary numerical milestone is important,"" says Hetan Shah, chief executive of the British Academy and a former executive director of the Royal Statistical Society. ""It is a chance to reflect again on the terrible toll this pandemic has taken on so many British families."" In a Manchester nightclub one evening in 1973, 18-year-old Tony felt a tap on his arm. It was Ann, a year his senior, whom he knew by sight as a barmaid in one of the city-centre pubs he sometimes drank in. She'd always stood out to him, with her olive skin and striking good looks, but he'd never dared imagine she might be interested in him romantically. ""I'm here with that fella over there,"" she told him, gesturing towards across the room. ""But I don't like him and I don't know what to do."" Tony walked over to Ann's date and told him to clear off. Then Tony returned to Ann, and the two of them had a drink together, and then another. Before long they were a couple and Tony decided he was the luckiest man in the world. Soon he learned all about Ann's background. Her Lithuanian-born Jewish father had died when she was two years old, and with her mother unable to cope she'd been passed between relatives throughout her childhood. By 16 she was living in a bedsit, supporting herself with waitressing and bar work - she'd also been employed at the legendary art-deco Kardoma cafÃ© on Market Street and at George Best's nightclub, Oscar's. ""As a consequence of her upbringing she was really, really independent,"" says Tony. ""She was really good at talking to people, and she was sharp - the sharpest, wittiest person I've ever met."" They rented a flat in Fallowfield together and made it their home. After Ann was offered relief work running bars around Manchester, Tony quit his job as a sales rep to join her. Eventually, in 1981, they took on their own pub. It was in what was then a tough part of Salford, but Ann had grown up nearby and knew how to handle the local characters: ""She could have you in stitches, but she could throw you a look, and you knew you had to behave yourself,"" Tony says. The couple were offered the chance to take on another pub in Sale Moor. They thought they were going upmarket, but it turned out to be quite the reverse; Tony would joke that he should take away all the tables and chairs and install a boxing ring instead. But Ann wasn't intimidated by anyone. According to Tony, when a notorious local villain turned up and demanded a free drink, Ann stood her ground: ""My husband's name is above the front door, and he pays for his drinks, so you're going to pay for yours,"" she told him. Impressed, the villain ended up buying one for Ann instead. She and Tony knew it was time to quit when burglars broke in one night while their baby daughter slept in her cot upstairs. Tony went back on the road as a salesman; Ann worked variously as a debt counsellor, an incident manager for the RAC, and a sales trainer at a cotton firm. Their children, Gary, and Rachel, never once heard them argue, Tony says. For six years the couple had a stall at Altrincham Market selling women's clothes. ""People would come, not necessarily to buy something - they just wanted to see Ann,"" says Tony. ""And as a consequence, they'd buy something they didn't really want."" Each time this happened, Ann would give Tony a wink. By the start of 2020, Ann and Tony were looking forward to a long retirement together. Both their children had left home, and they'd recently moved to the bungalow. The news broadcasts had begun describing a deadly pandemic that had spread from China. But Ann wasn't leaving the house much while she recovered from an operation to replace both hips. Then one Thursday in March she went for a haircut; she asked for the colour to be darkened slightly too, and when he first saw her afterwards Tony told her how much he loved it. Ann mentioned that the hairdresser had been coughing. Three days later, Ann began coughing too, and soon afterwards so did Tony. But with a fever, she felt worse, and within a few more days she was barely able to stand. She asked Tony to call 999. The paramedics helped her to the ambulance. It haunts Tony now that he didn't hug or kiss her as they said goodbye. ""Neither of us thought for one moment that it would be the last day I would ever see her alive,"" he says. She told him they'd probably give her antibiotics and he could come and pick her up in a few hours. But later that day she phoned him to say the doctors suspected Covid and they would be keeping her in. As in many hospitals during the first wave, no visiting was allowed. Tony could only stay in touch with her by phone. When a doctor told him the next 24 hours were critical, he didn't tell Ann, because he knew how scared she was already by then. But he did pass on something else the medic had said - that they were deeply impressed by her upbeat attitude and fighting spirit. Tony told her, too, that he believed she would be home soon: ""I had to say that to keep her fighting, and fight she did for 10 days."" The last time they spoke was Saturday 4 April. Ann told Tony she thought she'd turned a corner; she'd eaten a sandwich and some yoghurt. After that, talking became too difficult for her; she wasn't in intensive care but the mask she wore to help her breathe was getting in the way. Three days after their last conversation, Tony was sitting in a white hospital room beside Ann's body. He sat with her there for an hour. He didn't just apologise, he also promised he'd make sure she was remembered properly. When it was time to leave, a nurse gave him a booklet about bereavement and a black bag in which to put Ann's belongings. Tony carried them along a hospital corridor, wondering how he would tell Gary and Rachel their mum was dead. There are eight photographs of Ann in Tony's living room. In each of them she looks full of joy. ""Every time I look around, there's a picture of Ann somewhere,"" Tony says. ""She's smiling and I'm thinking, 'If only I could turn back the clock.' But I can't, you know, and nor can all those other families and relations, either."" Nearly 10 months after Ann's death, Tony finds himself resenting the home he's been left alone inside. If they hadn't moved there, he reasons, Ann wouldn't have gone to that hairdresser's that day and caught the virus - she'd still be alive, perhaps. He feels robbed of the 20 additional years he hoped they'd spend together, as surely will thousands of other bereaved relatives. While the impact on the very oldest has been widely recognised, those who might have looked forward to a long retirement have been badly hit, too - during the pandemic, around 15% of all UK fatalities with Covid mentioned on the death certificate have been among those aged 65-74. Tony desperately wishes his life would go back to how it was, but knows it won't. Ann's funeral didn't give him any closure. Tony would rather she had been buried, but the undertaker warned him to hurry - extra restrictions could be introduced any time - so he took the date that was offered by the crematorium. As it was, under the rules that were already in force, only 10 mourners were permitted, spaced out around the chapel. No flowers or photographs on display, no hugging. Tony understood why all this was necessary - but it wasn't the celebration of Ann's bright, gregarious, love-filled life that he thought she deserved. He'd have to plan another one when all this was over. As the months went on, Tony joined online Covid support groups. It helped talking to others who understood how it felt to have lost someone. There was the family of a 19-year-old boy. A woman who was mourning both her mum and her dad. Another woman whose husband had died in the car as she drove him to hospital. He thought of these stories each time he switched on the news and watched the Covid mortality figures climb higher and higher. Behind these cold statistics were human lives. And each was as unique as Ann, with a personality and backstory entirely of their own. It would have been Ann and Tony's 41st wedding anniversary on 6 October, the day before the six-month anniversary of her death. The following month, a few days after the UK's Covid death toll reached 50,000, Tony once again felt Ann's absence bitterly on what would have been her 66th birthday. ""Christmas was a nightmare for me,"" he says. Under the rules for the festive season, Gary and Rachel and their partners were able to be there with him, and cooking lunch kept him busy most of the day. But afterwards, when he was on his own again, the reality hit that another celebration had gone by without Ann beside him, and Tony sat down and sobbed. For millions the arrival of the Covid vaccines has brought hope, but it is a cold comfort for those who have lost someone. If every one of the 100,000 were loved by a dozen people, ""that's a million people in Britain who have been bereaved"", says the bioethicist and sociologist Prof Sir Tom Shakespeare. ""We need a national monument, some form of remembering."" Tony is not one of those who will find it hard to grasp the significance of this bleak milestone. ""To me it's 100,000 poor souls fighting for breath, and they've not had a hug from anyone in their family,"" he says. ""There's a name - there's a person behind that number. And then they've passed away, and the family goes through the grief that I've been through - the numbness, the shock, the anguish and the pain to come.""

"The head of AstraZeneca has defended its rollout of the coronavirus vaccine in the EU, amid tension with member states over delays in supply. Pascal Soriottold Italian newspaper La Repubblica,externalthat his team was working ""24/7 to fix the very many issues of production of the vaccine"". He said production was ""basically two months behind where we wanted to be"". He also said the EU's late decision to sign contracts had given limited time to sort out hiccups with supply. Mr Soriot, chief executive of the UK-Swedish multinational, said a contract with the UK had been signed three months before the one with the EU, giving more time for glitches to be ironed out. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Cases, deaths and vaccinations by country He told La Repubblica that problems in ""scaling up"" vaccine production were being experienced at two plants, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium. ""It's complicated, especially in the early phase where you have to really sort out all sorts of issues,"" he said. ""We believe we've sorted out those issues, but we are basically two months behind where we wanted to be."" He added: ""We've also had teething issues like this in the UK supply chain. But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So with the UK we have had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said a vaccine targeting the South African variant was being worked on ""Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume. We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small."" Mr Soriot also said AstraZeneca was working on a vaccine with Oxford University that would target the South African variant of the coronavirus. Scientists have warned there is a chancethe South African variant may harm the effectiveness of current vaccines. The AstraZeneca vaccine is already being used in the UK but has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to give it the green light at the end of this month. The bloc signed a deal in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. The EU has ordered 600 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is already being used on patients around the bloc. But Pfizer-BioNTech said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian plant. In response to the delays, the EU has said it might restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc. This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said companies making Covid vaccines in the bloc would have to ""provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries"". She said the 27-member EU bloc would ""take any action required to protect its citizens"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, addressing the virtual version of the annual World Economic Forum (WEF), usually held in Davos, said:  ""Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines.

Tony went back on the road as a salesman; Ann worked variously as a debt counsellor, an incident manager for the RAC, and a sales trainer at a cotton firm. Their children, Gary, and Rachel, never once heard them argue, Tony says. For six years the couple had a stall at Altrincham Market selling women's clothes. ""People would come, not necessarily to buy something - they just wanted to see Ann,"" says Tony. ""And as a consequence, they'd buy something they didn't really want."" Each time this happened, Ann would give Tony a wink. By the start of 2020, Ann and Tony were looking forward to a long retirement together. Both their children had left home, and they'd recently moved to the bungalow. The news broadcasts had begun describing a deadly pandemic that had spread from China. But Ann wasn't leaving the house much while she recovered from an operation to replace both hips. Then one Thursday in March she went for a haircut; she asked for the colour to be darkened slightly too, and when he first saw her afterwards Tony told her how much he loved it. Ann mentioned that the hairdresser had been coughing. Three days later, Ann began coughing too, and soon afterwards so did Tony. But with a fever, she felt worse, and within a few more days she was barely able to stand. She asked Tony to call 999. The paramedics helped her to the ambulance. It haunts Tony now that he didn't hug or kiss her as they said goodbye. ""Neither of us thought for one moment that it would be the last day I would ever see her alive,"" he says. She told him they'd probably give her antibiotics and he could come and pick her up in a few hours. But later that day she phoned him to say the doctors suspected Covid and they would be keeping her in. As in many hospitals during the first wave, no visiting was allowed. Tony could only stay in touch with her by phone. When a doctor told him the next 24 hours were critical, he didn't tell Ann, because he knew how scared she was already by then. But he did pass on something else the medic had said - that they were deeply impressed by her upbeat attitude and fighting spirit. Tony told her, too, that he believed she would be home soon: ""I had to say that to keep her fighting, and fight she did for 10 days."" The last time they spoke was Saturday 4 April. Ann told Tony she thought she'd turned a corner; she'd eaten a sandwich and some yoghurt. After that, talking became too difficult for her; she wasn't in intensive care but the mask she wore to help her breathe was getting in the way. Three days after their last conversation, Tony was sitting in a white hospital room beside Ann's body. He sat with her there for an hour. He didn't just apologise, he also promised he'd make sure she was remembered properly. When it was time to leave, a nurse gave him a booklet about bereavement and a black bag in which to put Ann's belongings. Tony carried them along a hospital corridor, wondering how he would tell Gary and Rachel their mum was dead. There are eight photographs of Ann in Tony's living room. In each of them she looks full of joy. ""Every time I look around, there's a picture of Ann somewhere,"" Tony says. ""She's smiling and I'm thinking, 'If only I could turn back the clock.' But I can't, you know, and nor can all those other families and relations, either."" Nearly 10 months after Ann's death, Tony finds himself resenting the home he's been left alone inside. If they hadn't moved there, he reasons, Ann wouldn't have gone to that hairdresser's that day and caught the virus - she'd still be alive, perhaps. He feels robbed of the 20 additional years he hoped they'd spend together, as surely will thousands of other bereaved relatives. While the impact on the very oldest has been widely recognised, those who might have looked forward to a long retirement have been badly hit, too - during the pandemic, around 15% of all UK fatalities with Covid mentioned on the death certificate have been among those aged 65-74. Tony desperately wishes his life would go back to how it was, but knows it won't. Ann's funeral didn't give him any closure. Tony would rather she had been buried, but the undertaker warned him to hurry - extra restrictions could be introduced any time - so he took the date that was offered by the crematorium. As it was, under the rules that were already in force, only 10 mourners were permitted, spaced out around the chapel. No flowers or photographs on display, no hugging. Tony understood why all this was necessary - but it wasn't the celebration of Ann's bright, gregarious, love-filled life that he thought she deserved. He'd have to plan another one when all this was over. As the months went on, Tony joined online Covid support groups. It helped talking to others who understood how it felt to have lost someone. There was the family of a 19-year-old boy. A woman who was mourning both her mum and her dad. Another woman whose husband had died in the car as she drove him to hospital. He thought of these stories each time he switched on the news and watched the Covid mortality figures climb higher and higher. Behind these cold statistics were human lives. And each was as unique as Ann, with a personality and backstory entirely of their own. It would have been Ann and Tony's 41st wedding anniversary on 6 October, the day before the six-month anniversary of her death. The following month, a few days after the UK's Covid death toll reached 50,000, Tony once again felt Ann's absence bitterly on what would have been her 66th birthday. ""Christmas was a nightmare for me,"" he says. Under the rules for the festive season, Gary and Rachel and their partners were able to be there with him, and cooking lunch kept him busy most of the day. But afterwards, when he was on his own again, the reality hit that another celebration had gone by without Ann beside him, and Tony sat down and sobbed. For millions the arrival of the Covid vaccines has brought hope, but it is a cold comfort for those who have lost someone. If every one of the 100,000 were loved by a dozen people, ""that's a million people in Britain who have been bereaved"", says the bioethicist and sociologist Prof Sir Tom Shakespeare. ""We need a national monument, some form of remembering."" Tony is not one of those who will find it hard to grasp the significance of this bleak milestone. ""To me it's 100,000 poor souls fighting for breath, and they've not had a hug from anyone in their family,"" he says. ""There's a name - there's a person behind that number. And then they've passed away, and the family goes through the grief that I've been through - the numbness, the shock, the anguish and the pain to come.""

"The government will set out a ""roadmap"" for reopening schools, the economy and society on 22 February, the PM says Boris Johnson also tells a Downing Street briefing that 8 March is the earliest date schools could reopen It will take weeks for case numbers to come down to ""really low levels"", says UK's chief scientific adviser A further 1,725 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, making 101,887 deaths with the virus in the UK Travellers to the UK from countries where there are concerns about new virus variants will go into hotel quarantine, the government said earlier But Wales and Scotland say the quarantine plans don't go far enough At PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked why the UK has the highest number of deaths in Europe The EU urges AstraZeneca to supply it with more doses of its Covid vaccine from UK plants, amid a row over shortages Edited by Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald Thank you for joining us for our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by Alex Therrien, Cherry Wilson, Claire Heald, Ella Wills, Georgina Rannard, Jennifer Meierhans, Jennifer Scott, Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Penny Spiller and Sarah Collerton. We are going to be wrapping up the live page for this evening soon. Let's have a recap of some of the key dates and figures announced today. A WHO team is in Wuhan to investigate the origins of Covid-19 The United States wants a ârobust and
clearâ international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus in China,
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki says. She told reporters that the âmisinformationâ
from some sources in China was âof great concern to usâ and added that âit's
imperative that we get to the bottom of the early days of the pandemicâ. The Biden administration also intends
to return to having âstaff on the ground in Beijingâ, from scientists and policy experts,
she said, noting that this was something that âfell back in the last
administrationâ. President Trump frequently referred to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"", directly blaming China for the outbreak. Beijing has said it believes the virus originated outside of the country. A World Health Organization team is currently in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to begin investigating the origins of the virus.  This video can not be played Californiaâs Governor Newsom eases Covid restrictions - why now? Cases are beginning to fall in California, but death rates remain the same in the US state. Governor Gavin Newsom has lifted restrictions, meaning Californians can now eat in outdoor restaurants and beauty salons have opened. But some accuse authorities of playing politics. We know... who could imagine, right? But in March 2020, as the UK, parts of the US and elsewhere, went into their first lockdown, millions of people suddenly had a lot more time alone at home, with the internet as their friend. On social media others seemed to be having the times of their lives playing with their dogs, posting adorable photos and recording cute animal-themed TikToks. The message: a furry friend would make lockdown a lot less lonely. People who had been putting off getting a dog because of a lack of time at home suddenly had a glut of it. They saw lockdown as the perfect opportunity to finally raise a puppy. Now, almost a year later, animal shelters are starting to see older puppies with behavioural issues being handed in by frustrated owners, and pet sales websites are filling up with listings for puppies being resold. Read how some around the world have been getting on with their pandemic puppies here. Christopher GilesBBC Reality Check A man making false and misleading statements about Covid-19 tried to remove a sick coronavirus patient from East Surrey Hospital, and is wanted by police. The man filmed himself arguing with doctors in the ward, demanding to be allowed to take the patient home. Doctors at the hospital are seen in the video warning against such an action - stating that the patient would die if he left their care. It follows atrend of people filming supposedly ""empty hospitals""and then posting them online and encouraging others to do the same, spread on social media platforms. In a statement, Michael Wilson, chief executive of Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: ""Any suggestion that Covid-19 doesn't exist or isn't serious is not only extremely disrespectful to the NHS staff caring for patients affected by the virus, but it also puts the lives of others at risk."" The video has been shared thousands of times on social media. The man behind the camera makes a number of discredited claims that are very popular in Covid-19 conspiracy communities online. What are they - and what's the truth behind them? Eva Gicain with her daughter Elleana and husband Limuel A nurse who gave birth nearly three months ago while seriously ill with Covid-19 has held her daughter for the first time. Eva Gicain, 30, had the long-awaited reunion with her baby after being discharged from theRoyal Papworth Hospital,externalin Cambridge earlier this month. Baby Elleana had to be delivered about a month early by C-section, but Mrs Gicain has no memory of her birth. ""When I held Elleana for the first time I didn't want to let go,"" she said. Her husband Limuel, 30, who also had Covid-19, was unable to visit her and had to wait three weeks to see Elleana, who was in a special care baby unit. Limuel had to register the birth alone and needed to know how his wife wanted to spell their daughter's name - but he could not contact her. Find out how he did ithere.

Earlier, the home secretary set out how the new UK border measures will work. These are to ensure ""only a small number of people for whom it is absolutely essential to travel are doing so"", she says. This video can not be played Priti Patel sets out new UK border measures Norwayâs borders are to be closed to all but essential visitors, prime minister Erna Solberg has announced. She said that while exceptions will
apply to a few groups, such as health workers: âIn practise, the border will be
closed to anyone not living in Norway.â The measures will be reviewed in two
weeks, she said. Norway announced a lockdown of the
region around its capital Oslo on Saturday after an outbreak of a more
contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK. Production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has resumed at a plant after it was suspended when a suspicious package was received. The Wockhardt UK plant on Wrexham Industrial Estate in North Wales was evacuated and the Army sent a bomb disposal unit. Police say the package was made safe and its contents ""taken away for analysis"". Wockhardt says staff had been allowed to return and its production schedule had not been affected. Both Downing Street and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford had been receiving updates on the incident since police were calledat about 10:40 GMT. This video can not be played Prof Jonathan Van-Tam on Covid and schools One of the big headlines today has been that most children, who are not at school, will not go back until at least 8 March. At the Downing Street press conference, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam was asked about the vaccine and children returning to school. Here he sets out, and answers, some of the key questions around children and the virus. Here are some of the latest stories about the coronavirus from around the world: TheEU has urged AstraZeneca to supply it with Covid-19 vaccines from UK plantsas production issues at European plants have delayed  supply of the
first batch of at least 300 million requested doses. The issue has raised tensions between the firm and
the EU bloc. French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi says it will start mass
production later this year of the vaccine developed by its rivals
Pfizer/BioNTech in a bid to help the EU meet its vaccination targets. An 11-year-old Colombian boy says he has receiveddeath threats after calling for better access to educationduring the pandemic. Francisco
Vera is a known campaigner on the environment and childrenâs rights. Peru has announced a two-week lockdown covering a third of the
country until mid-February following a spike in infections. Iceland has begun issuing digital vaccination certificates to residents who have had two doses. The certificates are designed make it easier for people to travel but are not recognised in Europe. Japanâs prime minister has apologised after several of his
ministers visited nightclubs despite his government urging the public to avoid unnecessary
outings Earlier today, a further 1,725 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK - the second highest daily figure since the pandemic began. It comes a day after the UK surpassed 100,000 deaths by this measure. Below we look in more detail at the UK's coronavirus numbers. Dominic Yeatman from the Metro asks whether the prime minister agrees with a figure given by the head of AstraZeneca in which he apparently said the number of people vaccinated in the UK could be 28 to 30 million by the end of February. Boris Johnson says he can't confirm the numbers but is ""confident"" of the UK's vaccine supply and pleased the UK has the ""fastest roll out in Europe"". Mr Yeatman also asks whether the Covid public health advice should be changed after a study found people affected with the new variant are less likely to lose their sense of smell and taste. Jonathan Van-Tam says health advice is under ""regular review"" but the cough and fever symptoms are still ""extremely important"". Adam Vaughan at the New Scientist asks for more information on the vaccine's impact on transmission or if there are any cases of people who have been vaccinated being hospitalised with coronavirus. Patrick Vallance says data from Israel on the effect of the vaccines on covid transmission ""is preliminary"". ""We've got to be extremely cautious and wait until we've got proper data,"" he says. ""You shouldn't expect to see nobody getting ill who has been vaccinated, vaccines are not 100% effective...we will still see people who get the disease, we will still see people who get severe disease, but it'll be much, much reduced with the vaccine."" Jonathan Vam-Tam says: ""I know everyone is straining to get information but we can't get it any faster than we can get it."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asked about transmission rates in people given the vaccine Tom Newton Dunn from Times Radio asks what we know so far about the rate at which people who have had the vaccine can transmit coronavirus. Jonathan Van Tam says there is no clear data on how the vaccine impacts transmission of coronavirus but there are studies working on finding out and we will have that information in time. He said the question is less ""will they"" and more ""to what extent"" do they stop transmission. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""you don't have vaccines of this efficacy without there being some effect on transmission"". He says it's an important question as ""it will also determine to what extent these vaccines can be used across wider society to reduce transmission overall"". Newton Dunn asks how the prime minister came to the date of 8 March to reopen schools and whether it would have been ""wiser to wait until you were sure"". The prime minister says the date depends on the vaccines working in reducing mortality and serious disease.... and we need to make sure the infection rate is in the right place. ""We will keep it all under constant review,"" he says. The prime minister repeats that he takes ""full responsibility"" for the government's handling of the crisis. But the ""brutal and difficult dilemmas"" faced mean there are no ""good answers"", he adds. He is asked about the row between AstraZeneca and the European Union over vaccine supplies - the bloc has asked the company to supply it with more doses from UK plants. Boris Johnson says he is ""very confident"" that jabs for use in the UK will continue to get through. He adds that the creation of vaccines, and their distribution, is a ""great multinational effort"". Jonathan Van-Tam says ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children In Downing Street, the prime minister is asked a question by Henry, who's in Cornwall. Henry says many clinically vulnerable children have been shielding since the first lockdown and have been unable to return to school at all during that time - even when schools were back for a while. He asks the briefing when children may be able to receive the Covid vaccine. Jonathan Van-Tam says the current advice is that children who are extremely at risk can have a discussion with their physician and parents about the benefits of vaccination in children under 16. However, this would be using the vaccine in an ""off-licence way"" so it needs to be a ""carefully discussed, individual decision"" - but it is possible to go down that route. He adds that ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children - but believes ""that will come in time"". This video can not be played Covid-19: 'AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments' An update now from the latest twist in the row over the AstraZeneca vaccine supply to the EU. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has called upon AstraZeneca to ""deliver on its commitments"" to supply vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic. Tensions have risen after the pharmaceutical company said its rollout of at least 300 million doses in Europe had been hit with delays and supply problems. Ms Kyriakides said vaccine suppliers have a ""moral, societal and contractual responsibility which they need to uphold"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Labour is calling for juries to be cut from 12 members to seven, to stem the ""gravest crisis"" in the justice system since World War Two. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said action was needed to clear the backlog of thousands of cases. He argued that smaller juries and the use of more temporary courts would allow socially distanced trials. The government has not ruled out such a move but insists measures it is taking to clear the backlog are working. Last weekfour criminal justice watchdogswarned that courts in England and Wales were straining under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic. Close courts or face strikes, union warns 'Trials may collapse' as Covid delays continue Locations of 10 temporary courts revealed Jury trials ground to a halt at the start of the first lockdown, when people were advised to stay at home except in limited circumstances. When they resumed, there were severe delays and numerous cancellations due to social-distancing requirements. Recent figures revealed that the number of unheard cases in crown courts had reached a record 54,000. The backlog means some from last year may not go before a jury until 2022, and it could be years before the courts get back on track. Labour wants the temporary return of so-called ""wartime juries"" of seven rather than 12 members to speed up the process. ""Victims of rape, murder, domestic abuse, robbery and assault are facing delays of up to four years because of the government's failure to act,"" Mr Lammy said. He also urged the government to speed up the rollout of temporary ""Nightingale courts"" to hear civil, family and tribunals work, as well as non-custodial crime cases. Ten of thesewere announced in July 2020 to help deal with the backlog in court proceedings, and 20 arenow in operation across,externalEngland and Wales. Leading lawyers are sceptical about Labour's proposal to reach back into wartime history. The Criminal Bar Association - representing barristers who prosecute and defend trials - says a panel of seven may allow more courtrooms to be used, but it wouldn't solve what it says is chronic underfunding - and potentially undermines one of the most important safeguards in our society. The Law Society, for solicitors, wants to see evidence that smaller panels would ease backlogs without risking injustices. The Ministry of Justice's internal modelling calculated last year that reduced juries would lead to a 10% increase in cases - but that was before courtrooms received new Covid-proof screens that have allowed more trials to run. Scotland's courts are using cinemas to host juries - and while that is not being actively discussed in England, it's not been ruled out either. Even if juries were slimmed, courts would still need to tightly control the number of defendants who can use their cells and courtroom docks to meet Public Health England's guidelines. In April last year, the head of judiciary in England and Wales, Lord Burnett,backed the idea of reducing the number of jurorsif social distancing continued. In June, Justice Secretary Robert Bucklandtold the BBC he was ""very attracted""by the idea of smaller juries, as had happened in wartime, and judge-only trials in less serious cases. The Ministry of Justice says it has now installed plastic screens in more than 450 courtrooms and jury deliberation rooms to reduce Covid risks. It says the safety measures are designed for 12-person juries and that the impact of lowering the number of jurors would be negligible. However, a spokesman said nothing was being ruled out and ministers were continuing to consider every option available to ensure courts recover quickly. ""This approach is already delivering results, with magistrates' backlogs falling significantly and the number of cases being dealt with in the crown courts reaching pre-Covid levels last month,"" he added. The spokesman also said: ""We know more must be done and are investing Â£110m into a range of measures to drive this recovery further, including opening more Nightingale courts.""

contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK. Production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has resumed at a plant after it was suspended when a suspicious package was received. The Wockhardt UK plant on Wrexham Industrial Estate in North Wales was evacuated and the Army sent a bomb disposal unit. Police say the package was made safe and its contents ""taken away for analysis"". Wockhardt says staff had been allowed to return and its production schedule had not been affected. Both Downing Street and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford had been receiving updates on the incident since police were calledat about 10:40 GMT. This video can not be played Prof Jonathan Van-Tam on Covid and schools One of the big headlines today has been that most children, who are not at school, will not go back until at least 8 March. At the Downing Street press conference, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam was asked about the vaccine and children returning to school. Here he sets out, and answers, some of the key questions around children and the virus. Here are some of the latest stories about the coronavirus from around the world: TheEU has urged AstraZeneca to supply it with Covid-19 vaccines from UK plantsas production issues at European plants have delayed  supply of the
first batch of at least 300 million requested doses. The issue has raised tensions between the firm and
the EU bloc. French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi says it will start mass
production later this year of the vaccine developed by its rivals
Pfizer/BioNTech in a bid to help the EU meet its vaccination targets. An 11-year-old Colombian boy says he has receiveddeath threats after calling for better access to educationduring the pandemic. Francisco
Vera is a known campaigner on the environment and childrenâs rights. Peru has announced a two-week lockdown covering a third of the
country until mid-February following a spike in infections. Iceland has begun issuing digital vaccination certificates to residents who have had two doses. The certificates are designed make it easier for people to travel but are not recognised in Europe. Japanâs prime minister has apologised after several of his
ministers visited nightclubs despite his government urging the public to avoid unnecessary
outings Earlier today, a further 1,725 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK - the second highest daily figure since the pandemic began. It comes a day after the UK surpassed 100,000 deaths by this measure. Below we look in more detail at the UK's coronavirus numbers. Dominic Yeatman from the Metro asks whether the prime minister agrees with a figure given by the head of AstraZeneca in which he apparently said the number of people vaccinated in the UK could be 28 to 30 million by the end of February. Boris Johnson says he can't confirm the numbers but is ""confident"" of the UK's vaccine supply and pleased the UK has the ""fastest roll out in Europe"". Mr Yeatman also asks whether the Covid public health advice should be changed after a study found people affected with the new variant are less likely to lose their sense of smell and taste. Jonathan Van-Tam says health advice is under ""regular review"" but the cough and fever symptoms are still ""extremely important"". Adam Vaughan at the New Scientist asks for more information on the vaccine's impact on transmission or if there are any cases of people who have been vaccinated being hospitalised with coronavirus. Patrick Vallance says data from Israel on the effect of the vaccines on covid transmission ""is preliminary"". ""We've got to be extremely cautious and wait until we've got proper data,"" he says. ""You shouldn't expect to see nobody getting ill who has been vaccinated, vaccines are not 100% effective...we will still see people who get the disease, we will still see people who get severe disease, but it'll be much, much reduced with the vaccine."" Jonathan Vam-Tam says: ""I know everyone is straining to get information but we can't get it any faster than we can get it."" Times Radio's Tom Newton-Dunn asked about transmission rates in people given the vaccine Tom Newton Dunn from Times Radio asks what we know so far about the rate at which people who have had the vaccine can transmit coronavirus. Jonathan Van Tam says there is no clear data on how the vaccine impacts transmission of coronavirus but there are studies working on finding out and we will have that information in time. He said the question is less ""will they"" and more ""to what extent"" do they stop transmission. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""you don't have vaccines of this efficacy without there being some effect on transmission"". He says it's an important question as ""it will also determine to what extent these vaccines can be used across wider society to reduce transmission overall"". Newton Dunn asks how the prime minister came to the date of 8 March to reopen schools and whether it would have been ""wiser to wait until you were sure"". The prime minister says the date depends on the vaccines working in reducing mortality and serious disease.... and we need to make sure the infection rate is in the right place. ""We will keep it all under constant review,"" he says. The prime minister repeats that he takes ""full responsibility"" for the government's handling of the crisis. But the ""brutal and difficult dilemmas"" faced mean there are no ""good answers"", he adds. He is asked about the row between AstraZeneca and the European Union over vaccine supplies - the bloc has asked the company to supply it with more doses from UK plants. Boris Johnson says he is ""very confident"" that jabs for use in the UK will continue to get through. He adds that the creation of vaccines, and their distribution, is a ""great multinational effort"". Jonathan Van-Tam says ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children In Downing Street, the prime minister is asked a question by Henry, who's in Cornwall. Henry says many clinically vulnerable children have been shielding since the first lockdown and have been unable to return to school at all during that time - even when schools were back for a while. He asks the briefing when children may be able to receive the Covid vaccine. Jonathan Van-Tam says the current advice is that children who are extremely at risk can have a discussion with their physician and parents about the benefits of vaccination in children under 16. However, this would be using the vaccine in an ""off-licence way"" so it needs to be a ""carefully discussed, individual decision"" - but it is possible to go down that route. He adds that ""we are some way off"" getting clinical trial data for vaccines authorised for use in children - but believes ""that will come in time"". This video can not be played Covid-19: 'AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments' An update now from the latest twist in the row over the AstraZeneca vaccine supply to the EU. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has called upon AstraZeneca to ""deliver on its commitments"" to supply vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic. Tensions have risen after the pharmaceutical company said its rollout of at least 300 million doses in Europe had been hit with delays and supply problems. Ms Kyriakides said vaccine suppliers have a ""moral, societal and contractual responsibility which they need to uphold"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has defended the inclusion of ransomware payments in first-party cyber-insurance policies. It said insurance was ""not an alternative"" to doing everything possible to first minimise the risk. However, it added that firms could face financial ruin without the cover. Prof Ciaran Martin, former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, said the UK needed to rethink its policies on ransomware. Ransomware is a form of malware in which infected computers are remotely locked by cyber-criminals, who then demand a ransom, often in the form of Bitcoin, to unlock them and return the data they hold. There are many examples of businesses and public bodies which have chosen to pay because they do not have the data backed up, or cannot afford - or do not have time - to rebuild their systems from scratch. The Guardian reported that Prof Martin, now at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government, said he believed insurers were ""funding organised crime"" by accepting ransomware claims, but he told the BBC the issue of how to tackle ransomware was far broader than just the insurance sector. While official advice is not to pay the demand, it is not illegal to do so in the UK, he said. ""I have some sympathy with insurers, because as long as it's legal, there are incentives to pay."" While the ransom demand may be high, the alternative impact can also be devastating. When the global aluminium producer Norsk Hydro was attacked in 2019,it cost the firm around Â£45m, and its profits in the immediate aftermath plummeted by 82%,reported Reuters,external. Norsk Hydro refused to pay the demand, which would arguably have been cheaper - but it did have insurance. A spokesman for the ABI said insurers do require that ""reasonable precautions"" are taken to prevent cyber-attacks from succeeding in the first place, just as cars and houses require security measures in place to deter thieves. ""Some might argue that any insurance that covers against a criminal act could lull the policyholder into a false sense of security,"" he said. Prof Martin said he did not think that banning ransomware insurance claims would necessarily solve the problem. ""But it's worth a serious piece of consultation because if we continue as we are, things will get worse,"" he said.

"""A legacy of poor decisions"" by the UK before and during the pandemic led to one of the worst death rates in the world, scientists have said. Labour also criticised ""monumental mistakes"" by the prime minister in delaying acting on scientific advice over lockdowns three times. After UK deaths passed 100,000, Boris Johnson said he took ""full responsibility"" for the actions taken. But he said it was too soon to learn the lessons from the pandemic response. Prof Linda Bauld, public health expert from the University of Edinburgh, said the UK's current position was ""a legacy of poor decisions that were taken when we eased restrictions"". She told the BBC the lack of focus on test and trace and the ""absolute inability to recognise"" the need to address international travel had also led to a more deadly winter surge. Prof Sir Michael Marmot, who carried out a review of inequalities in Covid-19 deaths, said the UK had entered the pandemic ""in a bad state"" with rising health inequality, a slowdown in life expectancy improvements and a lack of investment in the public sector. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth rejected Mr Johnson's claim that he had done ""everything we could"" to minimise the death toll, adding: ""I do not accept that."" Why is the UK's death toll so bad?

The government also failed to create a working contact-tracing system, did not introduce effective health controls at the borders and still did not offer ""proper sick pay"", he said. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""I mourn every death in this pandemic and we share the grief of all those who have been bereaved. I and the government take full responsibility for all the actions we have taken to fight this pandemic."" He said there would be time to reflect on the decisions taken, but he did not think the right time was in the middle of the pandemic when ""37,000 people are struggling with Covid in our hospitals"". The government needed to focus on keeping the virus under control and continuing the fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe, he said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces UK deaths from Covid-19 have passed 100,000 He said his message to grieving families was that he ""deeply, personally"" regretted the loss of life and that the best way to honour the memory of those who had died and honour those who were currently grieving was ""to work together to bring this virus down, to keep it under control in the way that we are"". Asked about the government's ""legacy of poor decisions"", Mr Johnson said ministers followed scientific advice and did everything they could to minimise suffering. He said there were ""no easy solutions"" but the UK could be proud of its efforts to distribute the vaccine. After leading a minute's silence in the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""truly sorry"" for any mistakes, as Scotland recorded a total of 5,888 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. She said the government did everything it could, but added: ""I don't think any of us, reflecting on numbers like these, can conclude that we have always succeeded."" Next month, the prime minister hopes topublish a document giving details of the criteria he will use to start lifting the lockdown, a senior government source told the BBC. It will include factors such as the number of hospitalisations and deaths, the progress of the vaccination programme, any changes to the virus and the impact easing restrictions might have on the epidemic - but will be dependent on emerging data about how effectively the vaccine stops the virus spreading. The UK is the fifth country to pass 100,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. A scientist advising the government has warned the UK could face as many as 50,000 more coronavirus deaths. Prof Calum Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the BBC's Newsnight: ""It would really not surprise me if we're looking at another 40-50,000 deaths before this burns out. ""The deaths on the way up are likely to be mirrored by the number of deaths on the way down in this wave. Each one again is a tragedy and each one represents probably four or five people who survive but are damaged by Covid."" He said the UK had experienced some ""bad luck"" with the emergence of a new, more transmissible variant but had also suffered from ""decades of underinvestment"" in the NHS and ""a public health authority that's been eroded"" . Meanwhile, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell asked people, regardless of whether they had faith, to reflect on the ""enormity"" of the pandemic and join in a ""prayer for the nation"" at 18:00 GMT every day from 1 February. They said the death statistics were were not ""just an abstract figure"", saying: ""Each number is a person: someone we loved and someone who loved us."" Muslim leaders backed the call for a daily prayer. Qari Asim, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said Muslims and wider black, Asian and minority ethnic communities had been disproportionately affected by the ""tsunami of pain, grief and devastation"" - with many unable to properly mourn due to Covid restrictions. On Tuesday, a further 1,631 coronavirus deaths were recorded, taking the total number of people who had died within 28 days of a positive test to 100,162. Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics, which are based on death certificates,show there have been nearly 104,000 deaths since the pandemic began. A further 20,089 coronavirus cases were recorded on Tuesday, continuing a downward trend in the number of UK cases seen in recent days. The number of people in hospital remains high, as do the UK's daily death figures.

"Goldman Sachs' chief executive David Solomon will get a $10m (Â£7.3m) pay cut for the bank's involvement in the 1MDB corruption scandal. 1MDB was an investment fund set up by the Malaysian government that lost billions due to fraudulent activity. The global web of fraud and corruption led to a 12-year jail term for Malaysia's ex-prime minister Najib Razak which he is appealing. Goldman Sachs called its involvement in the scandal an ""institutional failure"". 1MDB scandal: The playboys, PMs and partygoers Malaysia ex-PM given 12-year term for corruption US targets Monet and Warhol artworks in 1MDB case Goldman Sachs helped raise $6.5bn for 1MDB by selling bonds to investors, the proceeds of which were largely stolen. Prosecutors alleged that senior Goldman executives ignored warning signs of fraud in their dealings with 1MDB and Jho Low, an adviser to the fund. Two Goldman bankers have been criminally charged in the scandal. Mr Solomon's pay would have been $10m higher but for the actions its board of directors took in response to the 1MDB saga, Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday. While disclosing his salary had dropped to $17.5m for 2020, the bank stressed that Mr Solomon was unaware of the corruption. He was not ""involved in or aware of the firm's participation in any illicit activity at the time...âthe board views the 1MDB matter as an institutional failure, inconsistent with the high expectations it has for the firm"". Mr Solomon's package consists of $2m in cash base pay, a $4.65m cash bonus, and $10.85m in stock-based compensation. In October,Goldman agreed to pay nearly $3bn to government officials in four countriesto end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB. The bank collected $600m for arranging the bond sales in  2012 and 2013. It has spent years being investigated by regulators across the globe including those in the US, UK, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.In total, Goldman's dealings with 1MDB cost the bank more than $5bn. Despite the costs and fines from the fallout from the 1MDB scandal, 2020 was a bumper year for Goldman's businesses with annual revenue of $44.6bn, its highest since 2009. The US-based bank got a huge boost from the recovery in global stock markets from the depths of the coronavirus recession.

By law, NRW has to produce an assessment of the country's natural resources every five years including everything from clean air and water to soil, rocks, minerals and habitats for wildlife. Fears over curlew population decline Wales a haven for wildlife - but for how long? Flood assurances sought 'before another travesty' Welsh rivers farm pollution 'embarrassing' Its latest report makes for ""bleak reading"", according to Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe. Due to the pandemic it is being published in a phased way - with key headlines and recommendations now. There will be more detail about the state of each of Wales' ecosystems from our coastline and seas, to rivers, woods and farmland, in March. Very few of the habitats wildlife rely on in Wales are in good condition - even in areas where there is meant to be more protection, the report says. Take rivers for example - more than 60% of all river Special Areas of Conservation were found to be failing targets around phosphate pollution - which can be washed in from farmland or sewers. Just 31% of the country is considered to be semi-natural habitat - and at least 40% of this is spread out in such small patches it is not seen as ""resilient"" enough. Could floating turbines power our homes? More than half River Wye 'fails pollution targets' Salmon population 'at risk' over warm waters Wildlife needs these areas to be joined up if it is to thrive - but this connectivity is also being lost. It means several iconic species such as the curlew are at risk of extinction from the Welsh countryside within the next 20 years. The situation is also threatening people's lives with poor air quality estimated to cause up to 2,000 deaths annually in Wales, 6% of the total number. And 245,000 Welsh properties are at risk of flooding - a problem likely to get worse as a result of climate change. The report concludes not one of four long-term aims NRW set in 2016 to measure progress towards achieving sustainable management of natural resources has been met. But it said this was not surprising in just a few years, and the problems were not unique to Wales. Wales needs to ""trial ideas, launch experiments and support innovation"", and urgently transform three key areas of the economy, the report says. They are the food, energy and transport systems. It wants to see a lot of work done to encourage lifestyle changes - from what we eat to how we travel. If everyone on Earth used natural resources at the same rate as Wales, two and a half planets would be needed, it claims. Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously said offshore wind could power every UK home by 2030 It said the pandemic provided a ""once in a generation opportunity to reset our values and prioritiesâ¦ and create a more sustainable future"". More technology in agriculture should be used to help cut fertiliser use, prevent pollution and limit the amount of land needed for farming, the report says. It also suggests there would be a ""positive impact"" from society reducing its consumption of carbon-intensive foods such as meat and dairy. Dr Hefin Williams, of the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences at Aberystwyth University, said this was ""at its heart a decision for individuals"" and livestock production was ""the backbone of agriculture in Wales"". While the report outlined the challenges faced by the sector, he said it also highlighted opportunities that the industry here was ""well-placed"" to grasp. ""Increasing use of crops such as white and red clover, peas and other legumes would ultimately allow farmers to have greater control over feed costs [for their animals], cut down on imports and provide environmental benefits by reducing the amount of synthetic fertilisers needed,"" he said. Wales needs to rely less on fossil fuels, the report says Wales must move away quickly from energy generation that relies on fossil fuels with more renewable energy developments, according to the report. But it cautions that these, too, can contribute to pressures on the environment if not enough consideration is given to planning and building. Jess Hooper, of Marine Energy Wales, said Wales could ""lead the world"" in this emerging field. ""At the moment we have 16 marine renewable developers that are active in the sector, helping deliver a low carbon economy with its own jobs, skills and prospects - an industry we can call home grown and that we could export to the world,"" she said. The report also calls for a major focus on efficiency measures in buildings, saying Wales has some of the oldest and least thermally efficient housing stock in Europe. Wales has high rates of car use for commuting Wales also has high rates of car use for commuting and has seen only a small reduction in carbon emissions from transport since 1990, the report says. But simply moving everyone over to using electric vehicles is ""not a sustainable solution"". ""A systemic change is needed to how and why people travel and what is transported,"" it says. It promotes the concept of a 20-minute neighbourhood - pioneered by Melbourne in Australia - where urban society is designed so residents can meet virtually all their needs a short walk from home. Ms Howe said this was ""not just about carbon emission targets - these solutions have wider benefits"". ""We have an obesity crisis so the last thing we want is people sitting in their cars."" Welcoming the report, Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths said it provided a ""comprehensive set of evidence on the state and trends of Wales' natural resources and ecosystems"". ""As we continue to face the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, we in Welsh Government have repeatedly committed ourselves to an environmentally-responsible response to the pandemic, and this is our opportunity to focus on a green recovery during this challenging time"". She also said it offered an opportunity to discuss ""the part we all have to play in improving the resilience of our ecosystems, so we can ensure they support the wellbeing of generations to come"".

"""A legacy of poor decisions"" by the UK before and during the pandemic led to one of the worst death rates in the world, scientists have said. Labour also criticised ""monumental mistakes"" by the prime minister in delaying acting on scientific advice over lockdowns three times. After UK deaths passed 100,000, Boris Johnson said he took ""full responsibility"" for the actions taken. But he said it was too soon to learn the lessons from the pandemic response. Prof Linda Bauld, public health expert from the University of Edinburgh, said the UK's current position was ""a legacy of poor decisions that were taken when we eased restrictions"". She told the BBC the lack of focus on test and trace and the ""absolute inability to recognise"" the need to address international travel had also led to a more deadly winter surge. Prof Sir Michael Marmot, who carried out a review of inequalities in Covid-19 deaths, said the UK had entered the pandemic ""in a bad state"" with rising health inequality, a slowdown in life expectancy improvements and a lack of investment in the public sector. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth rejected Mr Johnson's claim that he had done ""everything we could"" to minimise the death toll, adding: ""I do not accept that."" Why is the UK's death toll so bad? Kuenssberg: Grim milestone in an abnormal year Coronavirus: Your tributes to those who have died 'Hard to compute sorrow' of 100,000 deaths - PM He said the prime minister had been given scientific advice to impose lockdowns and ""pushed that back"" - not only in March but again in September and December. The government also failed to create a working contact-tracing system, did not introduce effective health controls at the borders and still did not offer ""proper sick pay"", he said. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""I mourn every death in this pandemic and we share the grief of all those who have been bereaved. I and the government take full responsibility for all the actions we have taken to fight this pandemic."" He said there would be time to reflect on the decisions taken, but he did not think the right time was in the middle of the pandemic when ""37,000 people are struggling with Covid in our hospitals"". The government needed to focus on keeping the virus under control and continuing the fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe, he said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces UK deaths from Covid-19 have passed 100,000 He said his message to grieving families was that he ""deeply, personally"" regretted the loss of life and that the best way to honour the memory of those who had died and honour those who were currently grieving was ""to work together to bring this virus down, to keep it under control in the way that we are"". Asked about the government's ""legacy of poor decisions"", Mr Johnson said ministers followed scientific advice and did everything they could to minimise suffering. He said there were ""no easy solutions"" but the UK could be proud of its efforts to distribute the vaccine. After leading a minute's silence in the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""truly sorry"" for any mistakes, as Scotland recorded a total of 5,888 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. She said the government did everything it could, but added: ""I don't think any of us, reflecting on numbers like these, can conclude that we have always succeeded."" Next month, the prime minister hopes topublish a document giving details of the criteria he will use to start lifting the lockdown, a senior government source told the BBC. It will include factors such as the number of hospitalisations and deaths, the progress of the vaccination programme, any changes to the virus and the impact easing restrictions might have on the epidemic - but will be dependent on emerging data about how effectively the vaccine stops the virus spreading. The UK is the fifth country to pass 100,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. A scientist advising the government has warned the UK could face as many as 50,000 more coronavirus deaths. Prof Calum Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the BBC's Newsnight: ""It would really not surprise me if we're looking at another 40-50,000 deaths before this burns out. ""The deaths on the way up are likely to be mirrored by the number of deaths on the way down in this wave. Each one again is a tragedy and each one represents probably four or five people who survive but are damaged by Covid."" He said the UK had experienced some ""bad luck"" with the emergence of a new, more transmissible variant but had also suffered from ""decades of underinvestment"" in the NHS and ""a public health authority that's been eroded"" . Meanwhile, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell asked people, regardless of whether they had faith, to reflect on the ""enormity"" of the pandemic and join in a ""prayer for the nation"" at 18:00 GMT every day from 1 February. They said the death statistics were were not ""just an abstract figure"", saying: ""Each number is a person: someone we loved and someone who loved us."" Muslim leaders backed the call for a daily prayer. Qari Asim, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said Muslims and wider black, Asian and minority ethnic communities had been disproportionately affected by the ""tsunami of pain, grief and devastation"" - with many unable to properly mourn due to Covid restrictions. On Tuesday, a further 1,631 coronavirus deaths were recorded, taking the total number of people who had died within 28 days of a positive test to 100,162. Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics, which are based on death certificates,show there have been nearly 104,000 deaths since the pandemic began. A further 20,089 coronavirus cases were recorded on Tuesday, continuing a downward trend in the number of UK cases seen in recent days. The number of people in hospital remains high, as do the UK's daily death figures. Speaking alongside the prime minister, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty saidthe number of people dying would come down ""relatively slowly""over the next two weeks - and would probably ""remain flat for a while now"".

Elsewhere, bereavement support charities have written to the health secretary calling for more funding in the light of what they call ""the terrible toll of 100,000 deaths"". The National Bereavement Alliance, representing a range of charities, said many families had been unable to be with loved ones as they died or to support one another. They called for Â£500m allocated to mental health in England to be used to support the bereaved. Minister for bereavement Nadine Dorries said the government had given more than Â£10.2m to charities since March to ensure services were available to those who needed them.
